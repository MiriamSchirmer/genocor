         4     MR. PRESIDENT: 

         5                    We now have before us a motion filed by 

         6                    Defence for the Accused Rwamakuba. 

         7                    We shall consider that motion immediately.  

         8                    Of course we shall request the parties to 

         9                    the previous motion, which allows them to 

        10                    withdraw, so that we can now deal with the 

        11                    motion regarding Mr. Rwamakuba. 

        12                    

        13                    Can we invite the Prosecutor's team handling 

        14                    the Accused, Rwamakuba, together with the 

        15                    Accused -- sorry, Counsel for Mr. Rwamakuba 

        16                    to take their seats.

        17     

        18                    We now call this session to order. 

        19                    

        20                    Let me start by apologizing to Counsel for 

        21                    the Accused Rwamakuba and to the team of the 

        22                    Office of the Prosecutor for the delay in 

        23                    dealing with this matter. 

        24                    

        25                    You do understand the delay, it was because

         1                    we had a preliminary issue on which we 

         2                    needed to deliberate.  So let me apologize 

         3                    to the counsel for Defence and the 

         4                    representatives of the Prosecutor. 

         5                    

         6                    Also to apologize for keeping them here at 

         7                    the time when you should be out for lunch, 

         8                    but the Judges are also in the same 

         9                    situation. 

        10                    

        11                    So can I now ask Defence Counsel for Mr. 

        12                    Rwamakuba to appear?  That's part of the 

        13                    formality for the record.

        14     MR. HOOPER:

        15                    Mr. President, David Hooper for Dr. André 

        16                    Rwamakuba, who the Chamber will note, is 

        17                    present today.

        18     MR. PRESIDENT:

        19                    Thank you.

        23     MR. PRESIDENT:

        24                    Sorry that I didn't start with the ladies.

         1                    Mr. Hooper, I will be giving you the floor.  

         2                    I am aware that you would have needed a lot 

         3                    of time to submit your motion but, in view 

         4                    of the late hour and without, in any manner, 

         5                    trying to encroach on your rights, let me 

         6                    just tell you that we have received your 

         7                    written motion and the attached documents.  

         8                    We have understood their contents and as is 

         9                    customary in this Chamber we would give you 

        10                    the floor to expound, briefly, on your 

        11                    motion, unless, of course, you would want to 

        12                    take more time.  But let me add that we have 

        13                    indeed received your written motion and the 

        14                    attached documents and we thank you for that 

        15                    -- for those documents that you have 

        16                    compiled and made available to the Chamber.  

        17                    We have read and understood its contents.  

        18                    We just want you to make an oral submission, 

        19                    briefly, unless, of course, you think you 

        20                    will need more time.

        21     MR. HOOPER:

        22                    Thank you, Mr. President for that 

        23                    invitation. 

        24                    

        25                    My original estimate for the submission, for

         1                    the making of this submission was, I think, 

         2                    about one and a half to two hours and I 

         3                    would have thought that it would be nearer 

         4                    to one and a half hours and by the time I 

         5                    would have concluded I would have covered, 

         6                    in fact, most of the factual points and 

         7                    premises that would be advanced, in any 

         8                    event, by the Prosecution.

         9                    

        10                    Dr. Rwamakuba is here today and I feel that 

        11                    the Court, the Chamber, would be best 

        12                    assisted if, in fact, I don't take the short 

        13                    route, but take the somewhat longer route. 

        14                    In doing that, I appreciate that there are 

        15                    particular demands on this Chamber's time 

        16                    today and that there are important matters 

        17                    that members of this Chamber must attend to 

        18                    else where. 

        19                    

        20                    I don't know how the Chamber, itself, is 

        21                    disposed to continuing throughout, but if I 

        22                    could, perhaps, take about an hour of your 

        23                    time up and if there could then be a break, 

        24                    but perhaps would be at about -- I see the 

        25                    time now is almost 1:00; that would be

         1                    almost 2:00; I'd assume I would have 

         2                    completed my motion by 2:30.

         3     MR. PRESIDENT:

         4                    Mr. Hooper, let me be clear.  No commitment, 

         5                    whatsoever, on the part of the Judges would 

         6                    allow them to, as it were, violate the 

         7                    rights of the Defence. 

         8                    

         9                    Our duty is to be here, to listen to you.  I 

        10                    want to be clear, you know, so that tomorrow 

        11                    no one says, well, the Judges wanted to do 

        12                    this and they prevented us from being able 

        13                    to speak.  So you can take your time.  I 

        14                    want this to be clear.  You can go.

        15     MR. HOOPER:

        16                    Well, Mr. President, perhaps I can commence 

        17                    my argument.  And the basis of this motion 

        18                    is, of course, that the Chamber has a 

        19                    discretion to stop a case on the basis that 

        20                    to continue with the proceedings would be a 

        21                    manifest unfairness to the Defendant or its 

        22                    continuation would bring justice, itself, 

        23                    into disrepute. 

        24                    

        25                    Each case depends on its own facts.

         7                    On the 21st of October of 1998 Dr. Rwamakuba 

         8                    was arrested and transferred to the 

         9                    detention facility here the next day. 

        10                    

        11                    He made his initial appearance on the 10th 

        12                    of March.  That initial appearance was put 

        13                    over to the 7th of April. 

        14                    

        15                    In my motion I've wrongly stated that that 

        16                    was for a particular reason.  In fact the 

        17                    reason was, and Judge Sekule may very well 

        18                    have personal recollection of this, was that 

        19                    the indictment wasn't in its proper form 

        20                    and, therefore, the initial appearance was 

        21                    put over to the 7th of April. 

        22                    

        23                    Much of this morning's motion concerns the 

        24                    detention of this Defendant in Namibia 

        25                    between the 2nd of August of 1995 and

         1                    February of '96, a period of some five 

         2                    months. 

         3                    

         4                    During that time, in fact six months, during 

         5                    that time there was no charge where plainly 

         6                    the Court would be very concerned in any 

         7                    event of a period of detention without 

         8                    judicial relief or charge and the Defence 

         9                    say that that period of detention, in whole 

        10                    or in part, was at the behest of the 

        11                    Prosecution. 

        12                    

        13                    The Prosecution reject that.  They say that 

        14                    they -- they only heard of the Defendant's, 

        15                    the Accused's detention in Namibia on the 

        16                    21st of December, considered the matter and 

        17                    responded relatively promptly on the 18th of 

        18                    January. 

        19                    

        20                    There may be, as to that issue, Mr. 

        21                    President, no conclusive answer available to 

        22                    this Chamber today and I will, in fact, if 

        23                    the Chamber feels, first of all, that that 

        24                    is right, that there is no conclusive answer 

        25                    available, and if it feels that it's

         1                    relevant to do so and the Defence would 

         2                    submit that it would be, I will be inviting 

         3                    the Chamber to use its powers, under Article 

         4                    28, to request the State of Namibia to 

         5                    provide an authoritative answer to the very 

         6                    serious matters that are contained in this 

         7                    motion. 

         8                    

         9                    I can take you, Mr. President, to the abuse 

        10                    of process summary, which is at page 2.  The 

        11                    Chamber should have been provided, now, with 

        12                    copies of the decisions and I say decisions 

        13                    in Barayagwiza. 

        14                    

        15                    I very much suspect, if not believe, that 

        16                    each and every one of you are very familiar, 

        17                    in any event, with both those decisions, but 

        18                    there will be points, in the course of my 

        19                    motion, when I will be seeking to, I hope 

        20                    helpfully, remind you of some of the 

        21                    contents of those decisions. 

        22                    

        23                    But, really, the abuse, the basis of the 

        24                    abuse, in summary, in this case, is this:  

        25                    First of all, that Dr. Rwamakuba was

         1                    unlawfully detained in Namibia.  The length 

         2                    of that detention, the fact that he wasn't 

         3                    properly informed of charges, that he 

         4                    received no legal advice, and that he was 

         5                    not brought before a judicial authority, are 

         6                    all aspects of that illegality and that the 

         7                    Prosecution have a responsibility for that 

         8                    detention. 

         9                    

        10                    Secondly, there was a lack of diligence in 

        11                    prosecuting this case; that such was a lack 

        12                    of diligence was a breech of the 

        13                    Prosecutor's duty, that it was oppressive, 

        14                    led to uncertainly and was a denial of 

        15                    speedy trial and by its nature, in this 

        16                    particular case, was arbitrary. 

        17                    

        18                    And finally there was a delay in the Accused 

        19                    being brought before a Chamber by way of  

        20                    initial appearance and that was a breach of 

        21                    his rights and a serious breach of his 

        22                    rights. 

        23                    

        24                    At page 2 I refer to paragraphs 73, 74 and

         1                    don't ask you to turn those up now, because, 

         2                    Mr. President, as you have said, you have 

         3                    read that and doubtless resorted to seeing 

         4                    those paragraphs and, in any event, my 

         5                    submission will be assisted, my motion will 

         6                    be, I hope, be assisted by the clear 

         7                    reference to those particular paragraphs at 

         8                    page 2 of the extended argument, if I can 

         9                    put it like that. 

        10                    

        11                    As for remedy, if the Court does find that 

        12                    there have been breaches in any one of those 

        13                    three particular aspects, detained in 

        14                    Namibia, lack of diligence in prosecution or 

        15                    failure to promptly produce the Accused for 

        16                    initial appearance, then such a remedy, the 

        17                    Court may be assisted, is reviewed at 

        18                    paragraph 106 and 109 of the Barayagwiza 

        19                    decision.

        23                    the initial response in the Barayagwiza 

        24                    case; monetary compensation, which is the

         1                    Barayagwiza case; and discounted sentence. 

         2                    

         3                    In order, I hope, to best conduct the 

         4                    submission that I make to the Chamber, I'm 

         5                    going to start, in fact, with the third of 

         6                    the heads relating to abuse and that is the 

         7                    delay in initial appearance.  I do that 

         8                    because it's probably the most 

         9                    straightforward. 

        10                    

        11                    It seems to be, factually, the least 

        12                    contested and my argument is set out at page 

        13                    10 and 11 in the bundle produced to the 

        14                    Chamber yesterday. 

        15                    

        16                    That bundle is a composite of both the 

        17                    motion and argument and on page 10 you will 

        18                    see, at the top, Delay, and under that four 

        19                    and five extracted from the motion and

        21                    Facts" and there is, there again, an 

        22                    extraction in Roman numerals, VIII to X of 

        23                    the argument taken from the argument or from 

        24                    the brief.  And, indeed, the general setting

         1                    appreciated reading it, is that essentially 

         2                    where there are script in capital letters, 

         3                    that is in addition to what was stated in 

         4                    the argument and in the motion. 

         5                    

         6                    And so I'm not going to repeat it at length, 

         7                    you will be relieved to know, but it comes 

         8                    to this and this is, as I understand it, an 

         9                    undisputed fact in this case, that between 

        10                    the time, again returning to the chronology  

        11                    at page 1, between the time that the 

        12                    Defendant was transferred and detained in 

        13                    the detention facility here at Arusha -- and 

        14                    he arrived on the 22nd of October -- until 

        15                    the time that he was, in fact, produced for 

        16                    the first aborted initial appearance, but 

        17                    where he had the services of counsel for the 

        18                    first time, I wasn't able to be here and 

        19                    Steven Kay, in fact, stepped in on my 

        20                    behalf; that was on the 10th of March.  That 

        21                    is a period of 135 days. 

        22                    

        23                    The period to effective appearance, that is 

        24                    when the Prosecution eventually got their 

        25                    indictment in order, which was the 7th of

         4                    Accused had neither access to legal help, 

         5                    assistance, or advice of any kind, not even 

         6                    that of duty counsel, which is assigned 

         7                    otherwise in every case, but was not 

         8                    assigned to him.  And he remained, in fact, 

         9                    in that position without any legal advice or 

        10                    assistance until, in fact, I was appointed.  

        11                    And one sees again, from the chronology, 

        12                    that the relevant time in 1999, in respect 

        13                    to this, is the 24th of February when, as 

        14                    you can see, counsel appointed David Hooper 

        15                    and there was exceedingly limited contact, a 

        16                    short phone call, a fax sent and that was 

        17                    the full extent of all the advice he 

        18                    received up until the very morning when he 

        19                    briefly met with Mr. Kay, who was otherwise 

        20                    occupied on a case in this court, in this 

        21                    building, and, effectively, didn't have any 

        22                    legal advice until he was able to see me in 

        23                    the few days leading up to the initial 

        24                    appearance on the 7th of April.

         1                    Well, that delay was a plain breach of both 

         2                    the Articles and Rule 62.  That would seem 

         3                    to me to be a quite incontestable aspect of 

         4                    my submission. 

         5                    

         6                    In Barayagwiza, where a significantly 

         7                    shorter period of time was involved, it was 

         8                    stated, and I'll just read this one extract, 

         9                    which is there on page 10, in any event, 

        10                    based upon the plain meaning of the phrase 

        11                    "without delay" the Appeals Chamber finds 

        12                    that a 96 day delay to be a violation of his 

        13                    fundamental rights, as expressed by Articles 

        14                    19 and 20, internationally recognised human 

        15                    rights standards, and Rule 62.  Moreover, we 

        16                    find that the Appellant's right to be 

        17                    promptly indicted in that particular case, 

        18                    Rule 40bis, to have been violated." 

        19                    

        20                    And they repeat that.  This is a longer 

        21                    period of days, turning over to page 11, Mr. 

        22                    President, 135 days in plain breach of the 

        23                    Rules.  There are none of the circumstances 

        24                    of acquiescence such as were identified in 

        25                    the review of the Barayagwiza decision.

         1                    That was a significant part of the reasoning 

         2                    for the Appeals Chamber to change their 

         3                    mind, because not only did it concern, of 

         4                    course, a change of mind based on the 

         5                    conduct of the Prosecutor in trying to gain 

         6                    the assistance of the American Ambassador in 

         7                    the Cameroon in that case, but there was 

         8                    also, in fact, unconsidered by the original 

         9                    Appeal Chamber, an acquiescence in delay to 

        10                    the extent that it was, in fact, 

        11                    Barayagwiza's own counsel who was asking 

        12                    repeatedly for the case to be put out. 

        13                    

        14                    That is not the position in this case. 

        15                    

        16                    It is admitted, in the case of Dr. 

        17                    Rwamakuba, that the delay in his case of 135 

        18                    days plus is such a grave departure from the 

        19                    Rules and international standards, that it 

        20                    is, in itself, sufficient to deprive the 

        21                    Tribunal of jurisdiction over the Accused 

        22                    and to entitle him to immediate release.

        23                    

        24                    It's right to say that at paragraph 

        25                    71 the Appeal Chamber stated that "We find

         1                    these violations do not result in the 

         2                    Tribunal losing jurisdiction over the 

         3                    Appellant, those violations being the delay 

         4                    in initial appearance."

         5                    

         6                    The present case can be distinguished and  

         7                    distinguished in a sharper contrasting way 

         8                    because in this case, the case of Dr. 

         9                    Rwamakuba, the Accused was not provided with 

        10                    any legal assistance, at all.  And, as I've 

        11                    said earlier, this is in contrast to all the 

        12                    other Accused. 

        13                    

        14                    The Defence rely on the lengthy dissenting 

        15                    judgment in Barayagwiza by Judge 

        16                    Shahabuddeen. 

        17                    

        18                    The Defence adopt his cogent and carefully

        21                    He found that, in fact, it was only the 

        22                    delay in initial appearance that he viewed 

        23                    with such seriousness that he declared that 

        24                    in his minority judgment that the Accused in 

        25                    that case should be released was based only

         1                    on the ground of delay between the time 

         2                    which elapsed from the Appellant transfer to 

         3                    the detention unit of the Tribunal and the 

         4                    time of his initial appearance. 

         5                    

         6                    He added "The requirement of promptitude was 

         7                    fundamental and its breach was grave, 

         8                    extending to a little over three months.  

         9                    This one reminds the Court Chamber is a much 

        10                    longer period, and he added, "I agree that 

        11                    the administration of justice by the 

        12                    Tribunal would suffer from proceeding with 

        13                    the case, not withstanding the delay." 

        14                    

        15                    That is at page 2 of his judgment in 

        16                    relation to the first decision of the 

        17                    Appeals Chamber.

        22                    understands it, the minority decision may be 

        23                    less persuasive to some, obviously, than the 

        24                    majority decision, but the majority

         1                    jurisprudence of this Tribunal is not 

         2                    binding on you.  It is deeply persuasive, 

         3                    but not binding on you.

         7                    in this case because of the marked contrast 

         8                    in those extra length of time that André 

         9                    Rwamakuba was detained and I add again the 

        10                    bare fact that his violation of rights was 

        11                    that much greater because he had absolutely 

        12                    no access to legal advice, and that is a 

        13                    fundamental breach of the most basic 

        14                    international norms and international norms

        22                    accepted opinion of Judge Shahabuddeen,

         3                    Paragraph 26 and onwards is a cogent and 

         4                    forceful and, in my submission,--  -- deeply 

         5                    persuasive review and I invite the Chamber 

         6                    to look at it with obvious care, as I know 

         7                    that it will.  He reviews, of course, the 

         8                    Rules there.  He also reviews national and 

         9                    international considerations. 

        10                    

        11                    Interestingly enough, when he's looking at 

        12                    those, the time taken between detention and 

        13                    judicial overview is often no more than four 

        14                    or five or six days before criticism arises. 

        15                    

        16                    This, again, I remind the Chamber, is in 

        17                    fact, a detention without judicial overview 

        18                    lasting 135 days.

         2                    `unit to the Trial Chamber.  That scarcely 

         3                    intergalactic passage involved no more than 

         4                    a 15 minute drive by motor car on a 

         5                    macadamised road.  To plead the character of 

         6                    to the crimes in justification of the 

         7                    manifest breach of an applicable requirement 

         8                    which was both of overriding importance and 

         9                    capable of being respected with the same 

        10                    ease as in ordinary case, is to transform an 

        11                    important legal principle into a statement 

        12                    of affectionate aspiration."

        13                    

        14                    Those are strong words from a judge, I know, 

        15                    is highly respected amongst you, his fellow 

        16                    judges of these Tribunals. 

        17                    

        18                    And that is all, essentially, I wish to say 

        19                    and, Mr. President, you have, of course, as 

        20                    you have already acknowledged, read and 

        21                    seen, in fact, where most of that has been 

        22                    set out, I hope helpfully, and has allowed 

        23                    me, in fact, to take a shorter course this 

        24                    morning than otherwise one might.

         1                    So, can I turn then to the first of the 

         2                    heads of abuse of process?

         3                    

         4                    The Chamber has the discretion to stop a 

         5                    case where there has been abuse.  At page 3, 

         6                    under the heading "Constructive Custody in 

         7                    Namibia" the facts are set out from the 

         8                    argument and I briefly refer you to them 

         9                    because it is significant and if one loses 

        10                    sight of some of these facts, the general 

        11                    context is lost.  It's rather dificult to 

        12                    deal with it other than thoroughly, I regret 

        13                    to say.  But with all of that, I hope I will 

        14                    be suitably brief. 

        15                    

        16                    Dr. Rwamakuba features in the sad history of 

        17                    his country only from his appointment as 

        18                    Minister of Primary and Secondary Education 

        19                    in the interim government appointed in April 

        20                    of 1994. 

        21                    

        22                    He subsequently left Rwanda and settled in 

        23                    Namibia.  Referring to the chronology, you 

        24                    can see that's referred to as the 27th.  

        25                    He's anxious that I get things right and I

         1                    agree with him.  It was the 21st of July of 

         2                    1994 that he arrived first in Namibia. 

         3                    

         4                    He settled there with his family.  He 

         5                    obtained, eventually, employment as a 

         6                    practicing physician at the Gabobis 

         7                    (phonetic) Regional Hospital and worked 

         8                    there. 

         9                    

        10                    We know that he was eventually arrested and 

        11                    transferred on the confirmed indictment, 

        12                    confirmed by Judge Pillay at the end of 

        13                    August 1998. 

        14                    

        15                    He was transferred here in October. 

        16                    Just pausing there, the history that 

        17                    preceded that, as far as we know, was never 

        18                    referred to Judge Pillay.  As far as we 

        19                    know, she wasn't given a hint that he had 

        20                    ever, ever been detained, ever questioned, 

        21                    and the like. 

        22                    

        23                    The Accused had, in fact, been arrested and 

        24                    detained on a previous occasion.

         1                    From August the 2nd 1995, until February 7, 

         2                    1996 he was detained in Namibia. 

         3                    

         4                    At no time did he receive legal advice.  At 

         5                    no time was he produced to a court. 

         6                    

         7                    And that was a period of just over six 

         8                    months and the Defence contention is that 

         9                    the Accused was detained at that time, at 

        10                    the behest of this Tribunal through its 

        11                    organ, the Prosecutor.  The basis for this 

        12                    belief is that the Ministry of Home Affairs 

        13                    in Namibia has told the Defence that that 

        14                    was the case and the Ministry has referred 

        15                    to a list of names circulated by the United 

        16                    Nations Tribunal in 1995 with a specific 

        17                    request to detain persons on the said list. 

        18                    

        19                    Dr. Rwamakuba's name was on that list. 

        20                    And I quote from what I was told, and that 

        21                    the state of Namibia, one, was told, was 

        22                    under a legal obligation, as indeed it was, 

        23                    to comply with the United Nations Security 

        24                    Council Resolution 978 to detain and to 

        25                    assist in respect of suspected genocide

         1                    suspects.

         2                    

         3                    And may I take you to the relevant affidavit 

         4                    and deal with those now?

         5                    

         6                    The Defendant made two affidavits, and now I 

         7                    just remind you of the principal concepts. 

         8                    

         9                    The affidavit of Dr. Andre Rwamakuba appears 

        10                    at page 35.  It's dated the 3rd of June.  It 

        11                    relates his history.  He was detained, he 

        12                    says, and this is the evidence in this case 

        13                    so I must read it, "On the 2nd of August, 

        14                    1995 I'm detained at the central prison in 

        15                    Windhoek."  He was questioned on the 3rd of 

        16                    August by Mr. Apenge(phonetic); Inspector of 

        17                    Police, Mr. Ishmal Goaglased (phonetic), a 

        18                    director from Home Affairs, and also a Mr. 

        19                    Apisolon or Episolon (phonetic) also from 

        20                    Home Affairs.  "They had with them a list of 

        21                    names which they showed me.  They said that 

        22                    I'd been arrested because my name was on the 

        23                    list." 

        24                    

        25                    "They showed me my name.  They told me they

         1                    had received this list and that it contained 

         2                    names of people wanted for involvement with 

         3                    genocide." 

         4                    

         5                    "They told me they were detaining me in 

         6                    compliance with Namibia's obligation to 

         7                    comply with the United Nations resolutions."

         8                    So that is the essential matter that -- and 

         9                    he adds more to that and I return to some 

        10                    aspects of it, and to my own affidavit in 

        11                    due course, and to his second affidavit.  

        12                    

        13                    The contention that the Accused was detained 

        14                    by the Namibian authorities at the behest of 

        15                    the Prosecutor, back on page 3, is supported 

        16                    by the fact that the Namibian government has 

        17                    stated that to be the case.  

        18                    

        19                    Secondly, there was no other reason to 

        20                    detain him. 

        21                    

        22                    Thirdly, there's no extradition treaty 

        23                    between Rwanda and Namibia and there was no 

        24                    other requesting state.

          RWAMAKUBA                                      26 SEPTEMBER 2000



         1                    And, fourthly, that there was a letter or 

         2                    fax dated the 18th of January 1995 from Mr. 

         3                    Goldstone, to the Namibian authorities 

         4                    acknowledging the detention and that's at 

         5                    page 39.  And, again, turning that up, it 

         6                    reads from Justice Richard J. Goldstone, 

         7                    Prosecutor, 18th of January and it is 

         8                    directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

         9                    and it reads:  "I refer to our recent 

        10                    discussions and would like to confirm to you 

        11                    that at this moment we do not possess 

        12                    evidence which would entitle us to request 

        13                    the Namibian authorities to detain Dr. Andre 

        14                    Rwamakuba."

        15                    

        16                    So there's a compelling logic, a compelling 

        17                    inference that arises from those four 

        18                    combinations of facts that the Defence rely 

        19                    on to say that this was a detention and to 

        20                    some extent, at the behest of the 

        21                    Prosecutor. 

        22                    

        23                    So we rely on those general circumstances as 

        24                    indicating that his detention was prima 

        25                    facie attributable to the Prosecutor.

         1                    

         2                    I'm going to deal with two matters, two 

         3                    questions that arise. 

         4                    

         5                    The first is was Dr. Rwamakuba's detention 

         6                    provoked by a list?

         7                    

         8                    And the second is, whatever the fact of that 

         9                    is, when was the Prosecutor first told about 

        10                    his arrest?

        11                    

        12                    In terms of whether it was provoked by a 

        13                    list, and the evidence is it was a list, 

        14                    again, the Defence rely on paragraph 2 at 

        15                    page 35, of the bundle, where he says that 

        16                    he was, in fact, told that by those 

        17                    authorities, responsible authorities in 

        18                    Namibia. 

        19                    

        20                    Secondly, by paragraph 5, where he says that 

        21                    on the 30th of August a little time further 

        22                    into his detention in Namibia he was told 

        23                    that the government of Namibia had contacted 

        24                    the Tribunal at Arusha and that he was told 

        25                    that by a representative from Namibian

         1                    Office to Refugees.  And from paragraph 6 of 

         2                    the same affidavit that on September the 

         3                    14th when he was transferred to the Zaire 

         4                    camp and detained there he was told that I 

         5                    had to remain detained until the Namibian 

         6                    government had received a response from the 

         7                    International Criminal Tribunal for Arusha. 

         8                    

         9                    At page 38, presenting this argument in 

        10                    context, there was a letter from the 

        11                    Republic of Namibia, Ministry of Home 

        12                    Affairs, which is addressed to Dr. Andre 

        13                    Rwamakuba then at the Windhoek Central 

        14                    Prison dated the 7th, that's not very clear, 

        15                    perhaps, on your photocopy it's the 7th of 

        16                    February of 1996 and it says, "The Ministry 

        17                    of Home Affairs would like to inform you 

        18                    that you are released from custody today, 

        19                    unconditionally.  You were detained as per 

        20                    requirement of Resolution 978 of February

        22                    in the Rwandan genocide should appear before 

        23                    the International Tribunal for Rwanda."

        24                    

        25                    "We are pleased to inform you that it is per

         1                    information received you are acquitted from 

         2                    charges against you."  

         3                    

         4                    That was the language they used.  It was an 

         5                    appropriate language one accepts, but that 

         6                    was the language that was used.

         7                    

         8                    They added that he could stay in the 

         9                    country. 

        10                    

        11                    So then there's a letter in response to the 

        12                    Goldstone fax, that you referred to just a 

        13                    short moment ago, which you have seen, in 

        14                    any event, in the bundle.  So the Goldstone 

        15                    fax, obviously, compellingly, results in 

        16                    this letter and the Namibian authorities 

        17                    telling the Defendant, telling the Accused 

        18                    on what basis, in any event, he had been 

        19                    detained in the previous six months.

        20                    

        21                    In the Accused's second affidavit, recently 

        22                    swore and found at page 44 he states the 

        23                    following and I'll read it.  And I'll read 

        24                    it because there are some additions that are 

        25                    in manuscript which don't appear, I regret

         1                    to say, on the copies that have been 

         2                    provided to the Chamber because he was only 

         3                    able to sign this as an affidavit on 

         4                    Saturday when I arrived here in Arusha and 

         5                    seeing it my formation of his evidence he 

         6                    wished to add to it and I've done that in 

         7                    manuscript on the original, which will be 

         8                    lodged with the Court. 

         9                    

        10                    He says further to his affidavit of the 6th 

        11                    of June he says, "As stated in my first 

        12                    affidavit I was told on my arrest in Namibia 

        13                    I was arrested because of a list that had 

        14                    been circulated and a list was shown to me." 

        15                    And he adds -- and I invite it is not 

        16                    written in your copies -- to write at this 

        17                    point an insertion.  "I was told I was 

        18                    number 428."  

        19                    

        20                    If I can just pause there. 

        21                    

        22                    Doubtless, from the reading, and the cases 

        23                    that in any event the members of this 

        24                    Tribunal have been acquainted with, you will

         1                    authorities, André Guichaoua, who has 

         2                    written a book in respect to Rwanda, in that 

         3                    book -- and I can give you the page 

         4                    references -- produces lists that was 

         5                    circulated by the RPF in July of 1994. 

         6                    

         7                    André Rwamakuba's name appears amongst the 

         8                    many hundreds of names that appear on that 

         9                    list. 

        10                    

        11                    He appears, in fact, as number 21 of the 

        12                    cabinet.  He does not appear as number 428.  

        13                    So this is another list, another list 

        14                    independent of the RPF list and it's 

        15                    significant, significance, I hope, is 

        16                    apparent. 

        17                    

        18                    He says, "I was told that my detention was 

        19                    in compliance with the duty of the Namibian 

        20                    government to comply with the resolution of 

        21                    the UN." 

        22                    

        23                    "I was told on a number of occasions by the 

        24                    Namibian authorities they awaited the 

        25                    response of the Tribunal Prosecutor."

         1                    

         2                    He says, "I lived and worked in Namibia from 

         3                    '95 until '98 and became very familiar with 

         4                    the working of the administration there. 

         5                    It is an efficient administration.  It may 

         6                    well be within the knowledge of this 

         7                    Tribunal its constituent member."  Is that 

         8                    is a valid statement the Accused makes.  It 

         9                    is an efficient administration. 

        10                    

        11                    "It would be extraordinary," he says "and to 

        12                    my mind beyond belief that the Namibian 

        13                    authorities to have told me these things and 

        14                    to detain me unless what they said was 

        15                    true."

        17                    Page 45, he says "I refer to my being shown 

        18                    a list of suspects.  I've seen reference to 

        19                    such a list since then."

         1                    --Those are two significant additions to his 

         2                    affidavit.  So in addition to what the 

         3                    Accused says he was told repeatedly by the 

         4                    Namibian authorities, he is giving three 

         5                    other independent sources for the existence 

         6                    of a list, which is a list other than the 

         7                    RPF list which this Tribunal may know and 

         8                    have heard of before, it was issued in July 

         9                    of 1994.  So that is what he says in respect 

        10                    of that.  His affidavit goes on incidentally 

        11                    to refer to his absence of all legal advice 

        12                    and transfer, but I dealt with that under 

        13                    the earlier heading.

        14                    

        15                    May I refer to my own affidavit.  My 

        16                    understanding is that where Counsel is 

        17                    invoking fact known to him, the Chamber 

        18                    requires him to do so on affidavit.  And 

        19                    that is why this affidavit has been made, 

        20                    and it reads as follows:  "I have the 

        21                    conduct of the case with the Accused, having 

        22                    been appointed his Counsel on the 24 of 

        23                    February 1999," page 48, Mr. President.  

        24                    Following the Barayagwiza decision, I have 

        25                    been concerned to establish the precise

         1                    circumstances of the accused's detention in 

         2                    Namibia from August 2nd '95 to February the 

         3                    7.  To this end, I wrote the Minister of 

         4                    Justice in Namibia, Dr. Tjiriange on the 16 

         5                    of November.  I didn't receive a reply.  I 

         6                    wrote again on 6 January, and again I 

         7                    received no reply, and I wrote the Minister 

         8                    of Home Affairs on the 6 of January, I 

         9                    didn't get a reply to that either.  I then 

        10                    sought the assistance of the High 

        11                    Commissioner for Namibia in London, and she, 

        12                    I think, gave me some assistance which I set 

        13                    out there, and it was suggested by her that 

        14                    I approached the Permanent Secretary for 

        15                    Home Affairs, Mr. Taapoppi.

        16                    

        17                    Between February the 3rd and the 8th of this 

        18                    year, I went to Namibia to take a statement 

        19                    from the Accused's wife.  While there I met 

        20                    with representatives of the Ministry of Home 

        21                    Affairs.

        22                    

        23                    On the 3rd of February, I spoke with the 

        24                    Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of 

        25                    Justice, Dr. Albert Kawani, who told me that

         1                    his Ministry had only affected 

         2                    constitutional aspects of the transfer to 

         3                    Arusha.  He told me that the Ministries had 

         4                    conduct of the affair with the Ministry of 

         5                    Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs.  He told 

         6                    me that there was no extradition treaty with 

         7                    Rwanda then or now.  And he told, quote, and 

         8                    it is a quote, "My understanding of this was 

         9                    that there was a request from Arusha to 

        10                    apprehend, and that they were supposed to 

        11                    come and get him.  And then they said they 

        12                    had no evidence, they were still 

        13                    investigating.  Then they came back and 

        14                    asked for him later.  He advised me to talk 

        15                    to the two Permanent Secretaries for those 

        16                    ministries.  He cautioned me that; "and now 

        17                    the element is that in bureaucracies there 

        18                    is reluctance to reveal documents and you 

        19                    will need to address that issue with them".  

        20                    

        21                    Despite my efforts, I was unable to talk to 

        22                    or meet any representatives at the Ministry 

        23                    of Foreign Affairs.  I arranged to meet the 

        24                    Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs, Nito 

        25                    Taapoppi, and did so on Monday the 7 of

         1                    February.  He was generally helpful.  The 

         2                    meeting was attended by his assistant, a Mr. 

         3                    Nyeshekwa, and Mr. Taapoppi informed me that 

         4                    there was a problem, the file had gone 

         5                    missing and it was either with the Ministry 

         6                    of Justice or Foreign Affairs and he 

         7                    confirmed the period of detention ran from 

         8                    August to February. He told me, and this is 

         9                    perhaps the most significant aspect of my 

        10                    affidavit in respect of this particular 

        11                    matter and said in this Tribunal; he said 

        12                    that the detention had nothing to do with 

        13                    Rwanda, that they had acted on the United 

        14                    Nations list, "a list issued by the United 

        15                    Nations".  His name was on it, and he was 

        16                    arrested and detained.  The Prosecutor was 

        17                    informed, he said that he would check and 

        18                    confirm the date.  They waited for the 

        19                    Office of the Prosecutor to react, and 

        20                    eventually they responded with the exhibited 

        21                    Goldstone letter which you have seen and 

        22                    which has been referred to.  That is, the 

        23                    Defence produced facts.  

        24                    

        25                    It was agreed I should return for a meeting

         1                    the following day.  Basically I was told 

         2                    there were certain difficulties, paragraph 7 

         3                    of my affidavit sets those out, I don't have 

         4                    to go through all that-- file gone missing, 

         5                    whatever--  But in later correspondence with 

         6                    the Ministry of Home Affairs, I was advised 

         7                    to direct my questions to Foreign Affairs 

         8                    and the records of any contact with the 

         9                    United Nations Tribunal.  Before the letter 

        10                    of the 15 January, I was told, can only be 

        11                    obtained from the Ministry of Foreign 

        12                    Affairs.  I had a sad history with that 

        13                    department, no one has ever responded to any 

        14                    letter, and there have been many-- or fax or 

        15                    telephone calls-- essentially.  I have 

        16                    written to the Permanent Secretary of that 

        17                    department and to the Minister of Foreign 

        18                    Affairs, Mr. Guirirah, on the 10 of March, 

        19                    10 of April, 16 of August, 11 of September 

        20                    and I received no reply at all. I wrote to 

        21                    the Prosecutor of this Tribunal on the 16 

        22                    August in response to-- the response to the 

        23                    Defence motion, pointing out the 

        24                    difficulties that confronted me, and I asked 

        25                    for assistance, I asked them to use their

         1                    good offices to open their files up-- I 

         2                    apologise, it is unusual for me to be aided 

         3                    by a microphone.

         4     Mr. President:

         5                    It is for the translation.

         6     MR. HOOPER:

         7                    Oh, for the translation.  I am spurring on.  

         8                    I wrote to the Prosecutor on the 16 of 

         9                    August in response to his response of my 

        10                    motion asking for the Prosecution to use 

        11                    their good offices with the Namibian 

        12                    government to open their files, if not to me 

        13                    to the Chamber and to the Tribunal.

        14                    

        15                    I also suggested that there may be other 

        16                    files in the motion of the Prosecution at 

        17                    the Hague, Kigali or Arusha that may not 

        18                    have been examined.

        19                    

        20                    Just posing there; Mr.  Goldstone was 

        21                    written to at the Hague, or addressed at the 

        22                    Hague, by the-- not by the Namibian 

        23                    government, according to his letter of the 

        24                    21, which I will come to in a moment, he was 

        25                    in fact contacted first, he says by Rwandan

         1                    Ambassador to South Africa, which is unusual 

         2                    diplomatic channel.  Now, I know this 

         3                    Tribunal has some diplomatic experience and 

         4                    it would seem that that was a very unusual 

         5                    routing, given that the Namibian Authority 

         6                    had purported to act by the Tribunal's 

         7                    behest, the United Nations behest, they 

         8                    hadn't, in fact, themselves contacted their 

         9                    party that they purported to act for.

        10                    

        11                    The above history, paragraph 10, I suggest 

        12                    the following:  Firstly, that the Accused is  

        13                    correct in stating he was detained in the 

        14                    period he was, and that his account that 

        15                    there was a list circulated by the United 

        16                    Nations has been confirmed.  As to the date 

        17                    when the Prosecutor first performed that 

        18                    detention is unclear.  The Prosecutor's 

        19                    history of events are contained both in 

        20                    response and in the letter to this effect.  

        21                    The Prosecutor says the first they knew that

        23                    when the South African Ambassador, that is 

        24                    the Rwandan Ambassador to South Africa,

         1                    tell him that Namibia had detained André 

         2                    Rwamakuba, and he wrote the letter that he 

         3                    did, which he exhibited on the 22nd, 

         4                    considered the position and then wrote on 

         5                    the 18 of January to the Namibian 

         6                    Authorities, saying this time we have no 

         7                    evidence upon which to request the further 

         8                    detention of the Accused.  That history 

         9                    raises a certain number of questions which 

        10                    are, frankly, unanswered.  So in terms of 

        11                    whether there was a list, the Defence say 

        12                    that there is hopefully sufficient 

        13                    information for a prima facie finding, that 

        14                    there was a list, and that it is more 

        15                    probable than not that the Namibian 

        16                    authorities acted for the reasons they said 

        17                    they acted. 

        18                    

        19                    The significance of that is obvious, but to 

        20                    high-score it, if the Prosecutor circulated 

        21                    a list that contained the Accused's name 

        22                    against the background of invitation to act 

        23                    on it; and obligation by you and resolution 

        24                    to do so; and the consequent arrest of the 

        25                    Accused by Namibia, can probably be

         1                    described as being at the behest of the 

         2                    Prosecutor.  And if the Prosecutor acted in 

         3                    an irregular manner that is not formally 

         4                    under Rule 40 or 40 bis but indirect, then 

         5                    it should not not make no difference to its 

         6                    responsibilities.  The Accused should not 

         7                    be, in our submission, disadvantaged nor the 

         8                    Prosecutor advantaged in that way.  And the  

         9                    Defence go further and submit that if the 

        10                    list was circulated by another body, but it 

        11                    was the United Nations body, then the same 

        12                    principle should apply on the basis of the 

        13                    vicarious responsibility at least, the 

        14                    responsibility to this tribunal.

        15                    

        16                    Further, or alternatively, the Accused is 

        17                    detained at the behest of the Prosecutor.  

        18                    If there wasn't a list, for example, in any 

        19                    event, when the Prosecutor became aware 

        20                    Namibia was detaining the Accused and sought 

        21                    his further detention or allowed his further 

        22                    detention for the Tribunal's purposes, and 

        23                    the Prosecutor had responsibility to act on 

        24                    any information it received.  Now the 

        25                    Prosecutor said there was never a list, and

         1                    secondly, the first we ever heard of his 

         2                    detainer was the 21 of December, so, one 

         3                    issue or the second issue that arises here 

         4                    under behest generally, is when was the 

         5                    Prosecutor first told of the Accused's 

         6                    arrest?  And again, the Accused relies on 

         7                    the circumstances on what was said to him as 

         8                    evidence that the Tribunal Prosecutor was 

         9                    informed of his arrest and at an early 

        10                    stage.  I don't take you back to his 

        11                    affidavits, but you know there that he 

        12                    recounts the history of what he was told in 

        13                    August again, and again in September.  His 

        14                    own experience of the workings of the 

        15                    Namibian administration, of the total 

        16                    unlikelihood that the Namibian authorities 

        17                    within that state would purport to arrest 

        18                    and detain him without taking him to court 

        19                    on behalf of the UN, and yet not tell the 

        20                    Prosecutor about it.

        21                    

        22                    The response of the Prosecutor, as I say, is 

        23                    that there was no list and that the first 

        24                    knowledge was the 21.  Frankly, the Defence 

        25                    is sceptical and cautious-- page 5 of the

         1                    submission.  Sceptical and cautious as to 

         2                    the Prosecutor's response.  The Defence 

         3                    accepts that Mr. Fleming is entirely frank, 

         4                    that our concern as to the reliability, the 

         5                    accuracy of his instructions; is there a 

         6                    file un-traced?  Why should the Rwandan 

         7                    Ambassador be taking the initiative?  Why is 

         8                    he contacting the Hague?  Why not to Arusha  

         9                    or Kigali?  In their scepticism that the 

        10                    Defence show, I hope is not wholly 

        11                    misplaced, I wrote to the Prosecutor in  

        12                    November, December and January past, three 

        13                    or four times.  I eventually received a 

        14                    letter, and when it came to deal with Dr. 

        15                    Rwamakuba's detention in Namibia, it said 

        16                    purported detention and claimed no knowledge 

        17                    of it at all. 

        18                    

        19                    Here we are, just a few months later and 

        20                    they found at least one letter from Mr. 

        21                    Goldstone and clearly referred to it.  It 

        22                    sometimes happens, sadly, that the left hand 

        23                    doesn't know what the right hand is doing, 

        24                    and the Defence is concerned.  That is the 

        25                    situation here.  The Defence has been unable

         7                    but essentially, the Prosecutor says that-- 

         8                    The Prosecutor unequivocally stated that the 

         9                    Prosecutor didn't learn of the arrest until 

        10                    the 21 December and suggests that the -- 

        11                    submits, rather, that the Namibian -- this

         1                    sentence.  The Prosecutor submits that the 

         2                    Namibian government did not advise the 

         3                    Office of the Prosecutor of the detention of 

         4                    the Accused.  And over page 6 it says-- this

        10                    having offered any evidence of the vague 

        11                    recollections and it says at paragraph 7,

         9                    those six months is necessarily of paramount 

        10                    significance, then the Defence invites this 

        11                    Chamber to invoke its powers and authority  

        12                    under Article 28 to call on Namibia for

        14                    hearing, for a conclusive answer from the 

        15                    Namibian authorities who have a duty to 

        16                    respond and a failing to respond can be at

        21                    will do diplomatically at least, is give an 

        22                    answer where at the moment there is not 

        23                    conclusive answer.  The Prosecution account 

        24                    receiving a letter only on the 21 December 

        25                    is a possibility that it is improbable

         1                    rather than probable.  Given  the history of 

         2                    this matter, it is more probable than not, 

         3                    that André Rwamakuba was detained, in some 

         4                    way at the behest of this Tribunal, either 

         5                    because there was a list, however informally 

         6                    it was done or alternatively, because in 

         7                    fact the Prosecution were informed much 

         8                    earlier than the 21 of December.  Informed,

        17                    that I do exalt the Chamber to referring, in

         2                    was not in the constructive custody of the 

         3                    Tribunal the period of provisional detention 

         4                    was impermissibly lengthy.  We find the 

         5                    Appellant's right to be promptly charged 

         6                    violated.  So, the Defence, maintain that 

         7                    the Accused's detention was instigated by 

         8                    the Prosecutor on the evidence available to 

         9                    the Defence maintained by the Prosecutor in 

        10                    circumstances that amount to the Accused's 

        11                    being in the constructive custody of the 

        12                    Tribunal, what they list invoking a 

        13                    responsibility on the part of the Prosecutor 

        14                    towards that detention.  Alternatively, the 

        15                    Prosecutor had responsibility for his 

        16                    detention through instigating or maintaining 

        17                    it and the length and circumstance of that 

        18                    detention were in breach of International 

        19                    Principles and the Rules of law and Rules of

        24                    reasonable, that the overall abuse that

         2                    refer to paragraph 78 for full review of 

         3                    that right, set out in Barayagwiza, and very 

         4                    well set out.  It is a breach to the vital 

         5                    legal advice, it is a breach of the right to 

         6                    be tried without undue delay, and 

         7                    essentially if he is to be detained, if the 

         8                    Accused was detained without legal advice 

         9                    and help for six months at the top end of 

        10                    the scale of his argument, six months fall 

        11                    in excess of international norms; that was 

        12                    capable surely in any country, certainly in 

        13                    mine, of amounting to a clear abuse of 

        14                    process.  If the Prosecutor played a part, 

        15                    then that is such a severe wrong done to 

        16                    this Accused in the custody and under the 

        17                    responsibility of this Chamber, that the 

        18                    remedy for it is one  of immediate release.  

        19

        21                    maintain that the Prosecution failed in its 

        22                    responsibility to prosecute with due 

        23                    diligence the case against the Accused.  On 

        24                    the 18 of January 1996, the Prosecutor-- and 

        25                    this is not disputed, wrote; " I would like

         1                    to confirm that at this moment we do not 

         2                    possess evidence which will entitle us to

         4                    Dr. Rwamakuba".  I don't think I formally 

         5                    referred to that item of evidence, just for 

         6                    the record, I have it at page 39 of the 

         7                    facts.

         9                    The Chamber will be aware that the 

        10                    indictment against André Rwamakuba charges 

        11                    him with offences arising from certain 

        12                    facts, principle among those being his 

        13                    membership of the interim government.  That 

        14                    must have been known to the Prosecutor at 

        15                    the time of the letter written on the 18 of 

        16                    January '96.  He was a Cabinet member, he 

        17                    was 21 on RPF list.  The Accused was not 

        18                    arrested, however, until October '98.  So, 

        19                    all of '96, all of '97 and nearly all of 

        20                    1998 André Rwamakuba spent unknowing of his 

        21                    fate, he spent trying to settle in Namibia, 

        22                    he spent trying to support his family, and 

        23                    on the 20 October-- he is arrested; on the 

        24                    21 he is, in his words, kidnapped as he 

        25                    would feel it. But his feet barely touched

         4                    Prosecutor, who must have been known surely 

         5                    on the 18 January '96 after a review of 

         6                    several weeks, to be a member of the interim 

         7                    government who is written about in this way; 

         8                    "We do not possess evidence, which would 

         9                    entitle us to request the Namibian 

        10                    authorities to detain Dr. Rwamakuba."  The 

        11                    Accused's whereabouts was known to the 

        12                    Prosecutor.

        13                    

        14                    The Accused is a practising Doctor.  He 

        15                    registered and signed on with the Namibian 

        16                    Medical Authorities.  He was probably the 

        17                    most easily traceable, probably of any 

        18                    Accused, defendant, suspect, brought before 

        19                    this Tribunal.  He was even seen again by 

        20                    investigators in, I think, September '97.  

        21                    In fact, in my extract from the brief I got 

        22                    '96.  That is wrong.  It is '97.  So the 

        23                    Defence maintain this shows a lack of 

        24                    diligence on the part of the Prosecutor.

         1                    at length in the Barayagwiza, paragraphs 91 

         2                    to 99, essentially amounts to this; the 

         3                    Prosecutor has a duty to ensure the rights 

         4                    of the Accused person to be maintained, 

         5                    including the right of a fair and 

         6                    expeditious trial.  Mere delay that gives 

         7                    right to prejudice and unfairness, might by 

         8                    itself amount to an abuse in it's own right.  

         9                    The mere fact that the inquiries are not 

        10                    concluded is not necessarily grounds for not 

        11                    charging as the Prosecutor has power to add 

        12                    and to amend its allegations on the 

        13                    indictment.  Paragraph 95.

        15                    And, finally, the overall effect of all this 

        16                    is that the Prosecutor failed without 

        17                    reasonable excuse to bring the Accused 

        18                    before the Tribunal expeditiously, and he 

        19                    was thereby subjected to delay likely to 

        20                    prejudice in the conduct of his case.

        10                    person knows that there would be serious 

        11                    investigators and the argument here is that 

        12                    an arrest is clearly capable of forming 

        13                    within that criteria.

        16                    of oral argument, in fact, according to the 

        17                    Prosecution, there was a case-- this is a 

        18                    case where there was sufficiency of the 

        19                    evidence all along.  One has only to look at 

        20                    the indictment for you to see that.  The 

        21                    Prosecution say by their very indictment 

        22                    that there was sufficiency of evidence.  Was 

        23                    there a change of circumstances?  Three 

        24                    years, is, after all a truly enormous delay 

        25                    in Prosecution by any national or

         1                    international standards, without cause, and 

         2                    it would, in the Defence submission, 

         3                    necessarily have to be seen as unreasonable 

         4                    in its length.  Unless it wasn't the 

         5                    Prosecution's fault, and it is difficult to 

         6                    see how with these facts they can get from 

         7                    under foot, or that it was in itself not 

         8                    unreasonable.

         9                    

        10                    The only final matter that I seek to mention 

        11                    in respect to undue diligence is that it 

        12                    also rises under the failing to ensure an 

        13                    early initial appearance.  And my authority 

        14                    for that again is Barayagwiza, where it is 

        15                    clearly pronounced at paragraph 99 that the 

        16                    Prosecution, as in the words of Barayagwiza, 

        17                    hold the docket, and they can't just fall 

        18                    off their responsibility on the registry.  

        19                    They have, as the engine and power-horse of 

        20                    the Tribunal, responsibilities coexisting 

        21                    with those of the registry.

        22                    

        23                    Essentially, one is not concerned with fault 

        24                    in this submission of abuse of process.

         1                    that there have been very serious breaches 

         2                    of internationally recognised rights, rights 

         3                    reflected in the Articles and Rules of this 

         4                    Tribunal. This institution should be a 

         5                    leading light in respect of Human Rights, 

         6                    that these breaches of such significance 

         7                    taken singly, let alone together, that they 

         8                    are, in fact, worthy of a compelling 

         9                    argument, that the maximum benefit should be 

        10                    given to this Defendant for his objection to 

        11                    them which should so order the release, to 

        12                    stay the proceedings and to right the wrong 

        13                    that has been done to him in that way.  

        14                    That, despite the awfulness of the 

        15                    allegation that he faces.  And, again, that 

        16                    point again made in the case of Barayagwiza.  

        17                    

        18                    The second hearing of Barayagwiza led to a 

        19                    different result.  The basis upon which that 

        20                    second result was reach was in fact a full 

        21                    report of conduct revealed on the part of 

        22                    the Prosecutor, an acquiescence on the part 

        23                    of the Defence.  Neither those matters 

        24                    necessarily arise in this case.  Certainly 

        25                    not the later.  So this Defendant is fit and

         2                    of  release that can be ordered at this

         5                    Before I  close, again I go back to the 

         6                    difficulties that have confronted us in 

         7                    respect of Namibia, I am entirely in the 

         8                    court's Tribunal's hands as to whether it 

         9                    would be assisted as I submitted probably it 

        10                    will be by acknowledgement from Namibia one 

        11                    way or the other, a matter that is perhaps 

        12                    politically.  Well, perhaps not so much 

        13                    politically is even more in fact necessary, 

        14                    in the light of the allegations that have 

        15                    been made against that state by an organ of 

        16                    the United Nations.  I hope I haven't taken 

        17                    up over long.  I think it is important these 

        18                    matters are not just written in paper but 

        19                    they are listened to and that they are heard 

        20                    not only by the Tribunal but also, of 

        21                    course, by the Accused himself who has a 

        22                    deep and obvious interest on all that has 

        23                    passed here this morning and this afternoon.  

        24                    I am very grateful, Mr. President.

         1                    Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  I should give the 

         2                    floor immediately to the Prosecutor.  You 

         3                    have the floor.

         4     MS. POLLARD:

         5                    May it please the court, Your Honours.  I 

         6                    have to say first and foremost that I am 

         7                    somewhat surprised by what I consider to be 

         8                    a distortion of the facts by Mr. Hooper, 

         9                    especially with his repeated reference to 

        10                    the January 18th 1996 letter of the former 

        11                    Prosecutor Mr. Goldstone, I think he has 

        12                    simply taken that letter out of context, 

        13                    grossly mistakes what actually transpired.  

        14                    But before I move on to my points, and I 

        15                    promise that I will be brief, because I 

        16                    think the issues here are quite simple and 

        17                    can easily be resolved upon a clear review 

        18                    of the evidence.  At first I would like to 

        19                    raise an objection to the evidence offered 

        20                    by the Defence in that the Defence has 

        21                    offered in support of its entire preposition 

        22                    nothing more than hearsay upon hearsay upon 

        23                    hearsay.  The Defence has offered 

        24                    presentations from various ministers who 

        25                    stated that they had heard a list existed

         1                    the Defence has also offered representations 

         2                    and affidavits by the Accused, who contains 

         3                    that he was shown list which he was told was 

         4                    distributed by the Tribunal.  The bottom 

         5                    line is, to date, there has not been one 

         6                    piece of evidence from the Namibian 

         7                    government to show that there was a request 

         8                    by the Tribunal to detain the Accused, nor 

         9                    has there been any evidence offered to show 

        10                    that between the August 2nd 1995 arrest and 

        11                    the December 22 letter by Mr. Goldstone, 

        12                    that the Namibian authorities had anything 

        13                    to at list follow-up on the notification to 

        14                    the Tribunal.  And why I say that the 

        15                    January 18th 1996 letter, direct constant 

        16                    reference to that letter is misleading, 

        17                    because we must look at what preceded that 

        18                    letter, and clearly, the Office of the 

        19                    Prosecutor did not know of the arrest of the 

        20                    Accused until December 21st 1995.  How do we 

        21                    know that?  We know that because we have a 

        22                    copy of a letter dated December 22 from Mr. 

        23                    Goldstone directed to the Attorney General 

        24                    of Namibia.  In that letter, Mr. Goldstone 

        25                    makes it clear that he first learned of the

         1                    arrest the day before.  And yet Mr. 

         2                    Goldstone also states in that letter that he 

         3                    learned of that arrest through the 

         4                    Ambassador of Rwanda to South Africa.  I 

         5                    also found it quite surprising that the 

         6                    Accused would state in his affidavit that he 

         7                    finds the Namibian government to be highly 

         8                    efficient, because at the time that 

         9                    affidavit was submitted, Defence Counsel 

        10                    also submitted his own affidavit, stating 

        11                    the various problems he has had trying to 

        12                    secure information from the Namibian 

        13                    government.  In one instant, actually, I 

        14                    think I need to go, if I may, go to the 

        15                    affidavit of Mr. Hooper, and I don't mean to 

        16                    actually recount it at every point, because 

        17                    that won't be necessary.  But Mr. Hooper has 

        18                    indicated in his oral submission today-- 

        19                    stated that he happened to have been in 

        20                    Namibia in February, I think in an effort to 

        21                    interview the wife of the Accused.  In his 

        22                    affidavit, Mr. Hooper indicates that he met 

        23                    with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry 

        24                    of Justice who offered only a general 

        25                    understanding that there was a request from

         3                    On the 3rd of February, no information was 

         4                    offered, no documentation was offered, 

         5                    nothing concrete was offered by the Namibian 

         6                    government.  What happened was that Mr. 

         7                    Hooper was then introduced to the Permanent 

         8                    Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, 

         9                    who stated that he had acted on a list.  At 

        10                    the same time the Minister said that the 

        11                    file was missing but he promised that the 

        12                    file would be located because it was either 

        13                    with the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the 

        14                    Minister of Justice, and what was-- the  

        15                    understanding left by Mr. Hooper, by his own 

        16                    words was that Mr. Hooper would return the 

        17                    next day--

        18     Mr. President:

        19                    Please, please, please, please--

        20     MS. POLLARD:  

        21                    I am so sorry.

        22     Mr. President:

        23                    I am sorry for the interpretation.

        24     MS. POLLARD:

        25                    I am sorry.  I am so sorry, I apologise.  My

         1                    colleague here has reminded me that I am an 

         2                    American, I need to slow down.  Sorry. The 

         3                    next day when Mr. Hooper returned to 

         4                    retrieve these documents perceived to be 

         5                    some kind of definitive evidence, he was 

         6                    told that he should come back because two 

         7                    relevant letters were lost and after 

         8                    promising to retrieve these documents from 

         9                    the safe of yet another Minister, nothing 

        10                    was ever given to Mr. Hooper.

        11                    

        12                    Finally, Mr. Hooper had to conclude whatever 

        13                    other business he was in Namibia on, and by 

        14                    his own words despite repeated promises to 

        15                    uncover these missing files and to provide 

        16                    these sought for two relevant documents, the 

        17                    Defence was told suddenly to direct his 

        18                    questions yet to another ministry.  Well, 

        19                    the bottom-line is this, that to date there 

        20                    has been no documentation provided from the 

        21                    Namibian government, and what I did make 

        22                    clear to Mr. Hooper is that the Prosecutor 

        23                    does not now and has never circulated -- has 

        24                    never prepared a list of suspects for 

        25                    general circulation.  Your Honour, I begun

         1                    my argument with objecting to nature of the 

         2                    evidence offered by the Defence, now I am 

         3                    not sure if I should have waited for the 

         4                    response from the Bench in regard to the 

         5                    objection?

         6     Mr. President:

         7                    Go ahead.

         8     MS. POLLARD:

         9                    In the event that the Bench does not intend 

        10                    to disallow the evidence, which, again, I 

        11                    submit that it is hearsay upon hearsay, I 

        12                    would ask that the evidence be deemed 

        13                    unreliable, in as much as it is very very 

        14                    far removed from its resources.  With 

        15                    respect to the-- I notice, I would like to 

        16                    stress, Your Honour,  that in his Defence 

        17                    brief.  Mr. Hooper stated that the Accused 

        18                    was detained in 1995, and Mr. Hooper 

        19                    specifically states, at the behest of the 

        20                    Tribunal, and he says that the Ministry of 

        21                    Home Affairs has referred to, quote, 

        22                    unquote, a list of names circulated by the 

        23                    United Nations Tribunal with the specific 

        24                    request to detain persons on the said list.  

        25                    Why I mentioned that is because since Mr.

         1                    Hooper first brought this motion before the 

         2                    court, there has been several motions before 

         3                    the Defence.  Unfortunately for the Defence 

         4                    there has been no new additional evidence 

         5                    added.  As a matter of fact most recently, 

         6                    as recent as yesterday when Mr. Hooper 

         7                    provided the blue binder we are all 

         8                    utilising, on page 4, Mr. Hooper now tries 

         9                    to include for consideration the possibility 

        10                    that the list was circulated by another 

        11                    body.  And, I am stressing this point 

        12                    because perhaps there was a list.  What I am 

        13                    saying to the court is that we are clear on 

        14                    the fact that, the Prosecutor's Office at no 

        15                    time circulated such a list.  And we are 

        16                    also clear on the fact that the Office of 

        17                    the Prosecutor did not learn of the arrest 

        18                    of the Accused, until four months after the 

        19                    Defence -- the Accused had been in custody.  

        20                    In respect of the Defendant's motion I 

        21                    submit that the issues underlining the 

        22                    motion are threefold.  First; was the 

        23                    Accused subjected to a lawful dilatory 

        24                    process of behaviour by the Prosecutor, and 

        25                    that would be in respect of the 1995

         1                    arrest -- by the Accused in Namibia.  I 

         2                    would submit that the answer is no, because 

         3                    first and foremost the Defence has failed to 

         4                    establish that the Tribunal is, in fact, or 

         5                    was in fact related or in fact caused the 

         6                    arrest of the Accused.

         7                    

         8                    The second issue would be, if the answer to 

         9                    the first question was 'yes', was the extent 

        10                    of the behaviour such as would render the 

        11                    Accused's continued detention and trial an 

        12                    abuse of process?  Given that we have 

        13                    answered the question in the negative, there 

        14                    is no need to address the second issue.

        15                    

        16                    The third issue, I think, which would be 

        17                    outcome determinative would be what effects, 

        18                    if any on the court's jurisdiction has the 

        19                    delay of 135 days between transfer and 

        20                    initial appearance have?  Or in the 

        21                    alternative, is the delay in this case 

        22                    sufficient to cause the Tribunal to loose 

        23                    it's jurisdiction?  I say that the Defence 

        24                    has been somewhat misleading it its 

        25                    preposition that the Barayagwiza case is

         1                    very very similar to the case at hand.  

         2                    Particularly-- well, actually let me backup 

         3                    a little bit, in preparing a response to 

         4                    this motion, the Office of the Prosecutor 

         5                    contacted the Court Management Section to 

         6                    determine the exact basis for the delay 

         7                    between the arrest of the Accused and the 

         8                    rescheduling of the initial appearance.  The 

         9                    Office of the Prosecutor received back from 

        10                    the Court Management Section a copy of a 

        11                    memo which was dated February 16th 2000.  In 

        12                    that memo, the Court Management Section 

        13                    informed the Prosecutor that the Accused, in 

        14                    fact, contributed to the delay.  In addition 

        15                    to the delay caused by the refusal of the 

        16                    Accused to accept Counsel which was being 

        17                    proposed, there was also a period of 31 days 

        18                    for the Judicial recess.  And if we are 

        19                    considering a period between March and April 

        20                    7, that would be an additional 28 days which 

        21                    adjournment was that-- its my 

        22                    understanding-- was at the request of the 

        23                    Counsel for co-accused Karamera. So despite 

        24                    the assertions of the Defence, to the 

        25                    contrary, in fact given the reluctance, and

         1                    the refusal of the Defence of the Accused to 

         2                    accept counsel which was offered to him, 

         3                    there were circumstances of acquiescence as 

         4                    those elements which were identified in 

         5                    Barayagwiza.

         6                    

         7                    One additional point I wanted to make, Your 

         8                    Honours, is that it needs to be noted that 

         9                    had the Prosecutor sought the detention of 

        10                    the Accused, pursuant to Rule  40 of the 

        11                    Rules governing this Tribunal, the 

        12                    Prosecutor would have been well within her 

        13                    right to do so without the need for all this 

        14                    subterfuge, without the need to in a 

        15                    backhand kind of way circulate some kind of 

        16                    a list with some kind of nondescript request 

        17                    to detain.  In this instance the Prosecutor 

        18                    did not exercise that right, and, in fact, 

        19                    again, the Prosecutor had no involvement 

        20                    with the detention of the Accused from 

        21                    August 1995 through February of 1996.  The 

        22                    only involvement of the Prosecutor came 

        23                    about again when the Prosecutor was advised 

        24                    by the Rwandan Ambassador that the Accused 

        25                    was in custody, and Mr. Goldstone as stated

         1                    in his letter to the agent SYRUPS to 

         2                    ascertain whether we were interested in a 

         3                    possible Prosecution of Dr. Rwamakuba, and 

         4                    by answer following in approximately three 

         5                    weeks, former Prosecutor Goldstone very 

         6                    expeditiously, so I think, notified the 

         7                    Namibian authorities that we would not have 

         8                    an interest at that time in prosecuting the 

         9                    Accused.  And one other fact I would like to 

        10                    point out is that, the Defence Counsel makes 

        11                    a big deal or is trying to make a big deal 

        12                    out of the fact that while the Accused was 

        13                    in the custody of the Namibian authority, 

        14                    that the Accused did not have right to 

        15                    Counsel.  There was a brief period, I think, 

        16                    from September of 1995, to November 1995, 

        17                    where the Accused was transferred to some 

        18                    kind of camp which was the same as 

        19                    House-arrest.  But in exchange-- and this I 

        20                    am learning-- I have learned from an 

        21                    affidavit prepared by the Accused and the 

        22                    Accused, in his affidavit, recounts that in 

        23                    exchange for this more lenient type of 

        24                    detention, he voluntarily gave up his right 

        25                    to Counsel, he gave up his right to-- as

         1                    part of the agreement he agreed not to 

         2                    contact an Attorney, he agreed not to 

         3                    contact the press, and he agreed apparently 

         4                    not to contact some kind of refuge 

         5                    organisation.  So I say this to say that, 

         6                    the Accused, as a medical doctor, an 

         7                    educated man, was well aware of what his 

         8                    rights were and I am just sort of amazed 

         9                    that five years after the fact, actually, it 

        10                    was a little bit before five years, it was 

        11                    in May that this motion was brought; four 

        12                    and half years after his arrest the Accused 

        13                    is now contending that it was somehow 

        14                    illegal.  Again, it needs to be noted that 

        15                    the -- if the Accused considered his arrest 

        16                    to be unlawful, he should have challenged 

        17                    the arrest while he was in custody of the 

        18                    Namibian authorities, where he had such 

        19                    right to do so.  There is no indication that 

        20                    he invoked such a right, and again, as I 

        21                    have just pointed out, there is an 

        22                    indication from the own words of the Accused 

        23                    that he specifically gave up the right to 

        24                    have an Attorney.  For these reasons, Your 

        25                    Honour, again these are reasons of the

         1                    Prosecutor's that the Prosecutor said in 

         2                    much more detail, involves the response of 

         3                    the Prosecutor and in the Sole Reply to the 

         4                    reply of the Defence Attorney, but I don't 

         5                    believe it is necessary to recount each and 

         6                    every element here.  But for those reasons, 

         7                    and the reasons I have just stated, I 

         8                    believe the Defendant has failed to support 

         9                    the motion brought before the court, and for 

        10                    that reason must be denied the request to 

        11                    have the Defence released from detention and 

        12                    the most required is to request to have the 

        13                    indictment dismissed.  Thank you.

        14     Mr. President:

        15                    Defence?

        16     MR. HOOPER:  

        17                    Dealing with the efficiency or inefficiency 

        18                    of the Namibian government, one can, of 

        19                    course, be efficiently blocked from pursuing 

        20                    a particular inquiry, and my feeling is that 

        21                    I was efficiently blocked from pursuing a 

        22                    line of inquiry.  The question that arises 

        23                    is why?  It may be, that it is not, in fact, 

        24                    because there was no contact between the 

        25                    Namibian government and Arusha, but because

         1                    there was contact.  Secondly, Ms. Pollard 

         2                    refers to there being no evidence, only 

         3                    hearsay on hearsay-- that there is hearsay 

         4                    evidence submitted in this Tribunal.  There 

         5                    is evidence, it is in the nature of hearsay.  

         6                    You are going to have to evaluate it and 

         7                    give it such weight as it merits.

         8                    

         9                    There is reference by Namibian authorities 

        10                    in correspondence and orally to the 

        11                    Defendant and to me-- of a list-- an 

        12                    existence of the list.  There are other 

        13                    secondary references by the Defendant, 

        14                    publication, reference to the cutting "Voix 

        15                    D' Aloemagne", BBC, on the 12 of December-- 

        16                    references to a list.  Thirdly, the Defence 

        17                    Case just now introduced the concept of a 

        18                    vicarious responsibility arising because the 

        19                    motion in fact refers to a responsibility by 

        20                    the Prosecutor for the period of the 

        21                    Accused's detention in Namibia in whole or 

        22                    in part. That phrase, recognises that there 

        23                    was a list, be it whole, part would be 

        24                    arising from some other consequential way.

         1                    The initial appearance; reference is being 

         2                    made to a memorandum dated the 16 February, 

         3                    2000.  "I refer to the Defendant's-- 

         4                    Accused's second affidavit.  He has never 

         5                    received or seen such a memorandum.  He is 

         6                    defenceless, as it were, in the face of that 

         7                    particular suggestion.  It is not something 

         8                    he or I have been able to deal with.  We 

         9                    have never seen it.  Secondly the Accused in 

        10                    his second Affidavit refers quite clearly 

        11                    that he was never offered Counsel at all.  

        12                    Secondly, that he was only in contact, and 

        13                    permitted contact with Counsel as of the end 

        14                    of February with me.  In other words, he is 

        15                    stating quite clearly that there was a 

        16                    calamitous failure to attend to his rights 

        17                    between his transfer and the end of 

        18                    February.  He is raising that as a fact.  He 

        19                    is stating that he has never contributed to 

        20                    delay.  There is no evidence that has been 

        21                    put before this Tribunal that he did.

         1                    short period during the period of detention 

         2                    in 1995 to 1996.  It is difficult to suggest 

         3                    that a man who is in a prison cell and 

         4                    offered slightly less strenuous 

         5                    circumstances 'volunteer' is an 

         6                    inappropriate phrase to use when in fact the 

         7                    public authority are demanding concession 

         8                    from him in order to allow him a less 

         9                    restrained period of liberty.  The price for 

        10                    getting out of that prison, the point-blank 

        11                    offer made to him unlawfully --quite plainly 

        12                    by the Namibian Authority is that is that we 

        13                    will let you out but you have got to sign 

        14                    this document, and not at any time seek to 

        15                    effect any rights.  And it can hardly be 

        16                    described as a voluntary matter, it will be 

        17                    a very poor precedent indeed if that was to 

        18                    be upheld, because when we deal with human 

        19                    rights we are dealing with effective  human 

        20                    rights and that effectiveness was  taken 

        21                    away.  Those are all the matters that I had 

        22                    wished to add.  Grateful.

        23     MS. POLLARD:

        24                    Pardon me, Your Honour, but I promise I will 

        25                    be brief.  I just wish to offer a note,

         1                    actually two notes of clarification.  The 

         2                    February 16, 2000 memorandum to which I 

         3                    refer is the memorandum which was prepared 

         4                    by Dr. Mindua, it was addressed to these 

         5                    Chambers for clarification on the statute of 

         6                    the Accused.  So, of course, Mr. Rwamakuba 

         7                    would not have access to the memorandum and 

         8                    if one has to decide on what has more 

         9                    weight, a memorandum prepared before a 

        10                    motion has a reason versus the affidavit of 

        11                    the Accused whose liberty is at steak; one, 

        12                    a reasonable person would probably tend to 

        13                    side with the memorandum as being more 

        14                    credible.  And on the issue of whether or 

        15                    not Dr. Rwamakuba could have  suggested 

        16                    legal representation while he was in 

        17                    Namibia, Counsel is suggesting that the 

        18                    conditions of his detention were dreadfully 

        19                    onerous.  I submit that by the submissions 

        20                    by the Defence Counsel, Mr. Rwamakuba was 

        21                    offered Refugee status by the  Namibian 

        22                    government and by the Accused's own 

        23                    affidavit.

        24                    

        25                    After his detention, he went to serve as a

         2                    would suggest to me that he was treated 

         3                    rather nicely by the government, certainly, 

         4                    minimally, and I realise that I am back and 

         5                    forth between two issues.  This is my last 

         6                    point in respect of the appointment of 

         7                    Counsel, Your Honours, of course, recognises 

         8                    that that is the function of the registry 

         9                    and again the registry has advised us that 

        10                    the delay in so appointing an Attorney was 

        11                    partially due to the refusal of the Accused 

        12                    to accept the Counsel which was designated.   

        13                    Thank you.

        14     Mr. President:

        15                    Mr. Hooper, of course you are the last 

        16                    person to speak.  There is -- if Dr. 

        17                    Rwamakuba wishes to speak he has to go 

        18                    through his Counsel.  I am referring to the 

        19                    Accused.  If you wish--

        20     MR. HOOPER:

        21                    Those are my instructions, I am aware of 

        22                    them I don't need to consult Dr. Rwamakuba 

        23                    on his instructions to me --

        24     Mr. President:

        25                    Because he is raising--

         1     MR. HOOPER:

         2                    Yes, we will resort to order in a moment.  

         3                    Dr. Rwamakuba's instructions to me are that 

         4                    at no time was he responsible for any delay, 

         5                    and more pointedly in respect of the last 

         6                    matter, no time did he refuse Counsel that 

         7                    was in fact offered to him, and I have  seen 

         8                    no evidence to contradict that statement in 

         9                    his affidavit which is evidence before this 

        10                    court rather than argument.  I have seen no 

        11                    evidence to contradict that.

        12     Mr. President:

        13                    Thank you.  Can we ask the registry.  I 

        14                    mean, how about this memorandum that is 

        15                    being referred to?

        16

         2     MR. KIYEYEU:  

         3                    Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm sorry, 

         4                    Mr. President, personally, I have not seen 

         5                    that memo, and I was not aware that it was 

         6                    going to be referred to this afternoon.  Had 

         7                    I known, Mr. President, I would have had it 

         8                    in my hands so that it could be helpful.  

         9                    But, in any case, if there is a memo which 

        10                    was officially addressed to the Prosecutor, 

        11                    I believe, it is authentic, Mr. President, 

        12                    and that, your Honourable Chamber would take 

        13                    good note of it.  Thank you, Mr. President.

        14     Mr. President: 

        15                    Prosecutor, we have this memorandum in the 

        16                    file, it was addressed to the Presiding 

        17                    Judge and Judges of Trial Chamber II.  How 

        18                    did you manage to get a copy, and if that 

        19                    were to be case, how come a copy was not 

        20                    sent to Defence?

        21     MS. POLLARD:

        22                    I obtained a copy by requesting the 

        23                    memorandum, some information from 

        24                    Dr. Mindua, as to any information he may 

        25                    have had in respect of the delay between the

         1                    arrest and the initial appearance of the 

         2                    Accused.  And in response to my request for 

         3                    information, Dr. Mindua sent me a cover 

         4                    memo, attached to which was the February 

         5                    16th, memorandum.  And I presumed that a 

         6                    copy was sent only to me because I was the 

         7                    one who requested it.  

         8                    

         9                    With all due respect, I mean, the Defence 

        10                    could have undertaken his own investigation 

        11                    into this matter.  I can't explain beyond 

        12                    that, Your Honour, why a copy was not 

        13                    submitted to the Defence.

        14     Mr. President: 

        15                    Mr. Hooper, we shall direct the Registry to 

        16                    give you a copy of the memorandum, and if 

        17                    you have any comments, you can do so in 

        18                    writing and forward it to the Chamber. 

        19     THE INTERPRETER: 

        20                    Microphone. Your microphone, please.

        21     MR. HOOPER: 

        22                    Thank you, very much.  I have no idea what's 

        23                    contained in the memorandum.  There are two 

        24                    matters that seems perhaps to have risen in 

        25                    the course of, prior to this morning, and

         1                    also this morning, and now afternoon.  

         2                    

         3                    One is this question of whether or not the 

         4                    Accused was offerred in conformity with the 

         5                    Rules, legal advice.  He maintained he 

         6                    wasn't.  And maybe, history there needs more 

         7                    detail and ravelling, particularly in the 

         8                    light of the memo that has been produced 

         9                    because that -- I take it's a memo in 

        10                    contradiction to the averments that I have 

        11                    made, and may need some explanations as, Mr. 

        12                    President, you've recognised it.  

        13                    

        14                    The other matter is this, I referred to the 

        15                    inconclusive, if I can use it, neutral word 

        16                    as possible, made through the evidence in 

        17                    respect of Namibia, and the Defence 

        18                    suggestion that this Tribunal could, 

        19                    in fact, formally request the Namibian 

        20                    Government to assist it by allowing you, 

        21                    Mr. President, to be told by the Namibian 

        22                    Government, when it was that they say they 

        23                    first contacted the Prosecutor in any one of 

        24                    his three shapes and forms, Kigali, Arusha 

        25                    or The Hague.  Maybe those two matters could

         1                    take a little time, and I could only suggest 

         2                    that maybe, that if this matter could be 

         3                    relisted in the hope of a response in 

         4                    settlement of those two issues, say in, 

         5                    about five weeks time, that I would be 

         6                    probably here in any event, and the Court's 

         7                    time may be usefully taken up in that way.  

         8                    And that we could, as it were, forgo any 

         9                    further decision making today.  They are 

        10                    both significant matters for obvious 

        11                    reasons.  I am sorry that I'm not in a 

        12                    position to further assist the Tribunal as 

        13                    to their resolution.  

        14                    Thank you, Mr. President. 

        15     Mr. President: 

        16                    Yes, I think there was a misunderstanding 

        17                    between us.  There was a misunderstanding.  

        18                    We heard your motion, namely to see the 

        19                    Namibian Government before following up on 

        20                    your motion.  But for now, I am saying that 

        21                    there is a memorandum that was addressed by 

        22                    the Court Management Section, to the 

        23                    President and the Judges of Trial Chamber 

        24                    II.  Now, that memorandum got to the 

        25                    Prosecutor but I don't think it got to the

         1                    Defence, and I subsequently put a question 

         2                    to the Prosecutor, and the Proasecutor 

         3                    explained that it was as a result of a 

         4                    letter she addressed to the Court Management 

         5                    Section, with respect to the delays in the 

         6                    initial appearance, that Court Management 

         7                    Section then sent a copy of that letter and 

         8                    the memorandum, which was also subsequently 

         9                    sent to the President and the Judges.  

        10                    

        11                    Now, my question is, would you not want a 

        12                    copy of this memorandum to be given to you, 

        13                    in the event you might have some comments or 

        14                    observations to make?  So what is your 

        15                    answer to that question? 

        16     MR. HOOPER: 

        17                    Mr. President, sorry, there may be a 

        18                    misunderstanding, I thought I had answered 

        19                    it.  Indeed, yes.  I am grateful to you.

        20     MS. OJEMENI:

        21                    Your Honour.

        22     Mr. President: 

        23                    You have to finish now.  The last word is  

        24                    Defence.  I tolerate that -- really, I don't 

        25                    tolerate that but, exceptionally, I give you

         3                    I'm sorry, and I thank you for that 

         4                    opportunity.  But I would like to address 

         5                    the Court on the issue of the request made 

         6                    by the Defence to investigate the 

         7                    circumstances of that arrest.  And if I'm  

         8                    allowed I would like to just say one or two 

         9                    things on that.  Do I go on?  Can I have  

        10                    your permission? 

        11     Mr. President: 

        12                    I think your colleague did talk about these 

        13                    matters, he did address the Court, you want 

        14                    to add something?  I thought your colleague 

        15                    already spoke on your behalf with respect to 

        16                    the circumstances of the arrest.

        17     MS. OJEMENI:

        18                    Yes, Your Honour.  I just want to address 

        19                    the fact that the arrest was done by a 

        20                    sovereign state.  And that you have 

        21                    consistently held that even in a situation 

        22                    where the Prosecutor exercise its right --  

        23                    I mean, her right under Rule 40(A), that 

        24                    this Tribunal has no basis to investigate 

        25                    the circumstances of the arrest.

         2                    And that even the reliance on Article 28, 

         3                    that inviting Your Honours to seek 

         4                    cooperation of the Namibian Government, that 

         5                    the spirit of that Article is very clear, is 

         6                    the circumstances under what such 

         7                    cooperation can be sought, are stated there, 

         8                    and the situation here is quite different.  

         9                    

        10                    So, I urge Your Honours to deny my learned 

        11                    friend's request, because the arrest was 

        12                    done by a sovereign state, and this Tribunal 

        13                    has no jurisdiction to investigate the 

        14                    arrest.  And it's our position that we did 

        15                    not request for his arrest.  So, I just 

        16                    thought I should bring out that salient 

        17                    point.

        18     Mr. President:

        22     MR. HOOPER:

        23                    The persistent disinclination of the 

        24                    Prosecutor to assist the Defence, and

         1                    using its doubtless good offices, for 

         2                    example, with the Namibian Government to get 

         3                    to the bottom of this, and the comments, 

         4                    which came in the face of open justice that 

         5                    have just been made, strike somewhat 

         6                    extraordinary.  

         7                    

         8                    Article 28 is headed Cooperation and 

         9                    Judicial Assistance.  And very briefly, if I 

        10                    can take you to one which is just the 

        11                    reaffirmation, in any way, of a State 

        12                    responsibility within its international 

        13                    setting, they shall cooperate with the 

        14                    International Tribunal for Rwanda, in the 

        15                    investigation and Prosecution of persons 

        16                    etc:  

        17                    

        18                    And two, States shall comply without undue 

        19                    delay with any request for assistance, or an 

        20                    order issued by a Trial Chamber, including 

        21                    but not limited to.  And under the 

        22                    "including" but not limited to" is the 

        23                    taking of testimony and production of 

        24                    evidence; (c) is service of documents.  But 

        25                    it's the production of evidence and taking

         1                    of testimony, and including but not limited 

         2                    to.  These are wide powers.  

         3                    

         4                    And here, we are on a matter of the greatest 

         5                    importance; the right and liberty of an 

         6                    individual.  There are unanswered questions, 

         7                    there are compelling questions yet 

         8                    unanswered.  And the Defence, in fact, are 

         9                    basically inviting this Tribunal or 

        10                    requesting this Tribunal to assist them in, 

        11                    in, in fact, gaining the very simple 

        12                    answers, if possible.  It all has to be done 

        13                    at the discretion and consent of the 

        14                    Namibian Government, itself.  This is not a 

        15                    mandatory exercise.  

        16                    

        17                    It seems that it would be a matter at least 

        18                    of very basic diplomatic courtesy to the 

        19                    Namibian Government to respond to a letter 

        20                    request from this Chamber, saying please, 

        21                    may you assist us in an important matter, in 

        22                    a decision that we have to reach, if you can 

        23                    assist us in telling us when it was that you 

        24                    first contacted the ICTR.   The ICTR contact 

        25                    or potential contact of the ICTR, is not a

         2                    government, it directly affects the Tribunal 

         3                    and the decision that its been asked to make 

         4                    in what is a significant and important 

         5                    motion that's been brought before it.  

         6                    

         7                    And I really reiterate these matters that I 

         8                    said probably out of turn, I regret, a 

         9                    moment ago but I referred to that whilst I 

        10                    repeat them.  And those are all the matters 

        11                    that I have to say.  I'm very grateful.

        15     Mr. President: 

        16                    The matters raised and observations made by 

        17                    all the parties would be considered in the 

        18                    course of our deliberations.  Our answer to 

        19                    all the questions you have raised will be 

        20                    contained in the decision we will arrive at 

        21                    after a deliberation, and they will be 

        22                    communicated to the parties. So we shall 

        23                    deliberate on the matter, and this session 

        24                    stands adjourned.
