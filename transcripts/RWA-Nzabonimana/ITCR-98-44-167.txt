Good morning, Mr. President.  May it please the Trial Chamber, I am Peter Robinson and I am defending Joseph Nzirorera.  I am assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva, a legal assistant sitting behind me to my right.  We are sharing with the Karemera team at the moment.  Also by legal intern, 
Russell Hopkins from Scotland, sitting also to my right, Georgina Mensah-Datsa from Ghana sitting in the back from - - on my left. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

I think that there are one or two preliminary issues that we must address and the first one relates to a motion for reconsideration of the decision on continuance of the trial, and of a request and cooperation to the government of Rwanda and supplementary filing, filed by counsel for Accused Nzirorera. 

We have a decision in that matter which I think we should deliver at this stage, and this is the decision: The Defence has moved the Chamber for reconsideration of its decision denying the Defence motions for continuance of the trial.  

It submits that the Chamber erred in its finding that the Defence has other investigators who can interview witnesses in Rwanda since the second Defence investigator is a refugee, he cannot re-enter that country.  

The Defence submits that the addition of two Prosecution witnesses also requests postponement of the trial since the Prosecution failed to disclose for Witness EDE, the statements within the time limits prescribed by the Rule 66 of the Rules, and no preparation for the witness, Reyntjens was planned.  

Additionally, the Defence request, pursuant to Article 28 of the Statute, that the Rwandan government allow the investigator for Mr. Nzirorera to interview witnesses in Rwandan prisons and on the territory of Rwanda.  

The Prosecutor filed a response opposing the motion.  

The Chamber considers that the issue of investigation of the Defence investigator by the 
Rwandan authorities is a matter with which the Chamber should not interfere lightly.  The issue of access to the Rwandan prisons by the investigator is something that is incidental to those investigations.  The fact that the investigation is in existence without any other allegations is not sufficient to allow a request for cooperation.

Additionally, it is not alleged that the access of the Defence team to the Rwandan prisons has been denied.  The Chamber considers that this will allow the Defence to make alternative arrangements to conduct its investigations.

With respect to the late disclosure of Witness ED's status, and the fact that the Defence did not prepare for Professor Reyntjens' testimony, while the Chamber still has to address the matter of the proposed variation of the Prosecution witness list, it considers that the alleged prejudice of the Defence does not justify a postponement of trial. 

It is desirable to recall that this is a recommencement of the hearing which started in 2003, and the scheduling order for the proceedings was made since 24 of May 2005.  Both factions have had a lot of time to prepare.  I say both, but I mean all parties, have had a lot of time to prepare.  And in the interests of justice require commencement of the trial.  Trial postponement is not the only or necessarily the most appropriate remedy for the defaults alleged by the Defence.  The Chamber is of the view that there is no good reason to grant continuance of the trial.  The Defence motion is, therefore, denied.  

Now, the other issue on which something is required to be said is the document filed by the Prosecutor amending the final Prosecution witness list.  Now the Chamber recalls that on the 
15th of September 2005, the Prosecution filed a supplementary filing regarding its witness list for this trial.  It submits that in the interest of justice, and although the investigations remain on-going, the Prosecution will reduce its list in fact.  It will no longer rely on 12 witnesses.  Additionally, the Prosecution notifies the parties of the addition of two witnesses to its list.

First, the Chamber has to express its concern regarding the Prosecution statements that investigations are still on-going.  It should not be necessary to recall that the Prosecution must know its case before it goes to trial.  Secondly, as the Prosecution contends in its filing, Rule 73 bis (E) of the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence, provides, indeed, that after the commencement of the trial, the Prosecution may move the Chamber for leave to vary its witness list.  However, in the instant case, the Chamber issued a scheduling order with the agreement of both parties, prescribing that the Prosecution file its final witness list, pursuant to Rule 73 bis (B) of the Rules, no later than 27th June 2005.  At that date, the Prosecution complied with the Chamber's order.  The Chamber reminds the Prosecution that it has therefore, to seek leave to vary its final Prosecution list before amending it.  

Now, we have decided to invite the Prosecution to indicate whether it intends to make such an application and if so, whether it wishes to regard the motions filed as application and to present supporting arguments already.  If that is the case, we can make an appropriate scheduling order. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honours.  We do plan to make a motion in view of the Court's comments.  We will make a motion to add two witnesses to the witness's list, but I would prefer not to do that at this time we will make motions on a later time and supported with -- motivate the motion properly.  The filing was made on the 15th of September, was not sufficiently motivated because we assumed that it did not require motivation since the trial had not commenced, but we simply wanted to indicate to the parties and the Trial Chamber before trial commenced that these two witnesses may be called during the course of the trial and we will make the appropriate motion at a later time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do I understand, therefore, that you withdraw the material already filed?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could you clarify for us what material has been file, what material you are referring? 
MR. PRESIDENT:   
You made a filing on the 15th of September, a supplementary filing with regard to your witness list. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:   
Now, you are saying that you do not want that to be considered as a motion for variation, but you are going to file a separate motion at a late stage.  Therefore, I was trying to clarify the status of the document that you have already filed.  Is it therefore withdrawn? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It is not withdrawn. I don't think it is an appropriate withdrawal, but we will file a motion under 
Rule 73 bis, I believe it's there. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Mr. Webster, if we don't restrict the withdrawal, what am I proposing, was that you make a scheduling order?  You see if this is going to - - I mean your application and you wish us to support it, then we can make a scheduling order listing the time by which you must make your supporting presentations either in writing or orally and give the Defence an appropriate time for a response. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is appropriate, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the time is:  What time would you require? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would suggest a month. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A month? 
MR. WEBSTER:   
Your Honour, I leave the matter to the Court's discretion. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No no, we don't know what's going on.  So, if there is a later date our discretion is to be informed by the actual facts. It just seems to me that a month was very long in the context of this trial.  I would have thought that you either know what you were doing now, and if you do not, you do know that you are making the application during the course of the week. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The application cannot be made during the course of the week, Your Honour, because it is going to be contacting and getting supporting affidavits from the whatever -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, no, no, we cannot make an order if we are going to rely on our own instincts, we will have it dealt readily.  We think it should be dealt as soon as possible in the interest of justice.  We do not know what is possible.  So if you can you must make a proposal. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My proposal is two weeks, Your Honour.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you are going to do it in writing or orally, in writing, I presume?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
In writing.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Two weeks is Monday the 3rd of October.

Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, thank you for granting me the floor.  Your apparent issue, that letters Madam Hounkpatin and myself to talk to each other because we know that it's a document that was served as memorandum, and we thought the Defence should react within the five days time frame.  We are preparing it as especially Webster has said he thought were withdrawing it as a memorandum.  So that we are faced with a problem.  Is it a memorandum?  If that is the case we shall respond or is it a memorandum?  And if it's not the common sense would dictate that Mr. Webster withdraws his document, but we do have procedural obligations, and we have to respect those obligations on the basis of the documents served to us, Mr. President.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, the Court is indicating that the document as filed required a different prayer before it could considered.  And what we were doing was scheduling the may to proceed.  Now, the Prosecutor has proposed to make a supplementary filing by the 3rd of October in which case the Defence would have time to respond.  You would normally be entitled to five days; I was wondering whether we could make an order for you to respond on the Friday the 7th of October.  That is the documents would be filed on Monday 3rd and the Defence response to be filed on Friday the 7th of October.  Would that be an order with which the Defence will comply?
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I only have one question:  During the week on the 3rd to the 7th of October, if I look to the calendar proposed by Mr. Webster, we are going to have hearings with regard to 
Witness G.  I am wondering if we are going to have enough time from now and until given that we will have to prepare that witness.  We are in the hands of the Prosecution.  The Prosecution has all the necessary time from until the 3rd of October.  We will not have sufficient time as we will be dealing with that witness.  I will just ask the Chamber to be mindful of that situation.

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the Rules require to reply within five days.  We were thinking of bridging it to four days.  Are you saying you can't do it in four days that you do need your 5th to reply? 
MR. WEYL:  
	With all due respect, I would say that the list of witnesses should have been dealt with before the commencement of trial.  Mr. Webster has indicated two days after the pre-trial conference that he no doubt way will introduce new witnesses.  And that there would some 600 hours of testimony overall.  I don't know that the motion will contain. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
We will schedule Defence replies to 10th of October.
Well, I think that list of scheduling order has been appropriately made for the Prosecutor to file its supporting material by application to vary the witness list by 3rd 0ct0ber and the Defence reply by 
10th October.  

That concludes the matters which were preliminary to the commencement of main business for this morning and I would invite the Prosecutor to make the opening statement. 
MR. JALLOW: 
I am much obliged to the Court.  As it pleases the Court and I do return greetings to my 
Learned colleagues on the Defence side.  

My Lords, in 1994, the people of Rwanda faced the challenge; it was a challenge of trying to create a more inclusive form of government.  Sadly, however, there were those, amongst Rwandans, who at this time, who were greedy for power and who were filled with hate to conspire to make that effort, to make that dream an impossible one.  We have before this Court today.  Eduard Karemera, 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and Joseph Nzirorera, and they all fell within that category of people who contrived to make that effort impossibility.  The Accused were among Rwanda's most privileged sons, but instead of using their talents to this effect to build their nation, they collaborated with other powerful military and political leaders to commit the most abominable crime; the crime of genocide.  

This trial will address three major issues on which we will lead evidence as well:  First the creation of command and control of the genocidal Interahamwe militia, second the genesis and the implementation of the Interim Government's genocidal policies and thirdly, the gender nature of the genocidal enterprise itself.  That is to say the role of sexual violence in the MRND's genocidal campaign against the Tutsi.  In all these three matters, the accused that are before the Court today, played a major role.

The three accused were amongst those who founded the Interahamwe youth wing of their own party, the MRND, that is, the Movement Républican national pour lé Developpment et la Démacratie (MRND) democracy republican nationale.  They assembled them, that is, the Interahamwe in a coalition of militiamen with youth from the Hutu power political parties and then deployed them against the Tutsi and against their political opponents in their bid to hold onto power and privilege.  These Accused systematically dismantled, together with others, all institutional bulwarks against lawlessness and they cranked every lever of power and authority at their disposal to mount this nationwide campaign of terror.  Genocide of the Tutsi was their means of combating the Rwandan Patriotic Front; and when faced with the prospect of sharing power with a legitimate political opposition, they opted instead to drive their country into an abyss of destruction. 

Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera are charged as co-perpetrators in a joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi throughout Rwanda.  By that we mean they committed the crime of genocide, they planned it, they ordered it, and they instigated and incited others to commit genocide.  They provided some perpetrators with the means to kill, and they knowingly failed to stop or sanction others from killing and raping when they had the duty and the capacity to do so.  

The Prosecution will lead evidence to prove that Edward Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and 
Joseph Nzirorera conspired to commit genocide and directly and publicly incited others to do so well.  They are responsible, therefore, for rape and extermination as crimes against humanity.  They are responsible for murders as serious violations of the Geneva conventions.  The incitement has before the Court consists of seven separate counts with complicity in genocide pleaded as an alternative count for the crime of genocide itself.

The Prosecutor will present evidence from witnesses who were themselves co-perpetrators with the accused in there horrendous crimes.  They are the witnesses also who exercised some degree of governmental authority themselves, but who tried to resist the genocidal policies of the accused; they the evidence from the eye-witnesses who survived the horrendous genocidal campaign and now appear before you to tell their story.  And the evidence from scholars and journalists who will assist this Court with their expert analysis and commentary on the events of the time.

Broadly stated My Lords, the background to the Rwanda genocide of 1994 is thus:  The Habyarimana regime with its puppets in the country's North West responded to the political crisis of the 1990s by re-organizing the MRND party in which these three accused were leaders to compete in the arena of multi-party politics.  The destruction of Rwanda's Tutsi population was part of that strategy.  Genocide of the Tutsis was an end in itself, but it was also a strategy which fueled the MRND's military and political campaign against the RPF, and allowed it to sweep away the largely southern-based political opposition, both of which threatened the MRND's hold on power.  Fundamentally, as they saw it, the entire structure of state authority in Rwanda was being dismantled by the Arusha Peace Accords.  Power in Rwandan society was being taken away from the presidency which held virtually all power under the MRND party state and was being transferred to a government led by a prime minister who would then become the most significant political actor.  The incumbent President Habyarimana would then be reduced to a title more that a figure head after having spent decades creating and managing an elaboral party machine to administer to administer to his power. 

In 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the president of the MRND party.  Joseph Nzirorera was the MRND national secretary and Eduard Karemera was the party's first vice president.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse first became party president on an interim basis some time in March 1993, when Rwanda's head of state resigned the presidency.  At that time, he was already serving as the MRND national secretary.  
Eduard Karemera had been national secretary of the party in 1991 before Ngirumpatse.  And, of course, Nzirorera was national secretary in 1994. So at some point in time, each of these three accused rotated to the office of the MRND national secretary.  That office was a paid position in the party providing the office holder with the trappings of office and vesting him with full time executive responsibility for the party's day to day affairs.  Along with Ferdinand Kabagema, these three accused constituted the Bureau Executive of the MRND in 1994, and that was a powerful institution in Rwanda in those days.  This was the MRND's policy making nucleus.  Each of the accused had been a member of the central executive organ of the party during most of its critical phase.  That is the early 1990s when the multi-party system was introduced in Rwanda for the first time and subsequently.  This party machine over which they presided was the one which created the Interahamwe.  The MRND party created uncontrolled Interahamwe and the Interahamwe was vital to MRND strategy of survival and multi- party system.  MRND party leaders were Interahamwe leaders and government soldiers that were loyal to the party trained and provisioned the Interahamwe and themselves became leaders of this militia.  Since banking, industry and trading were all laced with networks of MRND control, MRND businessmen or high level civil servants could hire or subsidize the Interahamwe wing.  Ultimately, this MRND Interahamwe, Interahamwe youth wing was recruited, indoctrinated, trained and armed and deployed in a national wide campaign to destroy its enemies.  And by 1993, the three accused in this case made sure that these militiamen that they controlled as part of the Interahamwe of the party machine understood that their enemy was the Tutsi.

Mathieu Ngirumpatse founded the Interahamwe youth wing in Kigali.  He did not do it alone of course, but his voice and his initiatives were catalytic in this respect.  In additional to appointing national leaders and councilors, Ngirumpatse supervised the appointment of Interahamwe leaders at the secteur level throughout Kigali.  When Ngirumpatse was MRND national secretary after April 1992, party leaders at the préfectural level throughout Rwanda were ordered to recruit local youth for its Interahamwe youth wings and these youths were mobilized and controlled by the party with Ngirumpatse at the summit of control and decision-making. He controlled the reins of the Interahamwe by choosing an influencing its national leaders in Kigali and through his control of the MRND party networks in the préfectures and communes throughout Rwanda.  

For Joseph Nzirorera, he founded again with others the Interahamwe in Mukingo, his home commune, in Ruhengeri préfecture.  He worked hand in hand with the local party government and military authorities with people such as Bourgmestre Juvenal Kajelijeli, Conseiller Assiel Ndisette, local party chairmen Michel Nyabusore, MRND préfectural president Casmir Bizimungu, Ruhengeri operational commander Augustin Bizimungu, a retired army colonel, Ephrem Setako, and there were others that worked with, and they all collaborated to recruit local youths for the Interahamwe.  Nzirorera paid them. He gave those uniforms, and MRND-Interahamwe ID, and he essentially mobilised them.  He held meetings with them at his home and at his mother's home in Mukingo, and at their headquarters at Isimbi house, a building that he owned and which he placed at their disposal.  Nzirorera also shuttled back and forth to Gisenyi and was instrumental in setting up the Interahamwe there as well and throughout the country particularly after he became national secretary of the party in July 1993. Towards the end of 1993, Nzirorera presented Gisenyi operational commander, Anatoly Nsengiyumva to the Gisenyi Interahamwe and told them that he was one of them, an Interahamwe like themselves. 

Karemera, we know he is from Kibuye, Eduard Karemera.  During 1993, he travelled throughout the country rallying party constituents to the cause, to the cause of the genocide.  And in Kibuye he collaborated with local administrative officials to recruit youths for the Interahamwe.  Eventually, he also delivered weapons and kitengi uniforms to these Interahamwe people and arranged for them to receive military training in army camps.  

Karemera was a lawyer in private practice in Kigali, and he defended Interahamwe that were arrested when that happened occasionally.  Initially, this was not the major undertaking since he was sluggish; Ngirumpatse was sluggish in prosecuting Interahamwe crimes during those brief initial periods when he was minister of justice.  The challenge of justice completely eclipsed Nzirorera who was much in control of local affairs in Mukingo commune that his Interahamwe constituted themselves as the region guardians of order and security.  This then is the background of the accused within the MRND and their role within the Interahamwe in the establishment and the organisation, training command of the Interahamwe.  By mid-November 1992, despite mounting public criticism of the Interahamwe, the then incumbent president openly embraced his party youth wing in a much publicised speech he defended them, and he told the nation that he would dress them up in colorful kitenge fabrics and descend with them throughout the country as party of electoral campaign.  This was his famous speech in Ruhengeri when he dismissed the Arusha Accords as "scraps of paper" incapable of bringing peace to Rwanda.  

Little more than a week later, Leon Mugesera, a party official in Gisenyi made another rousing much publicised, much criticised speech in Kibaya where he called upon his countrymen to send back to Abyssinia by the shortest route.  And this route was said to be the Nyabarongo River.  These were key moments in the evolution of the MRND's public campaign to galvanize Anti- Arusha, Ant-Tutsi sentiments.  Habyarimana enthroned Interahamwe and gave them his seal of approval and Lean Mugesera gave public voice nationwide to the most virulent strain of MRND's political ideology.  And throughout this period, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Eduard Karemera were key decision-makers in the party apparatus.  They were working methodically to organise its Interahamwe youth wing.

In August 1993, the Arusha Accords were brought to conclusion with the final series of protocols on power-sharing.  The MRND did not support the Accords and its Bureau Executive told the country, and I would like to recall that its Bureau Executive constituted, included some of the accused who are now before this Court.  Its Bureau Executive told the country to rail against them and propagated a notion that the coalition government that had negotiated the Arusha Accords had betrayed the nation and collaborated with the enemy.  The Arusha Accords were said to give too much power to the RPF.
And by October 1993, at a point when political tensions in the country were already high, the opposition political parties themselves became wracked by division and spilt into opposing camps; one a pro-MRND wing, and the other pro-Arusha Accords.  By late 1993, with the Arusha Accords already in place, and power-sharing finally on the horizon, Rwanda became dangerously polarised, and the MRND applied full throttle to accelerate the political degeneration.  Their objective to derail the Arusha Accords and their strategy was of genocide.
Frouauld Karamira, a leader of Rwanda's MDR technically a part of the political opposition addressed a rally in Nyamirambo stadium and made a rousing speech that reverberated throughout the country.  His call for Hutu Power, for MDR Power, for MDR Power, for CDR Power, for Interahamwe Power galvanized extremist political currents and stoked opposition to the Arusha Accords which by then were already underway.

The UN Peace Force was arriving in Kigali at the very moment that Karamira was calling for 
Hutu Power; a battalion of RPF soldiers was soon due to arrive in Kigali as peace agreement.  At this moment, the RPF was no longer the enemy army.  They were legitimate partners in the political transition.  By late 1993, the three accused; Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and Karemera as the MRND Bureau Executive strengthened and renewed their collaboration with the government soldiers and officials in the ministry of defence to provide military training for their Interahamwe youth wing.  They arranged for weapons to be stockpiled for future distribution o the militias.  Interahamwe were transported to national forests and to various army camps for military training in state owned ONATRACOM vehicles made available for such purposes to the ministry of transport which the MRND party controlled.

The ministry of defence, another MRND stronghold had even undertaken to organise a program of self defence and planned for demobilised soldiers and reservists to lead the civil defence in their home neighbourhood and train and mobilize local Interahamwe.  And now that the opposing parties were split, even youths from the opposition were to be included in the MRND strategy to mobilize militiamen.  So even if early supporters of the Interahamwe believed they were rejuvenating the MRND to compete in the political area, by late 1993, it was clear that these Interahamwe militiamen had become a lethal genocidal machine and had even expanded to include militiamen from some of the opposition political parties.  

Some time in mid-1993, MRND hardliners coalesced around Ferdinand Nahimana, 
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza and other members of the more radical CDR party to set up a private radio station, Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines.  This private radio station would provide them with unrestricted access to mass media airwaves since programming for the state-run Rwanda radio was now supervised by the minister of the information, an MRND preserve.  All accused were shareholders in RTLM.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in the first few meetings that were called to build popular support and soliciting financing for the radio station.  So by late 1993, the strategy adopted initially recourse to ethnic hatred, coupled with mobilisation of a militia force was radicalized dramatically and cranked for action as the country inched towards the power-sharing arrangements that would further weaken the MRND
On the evening of April 6 1994, we know that President Habyarimana together with his colleague from Burundi both lost their lives when the aircraft in which they were travelling was shot over Kigali and crashed.  His sudden death exacerbated and accelerated a political crisis that had begun months before.  The elimination of the president did not create an institutional void; here was a legitimate government in place even in the wake of the death of the president.  And that government of the then prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, should have managed any crisis that was brought in by the death of the head of state.  It was, however, prevented from doing so because extremist forces that were determined to derail the political transition used the opportunity of one crisis to create another.  On the morning of 7th of April, government solders disarmed the UN Peacekeepers that were guarding the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana's residence and removed them to Camp Kigali where they were brutally murdered.  

Meanwhile government army officers killed and sexually defiled the prime minister herself.  That morning, the presidential guards and other elite units of the Rwanda government forces tracked, arrested, and killed every political figure of significance that could be found that would have constituted legitimate state authority in Rwanda. In effect, extremist political and military figures coalesced around Theoneste Bagosora or responded to his call to obliterate all prospects of continuing the political transition towards the broad-based transitional government.  Following the first wave of killings, RPF soldiers emerged from the Parliament Building and began an exchange of fire with the Presidential Guards Battalion, rekindling the armed conflict that the Arusha Accords had sought to end.  And this was where the Bureau Executive of the MRBD including the accused who are before the Court, this is where that institution stepped in to play a decisive role.  

When Theoneste Bagosora, the Directeur de cabinet in the ministry of defence convened with the MRND Bureau Executive at the ministry of defence on 8th of April, they resolved to summon a number of leaders of other political parties to assemble a new Interim Government.  Bagosora and these MRND leaders set about creating a new civilian authority that normally, or at least cosmetically, would pass muster before the international community.  Although clearly this was a common effort among the like-minded political leaders, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera and Eduardo played the pivotal roles.  Every political party leader that gathered at the ministry of defence that morning was affiliated with Hutu Power.  There was no opposition in the government.  There were no Tutsis in the government.  And this government that was formed was a government with a Hutu Power agenda that would be used to organise the genocide of the Tutsi.

1000H 
MR. JALLOW: (continued)
The three Accused, Karemera, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, held no ministerial portfolios in the interim government when it was first sworn in on 9th April 1994.  Initially, their control of the government stemmed from their role in assembling it and from their role within the MRND itself.  Bearing in mind that the MRND was the most powerful political party in the coalition, the Accused were able to exert control in government affairs through the ministries that came under their control.

As a practical matter, there was little to distinguish the three Accused, who were political leaders, from the ministers of the interim government.  They assembled in the same meetings to discuss national policy, they travelled and moved about in the same circles; they lived and worked together and were headquartered in the same locations; they constituted a unified consortium of Hutu Power.  

Ngirumpatse spoke in the name of the interim government, as did Êdouard Karemera, even before he became minister of the interior.  Nzirorera travelled abroad to South Africa on behalf of the interim government.  These men, these three men participated in decimating one political authority and set themselves up as the successor.  And aside from the authority that they could exercise formally through government structures, they controlled the MRND party apparatus with its powerful network of influence throughout the country and in military circles.  

To all intents and purposes, the MRND and the interim government are practically indistinguishable.  Why?  Because genocidal state policy originated in those ministers that controlled -- that were controlled by the MRND party, and these policies were then adopted and implemented at the level of the entire government by consensus.  I here already referred to the policies of pacification and civilian self-defence, so called; both of these emanated from the ministry of the interior and ministry of defence, two institutions that bear long standing MRND strongholds.  As ambiguous as the terms "pacification" and the "civilian self-defence" may appear to the uninformed listener, those who implemented these policies in April 1994 had a very clear sense of what they were meant to accomplish.  

Pacification was a smoke screen for the widespread attacks against the Tutsi that were being organised nation wide.  Civil defence was a call to arms that was used to legitimize, recruit, coordinate provision, and deploy the military -- the militia, the militias who had been created by these three Accused and others as part of the youth wing of the MRND.  And both policies had a common objective, to organise and rationalise the killing of Tutsi.  Both policies too can be traced to the interim government and to the MRND party.  

The architects of the genocide felt compelled, nonetheless, to hide the widespread killings from the international community.  So, it was important to give some appropriate gloss or cover to what was happening.  And so the killing of Tutsi was described within the party and at government level as "restoring security"; alternately translated as "pacification".  And the civilian-defence offered a veil of legitimacy to convince the killers themselves, as well as outsiders, that by attacking Tutsi men, women and children, they were only protecting themselves.  

The first mention of a pacification campaign in this trial will arise in testimony from a former member of the national committee of the Interahamwe, one of the first Prosecution witnesses who will be called here.  By Sunday 10th April, killings of Tutsi at roadblocks throughout Kigali had littered the major thorough fares with corpses of Tutsi men and women that had been brutally hacked to death.  So much so, and so brazenly committed by the militiamen, that international media reporting embarrassed, somehow with difficulty, this self-proclaimed interim government, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera summoned the Interahamwe leaders to the L`Hôtel des Diplomate, which was the MAP centre of the Abatabazi government, and brought them to a meeting with the interim government.  

Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera and the other politicians instructed them to tour the city, and in the name of the interim government, to order militiamen at the roadblocks to stop the killings temporarily and to assist in removing the dead bodies from the road sides.  The killings of Tutsi, therefore, should proceed more discreetly and out of the public view.  Ostensibly, the interim government issued communiqués calling for an end to the killings.  Their lukewarm official pronouncements simply served as a cover.  In actuality -- actually, these national authorities had more effective means to disseminate their message that Tutsi should be tracked and killed.  True, the networks of information on control of the MRND party stayed.  

That first pacification tool was effective.  The national Interahamwe leaders were able to exert control over many of the roadblocks.  But even as they delivered the interim government message of pacification, they made arrangements to deliver guns to militiamen at the very same roadblocks on behalf of those very same civilian and military Abatabazi authorities.  

On Monday, 11th April, the interim government summoned all préfets to a meeting at the               L`Hôtel des Diplomate.  The préfets were expected to provide reports on the security situation in their respective areas.  This meeting was also an opportunity for the newly installed government to introduce themselves to the original authorities.  Only three of the 11 préfets were absent; the others provided accounts of attacks against the Tutsi, described as "problems of security."  

Butare and Gitarama préfectures were described as, "inactive" because the killings there were reasonably contained.  The préfets there advised that further instructions from the government would arrive in due course.  And on 27th April, the then prime minister, Jean Kambanda, issued a memorandum, which has been translated in English as "Instructions on Restoring Security."  One month later, he issued his prime minister's directives on self-defence, which was the further articulation of the official government policy.  

These directives were debated in cabinet meetings and were issued as government policy on the basis of consensus that is, unanimous approval, by the cabinet.  Both of them served to make local administrators responsible for restoring security and for organising civilian defence, for the population to defend itself against the enemy in "their very midst" as they said.  And this was a cover for the killing of Tutsi.  

By 18th April, within a week of this forced meeting with the préfets, the fundamentally genocidal nature of the government's policy was indisputable.  By then they had abandoned Kigali and shifted their temporary headquarters to the Murambi training centre in Gitarama.  RPF soldiers had practically encircled Kigali and a line of patrol between Rwandan government forces and RPF soldiers was etched across the very centre of Kigali and along the eastern front of Kibungo.  But behind government       lines -- behind the government lines, the Tutsi were still being hunted and killed in their homes, on open hillsides, at roadblocks, in schools, and in hospitals.  Not even the fortress-like walls of Rwanda's churches provided sanctuary from soldiers and militiamen.  

During this period, interim government ministers and political party leaders convened in several decisive cabinet meetings.  On 17th April, they decided to remove the prefets of Butare and Kibungo.  Jean Habyalimana, the only Tutsi préfet in the country, had managed to maintain order in Butare up to that moment.  Godfroide Ruzindana resisted the killings in Kibungo.  Both préfets were dispose -- deposed and were killed by militiamen shortly afterwards.  The préfet of Gitarama initially welcomed the convoy of interim government ministers and party leaders when they first arrived, anticipating that their presence in Gitarama would have a stabilizing effect, but it became clear within days that their arrival simply empowered the Interahamwe and the forces of disorder.  

On 18th April when Gitarama préfet Fidele Uwizeye organised a meeting of bourgmestres to coordinate security measures, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda prevented the meeting from taking place, and ordered those assembled to Murambi, where government ministers and party leaders addressed them.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera, Eliezer Niyitegeka and Justin Mugenzi, participated in that meeting, and were amongst the most vocal.  They ridiculed, they scolded and threatened the Gitarama delegation.  They defended the Interahamwe and accused the Gitarama officials of not understanding the government programme.

The interim government effectively broke down all resistance to the killing campaign by regional authorities in Gitarama -- in Butare, sorry, Gitarama and Kibungo, where the legitimate political officials had made inroads in the territorial administration.  The officials were removed and replaced.  And on 19 April, a powerful government delegation accompanied the president and the prime minister to Butare, where they publicly deposed the préfet and installed Sylvain Nsabimana in his place.                 Édouard Karemera, again, as usual was there among them.  He was there with the delegation.  Both the president and the prime minister made rousing speeches setting forth the government policy.  These were speeches to be broadcast by Radio Rwanda, and they reverberated nationwide.  The message was clear and unequivocal, war was everywhere, the enemy was everywhere, and the population must assist government soldiers in defence of the nation by searching out the enemy in their midst.  This was a call to arms to attack the Tutsi.  

By the time the prime minister's directives were disseminated on 27th, April there was no mistaking his message.  Every veiled phrasing could be interpreted just as it was intended: killing the Tutsi was part of the war effort; restoring security meant ridding the country of Tutsi. During this period, national and regional leaders of the Interahamwe, controlled by these Accused, made periodic visits to Murambi, the nerve-centre of the Abatabazi government, and there they reported directly to MRND president, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on the progress of the killings.  

The genocidal enterprise was nationwide.  The government policy extended to every hamlet, but the most graphic and heartless display of coordination within military authorities, political party leaders and regional government administrators was probably its campaign against the Tutsi of Bisesero in Kibuye, a place which was far from the battle front between the government armed forces and the RPF soldiers.  Here, again, the policy of the interim government was unmistakable.  The local authorities in Kibuye had already killed thousands of Tutsi who sought refuge in churches and other public shelters by the first half of April.  But by month's end they were still unable to eradicate those that ran into the Bisesero hills.  

An interim government delegation, lead by the prime minister, arrived in Kibuye town on 3rd May, and held a public meeting to address matters of security, once again.  Édouard Karemera represented the MRND in the delegation, and also addressed the gathering.  When local authorities in Kibuye complained of lacking security on the Bisesero hilltops, where poor, innocent civilian Tutsi were taking refuge and called upon the interim government to enforce their campaign against the Tutsi in Bisesero, the prime minister responded with promises of reinforcements.  Bus loads of soldiers and militiamen were dispatched from Gisenyi and Cyangugu.  Édouard Karemera arrived in person, along with several other national political leaders from Kibuye, joined with regional and local officials in mobilising soldiers, militiamen and local Hutu residents for renewed attacks against the Tutsi on the Bisesero hilltops.  
Édouard Karemera, along with the minister of information, Eliezer Niyitegeka, Gisovu tea factory director, Alfred Musema, businessman Obed Ruzindana, Kibuye préfet, Clément Kayishema,   Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Mika Muhimana, they were all there in the population.  They were all personally involved in directing these attacks in mid-May against the defenceless civilian population.  

Days later, on 16th May, Karemera returned to Kibuye with the presidential delegation to congratulate the people of Kibuye for their campaign against the Tutsi.

Despite this relentless campaign, there were still survivors.  By late June, with Operation Turquoise set to arrive in Rwanda from Ngoma, and fearing that the survivors would expose the government's genocidal campaign to outsiders, the national authorities mounted a final coordinated assault.  By this time, Édouard Karemera was the minister of interior in the interim government.  He had been promoted.  Following a meeting of the cabinet, he sent an official request to Gisenyi military commander,     Anatole Nsengiyumva, for re-enforcements to be dispatched to Bisesero for a final mopping up campaign to eliminate all traces of what he called the RPF in Bisesero by 20th of June, the deadline obviously had in mind the arrival of Operation Turquoise on 22nd June; the campaign had to be committed by that time.  

By that time, of course, the RPF had ventured no further west than Butare, a far distance from the hill tops of Bisesero.  There was no RPF presence in Bisesero; survivors of those final attacks in Bisesero reported that government soldiers and militiamen, speaking of the northern Rukiga tongue of Kinyarwanda launched the final assaults.  As I said, there were no RPF soldiers on those Bisesero hill tops, only poor, innocent, defenceless Tutsi.  

To recap, in certain regions of the country, mostly in the south, the government had to overcome institutional resistance.  It did so by removing the préfets in the various places we have mentioned.  In contrast, on the western front in Kibuye, local government officials who embraced the genocidal programme still had to rely on logistical resources and enforcement of soldiers.  There were two distinct patterns of the same governmental policy.  Firstly, clear the path for the killing campaign; remove anyone and anything that stood in the path of the genocidal enterprise.  And then, secondly, mobilise all government logistical material, major sources to support local authorities in their campaign.  

There was another pattern, a third that was clearly implemented in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, the cradle of the MRND party state.  These were the regions where repeated episodic killings of Tutsi had been going on since 1991.  And this is where the MRND party was most entrenched and where the Interahamwe militias had been nursed and groomed, indoctrinated, trained, equipped and integrated with government soldiers, and for the longest periods of time and with the greatest intensity.  
Let us look at Mukingo commune in Ruhengeri, that is Nzirorera's backyard, where by the morning of 8th April, Interahamwe militiamen had already decimated the Tutsi population.  On the morning of      7th April, with the news of President Habyarimana's plane crash, the Interahamwe militiamen gathered outside of Joseph Nzirorera's mother's home, others assembled in that nearby Byangabo centre with other local residents.  

Juvénal Kajelijeli arrived and told them that he had been in contact with Nzirorera, and ordered them to commence attacks against the Tutsi.  Interahamwe militiamen were joined and lead by soldiers from the nearby Mukamira army camp and they set upon the Tutsi residents of Mukingo, attacked them in their homes and then launched an attack against the Busogo parish church where hundreds of Tutsi had fled for shelter.  The burning, looting and killing and sexual violence on these refugees raged all day.  And by that evening, virtually the entire Tutsi population of Busogo and Rwankeli secteurs in Mukingo commune had been destroyed.  

The coordination and enforcement from national authorities that had to be built up over days and weeks in order to accomplish genocide in the south and the west of the country had preceded 6th April by over a year in Mukingo.  Nzirorera had, in this place, mobilised the Interahamwe years in advance and they were already very well rehearsed, so much so, that by 8th April 1994, even before the MRND bureau executive got together with those military officers to install their interim government, MRND party leaders could rely on their network of authority and control over the Interahamwe to organise the killing and the raping that could destroy the Tutsi of Mukingo commune.  

By 14th April, Tutsi from the adjoining sous-préfecture of Busogo had been transported to the Ruhengeri court of appeal, ostensibly for their protection.  Nzirorera called upon Juvénal Kajelijeli and collaborated with military authorities, Augustin Bizimungu and Ephraim Setako to prepare a combined attack by soldiers and Interahamwe militiamen from Mukingo to finish up the Tutsi who had taken shelter at the Ruhengeri court of appeals.  Sometime thereafter, Joseph Nzirorera returned to his native Mukingo and commended a large assembly of the population, and specifically congratulated the Interahamwe for their fine work that they had undertaken in destroying the enemy in that area.  

The planning and coordination for the genocide was not limited to mobilising the militia, however.  These interim government ministers and political party leaders also laboured to legitimise the genocidal campaign among the entire Hutu population of their country, to sanitise it, make it look presentable abroad and to re-arm themselves and encourage the complicity of the outside world or (unintelligible) the outside world.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse travelled to Nairobi and Kinshasa and back to Rwanda on behalf of the government.  His objective; to legitimise and defend the murderous government and to seek outside support to prop it up.  He returned to Murambi in time to participate in another key government meeting on 17 May, when there was further discussion of the civil defence programme for heading off again.  

That 17th May meeting was also the occasion of Ngirumpatse's appointment as presidential advisor for external relations, a fitting title for the leader that was proposed to head the Abatabazi government delegation to the OAU submit in Tunis.  When that government fled to Gisenyi again, Ngirumpatse was again there.  They are always there, the three Accused.  They are always there at every crucial meeting, at every crucial location.  He was there, installed at the very nerve-centre of this meeting at the Meridien Hotel.  He had every opportunity to free the country, to denounce the killings; he did neither.  

In late-May Nzirorera went abroad on mission travelling to South Africa and the Seyshells via Zaire, in order to purchase weapons for the armed interim government, for this campaign against his enemies, which he clearly understood to be Rwanda Tutsi population.  Firearms eventually did arrive in Gisenyi.  They were transported into Rwanda from Goma, and they ended up in the hands of soldiers and militiamen that were dispatched to Kibuye to reinforce local authorities in their campaign against the last surviving Tutsi in Bisesero.  Nzirorera returned to Rwanda by mid-June.  And on 5th July, he was sworn in as president of the national assembly in Gisenyi, a symbolic move that clearly demonstrated his endorsement of the interim government.  He, too, could have fled the country or denounced the killings.  He did neither.  As a matter of fact, he did worse.  

Karemera may not have travelled abroad to defend the government, but he clearly demonstrated the presence of the MRND party in every significant interim government initiative.  He accompanied the interim government to Murambi and participated in their meetings and their decision making.  His voice was one of the strongest to rail against the Gitarama bourgmestre during the encounter with the Abatabazi government on 18th April.  

Karemera travelled with the interim government to Butare to depose the préfet.  During that same period, he accompanied minister of defence, Augustin Bizimana, to Ruhengeri and made a formal report on the devastation of the killings to the interim government.  He addressed the nation in radio interviews on behalf of the interim government, and traveled to Kibuye to participate in the pacification, so-called, meeting of 3rd May with Jean Kambanda.  

At every stage in the progression of the interim government's genocidal campaign, Karemera was there, with or without portfolio, he was there representing the government and the party, and just -- and demonstrating just how aligned and indistinguishable the two were.  When Karemera became minister of the interior on 25th May, he issued his memorandum to all préfets on the implementation of the prime minister's directives on civil defence.  This was simply one in a series of directives, telegrams and cabinet minutes, that document the interim government's genocidal policy of civil defence, and Karemera's extraordinarily personal role in articulating, disseminating and implementing and enforcing that policy.  There is a paper trail there which will be brought to the attention of the Court.  

Consider for the moment, Karemera's memorandum to all préfets of 25th of May, where he directs préfets to implement civil defence from the level of the cellule, and reminds them that all people be called upon to play a role.  Then there is Kibuye Préfet Clément Kayishema's memorandum to the minister of interior, Édouard Karemera, of 2nd June 1994, where he requests, "military enforcements to aid the population in patrolling the highlands."  And notes, "Rifles and ammunitions for the civilian population are urgently needed for Kibuye."  

And Karemera's handwritten notes from the cabinet meeting of 9 June 1994 record  "a decision taken to send a memorandum to the prime minister on progress made on self civil defence, drawing the government's attention to the impatience of the people who have been sufficiently mobilized to confront the enemy, but who are waiting for the green light from the soldiers."  

And then we have Clément Kayishema`s telegram of 3rd June to the minister of defence, copied to minister of interior, Karemera, "Regarding security matters in Bisesero secteur, Gishyita commune, the people of the area are ready to undertake a clean up operation in the interest of civil defence.  The operation will last four days, from 15 June 1994 to 18 June 1994." 

Following that, Karemera's handwritten minutes for the cabinet meeting of 17th June indicate "decision taken: government decided to intervene vigorously in Bisesero, if need be, with the support of Gisenyi by 20th June at the latest." After which he then wrote to Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva stating unequivocally, "The government has decided to request the operational secteur commander in Gisenyi, with support of the population, to support a cordon and search operation by the gendarmerie in Kibuye in the Bisesero area of Gishyita commune which had become a sanctuary for the RPF".  But as everybody knew, there was no RPF presence in that area.

Mabanza bourgmestre Ignace Bagirishema's letter to the Kibuye préfet Kayishema a few days later confirms that this action was taken when he states, categorically, "With reference to our conversation of Wednesday evening, 22nd June 1994, concerning the Interahamwe coming from Gisenyi to reinforce the attacks in Bisesero between 19th and 22nd June 1994, and who should have stopped at Mabanza in Rubengera centre to launch an attack there."

The government campaign in Bisesero is thus very well documented.  And this campaign was a joint criminal enterprise among similarly motivated political, government, business and military authorities.  

And this trial will accuse people before this Court who were the bureau executive of the MRND, and the nuclear core of that ruling -- of that party.  They were the strategists.  They exerted the political will.  They were at the coordinating authority for the military.  They dispatched emissaries abroad, including themselves to re-arm genocidal campaign, and to confound and confuse world opinion.  But they may not have foreseen, of course, this day, when they would have to answer for their own participation in those crimes.  They need to be held to account.  

They are persons who held positions of leadership and trust.  They bear even greater responsible for the pillage and killings and rapes than those unlettered militiamen who did their dirty work for them in 1994.  These are the men who implanted a genocidal reflex within the very fabric of state authority in Rwanda.  They presided over the networks of controlled coordination and mobilisation.  

Those networks were the remnants and the legacies of the MRND party state.  Today, the people we have before the Trial Chamber are the organisers, the planners, the strategists for the genocide, the pacification and civil defence programme.  

When Jean-Paul Akayesu and other Gitarama bourgmestre walked away from their meeting with the Abatabazi in Murambi on the 18th April, having received a clear message from Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera and the other party leaders, they carried with them a mandate from the government, from the interim government.  It was this mandate that Akayesu and the other bourgmestre then implemented.  

And in this trial, in the course of these proceedings, we will establish that those policies and the means to implement them came from men such as Édouard Karemera, from Mathieu Ngirumpatse, from Joseph Nzirorera and from others.  And as in the case of Akayesu, the persecution of the MRND -- of these members of the MRND bureau executive will draw upon testimony from some of the most vulnerable survivors of the campaign of destruction.  

Many of the women who will testify in this case may have escaped with their lives, but the genocidal campaign ravaged and defiled their bodies in a way that they have to live with for the rest of their lives.  Genocide is fundamentally a crime against a group, and what more devastating assault upon the group than to attack the women, the culture bearers, the nurturers of the community.  How does the besieged group cohere and survive the defiling of its progenitors, the women?  How symbolic and how utterly devastating that Tutsi women and men were attacked in their very reproductive organ.  Accounts of militiamen formed, trained, equipped and encouraged, directed by these Accused, striking at the genitalia of their victims abound.  

Tutsi women were vilified as enemies seductresses, coveted for their bodies, raped, mutilated, tortured, defiled, killed, maltreated in ever -- any -- in every imaginable way.  So while on the one hand evidence in this case centres heavily on matters of policy, which were linked to the Accused given the role in the bureau executive of the MRND, this trial will also explore that very uncomfortable personal tale of individual suffering.  

None of the victims may be able to point to the Accused in the courtroom as rapists, but the massive, widespread and systematic rapes throughout Rwanda were the products of these Accused people; the Accused are responsible for the consequences.  Marauding bands of Interahamwe militiamen and soldiers raped Tutsi women because the enterprise with these Accused and others fostered, encouraged that form of conduct.  The campaign of destruction demanded, permitted and it rewarded lawlessness.  And it was the policies of these -- that these Accused implemented that generated the momentum for the spiraling violence.  

In 1994 Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera aligned themselves with other Hutu Power politicians.  They joined them in a criminal collaboration with certain extremist military authorities and installed themselves as the Abatabazi, the so-called saviours of Rwanda.  But it was a very tortured and perverse notion of salvation.  They would redeem the Hutu nation by destroying and eradicating the Tutsi amongst them.  Thus, it was not a government of saviours, it was a government of killers; government of genocidaires.  And the evidence that the Prosecution will lead before this Court will reveal them clearly as such.  

In that respect we will be relying on the testimony of a number of factual witnesses, up to 80 or thereabouts, and five expert witnesses, who, at the end of the day, we are convinced will establish beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of these three Accused in respect of the serious crimes for which they stand indicted today.  

I thank Your Lordships for your attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

Yes, at this time will the Defence wish to make any opening statements?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  The Defence for Karemera should like to make a few observations.  I should also like to ask for a short adjournment of five minutes before we do that.   In fact, Mr. President, my client has an urgent situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He is permitted to leave.  

It is 10:30 now, and we can take a short recess, 10:35. 
(Court recessed from 1037H to 1102H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now.  Madam Diagne-Mbaye? 

Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  Very briefly, I have a few observations.  You have heard the Prosecution's opening statement.  As you, we had to listen to that.  I feel as if I am not in the right place, if you, like me, have observed to what extent that statement was a reply before any trial, before any evidence has been submitted, before any trial has taken place, that you will have to decide upon without listening to that first.  Rule 44 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, state that each party can make an opening statement after the Prosecution's opening statement.  This is an opportunity for the Defence; and it supposes a fair debate, a Prosecution which respects the rights of the Defence and respects the provisions of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

The Defence for Ngirumpatse must look at this situation now.  For seven years the Defence has been dealing with five different indictments, because the Prosecution has chosen to proceed slowly.  Each time the commencement of trial was programmed, they changed their thesis.  They said that this was to adapt to the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, but also -- and this is more surprising, to adapt to the Defence arguments by attempting to side step them and move around them.  Each time they have failed.  

And they have tried to side step the obstacles just like a horse who refuses to be ridden and throws off his rider.  For seven years the Prosecution has attempted to obtain advantage in the proceedings, always by acting at the last minute, by trying to ambush the, Defence, by using -- to tire the Defence by conducting investigations that are useless, and trumped up charges against the Accused.  

For seven years, again, and worse still, over the past two years, they have attempted to learn lessons from their first errors, the Prosecutor has attempted to orient and distort the witness's testimony.  And today they try to substitute themselves for the witnesses, to talk in their place, based on the lessons that they have learned in their past experience.

During the last pre-trial conference, we received notification that the Prosecution wanted to hear two new witnesses, one which was heard for over 600 hours.  We also were notified of the changes that they want to make to the witness's statements, which clearly show that these are all trumped up charges.  They are trying -- they have tried to side step looking for the authors of the plane crash.  The Prosecutor is still failing to fulfill its mission to contribute to true justice, and to contribute to reconciliation, and to be unbiased without prejudice, without no intentions -- without bad intentions. 

At the beginning of the session, there was an opening statement which has allegations which were not included in the indictment, nor in the pre-trial brief, which contained allegations and affirmations which have been contradicted by witnesses who he will call for the Prosecution.  Once again, this is, again, the sun going around the earth, because he is coming to conclusions ignoring everything that shows us to the contrary.  He is asking you to condemn the innocent.  

At the time when the Prosecution is beginning his trial, it does not know specifically what he will be defending himself against.  It is necessary that when we look at the indictment, as has been seen, we have the first statements, the opening statements by the Prosecution.  It is uncertain; it is varying its position, and the Prosecution is not respecting the provisions of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Everything that is said against the Defence, Mr. Prosecution, once again you have given us an explanation regarding Mr. Karemera and his profession as a lawyer.  Talking about what we ourselves have to say that he is innocent, because these are the Accused.  So, should we not have means to exercise our Defence in the respect of the equality of arms?  

It is this kind of trial that Mr. Ngirumpatse, having used the faculties and facilities provided to him by the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, will also make his opening statement as provided by the rules, and will also provide his own evidence when the Prosecutor will have necessarily failed in presenting his case.  

At that point in time, the Prosecutor will probably have deployed the efforts necessary for his mission, and for which, so far, he has been spectacularly failing, in order to say to the Chamber, that this is justice.  

I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Does any other Defence team wish to say anything?
  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Indeed, Mr. President, the Defence for Mr. Karemera wishes to make a statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Most obliged.  

We are gathered here this morning for the commencement of trial in the Karemera et al trial.  Allow me, on behalf of my entire team, to present my respects to your Honourable Chamber and thank you for giving me the opportunity to defend the interests of Édouard Karemera against the serious crimes for which he is accused.  

I should remind you, Mr. President, Your Honours, that an opening statement was made on behalf of the Accused person on the 22nd of November 2003.  That was given by my excellent colleague,              Mr. Skornicki.  We all remember his brilliant performance.  For us, it is still relevant and fresh.  And, naturally, our newly constituted team embraces it entirely.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, Édouard Karemera is here today.  He has been described by a Prosecution which is attempting, seven years after he was incarcerated, to portray him as one of the planners of the genocide.  In light of those serious allegations, it would be interesting to go over the respectable past history of Mr. Édouard Karemera.

Very young and very early, Édouard Karemera was remarked by the authorities in his country for his exceptional intellectual qualities, his openness of spirit, and his ability to unite all actors in a political scale, from all parts of society around what was essentially the development of Rwanda; where in 1990, the trend and the requirements of the international community is towards multi-party politics as described by the famous conference of La Baule.  As described, multi-party politics had to be practiced everywhere in Africa.  

Édouard Karemera, his past shows us, is very proud of having been chosen as the person to accomplish that task, to give body or substance to the vision of President Habyarimana, to achieve multi-party politics in Rwanda.  That is how on the 24th of September 1990, Édouard Karemera was appointed president of the national synthesis committee in charge of revising the constitution.  That committee included 30 members.  

He conducted popular consultations to know the view points of his compatriots with regard to the return of multi-party politics.  He explained to them all of the benefits.  Furthermore, he liked to talk about anecdotes that happened that day.  During that famous meeting of the synthesis committee, during the contact meeting with the members of the commission on the 4th of October 1990, the RPF once again attacked the country.  During the meeting there was total mayhem.

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: (continuing)
In that context, furthermore, from France, President Habyarimana, wanting to be reassuring, reiterated, in response to that new attack, that he was still committed to multiparty politics.  

Édouard Karemera speaks again.  He understands the urgency of the situation and the danger to the population of the repeated attacks by the RPF.   He was tasked, in the framework of that historic mission, as head of the synthesis committee.  He was given two years to finish the work.  He worked untiringly and relentlessly.  His mission would last for four months.  

He made a report at the end of his work.  It was unanimously supported by the Rwandan people.  His synthesis report included a draft constitution which would become the famous constitution of Rwanda of 10 June 1991, a draft bill on political parties, which would lead to the well-known law of 18 June 1991.  He turned politics in Rwanda on their head.  

Édouard Karemera -- he's with us today -- defended the different projects in parliament as a member of parliament, assisted in that by his wealth of experience as a former minister in charge of institutional relations.  The transition from the single party to multipartyism in Rwanda was his brainchild.  After that colossal work, and for an interim period, Édouard Karemera was the national secretary of the MRND.  

On the 5th of July 1991, the new statute of the MRND was signed.  This new party proudly showed its commitment to the multiparty state, and Édouard Karemera would become the national secretary.  We should now point out that this historical work allowed, at the same time, the creation of all the opposition parties in Rwanda.  That is why, looking back at his past, Édouard Karemera is proud, and that is why his Defence team, led by me, is proud to defend him.  

In September 1991, Édouard Karemera explained to the members of his party that the transition from the party state to multiparty politics meant that the parties could no longer benefit from state assets and subsidies.  Now, in spite of the ferocious resistance by certain members of the party, he once again succeeded, and he acknowledges this, with the help of the important assistance of 
President Habyarimana to make people accept the new deal.  

To finish his work, he would be with all of the opposition parties' participants in the government.  He would participate in a study trip to the United States, and elsewhere, to see concretely in the field, multipartyism at work.  History would judge this.  During that trip, he met in the United States, Allison Des Forges.  And I am counting on her to confirm that here before you.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, this is the history of the multiparty system in Rwanda, whose advent was orchestrated and made possible by one man, of course, supported and encouraged by party comrades who worked in good faith, who wanted it just as much as him.  This man, who, in front of this colossal task which has brilliantly succeeded, was given the name Rukusanya, which means "the unitor", "the synthesiser".  This is such a positive name that it is difficult for us to understand and accept why the Prosecutor hasn't explained the origin of it to you.  Worse still, they are trying to hide that and devoid it of its meaning.  That is why it is frightening to hear the Prosecutor assert, and I quote: "The situation which prevailed was such that the political party of -- that Habyarimana had formed and led, the MRND, is the same party whose leaders, before you today, felt threatened by the constitutional changes that made Rwanda, a single state, into a multiparty state.  That is how people, such as Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and Édouard Karemera used the state structure within the MRND to build a sense of anti -- anti-Tutsi sentiments within the population of Tutsis and Rwanda."  Transcripts for hearing of 27 November 2003.  

It is also frightening to hear the Prosecutor persist in their pre-trial brief of 27 June 2005 by asserting, and I quote: "Karemera played a crucial role in using the crisis.  He was one of the strategists in the party.  He gave explanations justifying the adoption of the constitution of 1991, and tried to legitimate it, which was in fact a military coup d'état, during which the government in place was decimated and replaced, to a large extent, by the government concocted by the MRND."  

This is how things have been distorted before you.  This is the reality.  I've just described it.  It is not contested, Mr. President, Your Honours.  That is the distortion the Prosecution is up to.  That is the theory of the Prosecution with regard to the planning of the genocide.  

With regard to the categoric assertions, we are in a position to ask ourselves if the Prosecution took the time to learn of the political situation in Rwanda prior to the tragic events of April 1994.  Are we speaking of the same years, the same Rwanda, the same facts, Mr. President?  Are we speaking about the same people?  Naturally, when there is a false premise, as his past has shown, when you look at his concrete actions, those of Édouard Karemera, the Prosecution's theory falls by the wayside.  Between us, Mr. President, this man who has just been described always trying to move things forward, could this be the same man that the Prosecution is describing?  This man with profound convictions, could he be the same man to plan, incite the genocide, this man who did everything to try to develop his country, Rwanda?  How could he have planned a genocide; how?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Diagne-Mbaye?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Excuse me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would facilitate the translation and recording of your presentation (French spoken) --
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- a little slower.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I gave a copy to the interpreters.  I don't know whether this helped, but I do apologise.  I will try and slow down, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I was saying, how was he able to conceptualise and plan a genocide to the extent that he was unable to prevent the death of his relatives and parents, both of whom died on the way to exile in neighbouring Zaire?  How come he was unable to think about planning the genocide and foresee the present conditions under which his family is living?  The decency -- decency stops from me from evoking them here.  

However, Mr. President, Your Honours, I am convinced that none of the facts that I'm mentioning here is -- the Prosecutor is aware of all of them.  If, as you and ourselves, the Prosecutor wanted to shed light on facts which happened in Rwanda in this terrible year of 1994, if he is aware, as he had said - as he has said in his brief, that the trigger to the Rwandan tragedy in 1994, and a year which characterises the temporal jurisdiction of this Tribunal, and the assassination of 
President Habyarimana, he must tell us here and now how and when he is going to open investigations or a trial on this matter.  The people of Rwanda, the world needs to know.  In the search for the truth, which we must have, we need to be told the truth.  It's seven years that -- since Édouard Karemera has been languishing in prison, far away from everyone and from the whole world, especially his family.  He has not been able to visit the grave of his parents, and he has not been able to offer the most minimum, in other words, a decent burial.  This wouldn't have been shocking if he had not been innocent, but if we know that he Prosecution has written five indictments containing, each time, several variations regarding the facts.  The Prosecutor, do you know exactly why you are having Mr. Édouard Karemera to be prosecuted when we know that your task -- most of their witnesses have miraculously appeared in the years 2004, 2005, ten years after the facts.  We know that most of these witnesses have already appeared in trials of other accused before this Tribunal, and they have never, and I repeat, never mentioned the name of Édouard Karemera.  Did you ask yourselves why?  Because they don't know him?  Because Édouard Karemera was not there?  Because Édouard Karemera had never been there?  Because in 2004, for some, or 2005, for others, they had received the instructions to implicate him?  But with what bargaining, and what kind of bargaining are you using?  I am stopping myself for -- from thinking about this.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, from indictment to indictment the facts vary, and so do the dates.  The allegations that you have been asked to strike out due to defects in the form -- let me only mention the one of 
23rd February 2004 -- you re-introduced them surreptitiously, but rapidly, in another indictment.  Let's mention that one of the 24th August 2005.  Here, I wish to mention the presence of Édouard Karemera in Bisesero.  And from the magic of your various -- the variations that you have introduced, he is to be found as the chief of operations on the ground through witnesses, who have suddenly appeared ten years after.  Does your conscience allow you to condemn an innocent person who has rendered such service to his country?  Do you really think that the Chamber here, which is listening to us and listening to you, will follow you in this dangerous and unjust path?  Is it in this way that you intend to implement the desire of the whole world expressly recalled in the statute of the Tribunal, in other words, the reconciliation of the Rwandan people?  

Mr. Prosecutor, you are the one who said in your opening statements of the 27 November 2003, and I quote: "These refugees who were outside Rwanda wanted to come back home, and -- but 
President Habyarimana and his government stopped them, and, therefore, they established the RPF, and they tried to force their return home through armed struggle."  

Now, Mr. Presi -- Mr. Prosecutor, if there is to longer any doubt of the responsibility of the assassination of President Habyarimana by the RPF, when there is no longer doubt that that is the reason for the widespread mayhem which appeared in Rwanda in 1994 and led to the tragic events of April 1994, why in that case, have you not brought to trial -- and you probably will never be able to do this -- not even one member of the RPF for whom you have allowed recognition of responsibility for the Rwandan tri -- tragedy?  Would you be able to accuse anybody in the world?  Why have you not, as you have been allowed by article -- by Rule 28 of the rules of the Tribunal, the disclosure of the Bruguière report?  Because you already know that the RPF is fully responsible for the death of Habyarimana, and -- from what happened in Rwanda before and after the events of April 1994.  Why, when the Defence is trying to make efforts, you are opposed to this with all your energy?  Why are you placing obstructions before the manifestations of the truth on the Rwandan tragedy?  

No, you are finding refugees -- refuge behind what is known as joint criminal enterprise, showing thus your inability to find any proof for the serious allegations you have made against the Accused about genocide.  You are unable to find the moral element to support your thesis.  This intellectual, inadmissible notion in law, you are using it today in order to condemn the Accused.  But, Mr. Prosecutor, please do not go wrong.  Joint criminal enterprise, which you are trying to make a theory, will not be -- would not be able to validate collective responsibility, which is unacceptable in criminal law.  You have to prove individual responsibility for all the Accused -- for each Accused, as has been requested by the Chamber in the Brajdanin case, and I quote: "Beyond any reasonable doubt, whether the Accused had an arrangement or agreed with the other material perpetrators in order to commit a crime which is finally committed, or if the crime committed by the material perpetrators is a foreseeable consequence of a crime."  In other words, you have to prove the material facts, to prove the criminal intent of the Accused in being part of a collective plan, and you have to also show the nexus connecting these Accused to the said crimes.  You have to do this throughout the trial.  

My last words go to the Chamber on behalf of Mr. Édouard Karemera.  He had asked me to tell you, Your Honours, that he has serious requests regard -- with regard to the fairness of the trial which we are beginning today.  He has also asked me to ensure that you consider the claims that he will make in these days to come.  

And I thank you for having given me the floor to express these wills.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne-Mbaye.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Pursuant to Rule 84, we would like to have the opportunity to reserve our opening statements until the beginning of the Defence case.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Leave is granted.  

Well, be -- I think we've completed our -- our programme for today.  Tomorrow morning we commence hearing the evidence, and we have the facility of courtroom -- the Laity Kama courtroom on the fourth floor, and we will be resuming there tomorrow.  So we take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1134H)
