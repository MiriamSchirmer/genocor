         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  

         3        

         4        Could the registry introduce the matter coming before 

         5        the Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         6   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         7        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         8        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston 

         9        Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, 

        10        is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 

        11        3rd of December 2002, for the continuation of the 

        12        Defence case, when Defence counsel, Mr. Hinds, will 

        13        conduct the examination-in-chief of Mr. Nzirorera, in 

        14        the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli.   

        15        Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

        16        

        17        Thank you, Mr. President.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for registry.  

        19        

        20        May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with 

        21        the Prosecution for the record, please.

        22   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases.  I am Ken Fleming.  I 

        23        appear with Ms. Ojemeni, trial attorney and that with 

        24        Ms. Marotine, case manager.  Thank you.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 

        26        the appearance of the Defence, please, for the record.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds 

        28        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor 

        29        Bompaka, Mr. Emilien Dusabe, who is interpreter, 

        30        Ms. Juliette Chinaud, who is my assistant.  We also have

         1        independent counsel for Mr. Nzirorera, and I will let 

         2        him introduce himself for the record.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you, Counsel. 

         4   MR. ROBINSON: Yes, good morning, Mr. President, members of 

         5        the trial Chamber.  My name is Peter Robinson, I am from 

         6        California in the United States and I am the lead 

         7        counsel for the witness, Joseph Nzirorera.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         9   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, do I understand that Mr. Robinson 

        10        claims to be appearing on behalf of the witness.  If so, 

        11        we would have an objection to that.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we understand counsel is here to sort 

        13        of watching brief to assist the witness, if need be.

        14   MR. FLEMING: And Your Honours, what do you understand that 

        15        assistance to be?  Is it to intervene on the witness's 

        16        behalf on the record, or is it to give advice?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: To advise.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Yes, and we would be submitting that that's the 

        19        role, to advise; it's not to object, for example, to a 

        20        question that I might ask or indeed a question that my 

        21        learned friend, Professor Hinds might ask, but rather to 

        22        advise from time to time if the witness requires that 

        23        advice.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Particularly in terms of Rule 90(E)

        25   MR. FLEMING: Yes. 

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, may I be heard on this?

        27        

        28        Your Honour, the parties, and I think Mr. Robinson in 

        29        particular, filed a motion in which he made an 

        30        application to the Court -- I don't want to speak for 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        2



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        him -- but he filed a motion and set forward the basis 

         2        upon which Mr. Nzirorera and his rights ought to be 

         3        protected at these proceedings.  The Court ruled and, in 

         4        fact, granted his motion to be here and, in fact, to 

         5        represent Mr. Nzirorera's interest.  That necessarily 

         6        means that if there are issues in which he believes that 

         7        his client's rights are compromised, given the fact that 

         8        his client is not an ordinary witness.  We do not have 

         9        an ordinary witness in the witness box.  We have someone 

        10        who is accused before this particular Tribunal, and 

        11        there are complex issues that may arise from that.  And 

        12        it seems to me that Mr. Robinson will have to have the 

        13        right, if any questions are put, before answers are, in 

        14        fact, given to interpose whatever action is deemed 

        15        appropriate in order to protect his client's rights.  

        16        Obviously, Mr. Robinson cannot sit mute if his client's 

        17        rights are in fact being jeopardised.  I mean, I don't 

        18        want to speak for him, but I certainly think that the 

        19        role as perceived by Mr. Fleming is -- I don't know what 

        20        he perceives in terms of advice -- is narrowly 

        21        construed, but I will let Mr. Robinson address that.

        22   MR. ROBINSON: Yes, Your Honours, I think perhaps this issue 

        23        is best dealt with as the testimony unfolds and the need 

        24        arises for my intervention, I would try to be as 

        25        restrained as possible, but if it's necessary for me to 

        26        consult with Mr. Nzirorera before he answers the 

        27        question or to bring a matter to the attention of the 

        28        Chamber, I would like the opportunity to do that and I  

        29        hope not to abuse that.  Thank you.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         1   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, may I respond very briefly? 

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         3   MR. FLEMING: There is a misconception in what my learned 

         4        friend has said, that this is not an ordinary witness.  

         5        This, indeed, is an ordinary witness who has rights 

         6        under the Rules to protect him, for example, maybe the 

         7        right against self-incrimination.  They are the rights 

         8        that he has.  Your Honours adequately protect every 

         9        other witness in respect of that and this witness is the 

        10        same.  

        11        

        12        And as for my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, saying that 

        13        he is entitled to intervene, we still oppose that and 

        14        we'll continue to do so as the situation arises.  

        15        Thank you, Your Honours.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        17   MR. ROBINSON: Yes, Your Honour, I just wish to make one final 

        18        point on this and I think we should proceed without 

        19        further delay.  And that is, of course, that you can 

        20        tell that my concern on behalf of my client is that this 

        21        questioning here, when he is coming to assist the Court 

        22        in its fact finding on this case, not turns into some 

        23        kind of advantage for the Prosecutor to learn what Mr. 

        24        Nzirorera would say in his defence when his own trial 

        25        comes.  And so, that is my concern, and I would like to 

        26        be able to act on that concern, if necessary.  

        27        Thank you.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the Rules are very clear.  We'll see how 

        29        things develop on the ground.

         1        All right, your next witness, Professor Hinds.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: The Defence calls Joseph Nzirorera.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can you let him make the solemn 

         4        declaration.

         5        (Declaration made by the witness, Joseph Nzirorera, in 

         6        Kinyarwanda) 

         7        

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: And we take it that this witness knows how his 

         9        evidence is going to be taken here, so, you can proceed, 

        10        Counsel.

        14                      testified as follows:

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        17   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, we will show you a document -- first of 

        18        all, you are speaking in French or in English?

        19   A.   I'm speaking in French.

        20   Q.   We'll show you a document; it is in English.  If you 

        21        have any difficulties in understanding what is written 

        22        on it there, you can ask for assistance, but this 

        23        document has your personal particulars.   If it is 

        24        accurate, we would like you to sign it and date it and 

        25        return it to me?

        26   A.   I recognise this document.

        27   Q.   Can you sign the document and date it, if the document 

        28        is accurate?

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Defence tender this 

        30        document as Defendant Exhibit 34.

         2   MR. FLEMING:  No objection.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Let the document, I suppose, contained 

         4        the personal particulars of the witness be tendered as 

         5        Defence Exhibit No. 34; Thirty-four.

         6       (Exhibit No. D34 admitted)

        10   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera could you --

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Should we have the document marked 

        12        confidential?  Is it?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, this is -- the witness obviously is 

        14        testifying as a -- not as a protected witness.  So, it 

        15        does not have to be sealed.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Go ahead, Counsel.

        17   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, could you tell the Trial Chamber where 

        19        you were born; that is, the cellule, secteur and 

        20        commune?

        21   A.   Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  My name is 

        22        Joseph Nzirorera.  I was born on the 18th of April 1950 

        23        at Busogo -- Busogo secteur, I mean, Mukingo commune. 

        24        Mukingo is spelt, M-U-K-I-N-G-O, in Ruhengeri 

        25        préfecture.

        26   Q.   And how long did you live at that location?

        27   A.   First of all, during my childhood I lived there with my 

        28        parents.  Subsequently, I went into primary school, and 

        29        this was around 1964.  I was a student at the secondary 

        30        school as a  boarder.  Therefore, I remained there with

         1        my parents, because during the holidays I had to go back 

         2        home with my parents.

         3   Q.   Did you change locations of your residence at some point 

         4        after your secondary school?

         5   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Microphone for the witness, please.

         6   THE WITNESS: After my secondary school education, I went for 

         7        university studies.  I was at the National University of 

         8        Rwanda.  There I have a diploma in mathematics and 

         9        physics, subsequently, I also obtained another diploma 

        10        in civil engineering.  I concluded my university studies 

        11        in 1975.

        12   Q.   And at the time that you completed your advanced studies 

        13        in civil engineering in 1975, where did you reside?

        14   A.   I was still living in my commune of origin.

        15   Q.   Witness, are you married?  And do you have children?

        16   A.   I am married and I am a father of six children.  

        17        Unfortunately, my wife died in 1997.

        18   Q.   Witness, after you were -- after you had completed your 

        19        degree in civil engineering, were you employed in any 

        20        capacity?  And if so, could you tell the Trial Chamber, 

        21        dealing with your first employment?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: We haven't heard from him exactly what 

        23        engineering he got.  You were calling it civil 

        24        engineering, can you have the witness confirm that?

        25   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        26   Q.   What was your degree in engineering?  I though I heard 

        27        civil.


        28   A.   I thank you, Mr. President.  Indeed, I am in the civil 

        29        engineering profession, and my speciality is 

        30        construction and this is what is known as civil

         1        construction.

         2   Q.   Witness, after you obtained your degree in civil 

         3        engineering, can you tell this Tribunal what types of 

         4        employment you had, starting with your first employment?

         5   A.   Thank you, Counsel.  In 1975 at the end of my studies, I 

         6        was employed as an engineer and I was secretary for 

         7        administration at the ministry of public works and 

         8        equipment.  That was the name it was known by at the 

         9        time when I was recruited in November 1975.  In June 

        10        1976, I was appointed director general, head of the 

        11        department of roads and bridges within that same 

        12        ministry.  I held that position for approximately five 

        13        years until March 1991.  In March 1991, I was appointed 

        14        Minister for Public Works and Energy.  I remained 

        15        minister in that ministry from March 1991 until July 

        16        1990 -- I do beg your pardon, the first year was '81.  I 

        17        held the ministerial portfolio and I was appointed  

        18        minister for industry, mines and craft.  I held that 

        19        position of Minister for Industry until the 30th of 

        20        December 1991, the date upon which I left the 

        21        government.  

        22        

        23        During that period also, politically, from 1986, I was a 

        24        member of the central committee of the MRND party, the 

        25        national revolutionary movement for development, the 

        26        former single party.  I held that post from 1986 until 

        27        1991.  During that period of time also from 1991, 

        28        always, up till 1994, I was a member of parliament in 

        29        what was originally known as the national development 

        30        council.  With the advent of multi-partysm in 1992, I

         1        joined the new party, the MRND, the Republican National 

         2        Movement for democracy and Development, which was 

         3        established on the 5th of July 1991.  I joined that 

         4        party.  I am amongst the founders of the party.  And in 

         5        1992, I came back into the political arena, first of 

         6        all, being a member of the préfectural committee of 

         7        Ruhengeri préfecture.  During the same year, 1992, in 

         8        April of that year, I was elected member of the national 

         9        committee of the MRND party, the new MRND party, because 

        10        we were here in the multiparty era.  And in July 1993, 

        11        during the national congress of the MRND, I was elected 

        12        national secretary general of the MRND party.  

        13        

        14        And in 1994, after the assassination of President 

        15        Habyarimana, the former president of the national 

        16        council for national development Théodore Sindikubwabo 

        17        was appointed interim president of the government and a 

        18        few days later, I was elected speaker of the national 

        19        government to succeed Dr. Sindikubwabo.  I thank you, 

        20        Mr. President, Your Honours.

        21   Q.   Witness, do you know, Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        22   A.   Yes, Counsel.  I know Juvénal Kajelijeli very well, 

        23        first of all, as someone from my commune and then he is 

        24        my peer.  Maybe I am a year or two older than he is.

        25   Q.   When did you first make acquaintance of Mr. Kajelijeli?

        26   A.   As I have just told you, he hails from my commune and I 

        27        knew him when we were still in primary school.

        28   Q.   Did you know him when he was appointed and elected to 

        29        office in Mukingo commune?

        30   A.   Yes, I knew him, because as I have said, Mukingo was my

         1        own commune.  I knew Kajelijeli.  He was an accountant 

         2        for the Mukingo commune office from 1980 up until 1988 

         3        and from 1988 until 1993, I believe in the month of 

         4        March of that year, if my memory serves me right.  From 

         5        1988 until 1993, he was bourgmestre of that commune.  I 

         6        thank you.

         7   Q.   Do you know what happened in March of 1993 with respect 

         8        to his continued service as bourgmestre?

         9   A.   In 1993, Juvénal Kajelijeli was dismissed as 

        10        bourgmestre.

        11   Q.   Do you know the circumstances under which he was 

        12        dismissed as bourgmestre?

        13   A.   Could you repeat?

        14   Q.   Do you know the circumstances under which he was 

        15        dismissed as bourgmestre in March of 1993?

        16   A.   Yes, I am somewhat aware.  You know that from 1990 until 

        17        1994, Rwanda was at war with the RPF.  At a given point 

        18        in time, the RPF requested that there be a change or a 

        19        replacement of certain authorities within the communes, 

        20        within préfecture.  It asked for change amongst the 

        21        authorities of the communes and this included 

        22        Kajelijeli.  The Rwandan government, which was in 

        23        negotiation with this front, had requested that 

        24        justification be provided but, however, the government 


        25        accepted the request made by the RPF and Kajelijeli was 

        26        removed from his office at that time.  I thank you.

        27   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, could you identify Juvénal Kajelijeli for 

        28        this Tribunal if you saw him in Court today?

        29   A.   I think that is a very easy question because we lived 

        30        side by side in the cells at the UNDP, but I can

         1        recognise him if you so wish.

         2   Q.   Yes, for the record, can you point out Mr. Kajelijeli 

         3        indicating what he is wearing, whether he is wearing 

         4        glasses or not, the cloth he is wearing, where he is 

         5        sitting and if he is sitting next to anyone?  You could 

         6        stand if you want.

         7   A.   Yes, I can see Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli.  He is behind 

         8        Counsel Hinds.  He is in a black suit and he is wearing 

         9        spectacles.  He is sitting next to a white lady.  He is 

        10        seated at the second row.  I don't believe I'm mistaken.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: With one minor modification, I think Ms. NOR 

        12        does not want to be called a white lady, but he has 

        13        identified the defendant in the Court.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Now, Witness, has Juvénal Kajelijeli, to your knowledge, 

        17        ever been a member of the MRND?

        18   A.   Kajelijeli was never a member of the MRND party, at 

        19        least the new MRND, because prior to that we had the 

        20        single party, but the new MRND party, Kajelijeli was 

        21        never a member of that party.

        22   Q.   Was Kajelijeli ever a leader of the MRND either at the 

        23        préfectural level, the communal level, the secteur level 

        24        or the cellule level?

        25   A.   Since he was not a member of that party, he could not 

        26        occupy any position within the party.

        27   Q.   Were there ever any elections of the leadership of the 

        28        préfet at the préfet level for the MRND after multiparty 

        29        system was established in 1991?  Was there ever an 

        30        election for the leadership at the préfet level?

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   Yes, Counsel.  By leave of the Chamber, I would say that 

         2        from the onset of multi-partysm and, in particular, 

         3        after the adoption of the new constitution on the 10th 

         4        of June 1991, the MRND party held constitutional 

         5        assembly; in other words, multi-partysm enabled the 

         6        establishment of new political parties.  The law 

         7        governing political parties authorised all Rwandans, who 

         8        so wish, to come together and with a minimum of 30 

         9        individuals, to form a political party.  People came 

        10        together, in order to create the political party known 

        11        as the MRND.  We called it the new MRND and the 

        12        constituent assembly of that party took place on the 5th 

        13        of July 1991. 

        14   Q.   Now --

        15   A.   That party was registered as a political party.  

        16        Subsequently, it restructured itself.  Therefore, we had 

        17        to have elections at préfectural level -- firstly, at 

        18        commune level, at préfectural level and then at national 

        19        level.  I thank you.

        20   Q.   Now, Mr. Nzirorera, as a consequence of the 

        21        establishment of multiparty party system, did there come 

        22        a time when a constitution, a constitution for MRND was 

        23        prepared?

        24   A.   Are you referring to the MRND constitution?  Or could 

        25        you be a bit more clear.

        26   Q.   As a result of multiparty system, did there come a time 

        27        when the new statute for the formation of the MRND was 

        28        promulgated and signed by individuals?

        29   A.   Yes, that is when the party was created.  The party had 

        30        a manifesto and statutes and it's these statutes that 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        12



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        the founders of the MRND signed on the 5th of July 1991, 

         2        and I know the document very well because I was a 

         3        signatory of it.  And after the party was established, 

         4        it was registered at the ministry of interior in July.  

         5        Therefore, the statute and the manifesto do exist and 

         6        that's what we signed on the 5th of July 1991.

         7   Q.   And was that document registered as an official 

         8        document?

         9   A.   Yes, the document, the statute of each political party, 

        10        was registered with the ministry of the interior.  And 

        11        if my memory serves me right, the MRND party was 

        12        registered on the 31st of July 1991 and its statute was 

        13        published in the national gazette of the republic of 

        14        Rwanda the following month.

        15   Q.   Witness, was Juvénal Kajelijeli a signatory either at 

        16        the préfet level or at the commune level of that 

        17        founding document for the MRND?

        18   A.   The statute of the MRND was signed in Kigali on the 5th 

        19        of July.  I remember this because, as I said, I was a 

        20        signatory and I was minister at the time, and 

        21        Mr. Kajelijeli was not there and he was not one of the 

        22        signatories either.

        23   Q.   The individuals who were all signatories of this 

        24        document, has that been recorded?

        25   A.   Yes, I have said that the statute of the MRND party was 

        26        signed in public.  They were registered with the 

        27        ministry of the interior and they were even signed 

        28        before the notary of the Rwandan republics.  So, the 

        29        names indeed appear on the document and the signatories, 

        30        the founders of the party, signed it at the same time as

         1        the constitution. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: I'd like to show the witness this document 

         3        to see if he recognises it.  Show it to Mr. Fleming.

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, I would like you to take your time and 


         6        look at that document and can you tell the Trial Chamber 

         7        whether you recognise it?  And if so, how do you 

         8        recognise it?

         9   A.   Thank you, Mr. President.  I am able to recognise the 

        10        document.  It is the official gazette of the Republic of 

        11        Rwanda.  And this official gazette was published 

        12        regularly to inform the public about ministerial orders, 

        13        presidential orders, laws that have been promulgated, 

        14        make this known to the public given the fact that 

        15        ignorance of the law is no excuse.  This is published 

        16        officially.

        17   Q.   Witness, can you describe the contents of the document 

        18        that is before you?

        19   A.   I realised that the gazette contains ministerial orders, 

        20        registration of political parties, specifically the 

        21        MRND.  I can also see the MDR, PSD, but it is the MRND, 

        22        and as I said earlier on, I can also find the statute of 

        23        the MRND party.  I also find in here the signatories of 

        24        the statute, signatories from the various préfectures, 

        25        particularly the Ruhengeri préfecture.  I can see a 

        26        whole number of people, including my own self.  

        27        Thank you, Mr. President.

        28   Q.   Now, Witness, I would like you to focus on the 

        29        signatories from the préfecture of Ruhengeri.  Looking 

        30        at that page, is Juvénal Kajelijeli listed there as one

         1        of the signatories?

         2   A.   Thank you, Counsel.  The name of Kajelijeli does not 


         3        appear here and, as I said earlier, I was present, I 

         4        signed myself.  I know Kajelijeli was not there, so, he 

         5        couldn't have sign.

         6   Q.   Now, of the individuals who signed this document, how 

         7        many from the préfecture of Ruhengeri were signatories 

         8        from Mukingo?  How many individuals?  If you look at the 

         9        document, does the document, in fact, identify the 

        10        communes from which each of the signatories resided?

        11   A.   I see the Ruhengeri préfecture, the names of the 

        12        signatories of Ruhengeri préfecture, but I cannot see 

        13        the communes against the names.

        14   Q.   Could you look at page 1006 in the document?  Can you 

        15        find it?

        16   A.   On page 1006, I see Kibongo commune, then the names and 

        17        the communes.

        18   Q.   Okay.  Now, do you see the names of individuals who were 

        19        signatories from Mukingo -- I'm sorry, page 1004?  My 

        20        apologies, Mr. Nzirorera.

        21   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Microphone, please.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Microphone.

        23   THE WITNESS:  I am sorry, Mr. President.  On page 1004 at the 

        24        top, I see Ruhengeri préfecture and then Mukingo 

        25        commune, I see some names, including Mukasine, Louise 

        26        Antoinette, Niyoyita Jean Damascéne, Nzirorera Joseph, 

        27        Miheto Jérome, Nyirampunga Béatrice, Semahane Félicién, 

        28        Ziragobora Joseph and Bakuzakundi Michel.  So, on that 

        29        page, at least, they have the communes, including the 

        30        Mukingo commune.

         1   MR. KIYEYEU: I'm sorry, My Lord, if the witness can help to 

         2        spell out the names for the record.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Witness, could you spell out the names, for the record, 

         5        starting with Mukasine Louise Antoinette?

         6   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, if the document is going in, the 

         7        names would be there.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I have no objection.  I think that the 

         9        registry wanted it done.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: But the problem we have is for the recorders. 

        11   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Your Honour's microphone, please. 

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the problem that could be there is for 

        13        the recorders who would like to have the names also put 

        14        in the record.  I think we can have it run as fast as 

        15        possible.

        16   THE WITNESS: Thank you, Mr. President.  Those who hailed from 

        17        the Mukingo commune are as follows: Mukasine is  

        18        M-U-K-A-S-I-N-E, Mukasine, Louis Antoinette; Niyoyita, 

        19        N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A, Niyoyita Jean Damascéne.  And there is 

        20        Nzirorera, Joseph, N-Z-I-R-O-R-E-R-A; Miheto, Jérome, 

        21        Moiety is M-I-H-E-T-O, Jérome;  Nyirampunga Béatrice, 

        22        Nyirampunga is N-Y-I-R-A-M-P-U-N-G-A, Nyirampunga, 

        23        Béatrice, Semahane Félicién, Semahane, S-E-M-A-H-A-N-E, 

        24        Félicién; there is Ziragobora Joseph, Ziragobora is 

        25        Z-I-R-G-O-B-O-R-A (sic), and finally, Bakuzakundi 

        26        Michel, B-A-K-U-Z-A-K-U-N-T-I, (sic) Bakuzakundi, 

        27        Michel.  Thank you, Mr. President.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we move the document and have 

        30        it -- we would like to have it marked as Defendant's

         1        Exhibit 35.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection from the Prosecution?

         3   MR. FLEMING: No objection.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: No objection.  So, how do you describe that 

         5        document, Learned Counsel?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: The document is an official gazette of the 

         7        Republic of Rwanda.  It's dated -- well, it is in two 

         8        languages, in Kinyarwanda and in French.  It is dated -- 

         9        it is dated August 15th, '91.  

        10        

        11        We would like to make a full application, Your Honour.  

        12        The document was previously introduced in the Ntagerura 

        13        trial and the procedure that was used was that the 

        14        registry was asked to copy the document, because the 

        15        document a bit tattered.  If it could be copied and that 

        16        the copy then be used as the exhibit with the original 

        17        being returned.  We would appreciate that.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Return to who?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: To us. 

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: What do the Prosecution say on this?

        21   MR. FLEMING: We have no objection provided it is verified in 

        22        some way, Your Honours. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, it has got to be verified. 

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: It would be verified by the registry.  They 

        25        are copying it, not us.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Let the document as described by 

        27        Counsel be admitted as Defence Exhibit 35; Three-five, 

        28        and that the photocopies of the said document shall be 

        29        made by the registry and certified by the registry in 

        30        comparison to the original and that the certified copy

         1        of that exhibit shall be the one to be kept for the 

         2        record of these proceedings.

         3        (Exhibit No. D35 admitted)

         4   MR. FLEMING: And may we have a copy, Your Honours?  We 

         5        haven't received a copy of that document.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And after that has been done, verified 

         7        and done, then the original copy, which we are told is 

         8        not good form may be return to the Defence and copies be  

         9        made available to the Prosecution after the process.

        10   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  May we see, once my 

        11        learned friend is finished with the document, may we see 

        12        the document for our own purposes for cross-examination?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: We have no objection, and I believe that the 

        14        Prosecution is entitled to the document.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        16   MR. KIYEYEU:  The registry has taken note, My Lord.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And, if need be, or steps could be taken 

        18        to have the verification done by the registry and in 

        19        consultation with any person they may deem fit to 

        20        certify to the correctness of the document that is going 

        21        to be made.

        22   MR. KIYEYEU: We have also taken note, My Lord.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right.  Yes, go on, Counsel.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        25   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        26   Q.   Witness, you testified about elections that were taken 

        27        at the préfectural level of Ruhengeri sometime after 

        28        1991.  Do you recall what was the date of those 

        29        elections?

        30   A.   Thank you.  As I said a while ago, when the party was 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        18



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        set up 5th July 1991, we organised elections within the 

         2        party, starting with what is called the grassroots 

         3        organs all the way to the national organs of the party.  

         4        And by 1992, we had officials of the party and we 

         5        organised elections.  There was a congress and after the 

         6        congress, there were the various organs, particularly 

         7        the communal committee, préfectural committees and the 

         8        national committee.  What I would like to point out is 

         9        this, that all these elections took place in the course 

        10        of the year 1992, and more specifically in Ruhengeri, in 

        11        February 1992, the elections were held for the 

        12        préfecture committee of which I was a member.  Thank 

        13        you.

        14   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know how many people contested the 

        15        positions for leadership at the préfectural level in 

        16        Ruhengeri for the MRND in 1992?  How many candidates?

        17   A.   Are you referring to elections at the préfecture level?

        18   Q.   Yes.

        19   A.   Préfecture elections -- the préfecture -- the Ruhengeri 

        20        préfecture congress was to elect 20 members who were to 

        21        constitute what is referred to as the préfecture 

        22        committee.  And the préfecture committee, together with 

        23        the national committee, is referred to as the 

        24        préfectural committees.  And this committee also elected 

        25        the executive committee, and I was the vice-president of 

        26        that préfectural executive committee.  During those 

        27        elections, there were about 40 candidates, and if my 

        28        memory serves me well, I would say there were 47, and 

        29        the congress had to select 20 from among those 

        30        candidates.  So, 20 people were elected on that 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        19



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        occasion.  And, as I said, I was elected as one of those 

         2        20 people and the préfecture committee was elected -- 

         3        préfecture executive committee was elected, four 

         4        members; president, vice-president, secretary and a 

         5        fourth person -- and a treasurer.

         6   Q.   Was Juvénal Kajelijeli -- did he either stand for 

         7        election or was he elected to any position at that time 

         8        in 1992?

         9   A.   Juvénal Kajelijeli was not among the candidates.  He, 

        10        therefore, would not be elected.  He was not even one of 

        11        the electors.

        12   Q.   Now, Witness, were the results of that election 

        13        promulgated in any organ or anywhere?

        14   A.   All elections were public.  All elections were public, 

        15        and generally, there would be a committee in charge of 

        16        supervising the elections.  And since the elections were 

        17        public, they were also accessible to the press, state 

        18        press and private press.  So, the results were published 

        19        in the various local newspapers and on radio.  But 

        20        within the MRND, we know that these results were 

        21        published official in the private as well as in state 

        22        press.  And that was one of the hallmarks of the 

        23        multiparty system in Rwanda at the time.

        24   Q.   Do you know a publication by the name of Umurwanashyaka?

        25   A.   I know the newspaper Umurwanashyaka.

        26   Q.   And could you tell the Tribunal what was this newspaper?

        27   A.   The newspaper Umurwanashyaka is one of the papers in 

        28        circulation at the time.  And I know this one more 

        29        specifically, because it was published -- it was 

        30        published bi-monthly and the editorial body -- some of 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        the members of the editorial body were members of the 

         2        MRND.  The newspaper, therefore, would be interested in 

         3        the results of the election.  So, I know the 

         4        Umurwanashyaka newspaper and copies of it must be in the 

         5        archives of the MRND.

         6   Q.   Do you know whether or not the results of the 

         7        préfectural committee elections --

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you spell out the name, please, 

         9        Umurwanashyaka?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do you want me to spell it out, Your Honour, 

        11        or the witness?

        12   THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I will spell that. 

        13        Umurwanashyaka is U-M-U-R-W-A-N-A-S-H-Y-A-K-A, 


        14        Umurwanashyaka.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I am sorry 

        15        about that lapse.  

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Go on, Counsel.

        18   Q.   The last question I put to you Mr. Nzirorera is: Whether 

        19        or not you knew that the results of the publication, or 

        20        the results of the elections, were published in the MRND 

        21        newspaper?  Do you know whether it was?

        22   A.   That is correct.

        23   Q.   I would like to show you a document and ask you whether 

        24        or not -- a copy of the document -- and ask you whether 

        25        or not you recognise this. 

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Show it to Mr. Fleming.

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, I will show you a document and I would 

        29        like to ask you whether or not you recognise that 

        30        document?

         1   A.   Yes, Mr. President, I recognise this newspaper.  I 

         2        recognise the cover page.  I can even see that it's a 

         3        special edition, special edition for the elections, 

         4        March 1994.  It was a fortnightly newspaper.  And inside 

         5        I see the Ruhengeri préfecture.  And there, I can read 

         6        -- I can see the members of the préfecture executive 

         7        committee.  Item B, I see the list of the members of the 

         8        préfecture committee, as they were elected after the 

         9        votes.  So, I recognised the newspaper.  It is a copy of 

        10        Umurwanashyaka newspaper which I recognise perfectly.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: There was a translation that said the date 

        12        was March of 1994.  I'm not sure whether the witness 

        13        said that or whether there was a mistranslation. 

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Witness, what is the date of this publication?

        16   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Witness's microphone, please.  

        17   THE WITNESS: It's a fortnightly newspaper and the month is 

        18        written in Kinyarwanda, "Wuerurwe" W-U-E-R-U-R-W-E, 

        19        Wuerurwe, 1992.  And if my memory serves me right, 

        20        "Wuerurwe", I believe, is the month of March, and I 

        21        believe after the elections, and when the results were 

        22        made public, this newspaper published them.  This 

        23        newspaper published them and I know this newspaper very 

        24        well.  Thank you. 

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we move this document as 

        26        Defendant's Exhibit 36.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection, Mr. Fleming?

        28   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours.  It appears to be part of the 

        29        document.  We haven't see the whole of the document.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: We concede that it is part of the document, 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        but it is a -- it is the parts that were relevant with 

         2        respect to this issue in terms of the election that this 

         3        witness has testified about.  The witness has testified 

         4        that he recognises the document as being a -- certainly, 

         5        in terms of business record, that it is a publication of 

         6        the MRND and it's kept in the normal course of events 

         7        related to MRND affairs.  It is also admissible as a 

         8        document that this particular witness has identified.  

         9        He has identified the relevant portions of it and 

        10        certainly the document has a probative value and there 

        11        is no prejudicial impact with respect to it.

        12   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, first, the witness has never said 

        13        it's a document of the MRND.  He said that it's a 

        14        newspaper, and there were some MRND people on the board.  

        15        Second, he said he has identified it.  And how can he 

        16        identify it when it is a select number of pages out of a 

        17        particular document.  He hasn't identified it at all.  

        18        It is part of the document and we insist on seeing the 

        19        whole of the document.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness has identified, 

        21        and,  of course, I can just put the  question again to 

        22        him, but we believe that he says the document is an 

        23        organ of the MRND, but I can ask him that question.  I 

        24        think that it's clear what he said.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: He said what's the organ?

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Witness, can you identify the document for the 

        28        Trial Chamber?

        29   A.   Thank you, Mr. President.  I emphasise earlier on that I 

        30        recognised even the cover page of this newspaper 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        Umurwanashyaka, which was a publication.  I would not 

         2        say that it was a publication of the MRND, but it was a 

         3        newspaper in the MRND trend, because some of the members 

         4        of the electoral board were --  some of the members of 


         5        the editorial board were MRND members, and then they 

         6        were interested in the election.  I can see the list 

         7        here, Ruhengeri.  And I also said I was present during 

         8        those elections.  I participated in the elections.  I 

         9        was elected a member of the préfecture committee.  I was 

        10        elected as a member of the executive committee -- 

        11        executive body of the committee as a vice president.  

        12        So, I recognise the content of the paper.  And if there 

        13        should be any litigation or any hesitation, I think 

        14        copies could be found in the archives of the MRND to see 

        15        if the edition No. 19, a special edition for the 

        16        elections, could be found there, and all the necessary 

        17        checks could be done.  But I am saying that I perfectly 

        18        recognise this newspaper and the content of this 

        19        newspaper.  Thank you, Mr. President.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this document is certainly 

        22        admissible within the Court's discretion under Rule 

        23        70(F).  

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Rule? 

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Rule 70(F) in terms of its probative value.  

        26        It's certainly not outweighed by any prejudicial impact.  

        27        The witness has testified extensively about the 

        28        document.  The issue is whether or not Kajelijeli was 

        29        either elected into any position of the préfectural 

        30        committee of the MRND.  And it's a documentation that

         1        certainly the Prosecutor can cross-examine on, raise 

         2        whatever issues they want to raise with respect to the 

         3        question at this point.  We are not introducing all of 

         4        the newspaper.  We are certainly introducing the results 

         5        of an election that this witness has testified to, which 

         6        is promulgated in an official newspaper, which he 

         7        recognised, and certainly the Court can make a judgment 

         8        with respect to its value.  We are not dealing with a 

         9        jury at this point, we are dealing with professional 

        10        Judges, who can make the distinction in terms of its 

        11        probative value in light of the witness's testimony.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you.

        13   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, it's not a document.  It is a part 

        14        of a document, selectively part of the document.  My 

        15        learned friend refused to produce the whole of the 

        16        document.  My learned friend said it's an official 

        17        record of who?  Not of the MRND.  The witness has just 

        18        said about that.  Who publishes this?  For what purpose?  

        19        Whose record is it?  My learned friend hasn't establish 

        20        any probative basis for that.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think we have heard the parties.  

        22        

        23        Yes, the Court rules that as the document is not 

        24        complete and, in the light of the fact that the contents 

        25        at least have been spelt out, if the Defence would like 

        26        to put the document as a document, then, at least, the 

        27        whole or the other parts must be together.  So, until 

        28        that is done, we would deny the admission -- the formal 

        29        admission of this document, as it is. 

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

         2   Q.   Witness, can you tell us who was elected president of -- 

         3        at the election and what commune that individual is from 

         4        and also state what that person's occupation was?

         5   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, I noted the witness has now 

         6        having regard to the document, which was --

         7   THE WITNESS: You don't want me to look at it?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, no, no.  Mr. Nzirorera, you do not have 

         9        to listen to the Prosecutor in terms of what he says.  

        10        He does not run this courtroom.  The Judges do, and you 

        11        only follow the Judge's directions, not Mr. Fleming.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Yes, go on, Counsel. 

        13   MR. FLEMING: I'm making an objection, Your Honour, to the 

        14        fact that he is now referring to a document, which is a 

        15        part of the document Your Honours refused to receive, 

        16        because it's only part of a document.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: He has referred to the document throughout 

        18        his testimony.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Go on, Counsel.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        22   Q.   Can you, Witness, tell us who was elected president?  

        23        And if you know, what commune the president hailed from, 

        24        and what was the person's occupation?

        25   A.   Thank you, Mr. President.  I'd like to draw attention to 

        26        the fact that this document was given to me to identify.  

        27        I did not ask for it.  But as I was saying, I 

        28        participated in these elections.  I was present, and I 

        29        did say that I was elected a member of the préfecture 

        30        committee -- Ruhengeri préfecture committee; I was

         1        elected a member of the executive committee.  So, I do 

         2        not think that the full document will be a problem.

         3        Now, to answer the question put to me by Counsel, the 

         4        executive committee that was elected, the president was 

         5        Kamisiri Mungu -- Casmir Bizimungu, vice president, 

         6        Joseph Nzirorera, present before you, secretary was 

         7        Bicamumpaka Jean Bosco, and treasure, Kanyemera 

         8        Célestin.  So, I know all these things off hand.  

         9        I do not really need to consult any newspaper.

         2   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, can we have a copy of document to 

         3        which the witness is referring?  We don't have a copy.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: No, he is not referring to it. 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: He is not referring to it.  This is the 

         6        witness's testimony, counsel.  If you want a document 

         7        in, we can put it in and you can have a copy.

         8   MR. FLEMING: I don't need to have it put in.  If the witness 

         9        referred to it and he turned over and then he gave 

        10        evidence without further regard to it, we would like a 

        11        copy of the document which he is referring to, 

        12        Your Honour.  So it is not a difficult request.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Prosecution cannot have it  

        14        both ways.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Please, go on, Counsel.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

        17   MR. FLEMING: Is Your Honour denying a copy of the document 

        18        which he is referring to?

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the document is not admitted as evidence 

        20        and he is not referring to it, and he was answering 

        21        questions arising from -- put to him by counsel.

        22   MR. FLEMING: But, Your Honour, he has referred to it over and 

        23        over again in the course of his evidence.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, you should have raised objections at 

        25        that particular time.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours said --

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will go on with his evidence as it is.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

                                        28



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        individuals who were elected at the préfectural level 

         2        other than the officers that you have just identified?  

         3        And, if you have any recollection, without referring to 

         4        the document, could you tell the Trial Chamber?

         5   A.   Thank you, Mr. President.  As I have said, the congress 

         6        met.  It elected 20 members of the prefectural committee 

         7        of Ruhengeri.  They were 20 members, twenty individuals.  

         8        Obviously Professor Hinds is probably going to ask me to 

         9        mention the people who were elected.  This was in 1992.  

        10        I will make an effort and try and mention the names, but 

        11        I am not sure I will be able to mention the names of all 

        12        the twenty.  It is an extraordinary task, but I will be 

        13        able to give you some of the names over and above the 

        14        four that I have mentioned.  There was Mrs. Habimana, 

        15        Nyirasafari Gaudancia:  Habimana, H-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  Mrs. 

        16        Habimana Nyirasafari is N-Y-I-R-A-S-A-F-A-R-I, 

        17        Mrs. Habimana Nyirasafari, her other name is Gaudancia.  

        18        There was Rucaga, Boniface.  Rucagu is spelt, 

        19        R-U-C-A-G-U, Boniface.  There was Ferdinand Nahimana.  

        20        Ferdinand Nahimana is N-A-H-I-M-A-N-A, Ferdinand 

        21        Nahimana.  There was Professor Narigaraba, 

        22        M-A-R-I-G-A-R-A-B-A, Narigaraba.  Maributsi, his other 

        23        name.  He was a professor at the university of Kinuma.

        26        spelt, M-U-N-Y-A-N-G-A-N-I-Z-A.  I am sure there is a 

        27        mistake there. There was one Jean Bagiramanshi.  

        28        Bagiramanshi is B-A-G-I-M-A-N-S-H-I, Bagiramanshi, Jean.  

        29        There was one Gasana Thadeo, G-A-S-A-N-A, Thadeo.  There

         1        There was one Ndeheyeehe, Charles  N-D-E-Y-E-E-H-E, 

         2        Ndeheyeehe, Charles.  There was one Ntbutira, 

         3        Bonventura.  Ntibitura is spelt, N-T-I-B-I-T-U-R-A 

         4        Bonventura.  There was one Jean Baptiste Butera.   

         5        Butera is spelt, B-U-T-E-R-A, Jean Baptiste; Jean 

         6        Baptiste Butera.

         7        There was one, if my memory serves me right, I am trying 

         8        to remember; I am trying to give you these names from 

         9        memory.  They were 20.  At least I have done a good half 

        10        of them.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

        11   Q.   A very impressive job, Mr. Nzirorera.  The fact of the 

        12        matter is:  Was Juvénal Kajelijeli among them, either 

        13        those who you omitted, people who were elected?

        14   A.   No.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Kajelijeli was not at 

        15        all a member of this committee.  As I have said, he was 

        16        not amongst the candidates. He wasn't even a voter.  So 

        17        he was not a member of the Ruhengeri préfectural  

        18        committee of the MRND.  Thank you.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: This maybe my last question to the witness.  

        20        Let me just check with Mr. Kajelijeli.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel? 

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Just a couple of questions. 

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, do the statutes of the MRND provide for 

        25        who can chair MRND meetings at the communal level? 

        26   A.   Yes, the statutes of the MRND are clear because they 

        27        indicate the organisation of the party, and in the 

        28        organisation, as I have already testified, one of the 

        29        Articles of the Statute, I believe, it is Article 17, 

        30        speaks of three categories -- of the basic organs, the

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        communal organs, the grassroots bodies, the préfectural 

         2        bodies and the national organs.  At each category of 

         3        bodies there are structures which are provided for, 

         4        namely, committees at the communal level.  There was 

         5        what was known as the Chairman of the MRND.  Within the 

         6        commune, there was a president or chairman of the MRND 

         7        in the commune.  So there was indeed someone who 

         8        directed meetings at the MRND meetings and he would 

         9        preside over préfectural meetings.  So the structure 

        10        provides for steering committees which are to preside 

        11        over meetings at préfectural and communal levels 

        12        wherever necessary.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

        13   Q.   Mr. Nzirorera, in the préfecture of Ruhengeri and in the 

        14        commune of Mukingo, who was authorised, if you know, 

        15        pursuant to the MRND statutes, to hold meetings, MRND  

        16        meetings and to chair MRND meetings at the communal 

        17        level?  Do you know the name of the individual? 

        18   A.   At the communal level, there was a chairman of the MRND, 

        19        and chairman of the MRND in Mukingo was one Niyoyita.

        20        Niyoyita is spelt N-I-Y-I-O-Y-T-A Jean Damascéne.  He 

        21        was the Chairman of the MRND in Mukingo.  So he was the 

        22        only person able to convene meetings of the MRND party  

        23        whenever necessary.  Thank you.

        24   Q.   Could Juvénal Kajelijeli convene MRND meetings and chair 

        25        such meetings at the communal level in between 1991 and 

        26        1994? 

        27   A.   That was not possible because he was not a member of any 

        28        of the bodies.  So how could he convene any meeting?  It 

        29        wasn't possible.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No other questions, Your Honour.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Any 

         2        cross-examination?

         3   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour. Your Honours intend to 

         4        break at 11:00 because I will organise my 

         5        cross-examination.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, if you can do that.  We intend to take a 

         7        break at 11:00.

         8   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.

         9                    CROSS-EXAMINATION

        10   BY MR. FLEMING:

        11   Q.   Witness, you said that you recognised the document which 

        12        is in front of you.  You said that to us, didn't you? 

        13   A.   Yes, that is true. 

        14   Q.   You have also said that it is an organ of the MRND, 

        15        didn't you? 

        16   A.   I told you that the newspaper Umurwanashyaka was a 

        17        publication; it was a review of members of the newspaper 

        18        by the MRND party. 

        19   Q.   Was it a publication of the MRND?

        20   A.   It was a newspaper, but with MRND leanings.

        21   Q.   Witness, was it a publication of the MRND?

        22   A.   I have stated that the newspaper, the owners, were 

        23        members of the MRND.  Therefore, members of the MRND 

        24        since there were many newspapers in the country during 

        25        this period of multi-partysm, anyone could found a 

        26        newspaper and publish it.  But it so happened that this 

        27        particular newspaper was owned by members of the MRND.  

        28        Therefore, it was a newspaper with MRND leanings, and 

        29        was of interest to members of the party.

        30   Q.   It was funded, if not wholly but in part, by the MRND

         1        party; wasn't it?

         2   A.   The newspaper wasn't funded by the MRND.  It was a 

         3        private newspaper and it was maintained by its own 

         4        self-generated funding.

         5   Q.   What does the name mean? 

         6   A.   Umurwanashyaka, if you want the translation of that, was  

         7        any member of a political party.  Any member of a 

         8        political party is referred to as a Umurwanashyaka.

         9   Q.   And please, tell me that again, what you say the name 

        10        means? What does that name mean?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour, asked and answered. 

        12        He may not like the answer -- but that -- it has been 

        13        asked and answered.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Well, I think counsel wants just to 

        15        understand the meaning I mean, what -- the answer was 

        16        given by the witness, the witness can restate that.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: But he has asked the identical question.

        18   THE WITNESS:  Yes, let me repeat the answer I gave:  

        19        Umurwanashyaka is a Kinyarwanda word.  It means in a 

        20        political party, the members of the political party.  I 

        21        don't think I am teaching you anything but telling you 

        22        what a political party is.  As the political party has 

        23        its members, and the members of a political are known as 

        24        Abarwanacaka (Ph).  I think I have answered your 

        25        question properly.

        26   Q.   Witness, there is a cartoon on the front.  Who is the 

        27        two-headed person on the cartoon on the front page?

        28   A.   I don't know whether I can look at the document this 

        29        time around.

        30   Q.   Please look at the document, because I am

         1        cross-examining you on it?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, does the Prosecutor now want 

         3        the document to be admitted as perhaps a Prosecution 

         4        document?  He now wants the witness to in fact, testify 

         5        from this document?  You know that is the sense of my 

         6        objection.  The witness testified before from the 

         7        document.  There were no objections.  Then he objected 

         8        at the end.  Now, he is asking the witness to look at 

         9        the document, to testify from the document.  And if we 

        10        are interested in the truth, and if we are dealing with 

        11        an issue of -- just simply the document is now being 

        12        discussed.  He cannot refer to the document if it, 

        13        in fact, it is a document that is not going to be used.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel, Mr. Fleming?

        15   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour?

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: What do you intend to do with that document?  


        17        That document -- there was an objection raised and it 

        18        was not put into evidence.

        19   MR. FLEMING: He gave evidence nevertheless from the document 

        20        and, Your Honour, I am cross-examining him in respect of 

        21        his own credit.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: You can't go back to the document.  You can 

        23        ask him whatever questions that were raised before the 

        24        objection was raised; he can answer, you know, but you 

        25        cannot bring him back the document that has not been 

        26        tendered on your own objection.

        27   MR. FLEMING: Does Your Honour intend to strike then from the 

        28        record the answers that he gave in respect of what you 

        29        asked him?

         2        with those things.

         6   Q.   Now, Witness, would you look at that cartoon please.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: No. 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: No reference to that document which has not 

        10        been tendered.  You can ask about any other question.

        11   MR. FLEMING: I am sorry, Your Honour.  He has given evidence 

        12        from this document.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Court has ruled.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, that is our ruling, Mr. Fleming.

        15   MR. FLEMING: Does Your Honour intend to strike from the 

        16        record then the answers that he gave in respect of the 

        17        document previously?

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  You can cross-examine on that but we don't 

        20        intend to strike.

        21   MR. FLEMING: I can cross-examine on what, Your Honours, 

        22        the -- on why he identified the document?  I am asking 

        23        him now questions going to his identification of the 

        24        document.  He says that he identified it.  I want to 

        25        know how he identified it, how he says that it is owned, 

        26        for example, by the MRND, how he says it has MRND 

        27        leanings and I am simply asking him, Your Honours, to 

        28        verify what he has already said.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, you can ask him about that but not with 

        30        the reference to the document specifically by way of

         1        description as you were trying to put to him because the 

         2        document is not in evidence, it has not been produced by 

         3        objection that -- it is not a complete document.

         4   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         5   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         6   Q.   Witness, why do you say that that document has MRND 

         7        leanings?

         8   A.   Yes, I testified that the Umurwanashyaka newspaper was 

         9        published by individuals who were members of the MRND 

        10        party.  I think that is quite clear.

        11   Q.   Did the content of the document itself have MRND 

        12        leanings?

        13   A.   As I have testified a moment ago, the document is 

        14        publishing the elections of the MRND because these are 

        15        the activists, the members who followed the elections.  

        16        It was necessary that the results of the elections be 

        17        made known and if you look at it closely, you will see 

        18        that is what is being done, the results of the  

        19        elections which took place.

        20   Q.   So, I will have to look at it closely.  So tell us what 

        21        you say the MRND leanings are in that document?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he has said that the results were 

        23        published in that document.

        24   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, there might be more than that.  

        25        And  I am entitled to prompt him in respect of it?  Let 

        26        me  ask a direct question.

        27   BY MR. FLEMING:

        28   Q.   Witness, it has MRND leanings for reasons other than 

        29        just the publication of the names; doesn't it?

        30   A.   I think if you followed me right from the start on the

         1        cover of this document, it is mentioned that it is a 

         2        special elections edition -- I am sorry -- so it was 

         3        dealing specifically with the elections.  Amatora was 

         4        the word mentioned.

         5   Q.   There was also in that document propaganda against the 

         6        other parties; wasn't there?

         7   A.   I didn't look at the document as a whole but the extract 

         8        which I was presented with deals only with the 

         9        elections. 

        10   Q.   That is not so, is it, Witness, because on the front 

        11        cover there is something which deals with more than the 

        12        elections; isn't it?

        13   A.   May I look at the document?

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, again, I am raising an 

        15        objection.  The Prosecutor can't have it both ways.  If 

        16        he wants the witness to look on the document, and we 

        17        have no objection to that happening, but he cannot deny 

        18        the Court from having the document as an exhibit.  He 

        19        wants to deny the Court to have the document, yet he 

        20        wants to cross-examine from the document and the Court 

        21        will be then left in the dark.  It is unfair and it is 

        22        prejudicial.

        23   MR. FLEMING: We withdraw our objection to the receipt of the 

        24        document, Your Honour.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Could we now have the document marked as 

        28        Defendant's Exhibit 36?  Your Honour, this is still on 

        29        the Defendant's case.  We have made an application and I 

        30        understand there was an objection.  It has now been

         1        withdrawn.  And, we just want to complete the record by 

         2        making the formal application that the document be 

         3        admitted as Defendant Exhibit 36.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  The ruling of the Trial Chamber will remain 

         5        the same.  That, for reasons that were given, we have 

         6        considered that this document can't be admitted as -- 

         7        the Rules of the Chamber gave the reasons for that.  And 

         8        I hope, Mr. Fleming, learned counsel for the Prosecution 

         9        would bear that in mind, that was the ruling of the 

        10        Court, and to cross-examine the witness as far as this 

        11        document is concerned within the bounds of that aspect.

        12   MR. FLEMING: I promise the Court I will never mention the 

        13        document again, Your Honours.  Perhaps it should be 

        14        taken out of the witness's hands otherwise the 

        15        temptation might be too great for me.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, you can keep it there.  Go ahead, 

        17        Counsel.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        19   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        20   Q.   Witness, the northern area of Rwanda was a stronghold 

        21        for the MRND; wasn't it?

        22   A.   May I consult my counsel before I give my answer?

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: What was the question, Counsel?

        24   MR. FLEMING: The northern area of Rwanda was a stronghold for 

        25        the MRND?  I don't know what that might incriminate -- 

        26        the answer might incriminate him, Your Honours.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is not an issue for Mr. Fleming to have 

        28        commentaries -- the witness has asked to exercise his 

        29        right to speak to his lawyer without commentary.

        30   MR. FLEMING: And, Your Honours, I am opposing that because

         1        his right to speak with his lawyer arises, as 

         2        Your Honours have rightly noted, out of the rule against 

         3        self-incrimination.  How can it be that he can 

         4        incriminate himself by answering, yes or no to whether 

         5        or not the north of Rwanda is a stronghold of the MRND?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, obviously it is the state of 

         7        mind of this witness and not of the Prosecution.  And if 

         8        the witness has expressed a need to speak to his lawyer, 

         9        that is absolute.  This is not discretionary.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: I think, he can -- we will soon move from 

        11        there, Mr. Fleming.  I think the lawyer can speak to the 

        12        witness.

        13   MR. FLEMING: Do Your Honours wish to take the break now?  It 

        14        is just 11:00, I have noticed.

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, Mr. Fleming is not running this 

        16        courtroom.

        17   MR. FLEMING: I know, but I am taking account of what the 

        18        Judges said the break would be at 11:00.  I happen to 

        19        comply with what the Court wants.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can you speak to your client, please?  

        21        Yes?  

        22   MR. ROBINSON: Your Honours, would you like me to remain here 

        23        or return to my seat?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: You can remain here for a while.

        25   MR. ROBINSON: Thank you, Your Honours.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, go on, Counsel. 

        27   MR. FLEMING: Yes, I have asked the question, Your Honours:  

        28        He wanted to consult before he answers.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes?

        30   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Your Honours, he is now prepared to

         1        answer that question.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can he answer that question? 

         3   THE WITNESS: Yes, I wish to answer, Mr. President.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Answer it.

         5   THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  As to whether the 

         6        northern region was the stronghold of the MRND, I wish 

         7        to inform the Prosecutor that the MRND was indeed 

         8        represented in the north and it happened that it had the 

         9        majority of the people there.  But there was no contest, 

        10        because there was no party or elections to determine 

        11        that this party is more stronger than the others.  But I 

        12        do know that the MRND was well represented in the 

        13        northern region, Mr. President.  Thank you.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, go on, Counsel.

        15   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, you want me to continue 

        16        cross-examining?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        18   BY FLEMING:

        19   Q.   Witness, you have told us you went to secondary school 

        20        and to university, haven't you?

        21   A.   Yes, that is indeed the case, Mr. Prosecutor.

        22   Q.   You finished university in 1975; that is your evidence, 

        23        isn't it?

        24   A.   That is correct.

        25   Q.   What percentage of the Rwandan population went to 

        26        university in 1975?

        27   A.   I have no idea.

        28   Q.   It was a very small percentage, wasn't it?

        29   A.   Yes, it was a small percentage.

        30   Q.   You were privileged in your own educational background;

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        weren't you?

         2   A.   I went into secondary school; I went to university, and 

         3        it was after having sat exams in which I performed 

         4        brilliantly.

         5   Q.   So brilliantly that by the time you were 26, you were 

         6        director general of the government department; isn't 

         7        that the case?

         8   A.   Yes, I can say that because when I finished my 

         9        university studies, I passed with a distinction.  And 

        10        afterwards -- you know that Rwanda is an underdeveloped 

        11        country, and that was the problem, that I was appointed 

        12        director general.

        13   Q.   Do you mean underdeveloped in the sense that there were 

        14        not very many people with university degrees?

        15   A.   At any rate, they were not enough to fill the places, or 

        16        the positions within the central administration.

        17   Q.   So you were an employee for something like eight months 

        18        before you became director general of a department; that 

        19        is the case, isn't it?

        20   A.   That is correct.

        21   Q.   At the age of 31, you became Minister for Public Works 

        22        and Energy; that is your evidence, isn't it?

        23   A.   That is correct.

        24   Q.   And then in your political career, and you remained a 

        25        minister until 1991; that is your evidence, isn't it?

        26   A.   Yes, I remained a minister until the 30th of December 

        27        1991.

        28   Q.   Your political career in 1986 had you as a member of the 

        29        central committee of the MRND; didn't it?

        30   A.   It wasn't in 1986, but 1996, we were in exile, but it

         1        was 1986.

         2   Q.   That is what I said, 1986.  So you were a member of the 

         3        central committee of the MRND, that's so; isn't it?

         4   A.   That is indeed the case, Mr. Prosecutor. 

         5   Q.   1991 to 1994 were you a member of Parliament?

         6   A.   I was a member of Parliament from 1991 to 1994; I was 

         7        still a member of Parliament.

         8   Q.   Witness, the MRND stands for democracy, doesn't it?

         9        In fact, it includes the term democracy in its name?

        10   A.   Yes, after the end of the single party era the MRND 

        11        adopted political pluralism.  So, it was advocating 

        12        pluralism and democracy as one of their pillars.

        13   Q.   And democracy was an important pillar in the MRND, 

        14        wasn't it?

        15   A.   That is correct.

        16   Q.   Witness, in 1991, name me one Tutsi member of Parliament 

        17        out of the MRND?

        18   A.   In 1991, I can mention Mr. Ambrose Mulindangabo, who was 

        19        the Minister for Planning for 10 years.  He was also 

        20        member of Parliament and Ambrose Mulindangabo, 

        21        M-U-L-I-N-D-A-N-G-A-B-O.  Mulindangabo, I will spell it  

        22        is M-U-L-I-N-D-A-N-G-A-B-O.  His first name was Ambrose.  

        23        He was Planning Minister for ten years.  He was a Tutsi 

        24        and he was also a member of Parliament.

        25   Q.   Name me, Witness, one Tutsi member of Parliament in the 

        26        Abatabazi government in which you were Speaker of the 

        27        House?

        28   A.   Could you please repeat your question?

        29   Q.   Yes, Witness, it is a very simple question.  Name me one 

        30        Tutsi member of Parliament in the Abatabazi government?

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Abatabazi?

         2   MR. FLEMING: Yes.

         3   THE WITNESS:  You want to talk about a member of Parliament 

         4        or a member of the government?

         5   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         6   Q.   Let's break it down then?  We understand each other 

         7        don't we, when I refer to the Abatabazi government; you 

         8        understand that term, don't you?

         9   A.   I understand that there is the government and then there 

        10        is the Parliament, so you need to be clear in your 

        11        questions.  Do you want to refer to the government or to 

        12        the Parliament?

        13   Q.   Let's be very clear.  First, let's understand Abatabazi.  

        14        You understand what I mean by Abatabazi government; 

        15        don't you?

        16   A.   I know that the interim government led by Jean Kambanda 

        17        was referred to as the Abatabazi government.

        18   Q.   And what does Abatabazi mean?

        19   A.   I don't know exactly the translation.  I can't really 

        20        give you the translation in French.  I am not sure 

        21        exactly what it is.  Normally, if I try and translate it 

        22        literally, I would say the defenders, but I am not 

        23        certain because one has to have recourse to a specialist 

        24        for that translation.  But I understand the term 

        25        Abatabazi is a defender or something to that effect.

        26   Q.   Let's take then the MRND standing for democracy, the 

        27        Abatabazi government standing for defence.  Name me one 

        28        Tutsi who was a member of the Abatabazi government?

        29   A.   You know that this government was composed of several 

        30        parties.  There were five political parties involved and 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        each party was to present its candidates.  As far as I 

         2        know within that government, as far as I know, there 

         3        were no Tutsis.

         4   Q.   Then you stand for democracy.  Democracy is an inclusive 

         5        government.  Why was there no Tutsi in the Abatabazi 

         6        government?

         7   A.   Each political party would present its candidates to the 

         8        government and it was up to each party to assess the 

         9        candidates.

        10   Q.   Just one moment there.  You said each political party 

        11        presented their candidates to the government.  Which 

        12        government did each political party present their 

        13        candidates to in respect of the Abatabazi government?

        14   A.   From the 16th of April 1985 -- from the 5th of April 

        15        1992, there was what was known as the democratic 

        16        coalition government.  That government from that point 

        17        onwards -- that government was composed of five 

        18        political parties instead of a single party which had  

        19        previously been known as the MRND, a single party, I 

        20        repeat.  Now, the 7th of April 1992, the political 

        21        parties in Rwanda signed what was known as the 

        22        memorandum of agreement between the political parties, 

        23        and it was between these political parties which was 

        24        shared by the politicians.  Just at that time, the MRND 

        25        remained with nine portfolios, the MDR had four 

        26        portfolios, and PSD had three, PL three, MRD four, 

        27        PDC one, and, obviously, the MRND had the presidency of 

        28        the republic and the MDR, which was in the opposition, 

        29        had four portfolios.  So this was this democratic 

        30        opening which led to this multiparty government and led

         1        to the adoption of the constitution on the 10th of June 

         2        in 1992.  It  was, therefore, required that each 

         3        political party appoint its government candidates and no 

         4        political party was to interfere in the nomination of 

         5        ministers within the government, and that is the 

         6        explanation I can provide for you.

         7   Q.   I am sorry, Witness, I asked you a simple question.  I 

         8        won't be put off asking the question, and I will ask it 

         9        again.


        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I think the witness 

        11        has answered the question.  It may not be the answer  

        12        Mr. Fleming wants but he has answered the question in 

        13        great detail so that everyone understands the process.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thank you.

        15   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, it was a non-responsive answer 

        16        because the witness said that they presented their  

        17        candidates to the government and we are talking 

        18        specifically about the Abatabazi government and I asked 

        19        him which government he presented those credentials to 

        20        and then I got a long story going back to 1992.  I want 

        21        to ask the question again.  It was his former response 

        22        that I am questioning.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  Your question is what?  Just a minute, 

        24        Counsel.

        25   MR. FLEMING: My question is in respect of the Abatabazi 

        26        government.  The political parties were said to have, 

        27        according to him, presented their credentials to a 

        28        government.  I want to know what government they 

        29        presented their credentials to, the Abatabazi 

        30        government, that is, the members, who became members of

         1        the Abatabazi government.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think the witness described 

         3        the coalition government.  He indicated the particular 

         4        number of portfolios each one of the parties had.  And 

         5        he went to great detail explaining the composition of 

         6        that particular government and Mr. Fleming now wants to 

         7        ask the same question.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: No, let the witness understand that question.  

         9        Do you understand the question?

        10   THE WITNESS: After the specification he has given, I can 

        11        indeed supplement my answer, Mr. Prosecutor.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Let the witness answer that question if he  

        13        understands it.

        14   THE WITNESS:  I would like to inform the Chamber that the 

        15        so-called Abatabazi government, which was put in place 

        16        on the 9th of April 1994 follows the logic of the 

        17        protocol agreement or the memorandum of understanding 

        18        signed on the 7th of April 1992.  So, at the time when 

        19        this government was being set up on the 9th of April 

        20        1994, it was a matter of the five political parties 

        21        which had  previously been represented within the 

        22        government presenting themselves their candidates who 

        23        would constitute the new government.  I thank I have 

        24        answered your question, Mr. Prosecution.


        25   Q.   So there was no authority in existence on the 7th or 8th 

        26        of April to whom credentials could be presented; was 

        27        there?

        28   A.   You know that on the 6th of  April the president of the 

        29        republic was killed.  Subsequently, the political 

        30        parties met.  They appointed the Secretary of Parliament

         1        in order to act as interim president of the republic.

         2   Q.   That was not in conformity with the constitution, was 

         3        it?

         4   A.   Lawyers would have to see that.  People spoke about the 

         5        Arusha Accords, others talked about the old 

         6        constitution.  But, at that time, we had to apply the 

         7        provisions of the constitution of 10th June 1991.

         8   Q.   And, Witness, what happened was not in accord with the 

         9        constitution, and you know that don't you?

        10   A.   That is not true because jurists told us that that was 

        11        what was, rather, the truth.

        12   Q.   So, are you telling this Court that it was your 

        13        understanding that what occurred in the formation of the 

        14        Abatabazi government was in accord with the 

        15        constitution; is that what you are telling this Court?

        16   A.   Well, I am saying that it is in accord with the 

        17        constitution of 1991 because normally during that period 

        18        we were in a process of negotiations and there was the 

        19        Arusha Accords which should have been part and parcel of 

        20        the constitution. 

        21        

        22        Now, in the Arusha Accords, it was intended that the 

        23        Arusha Accords would be implemented when the 

        24        institutions are set up, but these were not set up.  The 

        25        legal minds that we had in the various political parties  

        26        suggested that in order not to create a political vacuum 

        27        that there should be a government which should continue 

        28        the negotiations with the RPF.  That is the government 

        29        that was set up on the 9th April 1994 to continue with 

        30        the negotiations with the RPF and to set up the

         1        transitional institutions.  I am not a lawyer, but that 

         2        was the thinking of the legal minds of the time.

         3   Q.   Is it your evidence that what happened on the 7th or 8th 

         4        of April was in accord with the Arusha Accords?

         5   A.   It is not the Arusha Accords that were implemented 

         6        because Arusha Accords could not be implemented before 

         7        the establishment of the transitional institutions.  It 

         8        was the constitution of 10th June 1991 which was 

         9        implemented.  Now, to set up the interim government, the 

        10        political parties relied on the 10th June constitution 

        11        and the memorandum of understanding as amended by the 

        12        additional protocol.  And there was another protocol in 

        13        the same vein to take care of the gaps so as to continue 

        14        with the negotiations with the RPF.  That was the 

        15        government that was set up which was also a coalition 

        16        government made up of seven political parties to carry 

        17        forward the Arusha procedure and which led to the 

        18        assassination of President Habyarimana -- because he was 

        19        also a part of the process of the Arusha process.

        20   Q.   I am puzzled, Witness, a moment ago you told us that the 

        21        Arusha Accords formed part of the constitution.  But now 

        22        you now are saying that the Arusha Accords didn't play a 

        23        part in the set of the government.  Is that what you 

        24        were telling us?

        25   A.   Since the Arusha Accords, I said that the president of 

        26        the republic was himself an institution and when the 

        27        president was assassinated and the institution had 


        28        disappeared.

        29   Q.   There was no provision in the constitution for precisely 

        30        such an occasion, was there?

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   No.  The Arusha Accords made no provision how the 

         2        president of the republic should be replaced before the 

         3        establishment of the transitional institutions because 

         4        it was provided for in the Arusha Accords that the 

         5        president of the republic should be replaced by the 

         6        Speaker of Transitional national Assembly and that 

         7        transitional assembly was not yet set up.

         8   Q.   Witness either there is a problem in translation or you 

         9        are not hearing me properly.  I said that there was 

        10        specific provision in the constitution for such an event 

        11        as the president of the republic dying or becoming 

        12        unable to act.  There is such a provision, isn't there, 

        13        in the constitution?

        14   A.   The 10th -- the constitution of 10th of June 1991 makes 

        15        provisions for replacing the president of the republic 

        16        in event of death or inability to act.  He is replaced 

        17        by the national council for development; that is clear.

        18        

        19        Now, the Arusha Accords, because I know where you are 

        20        coming from --

        21   Q.   I am not asking about the Arusha Accords, I am asking 

        22        you about the constitution, and if you would please 

        23        listen to the question that I ask and answer those 

        24        questions, I will be grateful.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Prosecutor -- Your Honour, 

        26        Mr. Fleming is arguing with the witness and the witness 

        27        provided an answer to each of the questions.  If 

        28        Mr. Fleming is not happy with the answer, he could 

        29        reformulate his questions but not argue and attempt to 

        30        browbeat the witness.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         2   MR. FLEMING: With respect, Your Honour, I object to the term 

         3        browbeating.  Your Honour, I am not brow beating him.  +---

         4        He answered the question and he wanted to go on and talk 

         5        about the Arusha Accords.  I cut him off because I was 

         6        not asking him about the Arusha Accords.  I would  

         7        simply ask that he answer the question I asked.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness, just listen to the question and 

         9        answer it specifically so that we can move forward.  And 

        10        be precise also, Mr. Fleming so that the witness can 


        11        also understand the question in precise terms and give a 

        12        response.

        13   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't have to go round this problem for a 

        15        long time.

        16   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        17   Q.   Witness, we are not talking about the Arusha Accords; do 

        18        you understand that?  Is it precise enough?  We are 

        19        talking about the constitution.


        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I suppose, of the time.

        21   MR. FLEMING: The 1991 constitution, yes, Your Honours.  

        22   BY MR. FLEMING:

        23   Q.   The one that he has described.  All right, now there was 

        24        an assembly in place, wasn't there, as of the 6th of 

        25        April 1994?  

        26   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: The answer didn't come through.  He 

        27        said, "oui".

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: He said "oui".  I think -- microphone.

        29   THE WITNESS:  I said yes.

         1   Q.   The government that was in place was in tatters because 

         2        various members of that government were murdered on the 

         3        7th of April 1994 isn't that the case?

         4   A.   Yes.

         5   Q.   So the prime minister, I am sorry, the president was 

         6        murdered and according to you, on the 6th of April, 

         7        1994, various members including the prime minister were 

         8        then murdered on the 7th of April in 1994; isn't that 

         9        the case?

        10   A.   Yes. 

        11   Q.   And it is your view isn't it, that that created a power 

        12        vacuum?

        13   A.   Obviously.

        14   Q.   And it was the -- of the view of the political parties 

        15        that they should step in and create something 

        16        themselves; that is the case isn't it?

        17   A.   Yes.

        18   Q.   And at which point the constitution was ignored, wasn't 

        19        it, in favour of something created by the political 

        20        parties?

        21   A.   And that is how you see it because that constitution, 

        22        the government that you were referring to, the 

        23        government you were referring to came out of the 

        24        political parties.  It is the same seven political 

        25        parties that came together and set up a government on 

        26        the 7th of April, 1994.

        27   Q.   You have told us yourself before that your understanding 

        28        of the constitution was that it was the assembly which 

        29        assumed power.  The assembly did not assume power on the 

        30        7th or the 8th or the 9th of April 1994, did it?


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   That is to say that the political parties met; they 

         2        requested the Speaker of the Assembly to step in as 

         3        interim acting president on the 8th April.

         4   Q.   Please listen to my question again.  On the on the 7th 

         5        or the 8th or the 9th of April the constitution was 

         6        ignored in that the assembly did not assume control; did 

         7        it?

         8   A.   Since already on the 7th of April, the political parties 

         9        consulted the then Speaker of the national Assembly 

        10        requesting him to act as president and set up a 

        11        government.   And he was asked for the -- for first time 

        12        on the 7th.  So, I don't see what we ought to have done 

        13        in the interim.  Note had to be taken that the president 

        14        of the republic was dead.  That is what was done  on the 

        15        7th of April and then later on it was realised that the 

        16        prime minister was also dead.  So there was a power 

        17        vacuum, so I do not know exactly what you wanted us to 

        18        do.

        19   Q.   And, Witness, let's go back again.  There was an 

        20        Assembly in place on the 6th of April 1994.  The 

        21        constitution according to you required that the Assembly  

        22        assume responsibility.  That Assembly did not assume 

        23        responsibility; did it?

        24   A.   That is what you are saying.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think he has given his answer to that 

        26        question.  We can move on.  We take note of the answer 

        27        given us by the witness according to him, according to 

        28        his evidence.

        29   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         2             (Court recessed between 1130H and 1140H)

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  We 

         4        continue with the testimony of the witness in 

         5        cross-examination.  Mr. Fleming?

         6   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         7   BY FLEMING:

         8   Q.   Witness, you are a friend of Mr. Kajelijeli; aren't you?

         9   A.   Yes, Kajelijeli is someone I have known for a long time.

        10   Q.   And, Witness, you are a person yourself, of influence in 

        11        the Ruhengeri area; aren't you?

        12   A.   Counsel, can you explain what you mean by influential?

        13   Q.   You don't understand the term?

        14   A.   Well, I mean influential in what sense?

        15   Q.   Political influence for example; shall we take that one?

        16   A.   Since I have given you my CV, I was a member of 

        17        parliament, a representative of people.  I was elected 

        18        by the people politically.  So politically I had a 

        19        defendable political position.

        20   Q.   And you used that to achieve what was best for the 

        21        people of Ruhengeri; didn't you?

        22   A.   For the number of years that I was in political office, 

        23        I believe if I did not do good things, I wouldn't have 

        24        been elected as a representative of the people.  So I 

        25        did good things for the people of Rwanda.

        26   Q.   Well, let's just go through that again.  In 1991 you 

        27        were elected as a member of Parliament for your area, 

        28        weren't you until the government, the broad-based 

        29        government broke down on the 6th to the 7th of April 

        30        1994.  You were a member of parliament during that time

         1        weren't you?

         2   A.   I do not know if it is a question of translation, but I 

         3        was elected a member of parliament the first time in 

         4        1981, not 1991, and I have been an MP from 1981 up  

         5        until 1994.

         6   Q.   1981, so you saw a lot of events occur in Ruhengeri 

         7        region; didn't you?

         8   A.   Since I was in politics, I knew the entire situation in 

         9        my country.

        10   Q.   And you had a particular concern for the safety and 

        11        security of the people in Ruhengeri; didn't you?

        12   A.   Security issues have always been a concern of the 

        13        Habyarimana regime.

        14   Q.   Particularly in the north because the north had had 

        15        incursion from the RPF; hadn't it?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  This is not only 

        17        beyond the scope but certainly getting into areas with 

        18        respect to Mr. Nzirorera's particular situation as a 

        19        defendant, and, who is now accused of acts relating to 

        20        events in that particular area.  I did not object before 

        21        concerning a number of questions relating to the 

        22        witness's political development and even events that 

        23        were -- where decisions were made in terms of successive 

        24        government et cetera, although they were way beyond the 

        25        scope of direct.  But the area that the Prosecution is 

        26        now going into is an area we believe is not only way 

        27        beyond the scope, but also has no issue that can 

        28        reasonably be advanced with respect to credibility but 

        29        only is designed to elicit information and testimony 

        30        from this witness who also is an accused and facing

         1        multiple counts relating from events within the same 

         2        area and region.  So, we are objecting with respect to 

         3        scope.

         4   MR. ROBINSON: Your Honour, if I may be heard just briefly to 

         5        express my own concern that we are now going into an 

         6        area which involves trial of Mr. Nzirorera, the 

         7        indictments that he is facing.  And I would ask the 

         8        Court to invoke Rule 90(g) to limit the examination 

         9        of -- the direct examination into matters directly 

        10        relating to credibility.  I would like to point out to 

        11        the Court that I have researched this issue; I found no 

        12        precedent on it in this Tribunal but there is some 

        13        precedent in the ICTY in a case called Prosecutor v. 

        14        Blaskic and the decision that was rendered on 11th of 

        15        November 1997 at paragraph 30; the government, the 

        16        Prosecution was offering a witness who was -- had 

        17        confidential material with respect to the government.   

        18        The government requested that the scope of the testimony 

        19        of the witness be limited so as to preserve the 

        20        confidentiality interest of that government.  And the 

        21        Trial Chamber held that yes, the cross-examination would 

        22        be limited in scope to the matters raised in the direct 

        23        because of the concerns of the confidentiality.  And 

        24        now, obviously, here we have concerns of prejudice to 

        25        Mr. Nzirorera's case.  And so, I would ask this Trial 

        26        Chamber to consider to limit in his interest as well as 

        27        in your own determination of relevancy for this trial, 


        28        the questioning to those matters directly related to his 

        29        credibility and directly related to the direct 

        30        examination.  Thank you.

         1        1200H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Counsel.

         3   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

         4        

         5        We must properly characterise Mr. Nzirorera.  By 

         6        coincidence he is accused before this Tribunal of the 

         7        crimes.  He remains part of the indictment against

         8        Mr. Kajelijeli because it is said that he conspired with 

         9        Mr. Nzirorera.  He has chosen to get into the witness 

        10        box himself.  He has waived, in our submission, any 

        11        privilege he has except in so far as he might 

        12        incriminate himself.  There is nothing yet which has 

        13        been put to him which might incriminate him.  The 

        14        Blaskic case relied entirely upon the state security for 

        15        the limiting of the cross-examination.  No such issue 

        16        arises here because he is an ordinary witness.  These 

        17        matters have already been litigated.

        18        

        19        And, Your Honours, further than that, the witness also 

        20        has given evidence of his own career which we can -- are 

        21        entitled to cross-examine on because it is within the 

        22        scope.  He has given evidence of his association with 

        23        the accused.  We are entitled to cross-examine on that.  

        24        We didn't raise issues before 1994.  Our learned friend 

        25        did in-chief, and I can go through the list of them if  

        26        Your Honour so required.  I have a full page of matters 

        27        that my learned friend raised prior to 1994, so it is 

        28        within the scope of the material which I have laid 

        29        first.  And, second, I intend to cross-examine in 

        30        respect of matters going to credit -- things that he has

         1        said, and things that he has said about the accused. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, the issue is whether or not 

         3        Mr. Fleming would be allowed to ask questions on the 

         4        issue of security matters in that particular region.  It 

         5        is not just questions that predate 1994.  And even 

         6        there, all the questions that we asked Mr. Nzirorera 

         7        related to the political membership election within the 

         8        MRND.  I have been surgical in my questions, lasting no 

         9        more than an hour and half.  Now, there has not been a 

        10        single issue raised about security.  And this is a 

        11        special question because I know that the Prosecutor 

        12        wants to get into this particular area.  It is way 

        13        beyond the scope, has nothing to do with anything that 

        14        the Defence has raised in our evidence in-chief, has 

        15        nothing to do with credibility, and it is designed fully 

        16        to obtain evidence from this witness which they want to 

        17        use then in a case in which he is a Defendant.

        18        

        19        The Defendant certainly has taken the witness box and 

        20        he, of course, is open for cross-examination but within 

        21        reasonable parameters.

        22   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, can I simply respond because my 

        23        learned friend raised a new issue in his reply.  He said 

        24        I can't ask questions about security.  He hadn't said 

        25        that prior to that.  The problem with that, of course, 

        26        is that the accused himself characterised the situation 

        27        in which they were "as a war", for a start -- his term, 

        28        not mine.  Second, he touched upon why Kajelijeli was 

        29        removed as bourgmestre and he said the RPF wanted him 

        30        removed as bourgmestre, and I am certainly entitled to

         1        cross-examine in respect of both those issues.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we are not objecting to him 

         3        raising questions about the circumstances of 

         4        Mr. Kajelijeli being removed, but that is not the 

         5        question being put to the witness.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the Trial Chamber would like to observe  

         7        the following, and that would be the procedure that we 

         8        expect to be followed by counsel as officers of the 

         9        Court.  Indeed the Accused here is here as a witness and 

        10        cross-examination can and could be done within scope of 

        11        Rule 90G and all that follows.  But at the same time, it 

        12        must be borne in mind that he is not on trial here for 

        13        his case.  He is also charged, and faces his charges, 

        14        that he will have his day in court at some stage, if he 

        15        hasn't had that opportunity now.  So that also has got 

        16        to be borne in mind.  So the scope of cross-examination 

        17        can be done and should be done within the spirit and the 

        18        scope of Rule 90, as already said, touching or dealing 

        19        with the issues that have already been raised in 

        20        cross-examination and issues of credit that are within 

        21        the scope of his role here as a witness, and not to go 

        22        or touch on any aspects, unless specified, that concern 

        23        or has any bearing, direct or specific bearing alone to 

        24        issues that are linked up to his charges that he may be 

        25        facing elsewhere.

        26        

        27        So that, we would expect that should be borne in mind in 

        28        the scope of cross-examination.  Of course, if you will 

        29        open to the accused person to indicate where so 

        30        perceived, whether there are any elements that might

         1        necessitate the invocation of Rule 90A.  That is a 

         2        different matter.  It is for the Accused and whose 

         3        counsel is here watching the brief.  So, we expect that 

         4        the cross-examination would take into account that kind 

         5        of scope.

         6   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         7   BY MR. FLEMING:

         8   Q.   Witness, you, yourself referred to the situation in 

         9        Rwanda in 1990 as a war; didn't you?

        10   A.   Are you asking me as to whether or not I was in the war?  

        11        I don't clearly understand your question, Counsel.

        12   Q.   Let me ask it again and tell me which part you don't 

        13        understand, which particular word.  You, yourself, in 

        14        your evidence here described the situation in Rwanda 

        15        from l990 onwards, as a war; didn't you?

        16   A.   Yes, I said that and I agree that Rwanda was at war 

        17        between 1990 and l994.

        18   Q.   Who were the warring parties in Rwanda between 1990 and 

        19        1994?

        20   A.   Officially it was the RPF against the Rwandan 

        21        government.

        22   Q.   That war was waged particularly in the north of the 

        23        country; wasn't it?

        24   A.   Yes, Rwanda was attacked from Uganda, the northern part 

        25        of the country.

        26   Q.   That was the part which you represented or part of which 

        27        you represented in Parliament; wasn't it?

        28   A.   The first invasion took place at Kagitumba border post.  

        29        This is in the Byumba préfecture, it is not in my 

        30        constituency.  My constituency is Ruhengeri.  Ruhengeri

         1        was invaded subsequently, but it started from the Byumba  

         2        préfecture.

         3   Q.   When was Ruhengeri invaded?

         4   A.   In January 1991.

         5   Q.   Was it invaded after that again?

         6   A.   Ruhengeri was invaded on several occasions in 1991, I 

         7        suppose, but also in 1992 and 1993, such that a portion 

         8        of Ruhengeri was occupied by the aggressors -- by the 

         9        invaders.

        10   Q.   Tell me when, in 1993, Ruhengeri was invaded?

        11   A.   In 1993 Ruhengeri town was attacked and occupied by the 

        12        RPF on 8th February 1993.

        13   Q.   What was the reaction of the government to that invasion 

        14        on 8th February 1993?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I think that we 

        16        have -- I do not object for the background information 

        17        for the questions that were asked.  Now a question is 

        18        being asked what was the reaction of the government of 

        19        which this witness was a member of the government.  Now, 

        20        what relevance does that have to his testimony, that he 

        21        has testified to with respect to the membership of the 

        22        MRND by Juvénal Kajelijeli which is, in fact, the issue 

        23        that is before us based upon the Prosecution's case?  

        24        They claim that Kajelijeli was a leader of the MRND and 

        25        played certain roles within Ruhengeri, and in particular 

        26        the commune of Mukingo within the MRND.  Okay, we have 

        27        presented this witness, the witness has testified with 

        28        respect to those relevant issues.  Now the Prosecutor 

        29        has gone way beyond the scope of the direct, and now he 

        30        is now into issues that may very well impact on

         1        capability of this particular individual within his own 

         2        trial concerning omissions, and I think that it goes way 

         3        beyond the scope of credibility and we are objecting.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Any response from the Prosecution, 

         5        Mr. Fleming?

         6   MR. FLEMING: Yes, I will respond, Your Honours, but I would 

         7        request that the accused not be present when I respond 

         8        he understands English.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS:  With the procedure, Your Honour, we would 

        10        end up either with the accused looking at this matter by 

        11        way of video or because, obviously, if Mr. Fleming 

        12        continues in this vein, it is going to evoke a 

        13        continuing sea of objections if he continues in this 

        14        vein.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, we prefer he stays here, unless you have 

        16        very specific aspects that you want to raise that might 

        17        cause prejudice to the proceedings.

        18   MR. FLEMING: It will cause prejudice to my cross-examination  

        19        because I want to inform Your Honours what my next 

        20        question is, and I don't want the accuse to know what my 

        21        next question is.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Right.  Witness, can you go out there and then 

        23        we will call you back.  We cannot deny parties to be 

        24        heard, that is the cardinal principle.

        25   MR. FLEMING: He is not a party, Your Honour.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  Is he gone?

        27   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours.  Your Honours, the issue is 

        28        why he was dismissed -- why Kajelijeli was dismissed.  

        29        Now, we go to the 8th of February 1993, his evidence 

        30        being that Kajelijeli was dismissed in March 1993

         1        because the RPF insisted, and that is the area that I am 

         2        probing, nothing outside, exactly what he said in 

         3        evidence.

         4   MR. ROBINSON: Excuse me, Your Honour, may I be heard on that?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         6   MR. ROBINSON: I think the problem, from our perspective, 

         7        worrying about the prejudice to his trial, is that the 

         8        questions that Mr. Fleming is asking are very broad.  

         9        What was the position of the government?  If he limits 

        10        it to why was Mr. Kajelijeli dismissed, I don't think we 

        11        have a problem.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: If Mr. Fleming is interested in that 

        13        inquiry, we think he is entitled to ask that question.  

        14        But what he is -- he is doing more than that.  He is 

        15        trying to get the testimony on a number of issues that 

        16        we believe are beyond the scope rather than getting 

        17        directly to the question at hand.  This is the question 

        18        we would not object.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think we have heard the parties.  The 

        20        general question as put by you, Mr. Fleming was wide 

        21        enough, and we think that the credibility aspect as well 

        22        must be tied up in an essential way with the testimony 

        23        of this witness before this Trial Chamber as raised and 

        24        as provided for within the provisions of Rule 90 of the 

        25        Rules of Procedure.  As we have said, any matters that 

        26        may concern him in other proceedings could be done 

        27        elsewhere when he has had time, when he will have time 

        28        to have his day in court.  So that should be borne in 

        29        mind.  But certainly the question that you intend to put 

        30        arising from his answer with regard to his dismissal as 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        you put it -- to the dismissal of Kajelijeli as you have 

         2        put it, that is perfectly within the scope.  So you 

         3        better -- you will have to narrow down your question 

         4        with that kind of consideration in mind.

         5   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.  I have that consideration in 

         6        mind and I will start with a broader perspective and 

         7        bring it right down specifically to him.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: No, I think you don't have to go back to the 

         9        government and what have you.  That is too broad, and it 

        10        could, in fact have some elements of connection to 

        11        whatever he might be facing elsewhere.  We will not 

        12        allow that question in that format.

        13   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Mr. Fleming.

        15   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        16   BY MR. FLEMING:

        17   Q.   Witness, upon the invasion on the 8 of February 1993, 

        18        was that the occasion when many prisoners were let out 

        19        of prison in Ruhengeri?

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.

        21   MR. ROBINSON: I will say, Your Honour, I believe that is an 

        22        area which is again contrary to -- under Rule 90G, 

        23        contrary to your orders that he be within the scope of 

        24        direct or related to credibility.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  We sustain the objection.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Without hearing me, Your Honour?

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we have discussed this matter long 

        28        enough.  We have got to get moving with the evidence of 

        29        this witness.

        30   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

         1   BY MR. FLEMING: Witness, the response of the local community 

         2        was swift and vicious, wasn't it against --

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  The question that 

         4        Mr. Fleming says he was going to put deals with the 

         5        removal of Mr. Kajelijeli.  He is now trying to elicit 

         6        testimony concerning reprisals and reactions of people 

         7        within the community that he has already established 

         8        Mr. Nzirorera as elected officials were presented.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        10   MR. FLEMING: Do you want to hear from me in response?

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        12   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours it is 

        13        abundantly clear from what I said before that there is a 

        14        connection between two events.  I don't want to raise 

        15        the second event, and I am now probing specifically 

        16        that.  I am not obliged to ask why a particular event 

        17        happened I am cross-examining.  I wanted to set up a 

        18        particular background as to why an event happened.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, he cannot now ask a question 

        20        with respect to whether the re-action from the community 

        21        was swift and -- we know that that question is a 

        22        predicate to and the objection is with respect to the 

        23        capability -- potential capability to this witness based 

        24        upon an answer.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, that question can be asked as long as it 

        26        is limited there.

        27   THE WITNESS: Shall I answer?  Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

        28        First of all, I would like to make a clarification.  The 

        29        Prosecutor is speaking about the release of prisoners at 

        30        Ruhengeri in 1993.  I didn't say anything like that, and 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        65



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        if we are talking of release of prisoners at Ruhengeri 

         2        it was not in 1993, but it was, rather, on the 23rd of 


         3        January 1991.  I think this should be taken due account 

         4        of.  That was the first attack on Ruhengeri préfecture. 

         5        I wanted to inform him that he was mistaken when he said 

         6        that the prisoners in Ruhengeri were released in 

         7        February 1993.

         8        

         9        Now, regarding the answer to his question; he is telling 

        10        me what his re-action was; in fact the RPF attacked 

        11        Ruhengeri in 1993 in violation of the cease-fire which 

        12        was agreed on with the Rwandan government.  The RPF in 

        13        Ruhengeri town -- I wasn't in Ruhengeri town personally.  

        14        There was fighting, and the troops of RPF and the army 

        15        fought in Ruhengeri.  I wasn't even at Ruhengeri myself.   

        16        I was in Kigali.  So, the re-action that he is asking 

        17        about is not for me to reply because I was not party to 

        18        the fighting, I was in Kigali.  But nonetheless, the 

        19        armed forces fought against the RPF which had violated 

        20        the cease-fire.  I thank you, Mr. President, Your 

        21        Honours.

        22   MR. FLEMING: Witness, you told us that Kajelijeli was removed 

        23        as bourgmestre as a result of the request from the RPF.  

        24        Why would the RPF request the removal of the 

        25        bourgmestre?

        26   A.   I can answer this question because I said that it was 

        27        the RPF because I am aware of correspondence which the 

        28        RPF wrote to the Rwandan government to the Ministry of 

        29        Foreign Affairs at the time in March 1993.  I know the 

        30        letter very well, and RPF was asking for certain 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        conditions in order to continue the negotiations.  They 

         2        gave a list of personalities, especially administrative 

         3        and local authorities, person who, according to the 

         4        RPF -- it was asking that they first of all be relieved 

         5        of their duties.  I know the letter exists, and I think 

         6        I even have a copy somewhere.  But I know that on that 

         7        list there was a certain number of individuals and the 

         8        government of Rwanda at the time, which was party to the 

         9        negotiations with the Ministry of Foreign affairs, 

        10        agreed to the request of the RPF in order to allow the 

        11        negotiations to continue.  I think it was in these 

        12        circumstances that Kajelijeli was released of his 

        13        duties, amongst many other individuals.  And I think the 

        14        ministry of interior -- the ministry of foreign affairs, 

        15        would know more than I do, but I did see the letter with 

        16        my very own eyes.

        17        

        18        Thank you very much, Mr. President, Your Honours.

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   But now, answer the question.  Why did the RPF request 

        21        the removal of Mr. Kajelijeli?

        22   A.   Mr. Prosecutor, I think you need to ask the RPF that 

        23        question because I saw the letter.  It is the RPF which 

        24        was asking that certain individuals be dismissed.  They 

        25        were not even giving explanations.  They were setting 

        26        their own conditions for their own government and the 

        27        Rwandan government acceded to their request.

        28        

        29        So this question must be put to the negotiators.

        30   Q.   Let me put to you another proposition to you.  He was

         1        removed from his official position because of the 

         2        indiscriminate killing of Tutsi people that time; isn't 

         3        that the case?

         4   A.   I am not aware.  You are the one informing me of this.  

         5        I am learning this from you.

         6   Q.   You are suggesting that there were no Tutsi people 

         7        killed in your region.  That is, Ruhengeri, in 1993? 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  A, it is beyond the 

         9        scope.  Again, we are dealing with questions for which 

        10        Mr. Nzirorera may very well be standing trial for before 

        11        this Tribunal.  Taken -- the question that is being put 

        12        to him is completely prejudicial.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: To whom?

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: To Nzirorera.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: That question can be answered by the witness, 

        16        if he has an answer or understands it in general terms. 

        17   THE WITNESS: Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the question 

        18        is clear and the answer I am going to give is clear.  

        19        There was a war; attacks were there; there was fighting; 

        20        there were Tutsis who died and Hutus who died also.  

        21        Tutsis and Hutus died.  That is the answer that I can 

        22        give.

        23   Q.   Witness, there were express allegations against 

        24        Mr. Kajelijeli for killing of Tutsi in 1993, weren't 

        25        there?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Again, Your Honour, beyond the scope of 

        27        direct.  The issue that this witness has testified about 

        28        was very clear with respect to the membership of the 

        29        MRND, leadership of the MRND with respect to 

        30        Mr. Kajelijeli.  Now the Prosecutor is raising questions 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        concerning matters way beyond the scope, which has 

         2        nothing to do with credibility.

         3   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, with the greatest respect, it 

         4        cannot be beyond the scope when they, themselves, opened  

         5        up the issue of the removal of Mr. Kajelijeli in 1993 

         6        and tried to give it some innocent explanation.  We are 

         7        entitled to cross-examine in respect of that.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  That proposition can be put.  It arises 

         9        from the reasons behind -- the alleged reasons, if any, 

        10        for the removal of Kajelijeli in that context.  If the 

        11        witness has any answer to that, he can give an answer, 

        12        if not, he can also say so.

        13   THE WITNESS: I thank you, Mr. President.  I have testified 

        14        that I gave you the information in my possession.  I am 

        15        also in possession of a letter which was signed by one 

        16        representative of the RPF in the person of 

        17        Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka dated March 1993.  The letter was 

        18        written to the Rwandan office -- the Rwandan Minister of 

        19        Foreign Affairs at the time who was participating in the  

        20        negotiations.  In that letter there is a list of 

        21        personalities -- political personalities, administrative 

        22        personalities, which, according to the RPF, in order to 

        23        continue with the negotiations which were ongoing, in 

        24        the opinion of the RPF, these persons should be 

        25        dismissed without -- dismissed unconditionally.

        26        

        27        Now, there is no explanation accompanying the list of 

        28        names.  This is the document which I have in my 

        29        possession and I know that Kajelijeli is on that list.  

        30        Now, Mr. Fleming is telling me he wants to know.  I

         1        cannot give any other reason other than what I know.  

         2        That is the official document that I have in my 

         3        possession.  Thank you, Mr. President.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: What do you say to the proposition being made 

         5        by the Prosecutor in his question, can you answer it 

         6        straight away -- straightforward way, if you still 

         7        remember the proposition?

         8   MR. FLEMING: I can repeat the proposition, Your Honour, for 

         9        his benefit.

        10   THE WITNESS: He can remind me because I understood that he 

        11        was asking me under what circumstances Kajelijeli was 

        12        dismissed.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  He was soliciting, so to say, a possible 

        14        reason.  What do you say to that, if you understand the 

        15        question, if you have any answer?

        16   BY MR. FLEMING:

        17   Q.   Witness, you know, don't you, that there were 

        18        allegations made against Mr. Kajelijeli in 1993, before 

        19        he was dismissed that he had killed Tutsi; you know 

        20        that, don't you?

        21   A.   You are the one informing me of that, Mr. Prosecutor.

        22   Q.   Witness, you might like to answer the question.  You 

        23        know, don't you, that there were allegations made 

        24        against Kajelijeli for killing of Tutsi in 1993; you 

        25        know that, don't you?

        26   A.   I am not aware of those allegations, Mr. Prosecutor.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Next questions, Counsel.

        28   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.

        29   BY MR. FLEMING:

        30   Q.   Witness, you are the benefactor of Mr. Kajelijeli,

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        aren't you?

         2   A.   What you are saying is not correct.

         3   Q.   I want to read something to you that Mr. Kajelijeli 

         4        said.  He called you his benefactor.  Are you saying he 

         5        is wrong?

         6   A.   Could you please repeat your question, Mr. Prosecutor?

         7   Q.   Mr. Kajelijeli swore an affidavit before this Trial 

         8        Chamber in which he said, among other things, that you 

         9        are his benefactor.  Is he wrong in saying that?

        10   A.   I don't know what you mean by "benefactor".  But as I 

        11        have told you, Kajelijeli is a friend whom I have known 

        12        for a long time.  He was bourgmestre I was a minister.  

        13        We were neighbours -- we are neighbours.  Maybe 

        14        relationships due to the fact that we are neighbours is 

        15        what is important.  But it -- I -- was not we, 

        16        ourselves, who decided that we become neighbours.  But 

        17        in any case, we know one another.

        18   Q.   And you helped him in his career; didn't you?

        19   A.   What I know is that when Kajelijeli was elected -- maybe 

        20        he was appointed, but I am not the one who appointed 

        21        him; He was appointed by the ministry of the interior 

        22        upon the proposal -- Kajelijeli was appointed 

        23        bourgmestre upon the proposal of the minister of the 

        24        interior, and I was never ever minister of the interior.

        25   Q.   You mightn't ever have been, but you used your influence 

        26        to have him appointed bourgmestre?

        27   A.   Mr. Prosecutor, I think that Kajelijeli was appointed 

        28        bourgmestre in the same manner as other bourgmestres in 

        29        Rwanda; there are 150 of them.

        30   Q.   I am sorry, that doesn't answer the question.  You used 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        your influence, didn't you, to have him appointed?

         2   A.   That is your point of view, Mr. Prosecutor.

         3   Q.   I am asking your point of view, not mine.  You used your 

         4        influence to have him appointed?

         5   A.   What I mean to say is that what you are saying is not 

         6        true, Mr. Prosecutor.

         7   Q.   He was appointed again bourgmestre in June of l994, 

         8        wasn't he?

         9   A.   Yes, Kajelijeli became bourgmestre again in June l994, 

        10        mores specifically in the second half of June l994.  

        11        This was following a pre-selection of candidates, or a 

        12        short-listing of candidates for the position of 

        13        bourgmestre.

        14   Q.   And, if, as you said, that you were very keen to 

        15        continue the process of negotiations with the RPF, why 

        16        would you appoint somebody who had been dismissed as a 

        17        result of a specific request that you have told us about 

        18        of the RPF as a condition to them going ahead with the 

        19        negotiations; how would that be?

        20   A.   Mr. President.  Maybe I need to provide a small 

        21        explanation here.  When some bourgmestres were dismissed 

        22        in 1993, the government of the day, led by an opposition 

        23        prime minister in the person of Dismas Nsengiyaremye 

        24        gave directives according to which the vacant 

        25        bourgmestre posts be filled with immediate effect.  It 

        26        was requested by a circular from the Minister of 

        27        Interior that all bourgmestre candidates be able to 

        28        apply because there was also rumour going around that 

        29        there were some bourgmestre or other cadres who had been 

        30        dismissed merely upon the request of the RPF, and that 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        the government had succumbed.

         2        

         3        Since we were in a democratic process of election and 

         4        not appointment, it was requested that applicants who 

         5        were applying for the positions of bourgmestre be 

         6        short-listed because the communal development and civil 

         7        society and political parties were involved.  Kajelijeli 

         8        who been target of dismissal earlier on once again 

         9        applied.  When the commune development committee met 

        10        together with various parties which had presented 

        11        candidates, Kajelijeli was short-listed amongst all the 

        12        others, and he was, in fact, at the top of the list.  

        13        The ministry of the interior only confirmed his 

        14        short-listing.  So now the Prosecutor is claiming that 

        15        Nzirorera used his influence.  I didn't have any 

        16        influence whatsoever over these elections.  I think, 

        17        Mr. Prosecutor, I am not the one who wanted anything 

        18        whatsoever, but Kajelijeli was elected by the relevant 

        19        authorities according to the instructions of the 

        20        ministry of the interior, Mr. Faustin Munyaheza, who is 

        21        today in America.  We have the text of the short-listing 

        22        which took place.  If the Prosecutor wants something 

        23        else Kajelijeli is here present; he can say something in 

        24        his defence.  But I know that that proceeding took 

        25        place, and this is how I know Kajelijeli became 

        26        bourgmestre the second time around, and I thank you, 

        27        Mr. President.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        29   BY MR. FLEMING:

        30   Q.   So it was democratic process; is that what you are 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        73

         1        saying, in the later part of June l994?

         2   A.   The instructions to fill the posts of bourgmestres which 

         3        were vacant came from the government of coalition which 

         4        was led by Nsengiyaremye and followed by Gatwigirimana.  

         5        It was on the basis of these instructions that the 

         6        elections took place in order to fill in the positions 

         7        of bourgmestre.  The documentation is there, candidates 

         8        are also there.  If the Prosecutor so wishes, I can give 

         9        him what I have and then we will have testimony to that 

        10        effect.  That is the information that I have, and I am 

        11        trying to put this before the Chamber in order to have 

        12        us all in the clear.

        13        

        14        Thank you, Mr. President.

        15   Q.   Two things:  First, are you saying that it was a 

        16        democratic process?

        17   A.   I am not a specialist in democracy, because you can tell 

        18        me there is democracy -- in Uganda there is democracy.  

        19        But what we know is that you needed to involve the 

        20        participation of all political parties or the 

        21        representatives of political parties that there is a 

        22        short-listing, that there is no automatic appointment, 

        23        but that at least the grassroots organisations be able 

        24        to speak about the position, and that is what we did, 

        25        Mr. President.

        26   Q.   Second proposition that came out of your answer:  You 

        27        say you have documents in respect of this; do you?

        28   A.   No. I am not saying that I have a document which 

        29        sanctioned this position.  I am saying I have in my 

        30        possession instructions concerning this matter regarding 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        the replacement of bourgmestres who had been dismissed. 

         2        So, since some members of government will definitely go 

         3        through here, they will obviously have the opportunity 

         4        to answer these questions.

         5   Q.   I thought we might have had the opportunity to see the 

         6        documents before now.  But anyway, tell me, who was with 

         7        you in Cantenon in Benin on the 27th of May 1998?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your honour.  Where does this go?  

         9        To the illegality of Mr. Kajelijeli's arrest which we 

        10        have argued ad nauseam?  Is that what we want to get 

        11        into at this stage of the proceeding?  I mean, it has 

        12        nothing to do with direct examination.  It is way beyond 

        13        the scope.  I mean, what is the relevance of this?  We 

        14        object, I mean, to where the Prosecution is going.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel, Mr. Fleming.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, we are addressing the issue of 

        17        influence, and this has direct relevance to the 

        18        direction which I have put before in respect of 

        19        benefactor.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, what does that have to do at 

        21        all with respect to issues before this Trial Chamber and 

        22        what we were dealing with on direct examination?  It has 

        23        absolutely nothing to do with it, Whether or not 

        24        Mr. Kajelijeli was a leader of the MRND, what role he 

        25        played, etcetera.  Now, certainly all the questions that 

        26        I asked in that regard we will not object.  Certainly, 

        27        if there is a question with respect to his removal, we 

        28        raised that issue and we think there could be inquiry 

        29        made with respect to why he was removed.  But now we are 

        30        into 1998, Benin, and issues relating to who

         1        Mr. Kajelijeli was with.

         2   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, issues relating to credit 

         3        precisely relating to credit.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: We allow the question to that limited extent.

         5   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  That is all.  That is 

         6        the only basis for which I ask it.

         7   BY MR. FLEMING:

         8   Q.   Let me ask it in another way:  Kajelijeli was with you 

         9        when you were arrested in Benin; wasn't he?

        10   A.   Thank you, Mr. President.  I think this is of public 

        11        knowledge, because Kajelijeli filed a motion for 

        12        severance and he was indeed resident in Benin.

        13   Q.   In the same house as you; wasn't he?

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I mean, the witness 

        15        said he was with him, period.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel, can you link up to the fact that 

        17        you want to follow up arising from your area --

        18   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   You were living in the same house as Mr. Kajelijeli, 

        21        weren't you?

        22   A.   Mr. Prosecutor, when the ICTR investigators came to 

        23        arrest me, they found Kajelijeli in my house; they 

        24        arrested him also.  He just happened to be there.

        25   Q.   He had been living with you since the 8th of May 1997; 

        26        hadn't he?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Again, Your Honour?  What is the basis of 

        28        this except that the Prosecutor is trying to put into 

        29        evidence the Defence's proposition that the only reason 

        30        why he was arrested was because he was in the presence

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002




         1        of Nzirorera, and the Prosecutor of the ICTR had not one 

         2        single iota of evidence that Kajelijeli had committed 

         3        any crime.  I mean, that is what we have said from the 

         4        very beginning.  But the issue at this point is whether 

         5        or not this has any relevance at this stage of the 

         6        proceedings with respect to the testimony on direct.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think we have followed the objections and 

         8        the submissions made by the parties.  We have allowed 

         9        the Prosecution to follow up this aspect with connection 

        10        with the alleged issue that was stated, and I think the 

        11        Prosecution will develop further than that.  We will 

        12        have to bear that in mind, whether or not there was 

        13        indeed, according to your understanding -- according to 

        14        the earlier observation, whether or not the kind of 

        15        general association, if any, relating to the accused and 

        16        Nzirorera as a witness, not to that extent only.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.  Nzirorera has said 

        18        Kajelijeli is a friend.  I mean we don't have an issue 

        19        of credibility where --

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Let the other party develop; it is the Trial 

        21        Chamber which will determine the issue of credibility at 

        22        a later stage.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:

        24   Q.   Witness, you said he just happened to be there:  That 

        25        was your last comment.  He had been there since the 

        26        beginning of 1997, in your house; hadn't he?

        27   A.   Mr. President, I can give some explanation, by your 

        28        leave.  I reach Benin in 1996.  Now Kajelijeli came to 

        29        my house because he was, in fact, in Kinshasa -- at the 

        30        time when Kinshasa was taken over he had to leave Zaire,

         1        present day Congo, to find another country of asylum.  

         2        In between he sought refuge in Benin.   He found me in 

         3        Benin because had already been there since 1996 and I 

         4        sheltered him.

         5        

         6        Now, when the investigators of the Tribunal came looking 

         7        for Mr. Nzirorera, they found a gentleman.  They asked 

         8        him who he was; he said he was Kajelijeli.  He was asked 

         9        his name, his identity --

        10        

        11        Now, afterwards, one of the investigators said?  "Take 

        12        this guy, we will see about him later", and was in Zaire 

        13        at the time of the invasion of the forces of law of 

        14        Ntehezire Kabila.  He left Congo, Zaire, through 

        15        Brazzaville as a refugee.  Refugees are dispersed all 

        16        over Africa.  Kajelijeli came to Benin?  He found me 

        17        there, and he came to my house and I welcomed him.  

        18        Unfortunately, he was not very lucky: He was discovered 

        19        at my house and he was brought here.  That is it, 

        20        Mr. President.

        21   Q.   Now, let me read to you from what Mr. Kajelijeli says 

        22        about this:  The guarantees laid down in the said 

        23        articles 17 to 19 of the Statute of the ICTR against --

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, if the Prosecutor is reading 

        25        from a document we are entitled to see the document.  We 

        26        don't know whether he is -- what he is doing.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: What would that document be, Mr. Fleming?

        28   MR. FLEMING: It is a document filed by my learned friend:  It 

        29        is the affidavit of Kajelijeli dated the 9th of November 

        30        1998 filed by our learned friend in this matter, Your

         1        Honour.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: The document you are reading, sir, we are 

         3        entitled to a copy of it before you put it in record.  

         4        You can't just simply read any piece of document and 

         5        then cite it.  That particular document that you are 

         6        reading, sir, must be presented to the Defence before 

         7        you begin reading from it.  It is not in evidence it has 

         8        not been tendered.  It is a hearsay document at best.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can the registry show the document to the 

        10        Defence?

        11   MR. FLEMING: I am astonished by my learned friend's 

        12        allegation that this is a hearsay document, Your 

        13        Honours.  That takes the cake in terms of legal 

        14        analysis.

        15        

        16        I have got to mention, Your Honour, it comes under the 

        17        umbrella of the letter and by our learned friends as 

        18        well.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Which letter?

        20   MR. FLEMING: There is a letter by our learned friends which 

        21        was addressed to us in Court, or at least, I think to 

        22        the Court.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming, do you have an idea as to how 

        24        long you still have to go?

        25   MR. FLEMING: I certainly won't finish by one o'clock, Your 

        26        Honours, and if I went on from now it would take some 

        27        considerable time, maybe another hour.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Because I think there will be some meeting 

        29        here.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we are requesting the original 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        79



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        document that was submitted -- this document purports to 

         2        be a document prepared by Mr. Kajelijeli.  We are 

         3        requesting the original, so that Mr. Kajelijeli can 

         4        examine this particular document.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Who has it?

         6   MR. FLEMING: The registry, Your Honour.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can the registry see it, so that --

         8   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, this is a document sent to us by 

         9        our learned friends.  That is where we got it from.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, there is no question about it 

        11        that we filed a particular motion and attached to it a 

        12        document that was prepared by Mr. Kajelijeli while he 

        13        was in detention in Benin, and under those 

        14        circumstances Mr. Kajelijeli as a pro se litigant filed 

        15        a motion.  Now, Mr. Kajelijeli is being shown a document 

        16        and he says that he wants a copy of the original so that 

        17        he can verify whether or not it is the statement that he 

        18        made.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: He wants a copy of the original or he wants to 

        20        cross-check with the original?

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: He wants to cross-check, and I think he is 

        22        entitled to that.  Your Honour, concerning the time for 

        23        cross, I limited very carefully my direct with one hour 

        24        and thirty minutes.  Mr. Fleming right now is over two 

        25        hours -- he is over two hours as he is proceeding.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, first, his mathematics are wrong.  

        27        Second, in their case our witnesses took an average of 

        28        an hour and five minutes, and my learned friend took an 

        29        average of five hours -- we can give you these 

        30        statistics -- an average of four hours in 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        cross-examination.  Also, my learned friend said only a 

         2        couple of moments ago that in pursuit of truth each 

         3        party must have as long as they require for 

         4        cross-examination.  I won't be very long at all.  Your 

         5        Honours know very well my reputation for not being long 

         6        in cross-examination.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the rule that was set by this 

         8        Tribunal and which has been imposed on me also, I have 

         9        accepted it is -- certainly, at this stage, we are bound 

        10        in terms of your direct to the -- what we have projected 

        11        -- the times we have projected.  The Court has 

        12        restricted, at least the Defence to a particular stage 

        13        even at the end of the Prosecutor's case that we should 

        14        keep our cross within the scope of direct, and that is 

        15        all I am saying that what has  been laid out as the rule 

        16        of the Trial Chamber should be applied.  I don't want to 

        17        put Mr. Fleming in a straitjacket.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: We -- certainly, the operational procedure is 

        19        certainly the Rules of Procedure with regard to 

        20        cross-examination as we have had occasion to state them 

        21        out time and time again.  And we do also expect that 

        22        time frames will also be borne in mind, but it won't go 

        23        on indefinitely and that is why we were asking, 

        24        generally to -- how long the Prosecutor in this 

        25        particular case still have to go.

        26        

        27        We will take into account the fact -- we do -- we hope 

        28        that that will be taken into account when planning the 

        29        remaining part of their work.  And that is what they 

        30        have done to all the parties, when the Trial Chamber 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        feels it is important to know how far a party has got to 

         2        go and, you know, for the trial Chamber to prepare for 

         3        the subsequent work before it.  For example, whether 

         4        today any other witness may be required.  So these are 

         5        the parameters that we had in mind when raising this 

         6        question.  I hope that will be borne in mind.

         7        

         8        We will stop here, Counsel, because you still have some 

         9        time to go.  We are told this particular Chamber may be 

        10        used for some other function during the lunch break. 

        11        

        12        So, we will take a break -- the lunch break and resume 

        13        our work at twenty to three.  Until then these 

        14        proceedings stand adjourned.

        15        (Court recessed from 1305H to 1440H)

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the proceedings are resumed and we 

        17        continue with the evidence, the Defence witness in 

        18        cross-examination.  Mr. Fleming.

        19   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        20   BY MR. FLEMING:

        21   Q.   Witness, it was government policy, wasn't it, that 

        22        people in the civil service shouldn't be involved in 

        23        politics?

        24   A.   Thank you, Counsel.  During the multiparty era in 

        25        Rwanda, a certain category of civil servants were 

        26        requested to remain totally neutral.  This category of 

        27        civil servants were the magistrates or judges, and 

        28        soldiers.  Other civil servants could join political 

        29        parties of their choice.  But let me add that regarding 

        30        civil servants, particularly those in the central 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        administration, particularly bourgmestres, it was not 

         2        allowed to hold political posts as well as 

         3        administrative offices.

         4   Q.   But it goes further than that, doesn't it?  Let us take 

         5        Mr. Kajelijeli as an example.  You -- using him as an 

         6        example, you said he wouldn't be allowed to hold 

         7        political office.  You agree with that proposition; 

         8        don't you?

         9   A.   What I meant was this, that during the one party system, 

        10        the bourgmestre of the commune was at the same time the 

        11        chairman of the MRND in that commune.  But with the 

        12        advent of the multiparty system, the bourgmestre -- the 

        13        office of the bourgmestre was separated from the office 

        14        of the chairman of the MRND, so they became two separate 

        15        and distinct offices which could not be combined by one 

        16        and the same person.

        17   Q.   So, during multi-partysm, Kajelijeli could not have been 

        18        a holder of political office, could he?

        19   A.   Counsel, it is different.  If Kajelijeli, for example, 

        20        since he was appointed a bourgmestre in  June l994, I am 

        21        saying that in that capacity he could no longer be 

        22        chairman of MRND in the commune.

        23   Q.   Witness, he could not be a holder of political office, 

        24        could he?

        25   A.   Yes, I said that he could not assume political office.  

        26        In other words, he could not hold an administrative 

        27        office and a political office.

        28   Q.   However, that wouldn't stop his biases politically, or 

        29        his own views politically, would it?

        30   A.   Yes, Counsel.  That is to say that as a bourgmestre, or

         1        as a préfecture or anyone in the civil service, he 

         2        could, if he so wished, be a member of a political 

         3        party.  He could even be registered officially, But 

         4        there were some who didn't want it.

         5   Q.   Including Mr. Kajelijeli, I suggest?

         6   A.   Yes, to my knowledge, Kajelijeli did not join the MRND.

         7   Q.   However, he did have affection and leanings towards the 

         8        MRND, didn't he?

         9   A.   Counsel, I think that is a question that you have the 

        10        opportunity to put to him when he takes the stand.

        11   Q.   I hope so.  The Interahamwe were part of the MRND, 

        12        weren't they?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour, beyond the scope.  

        14        We raised no issues about the Interahamwe specifically.  

        15        We could have raised nothing specifically that even 

        16        remotely touches on the question of Interahamwe and the 

        17        Court knows that this issue of Interahamwe as it relates 

        18        in this trial, and as it relates in Mr. Nzirorera's 

        19        trial, this is a central issue.  We have raised nothing 

        20        about Interahamwe.

        21   MR. ROBINSON: Your Honours, also, this is an important issue 

        22        for Nzirorera's own case as he may know he is charged in 

        23        his capacity as secretary general of the MRND party with 

        24        having superior responsibility for the acts of the 

        25        Interahamwe and as a result it is central to his case.  

        26        Any connection between him and the Interahamwe -- it 

        27        very much prejudices the trial that he will eventually 

        28        have, of which that will be the central issue.  So we 

        29        would ask the Court to not allow cross-examination 

        30        relating to this area which is outside the scope of both

         1        direct examination and unrelated to credibility.  Thank 

         2        you.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, what do you say?

         4   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, the most 

         5        extraordinary situation has now arisen. They have come 

         6        here and put a witness in the box who has said that 

         7        Kajelijeli is completely neutral in respect of any 

         8        political involvement.

         9        

        10        That political involvement, as Your Honours will know, 

        11        includes the MRND.  They now want the Prosecutor, or 

        12        myself perhaps more appropriately to be muted in respect 

        13        of the particular issue.  And they expect that we cannot 

        14        ask a question which they have raised affirmatively:  

        15        That is, which is politically neutral based upon the 

        16        whole case that we have run, that is, he is politically 

        17        active, including the Interahamwe.  We are entitled, we 

        18        would submit, to ask such questions.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, our proposition is not that Mr. 

        20        Kajelijeli is neutral with respect to the MRND.  We are 

        21        meeting the Prosecution's proof that they have set forth 

        22        through their witnesses that Juvénal Kajelijeli was a 

        23        leader of the MRND within MRND.  They produced witnesses 

        24        who, in fact, said that.  There is no issue here of 

        25        neutrality.  They said that this man was a leader of the 

        26        MRND.  We now have put a witness and produced certain 

        27        documents that, in fact, contradicts it.  There is not 

        28        one scintilla of evidence with respect to any 

        29        documentation establishing Juvénal Kajelijeli being a 

        30        member of the MRND.  This is what we produced in our 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        case-in-chief through this particular witness.

         2        

         3        Now Mr. Fleming is asking questions about the 

         4        Interahamwe and saying that he is entitled to do so in 

         5        order to show that Kajelijeli was not neutral with 

         6        respect to the MRND.  This is apples and oranges.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, before we make a ruling on this matter, 

         8        we would like to restate again that this Trial Chamber 

         9        is alive to the position -- and delicate position of the 

        10        witness.  He is a witness in this particular case, as 

        11        well as an accused, and facing serious charges in a case 

        12        in which he is allegedly involved.  And -- but at the 

        13        same time as a witness, issues that go beyond what has 

        14        been raised, we will deal -- as the Rule requires -- 

        15        deal with issues of credit.  And credit, as far as this 

        16        witness is concerned, will relate to his evidence -- to  

        17        his evidence in this particular case of Kajelijeli, not 

        18        as whatever role he may play in his own trial.

        19        

        20        So, coming up to the objection raised, we think issues 

        21        relating to the accused Kajelijeli on whom he is 

        22        testifying on behalf can be raised.

        23        

        24        So we will authorise the Prosecution to raise -- to ask 

        25        that question in the context as it relates to the case 

        26        of Kajelijeli -- as it relates to the case of 

        27        Kajelijeli.

        28   MR. ROBINSON: Your Honours, thank you for that ruling and for 

        29        considering the rights of my client.  The question 

        30        before my client right now as a witness is whether the

         1        Interahamwes relate to the MRND.  And I think that is an 

         2        example of the question that is too broad, that is not 

         3        related to Kajelijeli, and I would ask that you sustain 

         4        the objection to this question and we can take up the 

         5        next question.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: We overruled the objection, and the question 

         7        can be asked.  But all that we need, it should be asked 

         8        in the context that needs to be specified, within the  

         9        context of Kajelijeli's case, leaving out the accused 

        10        person who is not on trial.  If there was any kind of 

        11        question, it was going to be raised in that respect.

        12   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        13   BY MR. FLEMING:

        14   Q.   Witness, the question was:  The Interahamwe was part of 

        15        the MRND; wasn't it?

        16   MR. ROBINSON: I am going to instruct my client not to answer 

        17        the question under Rule 90E, and that is my position.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours can accept that on the basis of 

        19        self incrimination.  I haven't asked a single question 

        20        on this association with the MRND.  But with the 

        21        greatest respect to what my learned friend has just 

        22        said, there is no basis for claiming self incrimination 

        23        in that question.

        24   MR. ROBINSON:  Your Honour, any knowledge that Mr. Nzirorera 

        25        may have had of the Interahamwe may tend to incriminate 

        26        him in as much as he is charged with superior 

        27        responsibility with the acts of the Interahamwes.  So, 

        28        in my judgement as his counsel, a proper invocation of 

        29        Rule 90E, and we are invoking it.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Yes, we'll sustain the -- take note of 

         3        the observation of the Defence, as the answer given by 

         4        the Counsel for the Accused person.  He does not want to 

         5        answer it in the terms and in the scope in which he has 

         6        stated it.

         7   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING:

         9   Q.   Witness, a matter going to credit, you have no belief, 

        10        and you have said as much, in the impartiality of this 

        11        Tribunal, do you?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I mean, what --

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we don't see the relevance of that and 

        14        sustained.  Can you move on to the next question.

        15   BY MR. FLEMING:

        16   Q.   Witness, where were you in June of 1994? 

        17   MR. ROBINSON: And I am going to object to that as being 

        18        extremely broad question and irrelevant as currently 

        19        raised.  There is not any link to this case, as to its 

        20        credibility and certainly not apparent from the 

        21        question.

        22   MR. FLEMING: I shall --

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you explain or rephrase your question, 

        24        Mr. Fleming, to see the relevance and the context of 

        25        your question or what you want to demonstrate before the 

        26        Trial Chamber?

        27   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        29   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        30   Q.   Witness, by the end of May of 1994, there was an embargo 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        88

         1        in respect of the importation of arms into Rwanda, 

         2        wasn't there?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  I think that 

         4        Mr. Fleming knows that this is not only beyond the 

         5        scope, he knows that this is evidence that will be 

         6        introduced in the case against Mr. Nzirorera.  He knows 

         7        the evidence.  And why is he asking such a question when 

         8        he knows it has nothing to do with credibility; it is 

         9        beyond the scope of direct and it is evidence that the 

        10        Prosecution has in their file against Mr. Nzirorera.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel. 

        12   MR. ROBINSON: Yes, thank you, Your Honours.  I would like the 

        13        Court to be aware of the fact that during the search of 

        14        Mr. Nzirorera's residence in Benin in 1998, they found 

        15        there documents indicating involvement in the 

        16        procurement of weapons, which is -- that is the game 

        17        that Mr. Fleming is trying to play here.  And, 

        18        obviously, anything related to that not only is 

        19        irrelevant to this trial, it has nothing to do with 

        20        credibility, but its direct impact on not only defence 

        21        to the trial, but on Rule 90(E).  And so, we would ask 

        22        that you sustain our objection on the relevance of the 

        23        question.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Fleming.

        25   MR. FLEMING: Yes, thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, I 

        26        just been accused of playing a game.  Juvénal Kajelijeli 

        27        is on trial not for game, but for genocide amongst other 

        28        things.  The accused is being called to give evidence 

        29        and we have an entitlement to impugn his credit.  His 

        30        credit is directly on the line, because as my learned 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        89



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        friend said, while I play a game apparently with the 

         2        evidence, there is an international embargo in respect 

         3        of the purchase and importation of weaponry into Rwanda.  

         4        We have a document here signed by Nzirorera in June of 

         5        1994 for the importation of many, many weapons.  

         6        

         7        Now, it is our submission that this goes directly to his 

         8        credit.  He is a man who continues to say that he stood 

         9        for democracy and the entitlement of the individual, and 

        10        he is out, despite a world embargo in respect of these 

        11        matters, purchasing weapons contrary to the ruling of 

        12        the United Nations.  Now, if the Court pleases, if that 

        13        doesn't go to credit, then what does go to credit? 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is stretching the issue of 

        15        credibility, and any issue of credibility must be 

        16        balanced against the interest of fairness.  Now, what is 

        17        the linkage, if any, between whatever Mr. Fleming wants 

        18        to raise on cross to the issues in this case involving 

        19        Juvénal Kajelijeli?  We have -- we have clearly stated 

        20        the scope of our direct with respect to what this 

        21        witness has testified to.  Now, Mr. Fleming is raising 

        22        issues that is only going to invoke 90(E).  And I think 

        23        that in the fairness and in the interest of justice, 

        24        that this whole scope of questioning should be excluded.  

        25        He is not entitled to go into this area and he knows it.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: We sustain the objection.

        27   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  I have no further 

        28        questions.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, any re-examination.

         2                           RE-EXAMINATION 

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Witness, in 1994, was Juvénal Kajelijeli appointed or 

         5        re-elected to office?

         6   A.   I did say that he was re-elected bourgmestre.

         7   Q.   Witness, did the assembly in Rwanda assume 

         8        responsibility after the death of the president and 

         9        vice president in April of 1994?

        10   A.   I did say that they assumed their responsibilities since 

        11        the speaker of the national assembly became acting 

        12        president.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Those are the only two questions, but let me 

        14        just check with Mr. Kajelijeli.  

        15        

        16        No further questions on redirect.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Thank you, Counsel.  

        18        

        19        Judge Ramaroson has a question to put to the witness. 

        20   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, Mr. President.

        21        

        22        Witness, you did say that the national council for 

        23        development met for the sub-listing of candidates to 

        24        bourgmestreship.  Was that pre-selection or re-election 

        25        in the case of Kajelijeli in 1994.

        26   THE WITNESS NZIRORERA: Thank you, Your Honour.  As we said a 

        27        while ago, the office of bourgmestre for the Mukingo 

        28        commune became vacant since March '93, and then there 

        29        was an acting bourgmestre.  I also said that the 

        30        government, the then government, sent a circular to all

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        préfectural authorities, I mean préfets to proceed with 

         2        the replacement of all bourgmestres who were dismissed, 

         3        but that was not -- the procedure was not by 

         4        appointment, as was the case in the one party system.  

         5        Since the government of the day was made up of five 

         6        parties, they insisted that there should be a 

         7        competition instead of just election.  And the position 

         8        of bourgmestre then was open to all candidates from 

         9        whatever political party, who felt like putting 

        10        themselves for election.  It was within that context 

        11        that it was requested given the political context of the 

        12        country as at then, that there should be restricted 

        13        consultation through the communal council for 

        14        development, which was a body of the commune.  

        15        

        16        There was what was referred to as the general assembly 

        17        or the communal council.  They are members of the 

        18        technical committee, but there is also the civil society 

        19        and the staff in charge of certain departments in the 

        20        commune.  That's what was called -- that is what was 

        21        called the national council for development.  And this 

        22        national council for development was to conduct a 

        23        pre-selection of candidates; that is, those who want to 

        24        put themselves for election as bourgmestre should apply 

        25        formally, and it was up to this council to put them in 

        26        order of -- to classify them in order -- in a certain 

        27        order and present them to the appointing body.  It was 

        28        in this context that Kajelijeli put himself forward 

        29        together with candidates from other parties, because 

        30        there were several candidates at that time, and

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        Kajelijeli was top of the list and was then elected 

         2        bourgmestre of the commune.  That is how he was 

         3        re-elected  bourgmestre in June 1994.

         4   JUDGE RAMAROSON: My next question is as follows: How many 

         5        days before the approval of the selection, how many days 

         6        elapsed before the approval -- before the approval of 

         7        the ministry of the interior of the appointment, or 

         8        election of Kajelijeli?  Just tell me the number of 

         9        days?  How many days before this pre-selection and the 

        10        appointment by the ministry?

        11   THE WITNESS: I know that the press release for this 

        12        appointment came on 18th June 1994.  The préfecture of 

        13        Ruhengeri had no préfet since 8th April 1994, the préfet 

        14        was assassinated by RPF on the 8th April 1994.  So, the 

        15        position of préfet was also vacant.  So, they had to 

        16        wait for the appointment of a préfet, 17th April 1994, 

        17        to conduct the new procedure for the sub-listing of 

        18        candidates to the office of bourgmestre.  But what I can 

        19        say, Your Honour, is that the official appointment of 

        20        Mr. Kajelijeli occurred on the 17th June 1994. 

        21        Thank you.

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Why do you think that it was in a period of 

        23        elimination and massacre of Tutsis that Kajelijeli was 

        24        appointed as top of the list of candidates to the office 

        25        of bourgmestre?

        26   THE WITNESS: Your Honour, I am not too sure if the 

        27        confirmation you are referring to, or the statement you 

        28        are making is correct, when you say during a period of 

        29        massacre of Tutsi.  We did say it is a period of war, 

        30        but that war did not involve killing of only Tutsi with

         1        the raids that were carried out on -- in February 1993.

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON: We are not going back to 1993, but I will 

         3        mention, for example, the Busogo killings on the Busogo 

         4        hills, or the killings that occurred in the convent of 

         5        the sisters and which occurred just before the 

         6        appointment of Kajelijeli to the office of bourgmestre.

         7   THE WITNESS: Your Honour, may I have the specific date of 

         8        these killings in the Busogo parish?

         9   JUDGE RAMAROSON: It was around 7th, 8th of April.  Let's say 

        10        a month before, or a month and half, the killings 

        11        continued in Rwanda, as you know.  It's not up to me to 

        12        tell you this.

        13   THE WITNESS: But, Your Honour, you do know that Rwanda was in 

        14        a war situation, and there were a lot of war victims; 

        15        Hutus, Tutsi, there were thousands of war displaced 

        16        persons.  So, I really do not see the basis of the 

        17        question, madam.

        18   JUDGE RAMAROSON: The other question, you are saying that 

        19        there were five parties at the time, and that the MRND 

        20        under the president of the republic was a member of the 

        21        MRND; was that it?

        22   THE WITNESS: Your Honour, if I referred to five political 

        23        parties, I was referring specifically to the five 

        24        political parties who were part of the government, but 

        25        in the country there were many more political parties.  

        26        There were 17, about 17.  

        27   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But it were these five political parties who 

        28        requested the speaker of the national assembly to 

        29        establish a government following the death of the 

        30        president; wasn't it?

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   THE WITNESS: That is correct, because it were the five 

         2        political parties who were members of the previous 

         3        government.

         4   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And these five political parties were made 

         5        up of Hutus essentially; there were no Tutsis.

         6   THE WITNESS: Madam, are you talking about political parties, 

         7        or the executive committees of political parties?  

         8        Because in the political parties, there were Tutsis as 

         9        well.

        10   JUDGE RAMAROSON: No, I put the question to you that these 

        11        parties requested the speaker of the national assembly, 

        12        following the death of the president, to form a 

        13        government.  I'm therefore assuming that these parties 

        14        were made up essentially of Hutus, since they requested 

        15        for a government to be formed, the new government I 

        16        mean.

        17   THE WITNESS: Your Honour, I don't know if you are asking me 

        18        to say that they requested the government to be replaced 

        19        because they were Hutus, or saying --

        20   JUDGE RAMAROSON: No, I'm not asking you to say anything.  I'm 

        21        putting a question to you.  So, you can answer that it 

        22        was so or it was not so.

        23   THE WITNESS: Well, if I understood your question clearly, you 

        24        wanted to know if the executive members of those 

        25        political parties were exclusively Hutus.

        26   JUDGE RAMAROSON: No, I'm not talking about the executive 

        27        committees, I'm talking about members of the political 

        28        parties.  Well, okay, if you so wish, the executive 

        29        committees, but I am more interested in the general 

        30        situation.

         1   THE WITNESS: In any case, madam, those who met were members 

         2        of the executive committees of those political parties.

         3   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And were they Hutus, those members?

         4   THE WITNESS: I must say that regarding the MRND, we were all 

         5        Hutus.

         6   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Judge Maqutu has a question to the witness.

         8   JUDGE MAQUTU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         9        

        10        Having been listening to this case for a while, I 

        11        thought you had come to show that Mr. Kajelijeli played 

        12        no part in politics.  Is it what your evidence basically 

        13        is?

        14   THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honour.  I believe my testimony 

        15        here was to show that Kajelijeli was not a founding 

        16        member of MRND.  And that further, he was not a member 

        17        of the préfecture committee of the Ruhengeri commune 

        18        where I myself was the vice president.

        19   JUDGE MAQUTU: I see.  In other words, you are merely giving 

        20        evidence about the official MRND structures and nothing 

        21        else?

        22   THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honour.  I think in as far as 

        23        possible, I have tried to answer all the questions which 

        24        were put to me.  There are some which are connected, 

        25        obviously to my trial, and if I were to answer -- it's 

        26        not because I don't have an answer, it's not because I 

        27        don't have an answer, but I have been made to understand 

        28        that this present trial concerns Mr. Kajelijeli.  And 

        29        that my trial will also follow in that I also have my 

        30        defence.  But as for Kajelijeli whom I know well, within 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        96



          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1        the bodies of the party and amongst which I was 

         2        official, as I have said, I was a member of the 

         3        préfectural committee of Ruhengeri.  I was even a member 

         4        of the party at the commune level.  So, I came here in 

         5        order to shed light for the Chamber regarding 

         6        Kajelijeli's responsibility in terms of administratively 

         7        as well as politically.  And I have said everything I 

         8        know concerning the personality of Mr. Kajelijeli.  

         9        I thank you, Your Honour. 

        10   JUDGE MAQUTU: In short, what I had just understood you to say 

        11        is that your own trial impedes you from telling us what 

        12        you might wish to tell us?

        13   THE WITNESS: Your Honour, I said that, with regard to 

        14        Kajelijeli, he had no role to play within the MRND 

        15        party.  To the contrary, if the Chamber believes that I 

        16        should anticipate and speak of things with which I 

        17        personally I am accused, such as -- for instance, the 

        18        question put by the Prosecutor about the embargo.  That 

        19        doesn't mean that I don't know anything.  I do know.  

        20        And if the Chamber were to decide that I can already 

        21        start my trial, I can go into the matter.  I thank you, 

        22        Your Honour.

        23   JUDGE MAQUTU: You see, why I had to touch is just that you 

        24        brought it up.  I hadn't ask any question about it.  

        25        Thank you.

        26   THE WITNESS: Your Honour, can you ask me the question again, 

        27        now, so I can answer it directly?  Thank you.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Apart from Kajelijeli's role with regard to 

        29        MRND, as you have explained -- I don't know, do you have 

        30        any idea?

         1   THE WITNESS: I didn't understand the question.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Apart from the role, as you have just 

         3        talked about of Kajelijeli in MRND party, as you have 

         4        explained in your evidence, how familiar are you, if you 

         5        can answer that question, with events that could have 

         6        happened in Mukingo around 7th to 8th or 9th of April? 

         7   MR. ROBINSON: Your Honour, with all due respect, that's 

         8        something he is directly charged with in his indictment.  

         9        So, I will prefer him -- require him not to answer that.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  

        11        

        12        Well, Witness, this marks the end of your testimony, we 

        13        thank you.  We always thank the witnesses who come 

        14        before the Trial Chamber.  We shall have time at a later 

        15        stage to consider and review your evidence, together 

        16        with all the evidence that's going to be adduced in the 

        17        course of this trial.  But once again, we thank you. 

        18   MR. ROBINSON: Your Honours, thank you for allowing me to 

        19        participate on his behalf.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        21   THE WITNESS: In turn, I wish to thank you also, Your Honours.  

        22        Thank you very much.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: The next witness is a protected witness, and 

        27        the Defence would be calling Witness KAA.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, is the witness around, or is she around?

         2                  first having been duly sworn, 

         3                      testified as follows:

         6   Q.   Witness, I am going to present you with a document, 

         7        which we would like you to review.  It is in English.

        10        to me.  Do you understand?

        11   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness is asking where he 

        12        should sign the document.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: He should date it and sign it at the bottom 

        14        of the document.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: What does he say about that document? 

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, instructions to the witness was for 

        17        him to review the contents of the document.  If they 

        18        were accurate, he would then sign and date it.  

        19   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness wishes to know what 

        20        the date is today.

         4   MR. KIYEYEU: The registry has taken note, My Lord.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS:  May I proceed?

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, you can proceed, Counsel.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, we are now in open session.  That is the public 

        10        can hear everything that you say.  I would like you to 

        11        listen to my questions very carefully and in your answer 

        12        do not give any information that may reveal your 

        13        identity.  If you feel that you cannot answer a question 

        14        without giving information that may reveal your 

        15        identity, you should so indicate before you answer the 

        16        question and then the Trial Chamber would advise you, 

        17        the President of the Chamber would advise you, on how we 

        18        would proceed.  Do you understand that?

        19   A.   I have understood, Counsel.

        20   Q.   Witness, how old are you?

        21   A.   Today I am 28 years old.

        22   Q.   Is today your birthday?

        23   A.   I didn't reach my 28th year today, but it was during 

        24        this year.

        25   Q.   Now, Witness, without telling us where you live, do you 

        26        presently reside in Rwanda?

        27   A.   Presently, I don't live in Rwanda.

        28   Q.   And how long have you left Rwanda?

        29   A.   I left Rwanda eight years ago.

        30   Q.   Now, Witness, while you were in Rwanda, did you attend

         1        primary school?  And do not tell us where you attended 

         2        primary school, just let us know whether you attended 

         3        primary school.

         4   A.   Yes, I when to primary school.

         5   Q.   Did you complete primary school?

         6   A.   Yes, I did, I finished my primary school education.

         7   Q.   Did you attend secondary school in Rwanda?

         8   A.   Yes, I went into secondary school in Rwanda.

         9   Q.   And did you have any particular vocational interest when 

        10        you were in secondary school?

        11   A.   Yes, while I was in secondary I had a particular plan, a 

        12        goal which I wish to attain.

        13   Q.   And what was that goal?  What did you want to become?

        14   A.   In my desires, I wanted to serve God.  I wanted to 

        15        become a religious person, for instance, by becoming a 

        16        priest.

        17   Q.   And when did you first formulate that desire to become a 

        18        priest?

        19   A.   I cannot tell you the exact year during which I formed 

        20        that desire to become a priest, but for a long time I 

        21        had grown up within a Christian family and my family 

        22        gave me a Christian upbringing.  And whilst I was in 

        23        secondary school, I would serve mass -- I would sing at 

        24        mass, so much so that I wanted to serve the good Lord.  

        25        And my parents who had brought me up as a Christian, 

        26        helped me in that regard -- gave me advice in that 

        27        regard.

         1        1550H

         2   Q.   And what Christian denomination were you?

         3   A.   I was a Catholic.

         4   Q.   Did you pursue your interest in becoming a priest while 

         5        you were in Rwanda, and if so, without telling us the 

         6        name of any institution, how did you pursue that 

         7        objective?

         8   A.   Counsel, I don't quite understand your question.  I have 

         9        testified that whilst I was in Rwanda, I had been 

        10        brought up within a christian family.  So I don't quite 

        11        understand your question.  Can you please repeat it for 

        12        me so that I am able to understand it?

        13   Q.   While you were in Rwanda, did you attend any secondary 

        14        school that was committed to your particular vocation,    

        15        being a priest?

        16   A.   I thank the good Lord because whilst I was in Rwanda, 

        17        the good Lord orientated me and guided me towards 

        18        attaining my objective.  After my primary school 

        19        education, I passed an exam which enabled me to enter an 

        20        institution referred to as the minor seminary.

        21   Q.   Did you graduate from that seminary while you were in 

        22        Rwanda?

        23   A.   I wasn't able to finish my education at the minor 

        24        seminary because in my third year, the war broke out in 

        25        Rwanda.  And we were obliged to leave Rwanda.

        26   Q.   Now, Witness, did you have an occasion to complete your 

        27        secondary school and if so, where did you complete it? 

        28   A.   Because of the war, we were forced to leave Rwanda and 

        29        we went to Zaire, the present day DRC and when we 

        30        arrived there, I continued with my secondary education

         1        and I was able to complete the 6th year of secondary 

         2        education.

         3   Q.   Now, Witness, did you, in fact, continue your objective 

         4        to become a priest?

         5   A.   No, I didn't become a priest as I had wanted to, this is 

         6        because once outside my country, problems increased.  

         7        Sometimes I wouldn't have my schoolfees, but I still 

         8        wanted to become a priest.  I was looking for a school 

         9        at which I could attain my objective but I was 

        10        unsuccessful.

        11   Q.   Witness, you do know Juvenal Kajelijeli?

        12   A.   I know Juvénal Kajelijeli very well.

        13   Q.   When did you first come to know Mr. Kajelijeli?

        14   A.   I cannot tell you the day or the date on which I first 

        15        met him, but I know that while I was still very young I 

        16        could see Kajelijeli pass by but I got to know him 

        17        better while I was in primary school.

        18   Q.   And what was the circumstance under which you came to 

        19        know  Mr. Kajelijeli better in primary school?  Don't 

        20        identify or don't give us name of your primary school.

        21   A.   I am a bit perturbed in having to answer this question 

        22        because you told us that we are in an open session and 

        23        everything said in Court is being followed by the 

        24        public.  So I am a bit disturbed and uncomfortable in 

        25        answering the question for the time being. 

        26   Q.   Witness, did you know Mr. Kajelijeli when he was 

        27        bourgmestre?

        28   A.   I knew Juvénal Kajelijeli whilst he was bourgmestre but 

        29        I told you that I knew even before he became 

        30        bourgmestre.

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   Q.   Did you know what profession he practised prior to 

         2        becoming bourgmestre?

         3   A.   I know that before he took up the office of bourgmestre, 

         4        Juvénal Kajelijeli was an accountant in Nkuli commune  

         5        then he became an accountant at the Mukingo commune and 

         6        then he finally became bourgmestre.

         7   Q.   Did you know any of his two wives?

         8   A.   I know one of Kajelijeli's wives.

         9   Q.   And what was her name?

        10   A.   Her name is Sophie.

        11   Q.   Witness, did you know the years that Kajelijeli served 

        12        as bourgmestre and what was the commune that he served 

        13        as bourgmestre?

        14   A.   He was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune and he 

        15        served in that capacity for between five and six years. 

        16   Q.   Do you know whether in April of 1994, was he bourgmestre 

        17        of Mukingo?

        18   A.   In April 1994, Juvénal Kajelijeli was no longer 

        19        bourgmestre of Mukingo commune since someone else had 

        20        replaced him in that position.

        21   Q.   Witness, do you whether or not, Juvénal Kajelijeli 

        22        anytime in 1994, was in fact back in office as 

        23        bourgmestre of Mukingo?

        24   A.   If my memory serves me right, in June 1994, Juvénal 

        25        Kajelijeli once again became bourgmestre in Mukingo 

        26        commune.

        27   Q.   Witness, if you were asked to look around the courtroom 

        28        today, do you think you would be able to identify 

        29        Mr. Kajelijeli if he were in the courtroom, if he was in 

        30        the courtroom?

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   I would readily recognise him.

         2   Q.   Witness, I would like you to look around the courtroom 

         3        and see if you can identify Mr. Kajelijeli, identify him 

         4        in terms of what he is wearing and where he is sitting 

         5        if there is anyone sitting next to him?  You could stand 

         6        up if you need to.

         7   A.   The main problem is that even if I were to get up, I 

         8        wouldn't be able to look behind the Defence counsel who 

         9        is standing.

        10   Q.   I will move to the side.

        11   A.   I have seen him in the courtroom.  He is wearing 

        12        spectacles. He is also wearing a tie, a white shirt, a 

        13        jacket and I can see that he has became lighter, his 

        14        complexion has became lighter.

        15   Q.   What is the colour of the jacket that you see?

        16   A.   I think his jacket is black.

        17   Q.   And what row is he sitting in?

        18   A.   I can see that he is sitting in the second row towards 

        19        the extreme right, my extreme right.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating Mr. Kajelijeli, Your Honour, 

        21        witness has identified him in court well.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes the witness has identified the Accused in 

        23        the courtroom and let the record so reflect.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am now going into substance 

        25        of the witness's testimony.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Do we now --

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: No, we will take a -- we can take a break 

        29        here.  We will continue to be in open session, Counsel?

         2        minutes and come back to continue with the testimony of 

         3        this witness.  It will resume these proceedings at half

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: This will be slightly more than 15 minutes.  

         7        (Court recessed between 1650H and 1630)

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Professor 

         9        Hinds, Learned Counsel, can you continue your 

        10        examination-in-chief with the witness?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Witness, when did you first learn of the president's 

        14        death?

        15   A.   I heard of the death of the president of the republic 

        16        for the first time on the 7th of April around 5am, 6 am 

        17        corrects the interpreter, 6 am.

        18   Q.   Now, where were you when you heard the news and do not 

        19        tell us the cellule or secteur or commune that you were 

        20        in, but where were you?

        21   A.   I was at home and I was still in bed and I heard the 

        22        news on Radio Rwanda.

        23   Q.   And who was at home with you in terms of family members 

        24        without giving us their names?

        25   A.   I was at home together which my sisters and my 

        26        grandmother.

        27   Q.   And where were your parents at that time?

        28   A.   At that time my parents were deed.

        29   Q.   Do you recall what information you got on the radio 

        30        concerning the death of the president?

         1   A.   The news referred to the situation in which the country 

         2        had been plunged and the fact that the whole country was 

         3        mourning the death of the president of the republic 

         4        together with the president of Burundi as well as their 

         5        entourage during an accident.  That is the press release 

         6        also advised people on what to do that they should 

         7        remain calm, and that people were urged to stay at home.

         8   Q.   Now, Witness, after hearing the news, how did you feel 

         9        at that time?

        10   A.   When I heard the news, I was surprised to hear such a 

        11        news.  I was afraid and I called out my sisters since I 

        12        had a radio and i told them about the news item and 

        13        everybody in the house was afraid.

        14   Q.   Why you were afraid?

        15   A.   I was afraid because of the news I heard.  It's not very 

        16        usual to the hear about the death of a president, 

        17        besides the country was in a state of war.  So I was 

        18        afraid that other unfortunate incidents may follow.

        19   Q.   What do you mean by the country was in a state of war?

        20   A.   I said that the country was in state of war because the 

        21        war was still going on.  There were parts of the country 

        22        which were already occupied by the RPF and which were 

        23        neighbouring to my own locality and those are the things 

        24        that contributed to the fear that I had at the time.

         1         1640H

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: What part of the country were you aware of 

         3        on the morning of April 7th 1994 that were occupied by 

         4        the RPF?

         5   A.   Let me start with Ruhengeri, which is my native region, 

         6        and I will say that the communes of Nkumba, Kidaho, 

         7        Butaro and Kinigi were all occupied by the RPF.  Nkumba 

         8        is spelt, N-K-U-M-B-A.  Kidaho is, K-I-D-A-H-O.  Butaro, 

         9        B-U-T-A-R-O.  Kinigi, K-I-N-I-G-I.

        10   Q.   Witness, what, if anything, did you do after you learned 

        11        of the death of the president on the radio?

        12   A.   After I heard the news and informed my sisters, it was 

        13        necessary to go to my paternal uncles to find out if 

        14        they had also heard the news, and that is what I did.

        15   Q.   How far were your paternal uncles from your residence 

        16        compared to where you resided in terms of walking 

        17        distance?

        18   A.   No, the distance between the two places is not a great 

        19        distance.  It a distance you can cover in a minute or 

        20        two.

        21   Q.   When you -- did you eventually arrive at your uncle's 

        22        place?

        23   A.   When I got to their house, they told me that they had 

        24        heard the news on the radio, and we then started 

        25        discussing the events.

        26   Q.   Now, when you say they told you, could you tell the 

        27        Trial Chamber with whom you were having your 

        28        conversation at your uncle's home?

        29   A.   In my paternal uncle's home, there was my paternal uncle 

        30        himself, his wife and children.

         1   Q.   And what, if anything, was specifically discussed with 

         2        those relatives at your uncle's home?

         3   A.   Our discussions focused on the death of the President 

         4        which we had just heard and we were wondering what could 

         5        be the consequences of his death.  For example, we were 

         6        saying that the RPF positions were close to our 

         7        locality, and we wondered what was going to happen, and 

         8        then started considering what we should do in relation 

         9        to the prevailing situation; whether we should continue 

        10        observing the instructions that were given in the press 

        11        release, that is, to stay at home, given the prevailing 

        12        situation.  This is the kind of situation that went on.

        13   Q.   Witness, why were you at that time concerned about the 

        14        RPF's position in your community after the death of the 

        15        President?

        16   A.   We were concerned about information we gathered from 

        17        other people in relation to what we, ourselves saw, 

        18        particularly the manner in which the RPF forces were 

        19        killing people, torturing people.  And when we heard of 

        20        the death of the president we thought that the war was 

        21        going to start in our locality, given the fact that even 

        22        before the death of the President there were 

        23        infiltrations by RPF members who had come to our 

        24        locality to gather information on the houses of 

        25        authorities, intellectuals, within the locality.  We 

        26        were, therefore, afraid that following what had happened 

        27        the RPF members who normally would come to our locality 

        28        were going to come and harm us.

        29   Q.   Now, Witness, on April 7th of 1994, were you enrolled in 

        30        secondary school?

          KAJELIJELI                                       3 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   As at that date I was attending a secondary school, and 

         2        at that particular time, we were on holidays, getting 

         3        ready to go back to school at the end of the holidays.

         4   Q.   Witness, did there come a time when you made a decision 

         5        with respect to following the orders and directives that 

         6        you heard on the radio?

         7   A.   Following the discussion that I had with my paternal 

         8        uncle, there were other people who came, because there 

         9        is a road that goes -- a road in front of my paternal 

        10        uncle's house.  So, there were people passing by and 

        11        some people had heard about the news of the president's 

        12        death.  Others had not heard it.  As and when these 

        13        people were arriving, we discussed.  Therefore, we did 

        14        not respect the directives that were given on the radio, 

        15        we were in a state of confusion, and we thought it wise 

        16        to go and get information on what we could do given the 

        17        situation -- to get information from people we thought 

        18        could advise us on what to do.

        19   Q.   Now, Witness, when you talk about people passing by, 

        20        were these individuals whom you knew prior to that time?  

        21        Had you seen these individuals?

        22   A.   These are people of the same locality, people of my age 

        23        and some were friends.  In short, these were people I 

        24        knew.

        25   Q.   Now, how many of these individuals stopped so that you 

        26        could have discussions with them?

        27   A.   As I said, among these people who were arriving, as soon 

        28        as they heard the news, some of them would go back home 

        29        and some would stay behind.  In fact, these are the 

        30        people who lived in houses that are neighbouring to the

         1        one in which I was.  So I stayed there with people of my 

         2        age group.  It is mainly people of my age group who 

         3        remained with me.

         4   Q.   And at that time how old were you?

         5   A.   At that time I was 20 years old.

         6   Q.   Now, Witness, what steps, if any, did you take to obtain 

         7        additional information concerning the experience you 

         8        were experiencing?

         9   A.   We agreed, I mean, myself and those people who were with 

        10        me, we decided to go and gather additional information 

        11        on the prevailing situation.  So we went to some 

        12        soldiers who were close to the Primary school that I 

        13        attended.

        14   Q.   And how many individuals plus yourself, went to this 

        15        particular location?

        16   A.   There were four of us.  We didn't want to go in a large 

        17        group because we were aware of the fact that that was 

        18        contrary to the directives that were given on the radio.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Were you all of the same sex?

        22   A.   No, there were girls as well.

        23   Q.   How many girls or young women were there within the 

        24        group?

        25   A.   There were two girls and two boys.

        26   Q.   Now, Witness, did there come a time when you arrived at 

        27        the location you were going to get this additional 

        28        information?

        29   A.   We got to the place and we asked the people we met -- we 

        30        were asking information from the people we met and we

         1        told them that we had just heard some information about 

         2        the death of the president and that since they were in 

         3        charge of our security they would tell us what we should 

         4        do.  They then told us to go home and respect the 

         5        directives that were given on the radio.

         6   Q.   Now, who were these people who gave you this advice?  

         7        You shouldn't mention their names, but what was their 

         8        profession?

         9   A.   These were soldiers who were guarding a position which 

        10        was close to the primary school that I attended.

        11   Q.   Did you follow the advice and recommendations of the 

        12        soldiers?

        13   A.   We had no choice but to respect the advice that they 

        14        gave us and each one of us went home.

        15   Q.   Did you, in fact, reach your home?

        16   A.   No, we didn't get home, because when we got a little 

        17        further away we heard explosions further ahead in the 

        18        direction of Byangabo.  We heard explosions and 

        19        gunshots.

        20   Q.   Around what time was that?  Do you know?

        21   A.   It was around 8:00 in the morning, between 7:30 and 8:00 

        22        in the morning.

        23   Q.   Now, were you wearing a watch -- could you tell us 

        24        whether the time you are giving is an approximation, or 

        25        do you know the exact time?

        26   A.   No, it is not an exact time.  I was not wearing a watch 

        27        at the time.  This is an estimate I am giving you.  I 

        28        think it was between 8:00 -- I think it as around 

        29        8 o'clock in the morning.

        30   Q.   Now, Witness, what, if anything, did you do after you

         1        say you heard those explosions coming from the direction 

         2        of Byangabo?

         3   A.   When we heard the explosions we thought that it was the 

         4        war.  We said that it was the war which was breaking out 

         5        again.  We were afraid that we decided to go down 

         6        towards the location and find more.

         7   Q.   When you say "we", how many of the group decided to go 

         8        down to see what was happening?

         9   A.   I am referring to myself and the other young boy and the 

        10        two girls who made up the group.

        11   Q.   Now, Witness, what road did you take in going towards 

        12        this direction which you heard those explosions?

        13   A.   We didn't go back home.  And close to my house there 

        14        were several paths.  We took one which goes down towards 

        15        Byangabo.

        16   Q.   Now, that road you took going down towards Byangabo, 

        17        does that road lead to ISAE?

        18   A.   Yes, we took the road from my home towards Byangabo and 

        19        it is the same road that passed by ISAE.

        20   Q.   Now, witness, at the time that you heard those 

        21        explosions, did you know that the explosions were coming 

        22        from Byangabo?

        23   A.   My home is placed on higher ground in relation to 

        24        Byangabo; Byangabo is lower.  And from my home one can 

        25        see vehicles passing by Byangabo.  So, when we heard 

        26        these gunshots and the grenade explosions, we thought 

        27        that that noise was coming from the place where Tutsis 

        28        lived because at that time, we had been able to see 

        29        smoke coming out of some houses, and the explosions were 

        30        also coming from that location -- same location where

         1        the Tutsis lived.

         2   Q.   And what was the location that you knew that time 7th of 

         3        April 1994 that Tutsis lived in?

         4   A.   Apart from some Tutsis who had houses scattered around, 

         5        there were Tutsis who were concentrated in Byangabo in 

         6        particular in the Rwankeri, as well as the Busogo area, 

         7        in areas in the parish.

         8   Q.   Now, Witness, as you took the road that you described 

         9        going towards Byangabo, how far did you travel on that 

        10        road, on the morning of April the 7th?

        11   A.   We went down and when we came to a folk in the road 

        12        where there is a road which leads to Busogo Parish, we 

        13        went for about 15 to 20 meters, and there we saw a crowd 

        14        which was coming towards us.

        15   Q.   Now, could you describe this crowd you saw coming 

        16        towards you?  What were these people wearing, and could 

        17        you describe to the Trial Chamber whether any of these 

        18        people had anything that could be characterised as 

        19        weapons?

        20   A.   It was a large crowd made up of people wearing military 

        21        uniform, others were wearing ordinary clothing.  Some of 

        22        them were carrying clubs, others sticks or stones.  It 

        23        was a large crowd.

        24   Q.   Now, Witness, did the people you say you saw in military 

        25        uniforms, were they carrying any weapons?

        26   A.   Yes, these soldiers were carrying guns as well as 

        27        grenades to their belts at the waist and others, the 

        28        civilians, were carrying stones, machetes and the other 

        29        weapons I mentioned.

        30   Q.   Now, Witness, when you saw these individuals, were they

         1        coming towards you or travelling away from you?

         2   A.   As I have testified, after we passed the road going 

         3        towards the parish and as we continued to go down 

         4        Rwankeri, from where we could see the smoke, we saw this 

         5        crowd coming and we were going in the opposite 

         6        direction.  In other words, they were coming towards us 

         7        and we were going towards them.  And since we could 

         8        realise that this was a crowd which did not have good 

         9        intentions, given the weapons they were carrying, we 

        10        moved away from the road in order to let them pass by.

        11   Q.   How did you draw the conclusion that their intentions 

        12        were not good?

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Translate slowly; it is rather a long answer, 

        14        Interpreter.

        15   THE WITNESS: It was obvious because these people were 

        16        carrying machetes, clubs, and other weapons, and they 

        17        were showing -- they were saying, "We have been chased 

        18        away from our homes and now our president has been 

        19        killed".  Since these people were agitated and they had 

        20        weapons in their hands, we said to ourselves, that these 

        21        people were not up to any good.

        22   Q.   Now, Witness, you said the people were chanting, "we 

        23        have been chased away from our homes," did you make any 

        24        determination at the time whether these people were 

        25        displaced individuals?

        26   A.   Yes, in our region, as well as Byangabo, just as at 

        27        ISAE, and at the parish there had been people who came 

        28        from the commune occupied by the RPF as I have said, 

        29        these people came and they were singing about their 

        30        distress.

         1   Q.   Now, Witness, could you tell the Chamber, if you can, 

         2        the number of the estimated people you saw coming 

         3        towards you at that time?

         4   A.   It is not easy to tell how many they were, because these 

         5        people were very many, I wouldn't be able to give you an 

         6        estimate of their numbers.

         7   Q.   Were they in their hundreds or just in tens of people?

         8   A.   Given that these people were in separate groups, I could 

         9        say that they were in their thousands.

        10   Q.   Now, Witness, as you saw the group coming towards you, 

        11        did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli within their midst?

        12   A.   No, when we saw this group coming towards us, I did not 

        13        see Juvénal Kajelijeli, because I know him very well.

        14   Q.   On April 7th 1994, did you know the type of vehicle 

        15        Juvénal Kajelijeli drove?

        16   A.   When he was removed from the office of the bourgmestre, 

        17        and let me stipulate that in 1994, Juvénal Kajelijeli 

        18        used the vehicle belonging to the ESTB Secondary School 

        19        which was a red Hilux; if my memory serves me right.

        20   Q.   Did you see that vehicle on the morning of April 7th 

        21        when you saw the crowd coming towards you?

        22   A.   That morning I did not see any vehicle, or any other 

        23        vehicle on that road.

        24   Q.   Witness, do you know the commune vehicle, that is, on 

        25        April 7, l994 -- did you know the commune vehicle, that 

        26        is, the vehicle of Mukingo commune?

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, we will be stopping at about 5:30, 

        28        then you can organise to round up your work for today.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        30   THE WITNESS: I have told you that I did not see any other

         1        vehicle, I did not see any vehicle that morning, and 

         2        even the vehicle belonging to the commune, I did not see 

         3        it.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is the final question on this 

         5        particular issue, Your Honour.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we stop here and continue our work 

         7        tomorrow.  Interpreter, could you advise the witness 

         8        that we will resume our work tomorrow at 9:00.  And that 

         9        since he is continuing to testify, he should not discuss 

        10        his evidence with anybody else outside Court until we 

        11        meet tomorrow in the morning.

        12        

        13        So, until tomorrow morning at 9:00, these proceedings 

        14        stand adjourned.

        15   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, before we go, do we yet know which 

        16        day the holiday is going to be this week?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't know.  At least the Trial Chamber is 

        18        not fully appraised of that.  There was some mention 

        19        about those holidays, Thursday being mentioned -- is it 

        20        Thursday or Friday?

        21   MR. FLEMING: Thursday and Friday have been mentioned, and we  

        22        are uncertain as to what date it might be, and certainly 

        23        Monday is a holiday.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, that is the 9th December.

        25   MR. FLEMING: Yes, thank you, Your Honours.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: So, we are trying as much as possible, 

        27        perhaps, if we could, and if the working days go on up 

        28        to Thursday, and we should be able to finish the 

        29        witnesses which could have been listed for this week.  

        30        We still have two more witnesses.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: There is no question about that, 

         2        Your Honour.  In fact, we are ahead of schedule as it 

         3        stands right now.  We are ahead of schedule.  We had 

         4        scheduled one witness per day, and we are now on the 

         5        third witness on the second day.  So, we are ahead of 

         6        schedule.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we have to be because we will have 

         8        problems for next week as well in the sense that we will 

         9        have possibly, Monday off, that is next week.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: No problem there, Your Honour, we are, 

        11        again, on schedule, we have witnesses -- they are not 

        12        here now, but I am told by witness protection unit that 

        13        they will be here.  We have the witnesses certainly, for 

        14        next week.  We have four witnesses and we can take one 

        15        of them this week.  If we are through with the four 

        16        witnesses we could begin the fifth witness this week.  

        17        It all depends upon the situation, but I think that we 

        18        are moving ahead of schedule.  I don't see any problems 

        19        at all.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming, do you have any particular issue 

        21        in raising these public holidays?

        22   MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honour, it is just if it is Thursday we 

        23        obviously lose a day, whereas if it is Friday, we don't.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: We hope -- well, I don't know how we can put 

        25        it.  So, let us see how -- I don't know.  Is it in the 

        26        calendar?  Of course, the Tribunal would be able to say 

        27        that by the end of the day tomorrow, I suppose -- I 

        28        hope.  That is all I can say for the time being.  But 

        29        registry, can you follow it up?  I think that it is the 

        30        issue that at least you can gather the information and

         1        indicate to the Trial Chamber, as well as to counsels 

         2        how things are likely to be for Thursday and Friday -- 

         3        not now, but you can look it up for those concerned.

         4   MR. KIYEYEU: We will make a follow up, My Lord.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, that said then; until tomorrow at 

         6        9:00, these proceedings stand adjourned.
