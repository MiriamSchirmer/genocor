P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MS. NTILATWA:  
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Francis Emile Short (sic), and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday -- Thursday, 18th May 2006 for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As usual, the appearances are the same.  

Mr. Issa.  Mr. Issa, please.  

I would like to make a statement outside of the hearing of the witness.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Robinson, we have decided to let you proceed in open session.  But the witness has been tripping.  We don't attribute any fault to you for that, but the fault is not relevant in this matter.  If the witness does trip, we are going to have to go into closed session.  But, we will try to see how far we can go. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I appreciate that, Mr. President.  I'm going to try to keep him on a very short leash.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you bring the witness back in, please.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony's going to continue this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  

We are going to resume in open session, and I have to remind you of the importance of playing your part in ensuring that the protective order we have made against you works properly.  So, you have to be careful how you answer your questions, not to make statements which are capable of revealing your identity.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, are you ready?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

First of all, let me once again just place on the record my objection of proceeding in the absence of a ruling by Trial Chamber I giving the access to material from closed sessions, which is really going to handicap me today.  And also in the absence of a ruling on jurisdiction by this Trial Chamber.  

Next, I would like to turn to offer an exhibit.  We had the handwritten document as Exhibit D. NZ99, and it was placed under seal.  I now have a typed version, which I have given a copy to Mr. Webster.  I am asking that the handwritten document now be marked Exhibit D. NZ99, still under seal, and the typed version, which I will now hand to the registrar, be admitted as Exhibit 99B (sic), not under seal.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have the same objection that I raised yesterday, Your Honour.  I don't think I need to go any further than that.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
The text of the message that's now being offered was already read in open court.  I don't see any reason why the exhibit cannot be open, since it's not in handwriting.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we don't really see the need for doing this.  Yesterday, when Mr. Webster had suggested this may happen, we didn't take him seriously at all.  The -- the evidence is on record, and we don't -- I don't see the value of duplicating the testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, it's not duplicating the testimony, it's duplicating an exhibit that's already admitted, and it's a question of giving the public access to an exhibit that's already admitted.  It's really -- I mean, we have to fight for everything to be open here.  It's very difficult -- this is a public trial, it's -- everything that possibly could be open to the public should be.  That should be the premise that we're all operating under.  

So, here we have an exhibit, you had a legitimate reason for wanting it under seal; it was in handwriting so it might lead to identification of the witness.  Now we have the same document, it's not in handwriting, there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't be admitted.  This is part of history.  So, we should be going to great lengths to make all of this transparent and available to the public.  And it's a constant struggle for us to -- just to have our side presented publicly.  And it shouldn't be that way.  

So, I really don't think it's duplicative.  It's an exhibit that's already in evidence, and it's simply making an exhibit in a form that can be made available for the public, historians, and whoever else is interested in these proceedings.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, you have expressed discontent with deferred rulings.  But, as presently advised, we are not going to admit it, no.  We may come back to it later.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, thank you, Mr. President.  Can we have your staff make a note to make sure that we have a decision on this, because probably we'd ask for certification to appeal if the exhibit is not admitted.  So, we'd like at some point to have a definitive ruling on this.  But for now I'll accept to do that, to move on.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, you don't have to keep on threatening the Court.  I mean, we're doing what we think is right, rather than acting out of the fear of the possibility of appeal.  We recognise appeal is part of the process and you have a right to appeal.  But it's not appropriate for you to keep on including that as a reason for decision making.  We think it's not -- it's discourteous.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Honestly, I didn't mean it for that.  I just mean that I was just waiting for the time at which my seven days would run, so I could make sure that there was some definite time.  But I realise you almost never grant a certification to appeal, so I realise it isn't a problem for you that we want to appeal, so I'm not saying it in that vein.  

Now, if my exhibit (sic) number 4 from the bundle that was placed in front of the registry can be placed in front of the witness.  
WITNESS ZF
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ZF, good morning.  How are you? 
A.	Good morning, good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I wanted to try to keep the Kinyarwanda booth awake this morning.  So it was a good job by the English interpreter. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Murakoze.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Murakoze na we. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ZF, we're going to ask you to answer my questions very, very succinctly so that we don't compromise your identity.  I've placed in front of you a document which is in English, and I'm going to read it to you, so it's translated into French.  And then I'm going to ask you whether or not this was a message which was intercepted on the 7th of April 1994, and then I'm going to ask you to simply answer, "yes", "no", or "I don't know".  So, the text is as follows.  "It is an unforgettable" --
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, if I could interrupt for one second.  I think this was the point at which we left off yesterday, and I thought the Court was going to come back and give us some directions on how we would proceed with the exhibits (sic) 4, 5 and 6 of Mr. Robinson's bundle.  So do we need to hear something from the Court, or is this the way that we should proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We didn't see any legal objection to these documents going on -- going in once they formed part of the witness' recollection, and this does not seem to be an inappropriate way to approach this evidence.  The issue is, does he recognise, or recollect, that these messages were intercepted, or not?  If he does so, we will admit them in evidence.  If not, then we don't.  

You may proceed, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, the text of this message is as follows:  "It is an unforgettable day for us, and also for our ethnic group.  If the president of the Republic has been killed, we can say we are sure of victory.  We have heard the voice of Radio Rwanda saying that the president of Burundi is dead by an accident.  It is not a bad thing for us.  The invincible is dead.  In brief, we are congratulating the action groups.  The victory has been gained over the enemy of courage."  

So, that is the text of the document that's before you, Witness ZF.  And my question to you now is whether or not this was a message intercepted on the 7th of April 1994; yes, no, or I don't know.  
A.	Well, Counsel, for the time being I no longer recall.  
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  Now, I'm going to have you shown some pieces of paper from a time when you were asked the very same question in 2001.  And I'm just going to ask the registry to show you these papers and have you read them to yourself.  

Witness ZF, just answer this yes or no, please.  Have you now read the document -- the papers that I've placed in front of you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And, having read that material, can you now say that the message that I read out a few minutes ago was in fact intercepted on the 7th of April 1994; yes, no, or -- yes or no?  
A.	Please, Counsel, in respect of the answer I want to give, I don't see how yes or no fits.  I don't know if there's another answer I could give you.  
Q.	Well, you can answer as you wish, just be very careful not to reveal your identity or your function at the time.  
A.	Because what you read to me before is not what I have read just now.  It is a version.  But what I have read just now is another version. 
Q.	Okay, that -- thank you very much for that clarification, and we can solve that problem.  So that's okay.  So, looking at the papers in front of you, what I have done is I have taken the English transcript of those very same papers, and I have read the message as it was translated into English.  So, what I would like you to do now is to read for us, beginning on the first page where the message begins.  In English it says, "It's an unforgettable day."  So, you'll see the word "jour" in French in that first sentence.  And so what I would like you to do is read that message.  

And I believe it continues further on, because there's a question -- there's -- one sentence, then a question being asked of you, and then it's stated that, "The message continues as follows", and the rest of the message is read.  And then you're asked again if you remember this message.  

So, what I would like you to do is to read the French text of that first message as you -- as you remember it, or as it's now recorded there.  And I'm meaning that you should read it out loud.  
A.	"It is an unforgettable date for us, and even for our ethnic group.  If the president of the Republic is killed, and we can say we are sure of victory."  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, if you look down at the -- there was a question asked of you, and you give an answer, and then the person says that, "The message continues as follows."  So I want you to start to read again where the questioner continues with the message, and to me it appears, in English at least, "We have heard the voice of Radio Rwanda."  So if you could find that portion and read the rest of the message.  
A.	"We have heard the voice of Radio Rwanda saying that the tyrant and the president of Burundi are -- have died through an unfortunate accident.  It is not easy for us; we cannot believe it."  
Q.	Keep reading, please.  
A.	"In other words, the invincible is dead.  Briefly, we congratulate the forward action groups.  The morale is high; we have been victorious over the others."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could we ask the Kinyarwanda bit to be repeated, please, let the Kinyarwanda booth repeat, maybe, the translation.
  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness ZF, if you could just read the four Kinyarwanda words that appear.  Just repeat that, please.  
A.	The part coming afterwards, or the part in Kinyarwanda?  
Q.	The part in Kinyarwanda.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Perhaps everything after the Kinyarwanda part, excuse me.  
THE WITNESS: 
"The invincible who defied the evildoers and traitors."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, and now can you read the rest in French, after those four Kinyarwanda words.  
A.	In brackets, "The invincible is dead," close brackets.  "In brief, we congratulate the in depth forward action groups, victorious -- victory has given us the advantage over the others; our morale is high."  
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness ZF.  Now, just to make sure, I'm going to read this back to you in English so that we know that we have an accurate record of this message.  So -- and I want to thank you for calling these -- this difference to the attention, because the English translation in the documents was not as good as what we've now had.  And so you did a very good job to call that to our attention.  

So, as I now have recorded the translation -- you correct me if I'm wrong -- it says that, "It is an unforgettable date for us, and even for our ethnic group.  If the president of the Republic is killed, we can say we are sure of victory.  We have heard the voice of Radio Rwanda saying that the tyrant and the president of Burundi have died through an unfortunate accident.  It is not easy for us; we cannot believe it.  The invincible who defied the evildoers and traitors... the invincible is dead.  Briefly, we congratulate -- we congratulate the in depth forward action groups.  The morale" -- excuse me.  "Victory has given us the advantage over the others; our morale is high."  

So, Witness ZF, my question to you is, now that you have read what you've read, and we've translated it, is this a message which was intercepted on the 7th of April 1994?  Just say yes, no, or I don't know.  
A.	Yes.  Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay, thank you, Witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm going to retype exhibit (sic) number 4 and offer it as an exhibit tomorrow morning or later today.  So we'll pass that document for the moment.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, if document number 5 can be placed before the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know, Mr. Robinson, this brings up this same question that we're thinking about.  We haven't ruled on it yet.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
As to the necessity for a written exhibit?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, duplication of testimony.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ZF, now what I would like you to do is continue -- first of all, before you look at the pages from earlier testimony, I'm going to ask you a question -- I'm going to read you an intercepted message and ask you if you can recall whether this was a message that was intercepted on 7 April.  And if it turns out that you are unable to recall, we'll go through the same procedure of having you try to refresh your recollection from those papers.  

But first I'll read you the message, and tell me whether you can recall.  It starts saying, "RMT from 6th April at 9.  The meeting, which is going to take place in Mulindi today, Thursday, 7 April 1994, is cancelled.  Thank you and congratulate you for yesterday's operation.  You will be paid back.  All the units should be on alert.  The war is beginning."  

So, my question to you, Witness ZF, is whether or not you recall this message having been intercepted on 7 April 1994? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, could you ask the witness to repeat.  I'm very sorry, Mr. President, there's a little problem here.  Could we just ask the witness to repeat that, please.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, you are being asked to repeat the answer that you just gave because of a translation problem.  
A.	Counsel, I don't -- I don't recall this version.  I -- it is not -- this is not familiar. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  Now, I'm going to ask you to look at those papers that are before you in French, the transcript of your earlier testimony, and if you just look where we left off the last time when we had read the earlier message, there was a question to you about that message.  And then the questioner said, "Another message, and the content is as follows", and he started to read it.  And it begins with the words:  "RMT from 6th April 1994 at 9."  So, why don't you read that first to yourself, and tell me when you're finished reading the text of that message, and what your answer was, when asked if you remember at that message.  

So, Witness ZF, I'm just asking you for the moment, have you now read the message beginning, "RMT from 6th April 1994", as it was put to you in the question during the former testimony, and your answer about whether you recall that message?  I'm just asking you now whether you have read that; yes or no?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, thank you.  And having read that message, have you -- can you now say that that was a message -- that what I've read to you is a message that was intercepted on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I'm going to offer my document number 5 as Exhibit D. NZ100.  And I want to just give you a small explanation for why I think this is important that it be done this way.  And that is that, later on, it may very well be that these messages are discussed by other witnesses, particularly an expert witness that may be called by the Defence.  And it would be a lot simpler if we could, during the course of that expert or other person's testimony, or maybe even during cross-examination of Prosecution experts, if we could show them an exhibit that has the text of the message, rather than having to dig up the transcript of the testimony and question-answer, question-answer, and present the text to the witness that way.  So I think it would be simpler if we admitted the text of the message as an exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for saying that.  It's a much better reason than publication.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I will simply note my objection for the record for this whole line of questioning, and for the other three or four exhibits that are probably going to come in.  And I would also indicate that the English translations here are pretty poor.  That may be a reason why the witness is having difficulty recognising what's been placed before him, because even as I look at what Mr. Robinson has offered as D. NZ 100, it does not correspond word for word to what we see in the French text.  So maybe we should revisit that issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just for clarification, doesn't it confirm with what the witness just said in the witness box?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It does, but the question to him was whether -- I think Mr. Webster has a good point.  Because I asked this witness whether what I read to him is what was the text of the message, and he said yes.  But, to be more accurate, if there is some difference between the French and the English, I think it's better for the witness to read the French in the record, I will correct this exhibit, and we will -- we can admit the exhibit in its corrected form.  Because what I'm working from are the two -- is the translation -- official translation by the -- of the transcript of what he said earlier.  If that official translation is not correct, then we ought to have the correct version.  

So, what I would like to do, then, is have the witness read from those -- that prior testimony, the exact text of the message, and I will make any corrections on my exhibit, and then I will submit the exhibit to you as corrected, so we have an accurate translation.  If there's any -- if there's a question about it, then it seems like it should be done that way.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question of accuracy is obviously important.  So you can proceed and let the witness read the French version into the record.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ZF, what I'm going to ask you to do is read in French, to us, the message -- the text of the message beginning with the words:  "RMT from 6th April at 9."  So, I want you to read it out loud.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness' microphone is not on.  Issa, please.  Oh, sorry.  
THE WITNESS: 
"The meeting due to be held in Mulindi today, 7th of April 1994, is cancelled.  I thank you and congratulate you for yesterday's operation.  For the time being, the reward is due to you.  All units must be on the alert; the war is beginning."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I will offer this exhibit at a later time after I've had a chance to retype it according to the translation we've just had.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But I want to ask you just about this message, Witness ZF.  First of all, can we agree that Mulindi was the headquarters of the Rwandan patriotic army as of 7 April 1994?  Just yes or no, or I don't know.  
A.	I have heard it said. 
Q.	Okay.  And when the person who's giving the message congratulates them for yesterday's operation, in the context of this message, discussing a meeting held -- to be held in Mulindi, would you agree that it appears that this confirms that the RPF was responsible for the shooting down of the president's plane on the 6th of April?  
A.	I don't know, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you think of any other explanation for these words?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, this witness is not an expert.  I think you're pushing him too far.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I will withdraw that question.  We can move on.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you Witness ZF.  I'm going to now ask to have the document number 6 placed in front of you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, while that's being done, I just want to let you know that I'm doing this by the book, in the sense that I'm reading him the message first to establish whether or not he has a present recollection, and then once he doesn't, I'm going to the text.  And so I'm going to continue to do that unless you -- it's obviously cumbersome, because we're almost duplicating it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, the problem is that there's a suggestion that there's translation inaccuracies.  So that, in fact, is the position.  Why not go straight to his recollection, whether it's assisted or unassisted?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm willing to do that, but it's my understanding that formally I'm required first to establish that he doesn't have a recollection of the message, and only then can I try to refresh his recollection.  But if we can skip that step, I think it would be better.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think he can skip that step by having your co-counsel read the original text in its French version, and then we would hear it in English, it would be on the record, and then we wouldn't have to go back and forth.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That would save time, because there's no real issue involved in doing it this way.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I have only one copy of that.  So if it's okay, I think I will just ask the witness to read it, since he has the copy in front of him.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ZF, what I would like you to do now is, looking to the papers in French that you have, there comes a time after the discussion of the second message when the questioner reads you the content of the third message.  And it begins with the words:  "Assigned to you the mission."  Do you have that there?  
A.	I'm still looking for it, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  
A.	If you could give me the number -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I think he means the number of the line. 
THE WITNESS: 
 -- it would be easier to find it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe I can assist.  I have a copy here; I've highlighted the portion.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
But I'll need that back when he finishes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Mr. ZF, my bilingual colleague has given you the highlighted portion of the part I would like you to read.  So can you simply read that out loud to us, beginning with the words:  "Assigned to you the mission."  
A.	"Assign you the mission to complete the project as I have specified.  The plan is nearly accomplished.  The guerrillas (Hutu) have failed, and the Bergeronette (Tutsi) have won the game."  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Or "the match", "the game".  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much.  And can you say yes or no; is this a message which was intercepted on 7 April 1994?  
A.	Counsel, you ask me to say either yes or no, but sometimes I don't feel either is appropriate.  So, I don't know what, in this particular instance, I can answer for the time being.  I don't see how to say yes or no or I don't know.  
Q.	Okay.  Well I just don't want you to say anything that's going to reveal your identity, but you're free to answer your question.  But let me make my question a little bit more specific.  So, now that you have read the transcript of what you were asked before, and what you answered, I -- can you tell us, was this message intercepted on 7 April 1994? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, but as a version. 
Q.	Okay.  And can you explain what you mean by "as a version"?  

Actually, I'm going to withdraw that question.  I think that might give an answer that would be -- give your occupation.  So let's just move on and look at the next exhibit (sic), which is number 7.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If we're going to proceed in the same manner, I can hand up my text, and I will ask Issa to bring it back.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ZF, this is now the last message, and there's a portion of the text on your prior testimony when the questioner says the words:  "Last message", and he reads the contents.  And it starts:  "We thought that the 6 April 1994 plan".  So, can you read the text of that message, as it appears in French?  
A.	"We thought that the 6th of April 1994 plan was going on all right and within the institutional framework provided.  But the measures taken on the night of the 6th by the authorities and the white person were moral arrangements" -- or, rather, "normal" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Corrects the witness.  
THE WITNESS:  
-- "unfortunately, the measures taken to avoid any failure were not -- or, were only partially implemented."  That is it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ZF.  And now my question to you, having read the text of that message, and your answer, when you were asked if you remembered that message, can you now tell us whether or not this was a message intercepted on the 7th of April; yes or no?  
A.	Counsel, I no longer recall. 
Q.	And having read the testimony you gave in 2001, particularly when you were asked, "Do you remember this message?", and you answered, "Yes", does that refresh your recollection as to whether or not in fact this was a message which had been intercepted on the 7th of April?  
A.	Counsel, my answer is that, at this point in time, I no longer recall.  I would need all the parts in order to remember.  There is some confusion, because there are many parties (sic), and I do not remember how the text flows.  I do not remember the chronological order of the different parts.  
Q.	Very well.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So, Mr. President, I would be asking that the text of this message be admitted, and I will present you a written text that's corrected in translation.  But I'm going to ask that it be admitted as past recollection recorded, which is a situation when you have a witness who does not remember -- whose memory is not refreshed by a document, but the document itself is a record of something he remembered at a certain time, and under the doctrine of past recollection recorded, the document itself can be admitted as substantive evidence, even though the witness has no present recollection.  So, we can admit his -- the transcript, but I think it would be cleaner to actually admit a document which has that text in it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When you are formally making that application, I hope you will support it with some jurisprudence.  It's a doctrine with which I'm not familiar up to now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, it's actually codified in federal rules of evidence 801, but I can look for some more jurisprudence on that and see if it's come up in the context of the International Tribunal.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you, Witness ZF, we can move away from that document concerning your prior testimony, and I have just one other question for you not related to something you've been asked before.  And that is that, do you recall -- do you recall, during your time in Gisenyi, learning of any intercepted message that indicated that the RPF wanted to kill a person called Ferdinand Nahimana?  
A.	Counsel, I do not recall that, for the time being.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, we've talked about messages which were intercepted after the crash of President Habyarimana's plane, and I want now to direct your attention to the day before, or the day of the crash of President Habyarimana's plane.  Did you become aware of messages, or a message which was intercepted, indicating that something was going to happen? 
A.	Counsel, I find this question difficult to answer because I don't know what kind of answer to give.  I don't know what kind of answer you expect me to give. 
Q.	Well, I'd like you to give an answer that's as brief as possible and that doesn't reveal your identity or necessarily the source of the information.  But, I have some information, from what you've said in the past to the OTP, that a message was received on the afternoon of the 6th of April that was transmitted to the commander, and that when the commander read this message, he said that something was going to happen.  Is that correct?  
A.	This question is the same as the previous one, Counsel, and I prefer not to answer it. 
Q.	Well, do you have a recollection, as you sit here today, that the commander of the Gisenyi ops had received a message, or messages, before the crash of the president's plane, and as a result of those messages said that something was going to happen?  
A.	Yes, I recall, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  I think that's as far as we need to go with that.  

Okay, now I'm going to turn away from intercepted conversations, and we're going to discuss some individuals with whom you are acquainted, who are connected with the préfecture and military in Gisenyi.  Now, can you tell us the -- when you began your employment in 1990, after October 1990, you were under the jurisdiction, or authority, of the préfet; is that correct? 
A.	After 1990, no, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, let's say after the 14th of October of 1990, for that first period, can you tell us who it was who was your immediate superior? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that a safe question, in all (unintelligible)?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I'm believing that the answer to this would be the préfet, which is a very safe answer, but if it's not, maybe it wouldn't be. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, just to clarify for the record the position that I take on the matter.  All of this is not appropriate for open session testimony, not this question, not the questions that preceded it.  I have a standing objection to this line of questioning in open court.  So, I'm not going to object to every question Mr. Robinson asks, but my position should be clear on the matter.  I don't think this is an appropriate line of questioning for open session.  When I went into this area with the witness, it was all in closed session, and most of this witness' testimony that concerned his occupation was in closed session in previous -- previous proceedings.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Let me see if I could ask it in a different way.  If it's not possible, we could try to go into closed session.  But let me just ask.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, in October of 1990, who was the préfet of Gisenyi?  
A.	Counsel, in October 1990 the préfet was Mr. Nshunguyinka.  Nshunguyinka; he was the préfet of Gisenyi. 
Q.	I don't believe that's on the spelling list, so can you spell that for us?  
A.	S-H-U-N-K-U-Y-I-N-K-A (sic).  
Q.	Okay.  There may have been a translation -- a slight translation error, so let me just spell it back to you the way I understand it's spelled.  Tell me if this is correct.  N-S-H-U-N-G-U-Y-I-N-K-A; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And did there come a time when that préfet was replaced by a person named Côme Bizimungu?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And do you recall approximately when Côme Bizimungu became the préfet of Gisenyi?  
A.	I believe it was in 1992. 
Q.	And could you tell us if there came a time when Joseph Habiyambere became the préfet of Gisenyi?  And that's number 30 on the spelling list.  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And approximately when was that?  
A.	I no longer recall the date, Counsel. 
Q.	Was he the préfet that succeeded Côme Bizimungu?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And do you recall that Préfet Habiyambere was removed from office at some point?  
A.	I do not know whether he was removed from office or whether he was on transfer, Counsel.  
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when it was that he stopped being the préfet of Gisenyi?  
A.	At this point in time, I no longer recall the exact date. 
Q.	And after Mr. Habiyambere stopped being the préfet of Gisenyi, was there a sous-préfet who was acting préfet for a period of time in Gisenyi?  
A.	I do not know, Counsel.  
Q.	Isn't it true that an individual by the name of André Banyurwuhike -- and it's B-A-N-Y-U-R-W-U-H-I-K-E -- was acting préfet in Gisenyi after Habiyambere?  
A.	I was not informed, Counsel. 
Q.	And was there ever a man named Zirimwagab -- excuse me, Zirimwabagabo -- that's number 86 on our spelling list -- was there ever such a person became préfet of Gisenyi?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And when did he become préfet of Gisenyi? 
A.	After Mr. Habiyambere. 
Q.	Was it after 6 April 1994? 
A.	I do not very well remember the date, Counsel. 
Q.	Is it not true that Charles Zirimwabagabo was appointed préfet by the interim government on the 17th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I no longer remember.  I only know that there was a change of préfet. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, moving over to the military side, can you tell us who was the commander of operations for Gisenyi in October of 1990? 
A.	I would prefer not to answer this question, Counsel, because I don't think it falls within the framework of questions that are allowed.  
Q.	Okay, well, don't worry about that, because the chain of command in the courtroom is, I ask you the question, and you answer it, and if I'm wrong, those three Judges tell me that I can't do that.  So, when I ask you a question, if there's something wrong with it, there will be an intervention.  So, it's not really for -- your place to choose which questions you can answer and not.  So, I think the silence in the courtroom would indicate that you should answer the question.  

Who was the commander of operations in Gisenyi in October 1990 for the Rwandan armed forces?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness, the question is permitted.  
THE WITNESS: 
Please, Counsel, repeat the question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In October 1990, who was the commander of operations for Gisenyi for the Rwandan armed forces?  
A.	In October 1990 was Lieutenant Colonel Juvénal Bahufite, who was commander of operation for the Gisenyi military zone. 
Q.	Perfect.  Now, did there come a time when he was replaced by Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva? 
A.	I agree with you, Counsel. 
Q.	And approximately when did that occur? 
A.	That change took place around late 1993. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the second-in-command at the Gisenyi military, which would be someone occupying a position of S2 or S3, can you tell us who that was in October 1990?  
A.	When you talk of 1990, I do not know whether you are talking only of part of 1990, or the entire year, or even the beginning of the year.  I do not know exactly what you mean.  
Q.	I'm speaking of October 1990, from that period forward.  Can you tell me who occupied the position "second-in-command" in the Gisenyi operations sector for the Rwandan army? 
A.	I do not very well know whether the person was second in command, but the person who was S2 at that time was Lieutenant Munyaburanga.  He was the one that was there at that time.  
Q.	And that's number 54 on the spelling list.  Munyaburanga, André; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And was there a time when he was replaced by a Major Uwimana? 
A.	Counsel, I was not informed of who took over from him.  
Q.	Approximately when did Lieutenant Munyaburanga leave his position in Gisenyi?  
A.	Lieutenant Munyaburanga remained in Gisenyi up until July 1994. 
Q.	Now, did you also know a Lieutenant Alphonse Uwimana?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And was he an officer of the ops Gisenyi command during 1990 -- during the period of 1990 through 1994?  
A.	He was in Gisenyi for some time. 
Q.	Now, you have also testified about a Lieutenant Rwasa, and that's number 74 on the spelling list.  Can you tell us approximately what period of time Lieutenant Rwasa was in Gisenyi between the period of October 1990 and July 1994?  
A.	Lieutenant Bizumuremyi -- I'm sorry, Counsel, could you please repeat the question?  
Q.	Yes, I was asking you about Lieutenant Rwasa, Abel Rwasa.  Are you tell me what period of time he was in Gisenyi?  
A.	Lieutenant Rwasa spent the entire period from 1990 up until 1994 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Witness did not complete the answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, was Major Christopher Kabera also assigned to Gisenyi during the period between 1990 and 1994?  And that's number 35 on the spelling list.  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when he arrived in Gisenyi? 
A.	I cannot tell you when he was appointed and assigned officially to Gisenyi, because he used to come and go, so I do not know whether he was there on official appointment or on temporary assignment.  But I saw him in 1990, and he came again in 1992, and in late 1993, and again in 1994 after the 6th of July.  He came again when Lieutenant Bahufite came from Byumba.  He again came to Gisenyi.  
Q.	Do you know when it was that Major Kabera was transferred from Gisenyi to Byumba, approximately?  
A.	He left at the same time with Lieutenant Colonel Bahufite, when he was transferred in late 1993 to Byumba. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if you would like to take a break at this time, I could stop.
  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it's 10:30.  We will take the morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1117H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I do apologise for the late start, but there was -- something cropped up that we had to attend to.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President, it's no problem.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, I now want to turn to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  Can you tell us, what was his other name?  
A.	Counsel, for the time being, I only remember Bizumuremyi. 
Q.	Could it have been Anastase Bizumuremyi? 
A.	Counsel, some people call him by that name, but I do not know whether that was his first name or his surname.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us when he was assigned to Gisenyi? 
A.	Counsel, I do not remember the date, but I know he was there in the course of 1992. 
Q.	And did he remain there until July 1994? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And his wife, was she a gendarme? 
A.	Regarding his wife, I know she had a rank of captain.  She was called Mukamurenzi.  It was possible that she was a gendarme, because she was working at the gendarmerie camp in Kacyiru in Kigali. 
Q.	Thank you.  And Mukamurenzi is number 53 on the spelling list.  With respect to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, I put it to you that in fact Lieutenant Bizumuremyi did not arrive in Gisenyi until late March of 1994, and that all of these conversations that you have related with Lieutenant Bizumuremyi never in fact occurred.  Do you want to comment on that?  
A.	Counsel, I have no remarks to make.  But let me simply inform you that I personally saw him, and I lived with him up until July 1994.  We even left together to go into exile. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness please be shown document number 1 in our list of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, what has been placed in front of you is a document from the ministry of defence of the government of Rwanda dated at Kigali the 1st of January 1993.  And it is a list of all officers of the Rwandan army as of January 1st, 1993.  

Now, I want to direct your attention to the page that has stamped the K-number, K0078508.  So, you can see a stamped number at the top -- near the top of each page, and if you could go to the one that ends in 508.  

Have you found page 508?  
A.	Not yet, Counsel.  

Yes, I have found it, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  And if you could look at the bottom of that page, the second to -- heading from the bottom, it indicates the command of the ops Gisenyi.  And you see there are three names, Juvénal Bahufite, which is number 5 on the spelling list, André Munyaburanga, which is number 54 on the spelling list, and Alphonse Uwimana, U-W-I-M-A-N-A.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, I have found it, Counsel.  
Q.	And then continuing on the bottom of that page, there is Lieutenant Rwasa listed, and turning to the next page, there are the names of other people in five or six different categories, including Nzuwonemeye, N-Z-U-W-O-N-E-M-E-Y-E, Murego, M-U-R-E-G-O, and then it goes down to list other officers, until the bottom of the page where it says "Officers in stage."  And can we agree that nowhere among all the officers assigned to Gisenyi and its various battalions is there listed Lieutenant Bizumuremyi? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ100.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would object.  What is the basis for offering this in evidence?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the basis is, this is an official document of the Rwandan army, which was -- which is in the possession of the Prosecutor, disclosed to us by the Prosecutor.  It's been admitted an as exhibit in the trial of Bagosora, and we believe that it -- the purpose of showing this is to impeach the witness' testimony that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was assigned to Gisenyi as of 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can we see the document, please?  

Mr. Registrar, could we see the document, please?
(Pages 1 to 18 by Kirstin McLean)







1130H 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, even though this is a document that was provided in disclosure to the Defence by our office we do not vouch for the accuracy of the document.  There has been no foundation laid for it.  Nowhere does Mr. Robinson allege -- even allege that this is an accurate listing of how offices were assigned throughout the country by the FAR in 1993.  So, I don't see how it advances matters to admit it into evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, just to respond to that, I think because this document has all of the indicia of being an official document it goes to the weight, as to whether or not it is accurate or not.  And it is our position that from -- from the face of the document itself, matching up with persons he has said were, in fact, in Gisenyi during this period, in general, there is sufficient basis to admit the document.  And if we want to establish more weight to the document, we can do that through other witnesses.  But we are now at the threshold of admissibility, which, as I understand it, is a very low threshold. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not disputing that this is a document from the Rwandan armed forces, that seems pretty clear to me.  But when I look at it, and I am directing my attention to the bottom of page 8508, next to the S3 and S2 officer, I also see in parenthesis "A period, I period" close parenthesis, which I read as ad interim,  which -- I mean, I can -- this is the type of thing that I can go back into on redirect, but it is really not necessary.  I don't see why we should waste time on a point that is so minor, because this document doesn't really assist us in any way.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I agree that it don't assist Mr. Webster, but it assists us because it tends to establish that his testimony that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was assigned to Gisenyi in -- as of 1992 is not correct.   It appears that Mr. Webster, at least, is conceding that there is enough indicia of reliability of the document that ought to be admitted, and we can debate it with other witnesses and with this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as an exhibit.
 (Exhibit No. DNZ. 100 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  And that would be DNZ. 100.  
 
And if the witness could now be shown number 12 of the exhibits (sic). 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, directing your attention to the document that has been placed in front of you.  It is the minutes of the meeting of the 18th of January 1993 by the national gendarmerie.  And it is dated at the top in Kigali, on the 21st of January 1993.  And among the participants of the meeting, the last one listed as a representative of the command of the gendarmerie Mobinter, M-O-B-I-N-T-E-R, is a Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, reporter.  And then on the second page, the signatures of the document include General Ndindiliyimana, the head of the gendarmerie, I believe, colonel at the time.  And on the left-hand side, Anathase Bizumuremyi, lieutenant of the gendarmerie.  Now based on this document, dated the 21st of January 1993, would you agree that as of that time your friend, Lieutenant Buzumuremyi, was a member of the gendarmes in Kigali?
A.	I wouldn't agree with you.  First of all, I would like to know which Bizumuremyi you are referring to, because there are many Bizumuremyis in Rwanda.  This is a name born by many people.  

Regarding those meetings or those appointments, I wouldn't know because I wasn't a soldier, so I cannot comment on that or make -- or give an opinion on that.  Those are people I used to see and that is all. 
Q.	Well, if you could look at the second page of this document, it has identified the person further as Anathase Bizumuremyi.  And you told us that your friend was called Anathase Bizumuremyi.  So looking at that, now that your attention has been directed to that, can you explain to us why it is that Anathase Bizumuremyi is obviously working as a gendarme in Kigali at the time in January 1993 when you claim he was assigned to Gisenyi as an officer of the army? 
A.	Counsel, regarding the name Anathase, I have told you that I do not know his first name.  If there are people who called him by that name, I don't know whether that is his name.  But what I know is that his name was Bizumuremyi.  Others call him Rutukuya (phonetic), and other people called him by another name.  

Regarding the transfer, or the meetings, I, for one, wouldn't know.  Furthermore, what I knew was that whether you were a gendarme or a soldier in the Rwandan armed forces, during the period of the war you could join the army and go to the war front.  That was the case with Major Ndindayimana who commanded the 2nd battalion.  During that period he was a gendarme, but he was assigned to the 42nd battalion in Gisenyi, which was a reinforcement battalion.  People were not working where they were appointed to work, so you cannot tell me that the commanders who appointed in Kanombe lived in Kanombe.  They were on the chain of (intelligible) mountains.  So there was a major in Kanombe, but he was either in Ruhengeri or in the Mutara.  

Now regarding Bizumuremyi, if he had been appointed -- and I told you he was a reconnaissance or an intelligence officer, it is possible that he was there, in the interest of the ops Gisenyi, the fact that he was a gendarme did not necessarily mean that he was supposed to work at the gendarmerie chief of staff or general staff.  Even Nyibiragaba (phonetic) was the detour (sic) of the Rwandan armed forces, but he was a gendarme.  This shouldn't, therefore, make you think that those who are there were there on an official appointment.  As a matter of fact, in reality many people were on the ground.  So, you shouldn't try to establish a link between the appointments and what the people did.  I don't know how those appointments were done at the general staff.  But what I can tell you is that those are people I used to see.  And many things were said about them, and that is what I heard.  That is all I can say by way of testimony. 
Q.	Well, Witness, if I understand you correctly, you seem to be offering two explanations for this situation:  One, that the Anathase Bizumuremyi who was a gendarme in Kigali was not the same               Anathase Bizumuremyi who you knew in Gisenyi; or, secondly, that the Anathase Bizumuremyi who was a gendarme in Kigali was the same as the person you knew in Gisenyi, but that he was acting in an area outside of his official appointment.  So, in order to understand which of these is the truth, as opposed to a speculation, can you tell me whether the person that you knew as Anathase Bizumuremyi had ever worked for the gendarmerie? 
A.	Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was an gendarmerie lieutenant.  And I have told you that his wife was a captain, gendarmerie Capitaine Mukamurenzi, but she worked in the Rwanda Armed Forces in Gisenyi; whereas, his wife worked in Kanombe.  And it was at the end of the period, the end of the time that we spent in Gisenyi, that is after the 6th of April 1994, it was after that period that his wife came to Gisenyi.  And I have told you that when we left, as the RPF advanced, that was when I went with him.  And we stayed at camp together.  And you can obtain this evidence from anybody, if you wish.  It is not someone they spoke to me about, it is someone with whom I travelled right to the refugee camp. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I don't doubt that from March of 1994 until July and beyond that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was in Gisenyi, that is not a dispute.  But during most of the events about which you testified you received information from Lieutenant Bizumuremyi 1992, 1993 and the beginning of 1994.  It is our position that that testimony is not true, because Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was not there.  So, going back to this document number 12, it appears since your -- the person that you knew who was named Bizumuremyi, that since people called him Anathase and that since he worked for the gendarmerie it is a very high likelihood that the person that you are speaking of is the same person who is mentioned in this document; would you agree? 
A.	Are you referring to document number 12, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	If Lieutenant Bizumuremyi is mentioned in this document, I don't know which Bizumuremyi you are referring to, I cannot know.  I see the names, but of all of the lieutenants I knew, that was the one I saw in Gisenyi, but I did not know all Rwandan soldiers. 
Q.	Did you ever hear that there was another gendarme named Lieutenant Anathase Bizumuremyi? 
A.	Counsel, the problem is not with Anathase, the problem is that here I see Bizumuremyi on the list.  That is on the attendance list for meetings held. 
Q.	And I'm asking you whether or not that could be some other Bizumuremyi, or whether we can agree that given the fact that the Lieutenant Bizumuremyi you knew also was called Anathase and also worked for the gendarme, can we agree that we are speaking of the same person, or did you know some other Anathase Bizumuremyi who worked in the gendarmerie? 
A.	Counsel, in answer to this question, I can tell you that it is possible that there were other         Lieutenant Bizumuremyis, since I did not know all of the officers nationwide in Rwanda.  So what I know is that during that period -- during the entire period when I was with him, we were together, I did not talk of his appointment or his assignment.  I specified that that was when he was installed.  I did not talk of appointments because I did not see his appointment letter.  I do not know how appointments were made.  But I know that he came and settled in Gisenyi for some time; whether he came on the basis of an official appointment or on another basis, I'm not in a position to say, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document number 12 be admitted as DNZ. 101. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 101 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And if the witness could be shown document number 2 in our list of exhibits. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, I have now placed before you another document which is dated the 5th of March 1994, and it is also a minister -- Ministry of Defence document from the Rwandan army, listing the officers of the Rwandan army as of the 1st of March 1994.  And I would like you to turn to the page that has the number on top K0078473.  And if you could look at the bottom of that page, there is the word "ops Gisenyi"; do you see that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And then we -- then we have the name of Colonel Nsengiyumva, Uwimana, Rwasa, and then other names continuing onto page K0078474, going all the way down, almost to the bottom of the page where there are some people assigned to the ops of Kigaliville.  And if you look at all of those names, would you agree with me that there is no mention of Lieutenant Bizumuremyi being assigned to Gisenyi army, correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And if you turn to the very last page, which is K0078479, there is a list of three people.  And above it it says -- I'm going to read this in English and it can be translated for you, "officers awaiting assignment."   And underneath that designation there is the name "Anathase Bizumuremyi", do you see that? 
A.	I'm with you Counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:  
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer this document as DNZ. 102. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 102 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ZF, just to summarise here, the documents that you have been shown today, official documents appear to indicate that as of January of 1993 there was no Lieutenant Bizumuremyi in the Rwandan army; that as of the 21st of January 1993, there was a Lieutenant Bizumuremyi who was in Kigali assigned to the gendarme.  And as of the 1st of March 1994, that same -- or,                    Anastase Bizumuremyi was now attached to the Rwandan army as an officer but was awaiting assignment.  And I ask you whether or not, in light of these documents, you still insist that       Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, from whom you received a great deal of information, was assigned to Gisenyi as of 1992? 
A.	Counsel, I never mentioned Lieutenant Bizumuremyi's posting because I never saw these list of postings.  It didn't interest me, nor did it concern me.  What I spoke of was the actual installation.  Whether he had been assigned by his general staff or by the army, that they know, the army knows.  I saw him at the Gisenyi ops camp at a certain time for a specific period.  And my relations were with him were biblical -- or public. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm not sure whether public or biblical. 
THE WITNESS:
And there are other officers, some of the named on the list, who also knew him and could also give you that information.  But myself as someone who was not part of the system, I saw him.  I saw what he did.  I know what the others said.  I know the conversations I had with him and what my relations were with him.  And that is the only thing I have talked of.  I have not spoken of transfers or of postings or even whether he was a lieutenant or gendarme.  It is what he told me and it is what the others told me, and that is what I saw him do.  I was not officially informed in any way because I had seen no official documents posting him or transferring him to Gisenyi.  I don't know why he was there. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, do you know what happened to lieutenant Bizumuremyi; is he alive or deceased? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I have told you that we left -- we went into exile together.  And he stayed Goma, in town, that is where he set himself up with his family, a small business in town.  And we went to a camp called Mugunga, that is where we were.  As of that moment our paths separated.  And with the Zairian war the Kibila war, people scattered everywhere.  I returned to Rwanda, and him -- as for him, to date, I don't know where he went.  I have had no trace -- I have no trace of him at present. 
Q.	Now, Witness ZF, I want to put it to you that Major Kabera has stated that there was no                 officer Bizumuremyi in Gisenyi during the entire period at which he worked there, which went up to August of 1993.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, perhaps someone has asserted that in your face, but were I present-- or were he present here before me he would not dare say that.  He wouldn't dare.  I don't know what words to use -- that I have given you the explanation that I can.  Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was there at the time specified.  That is all I can say.  But as for Major Kabera, that is perfectly normal.  If I wanted to say he didn't exist, I could say that.  To lie or not to lie is an individual decision.  I don't know what I can tell you on Major Kabera. 
Q.	Did you know a person named Faustin Murego, M-U-R-E-G-O? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And he was a lieutenant in Gisenyi, was he not? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And for the Trial Chamber's information, his name can be found on Exhibit No. DNZ. 10, on page K0078509, assigned to Gisenyi as of January 1, 1993.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness ZF, I put it to you that Lieutenant Murega stated that there was no Officer Bizumuremyi in Gisenyi during the period in which he was there, up through 1993. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, where are you quoting these statements from?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Judge Short, in order to answer that question, I would need to have an order from Trial Chamber I.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And so I put it to you, Witness ZF, that Lieutenant Murego has stated that there was no officer Bizumuremyi in Gisenyi during 1993.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, what I can tell you regarding that Murego, Lieutenant Murego, he is someone who knows Lieutenant Bizumuremyi very, very well.  But as I have stressed, to lie or to tell the truth is an individual matter.  Even I can come back tomorrow and tell you that everything that I said about Bizumuremyi was false, and that I don't know him.  But if you want to know about that lieutenant -- Lieutenant Murego, that he didn't know Bizumuremyi, whereas, it was said he was a reservist in the army would be a bit difficult, because the officers know each other, especially the lieutenants.  He cannot say that he doesn't know him.  

He might have his own reasons, but whether Lieutenant Murego who, moreover, left before the plane crash, because he had a scholarship to go and study abroad.  And he was from Ruhengeri, his family stayed there.  It was someone who was not accessibly familiar with, but he was someone who else frequented Lieutenant Bizumuremyi in the course of his work.  But I was not very close to Murego, but they knew each other well. 
Q.	Witness ZF, did you know a gendarme lieutenant in Gisenyi by the name of ****** ******? 
A.	No, maybe I knew him by sight but that name I do not know, Counsel. 
Q.	All right.  I put it to you that that gentleman has stated that a few weeks before the 6th of April Lieutenant Bizumuremyi arrived in Gisenyi, and that there were no other Bizumuremyis in the army or the gendarme.  Would you like to comment on that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, I'm curious about the basis of that last enquiry and with reference to that name.  Could counsel tell us where that statement is coming from, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, as soon as I receive an order from Trial Chamber I, I will be in a position to do that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, in respect of the last name you mentioned the witness says he doesn't know him.  So what kind of answer do you expect from your follow-up question? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, the substance of what this person says I put to the witness.  He was there in 1994 and he knows when Bizumuremyi came.  I want to give the witness the opportunity to comment on that because I expect that ****************************** will come and testify to that in this trial, so I want to give the witness the opportunity to comment on that even though he says he does not know the gentleman. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want him to comment about what somebody who he doesn't know said?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Well, I want him to comment on the facts that I have asserted that -- my case as I asserted it to him.  And I'm identifying the source of my information to him so he can comment more fully.  That is what I am doing.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ZF, can you give us a comment, or if you care to, on the fact that I'm representing to you that ********************************** has stated that Bizumuremyi, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi arrived in Gisenyi a few weeks before 6 April, and that there were no other Bizumuremyis in the army or the gendarme? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I think without going round and round about Bizumuremyi, I told you that he was the coordinator of the youth wing of the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi.  He is someone who is well known even by civilians.  He wasn't only known by the military.  So you can investigate with either militiamen or civilians.  And you will find out that that person Bizumuremyi existed and we could perhaps cease the prelimics (sic) because I don't know how I can explain any better; I saw this Bizumuremyi.  It is not someone who is talked about to me, it is someone who existed.  And at a certain time in history he was in Rwanda, at a specific time, from -- one day to another date.  And those who say -- who contradict that, had better prove it.  I personally don't have any other proof than my own eyes.  But since I can't remove them to give them to you, you will just have to believe me. 
Q.	Well, can you give us the names of any other persons who are alive today who could verify that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was in Gisenyi as of 1992? 
A.	Yes, everyone.  Ask Mr. Nzirorera, Joseph. 
Q.	He doesn't -- 
A.	He can tell you if he is speaking frankly.  You can ask Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You can ask                  Colonel Nsengiyumva.  I don't know whether Bahufite is still alive.  But Major -- but Habimana, who commanded the 42nd battalion and today lives in Rwanda.  You can go and get him.  You can contact one Nzuwonemeye, if he is a Christian or a Muslim, he can tell you.  And if you contact even General Bizimungu, he can tell you.  It was someone who was at home there, he knows very well, they came from the same commune.

I don't know if I can give you any further explanation.  It is a question of being frank.  
Q.	Well, Witness ZF, I appreciate that.  We will talk to the people that you have mentioned and perhaps they will be here to give testimony at some later time, but thank you very much for that.  

Now, I just want to ask you if you can tell me the names of the persons who frequented the officers' mess in Gisenyi, with whom you shared information during the period of 1992 through 1994, including the things you testified to for the Prosecution, such as the meetings at (By order of the Court this word has been extracted from the transcript and filed under closed session) camp, Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You told us about things that you heard in the officers' mess.  Who are the people who also heard and discussed those things with you? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I mentioned first Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  And in addition to him, I spoke to     Lieutenant Rwasa; for a long time we were together.  And also Lieutenant Munyaburanga, and Major Kabera, but he would go and come.  But those were there throughout on a permanent basis who was closest was Munyaburanga, Rwasa and Bizumuremyi.  Those were the most important. 
Q.	Now, my information is that each of those three people are deceased, but are there any other people who would have heard the same conversations you heard at the officers' mess? 
A.	Well, I can't replace them with other people, because if they are dead, I don't know.  But there were many officers who would come to the officers' mess.  But everyone has their own group who he is comfortable -- the people he is most comfortable with.  And those were the people with whom I was closest, that I got on with the best.  They weren't always going places but just staying there for a long period of time, and with whom we could discuss many things; others would come and go.  I can't remember everyone from 1990 to 1994.  Many passed through, but many of them I was not in contact with, such as Murego, the lieutenants you mentioned.  Uwimana was there.  I can't speak of them because they weren't people with whom I was more intimate, than the people who I was close to.  I can't say anything about those people.  Even if it is true that sometimes from time to time we would meet at the mess, it was to have a drink together.  There were also routine conversations, but there weren't people who I was close to, such as those whom I have named. 
Q.	Witness ZF, what I am looking to do is to see if we can find someone who can verify what you have said.  So let's start with the meetings at location A.  Are there any other officers at the officers' mess with whom you recall discussing the meetings at location A? 
A.	I mentioned Lieutenant Rwasa, and Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and also Munyaburanga,            Lieutenant Munyaburanga; it was with those three that we discussed those problems. 
Q.	And then what about the visit of Mr. Nzirorera to the Méridien hotel in 1993?  Is there any other persons at the officers' mess besides the three that you have mentioned that you discussed that with, or that would have that information? 
A.	Regarding Nzirorera's visit to Gisenyi to the Méridien hotel, I think that many officers were informed, or saw him there.  But when I speak, I speak of the circles in which I move in Gisenyi, but there were also the gendarme who had their intelligence services there too who would know what is going on, and follow what is going on.  But I was not concerned with all of those people, in spite of the fact that there were many people who saw him.  And each -- all of those officers, whether they were from Gisenyi, whether gendarme, whether the 42nd battalion, many officers were present.  But when you are in the mess or in the camp there are always groups of people.  It is not that everyone sits together.  You would sit according to your interests, your close acquaintances.  But many saw him there, knew he had come. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  Now we are going to change topics a bit.  And I want to ask you some questions about location A.  And I want to be careful here, and I think I can be careful in my questions and ask you to be careful in your answers, not to identify the place so.  My first question to you -- and you can think about the sketch that you drew, because that is what I am thinking about -- to tell me approximately what is the dimensions of the parcel in which location A sat.  Can you tell me how    many -- approximately how many metres long it was, along the road from the first point to the last, and how many metres wide it was from the road to the place where the camp ended? 
A.	Well, Counsel, as to those measurements, I don't know whether you might call it surface area, I don't know how to answer because I'm not very good at measurements.  But if, perhaps, you think you are implying that ***************, I could show you a photograph of the place.  But in addition -- but other than that, I cannot estimate the distances because I might be mistaken. 
Q.	Well, do you have a photograph of that location? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  I think it would assist all of us if we could see that photograph.  Are you willing to show it to us? 
A.	Yes, I can show it to you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may the witness show us the photograph of location A?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think that the photograph is an identifying factor, and if it goes further than that, it will have to be under seal. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, definitely. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness, do you have this with you, or is this something that you would have to retrieve? 
A.	I can find it immediately, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you please do that now and then you can hand it to Mr. Issa? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe, it might be useful to allow -- it is now 25 past, I don't know if would it be useful to allow him to find it during the break and we will resume at 2 o'clock.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's a good idea.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now.  

Witness, I remind you not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this adjournment. 
(Court recessed from 1225H to 1407H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Robinson, you can continue now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I am now in a position to offer some of these intercepted conversations as exhibits.  I revised the exhibits so that they confirm exactly to the French -- to the English translation that was read in court today.  I have provided Mr. Webster with a copy.  And so what I would now like to do now is -- and I have 15 copies here, so everyone -- they can be distributed to everyone.  So, what I would like to do now is to offer each of the transcripts of the documents that were identified by the witness as intercepted messages on the 7th of April.  

The first one I have to offer is the typewritten version of D. NZ99.  And I would ask you to consider, in light of my explanation concerning the use of this in the future with other witnesses, admitting the typewritten document as Exhibit DNZ. 99B.  

And then I have four other messages that I would like to have admitted, which is simply the typewritten English text.  For the first -- for all but the last, the witness acknowledged that, in fact, these were messages from -- that were intercepted on the 7th of April.  And so I would ask that they be admitted on that basis.  

With respect to the last document, the last exhibit, the witness indicated that he did not recall whether this was a message that was intercepted.  And so I'm asking that this document be admitted on a different basis.  And my basis for this is that this is what is called "recorded recollection", which is an exception to the hearsay rule; but, of course, we don't have the hearsay rule, so it is even questionable whether we need an exception.  But what is before you, as far as the foundation of this document, is that in the year 2001, the witness was shown this text -- or was read -- this text was read to the witness in connection with testimony he gave under oath.  And he was asked if he remembered this message from 7 April 1994.  And he said, "Yes, I do remember."

Now, my authority for this in my national jurisdiction is Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(5).  It is called recorded recollection.  It says:  "A memorandum or a record concerning about -- concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness's memory, and to reflect that knowledge correctly, may be admitted; and that may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party," which in this case, I am the adverse party to this witness.  

So, I think that -- have not been able to find -- the jurisprudence on the ICTR and ICTY.  I have not been able to find any case on point one way or the other.  But I would suggest that, given the threshold for Rule 89(C) for admission of hearsay evidence, which is much lower than that in any national jurisdiction, I laid a sufficient foundation through the prior testimony of this witness for that exhibit to be admitted.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm objecting to the admission of all of these exhibits.  I'm not going to belabour the point because I have already made my position clear.  With respect to the last one, this certainly is not a recorded recollection. 

I can see Mr. Robinson's point, but that our evidentiary standards are governed by Rule 89 and not the Federal Rules of Evidence.  But if we were looking for persuasive authority from the federal rule in the US, this certainly would not fit under that rubric.  First of all, it is not a memorandum of the witness; it was not made contemporaneous to the event.  Mr. Robinson is not an adverse party to this part of the evidence.  He was gone into new information that was not covered under -- not covered in my direct examination.  He has gone into a new territory entirely.  So, he is clearly not adverse with respect to that portion of the witness's testimony.  So there is no basis for alluding to the Federal Rules of Evidence to allow this document in.  
But the Court seems to welcome this line of questioning and this evidence, so I will leave it entirely in your discretion, whether that fifth intercept should be admitted or not.  But for the record, I oppose the admission of all of the exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to take this under advisement, and we will give an opinion -- we will give a ruling shortly -- in due course. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness ZF. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness ZF, do you have the photograph of location A? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you please give it to Issa, and he can show it to the Judges, the Prosecution and then the Defence?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, are we still on track otherwise. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think I'm on track to complete my cross-examination in about 12 hours of cross-examination, in two days, I think we are on track for that.  I am not counting -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, we have -- it was not -- I was wondering, are you likely to finish tomorrow by 12:30? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't think so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your estimate?
MR. ROBINSON: 
It is hard to say because --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that, but in light of the interruption, I know that.  But as we are now, what are we looking at?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think next Tuesday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you looking -- Tuesday. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, we are hearing Witness T on Monday.  So, after tomorrow, the next day that we would hear this witness is Tuesday.  So, I think -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think that -- you will have a day and a half, enough to complete, basically.  We have a half day tomorrow. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And one other day. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think so, assuming that we go a full pace. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness ZF, thank you very much for showing us that photograph.  Can you tell us approximately when that was taken? 
A.	Counsel, it was in about 1991. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I was trying to ask you about the dimensions of the parcel in which location A is located, and you told me that are you not very good at distances.  So, let me ask you in another way.  If you were to start walking from the place where you first came to the camp on the road from Gisenyi town, along that road until the end of the camp, approximately how long would it take you to walk that? 
A.	Counsel, if I understood you correctly, you are talking of the distance from the entrance to the camp and *********************, or do you mean from the entrance to the other end, because there was the width and the length.  I do not know the distance you are referring to. 
Q.	Exactly.  I was referring to the length, so if you were to walk along the road parallel to the building from the beginning when you first reached the first boundary of the lake -- I mean, of the location, all the way to the end, the length, how long would it take you to walk that? 
A.	I cannot estimate the time in hours, but I can say that approximately from the entrance up to the bank of *********** is a distance of about 500 metres, and that can be considered as the width.  Now, as for the length, I would say that you can consider it in the other direction, that is, the part where there were toilets and *****************, right up to the end, or the limit of the property, that is the boundary of the plot.  I would say that the distance is about 800 metres, approximately 800 metres, 500 to 800 metres -- 800 metres by 500 metres. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, turning your attention to the building which is on location A, can you tell me approximately the length and width of that building? 
A.	Concerning that building, there were two periods, pre-April 1994 and, I really don't know well how to be specific with regard to the period.  There was a main building comprising the room which was the signals centre, and the other room which was a multi-purpose room.  Then there was the canteen, as well as the guard post.  I really don't know how to give an estimate because there were all adjacent to one another.  It was only subsequently that another building was put up towards the end of the parcel.  If we consider the length from the equipment stores to the edge of the parcel, there is another building constructed which had also the apartment for Colonel Nsungeswa (phonetic), who was commanding officer of the Bigogwe commando training centre and moved to (By order of the Court, this word was extracted from the transcript and filed under closed session) at some time.  But concerning the first building, if I were to estimate, it wouldn't be in terms of metres.  But I would say like the breadth of this courtroom with four petitions. 
Q.	And would it also be approximately the width of this courtroom? 
A.	Counsel, I really can't say the width very well.  But it is more or less the same thing from where I am seated right now. 
Q.	Now, the last part of this is I would like to direct your attention to the room where you say that the meeting occurred at location A.  Can you tell us approximately the dimensions of that room? 
A.	This would be a bit difficult, because, you see, I am unable to know the sizes of the various rooms in each apartment.  It would be slightly difficult for me to give you that.  You see, the rooms were not of the same size so it is sort of difficult for me.  I am unable to do that. 
Q.	The sketch that you did of that location, were the rooms that you depicted in that sketch roughly proportionate in size to each others; in other words, was the sketch an accurate depiction of which room was small and which room was large? 
A.	Counsel, the depiction on the sketch that I made is an estimate. 
Q.	Well, for example, on the sketch the room where the guards were is depicted as being rather small and the room ************** is depicted as being larger.  So in making that sketch were you attempting to approximately show the size of the rooms in relation to each other? 
A.	I think so, sir.  In order to be much clearer, the first room, which was the multipurpose room, and in which officers regularly met when they came for rest and recreation period in (By order of the Court, this word was extracted from the transcript and filed under closed session) was much bigger than the other rooms.  The next room in size was the work room.  And going down in size, we would say the canteen.  And then the smallest of the rooms was the guard room.  It was a very small room. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, very much.  Now, I want to ask you about the times that you were working at     location A.  And I understand that it is your testimony that you began working at location A on approximately the 1st of November 1990, correct? 
A.	That's right, sir. 
Q.	Now, I want to put it to you that -- I want to put it to you that it is our information --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name of a location has been mentioned, has been brought to my attention.  It slipped when it occurred. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I heard it actually a few times and I assumed we would be redacting it --  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you see I'm making the order for redaction but I don't want it on the record, really, so please try to avoid it.  I know it is not you doing it.  

I bring it to the witness's attention again, you mentioned the name of a place which should be kept confidential.  Do you understand, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I do understand that, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ZF -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  Just for the court reporters, I put the redaction order on the record.  Is that sufficient wording of the order?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ZF, what I am telling you is that we have information that you actually began working at location A sometime around the 23rd of January 1991, when the RPF launched an attack on Ruhengeri at which time the préfet directed that the equipment that had been in the préfecture office be moved, and that it was moved into a mini-bus, ******************** in early February of 1991.  

And my source for that information is préfet Côme Bizimungu.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, in this regard, let me start by making a clarification.  I did not start working in location A with the arrival of Côme Bizimungu, who arrived around late October and left in 1992.  I started to working while his predecessor, called Rudasingwa, was still there.  And it was way before then.  The date,       1st of November, I think was a time when Préfet Rudasingwa, was still in office.  Perhaps, he had already been appointed but had not yet handed over power, because, if I remember properly, Bizimungu started work, I think, sometime towards the end.  You see, he started after I had already started working in location A.  But, administratively speaking, I wouldn't know, perhaps the transfer were already effective.  

You see it was quite usual in Rwanda at the time for you to be appointed at a given date, and then you would assume duty at a much later date.  So I do not really know very well when he was appointed.  But when I started there, Rudasingwa was still working there.  So he does not know when I moved to that place.  By the time he came there I was already there. 
Q.	Well, just to be clear as to what he has stated, is that, when he came there ******************************** ****************.  And that in January of 1991, because of the RPF attack in Ruhengeri, it was thought that that equipment should be moved out of the préfecture office, and so it was.  It was moved into a mini-bus.  And then in early February of 1991, **************************************** and that you thereafter commenced working at location A.  That is the information from Préfet Côme Bizimungu.  So, do I understand that -- having heard that information you continue to maintain that you worked at location A from November of 1990? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I have already told you that, indeed, I started in 1990, in the month of November, but my move to location A was not in connection with the events which had occurred in the other préfectures, because the events he is referring to are distant events.  The only reason, perhaps, which I remember for me to be moved to that location was in order to avoid mixing up with civilians or in civilian inhabited areas in the préfecture.  There was no other reason for me to be moved, because there was never any large scale threats in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, we understand each other on that part.  Now, I want to go to when you stopped working at location A.  And I understand it is your testimony that you continued to work at location A until           July 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Now, we have information that is contrary to that, and I want to put it to you and give you a chance to comment on that.  First of all, Major Kabera has stated that he ordered you moved from location A to a residence known as *************, the residence of the ops commander in Gisenyi in January 1992.  

In addition, Préfet Bizimungu has stated that before he left as préfet in June 1992, you were no longer working at location A, but had been moved to the military camp.  And Lieutenant Murego has stated that as of April 1992 you were no longer working at location A, but were working at a place known as ******************.  In addition, Colonel Nsengiyumva has indicating that when he arrived in Gisenyi in June 13, 1993 you were not working at location A but you were working at the ******************.  I so would you like to comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I am not really familiar with that **************; but what I know is that Major Kabera did not have any authority over me.  I did not receive any orders from him.  Secondly, my work at location A had started as usual, because as you will remember, on the 6th of April I came to location A in the morning.  And I think Colonel Nsingiyumva would agree with me on that score.  If he says otherwise, I would not know.  

There are two possibilities in connection with that house called *************.  Firstly, it was an official state residence which had been assigned me for my family; I had to leave the popular neighbourhood so as to go to the official neighbourhood. It was in the ops camp in Gisenyi where my family had to live.  

When Colonel Nsengiyumva arrived in Gisenyi he was lodged in a different house from the one where Colonel Bahufite used to live.  Colonel Bahufite had a house toward la Corniche.  But when          Colonel Nsengiyumva came he was given a house at ops Gisenyi.  And it was a house belonging to Colonel Serubuga.  In that house, there was a two-way radio equipment being operated by an operator.  That is the zero network I had referred to.  I went to that place *************************************, because it was not possible ***************************************.  It was the only time I went there with my colleague.  

That is the house that was referred to as ****************** then that was the only time I went there.  It was not for work purposes, but it was in order to set up from the **************** to the new house **************.  I do not know if your enquiry has been properly answered.  Otherwise, I was always in location A.  

Even in July 1994, the vehicle which transported my property went to location A.  It is from there that I took my things and left.  And Colonel Nsengiyumva knows that very well.  Even through he was no longer the commanding officer, he was still there.  He was the coordinator for the Turquoise mission.  And it was Bahufite who had taken over the ops command.  But when we started packing the equipment, it was at location A.  That is why I assert that up until the last day, I was still in location A with all of my work equipment 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much for that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have a slight concern.  My understanding is that this proceeding is supposed to be a search for the truth.  And under Rule 90 of our Rules, the Trial Chamber is empowered to exercise the control over the mode and ordering of interrogating witnesses as to make the interrogation and the presentation of evidence effective for the ascertainment of the truth.  And I don't think that is happening now.  

Mr. Robinson insists that we conduct this examination in open session, which prevents the witness from going into detail, to give this Court a very broad understanding of what transpired between 1990 and 1994.  And it is hampering our search for the truth.  This witness should be allowed to talk about how he took his -- how he received information and how he passed it on.  What I understand -- what              Mr. Robinson was doing from the last question is putting to the witness that he was not at location A from 1992.  I'm not sure if it is 1992 or 1993.  But two hours ago, he was eliciting testimony from this witness about information that he received in 1994.  And that seems to me to be inconsistent.  And the only way to bring it out is to go into closed session and thrash the whole issue out.  

The Defence should not be allowed to present inconsistent lines of questioning to this witness that is going to confuse the record.  When we took note, or when the Court was considering the admission of the evidence of these intercepts, there was no testimony whatsoever about how that information arrived in the hands of this witness.  So, what I am suggesting to the Court is that the way we are proceeding is going to confuse the record.  And if we are here to find the truth of what happened, and to take a        full -- to get a full explanation from this witness, the only way we are going to do this effectively is to do it in closed session, where the witness can be asked fully what transpired between 1992 and 1994.  

I'm concerned about a question that was asked before we took our luncheon break because              Mr. Robinson at that point was not identifying the source of his information.  And when I was able to check a reference to someone, I think, the name that was given was ******.  The information, the proposition that was put to the witness is not what I read in the transcripts of that witness from another proceeding.  And there is no way I am going to be able to come back to that in redirect.  

It is our contention that that witness -- that testimony was false.  I'm not interesting in relying on       false -- going back to false testimony to correct it.  But if Mr. Robinson is going to put propositions to the witness, the Court should be aware of what the proposition is and where the information is coming from and give the witness a full opportunity to explain his position, and that is not happening now.  The Court is being kept in the dark because there are things that need to be brought to light that cannot be brought to light in open session.  So, either we do this in a way that is effective for the ascertainment of the truth and effective for the presentation of evidence without consuming needless amounts of time, or the Court has to set some parameters on this questioning.  It is one or the other.  We can't have it both ways.  So, that is my concern.  And I think I will stop there.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, there is a number of points that Mr. Webster has made; the first being that a full answer to my question could not be made in open session.  And first of all, I don't think that was expressed by the witness.  

Secondly, if there is more information that Mr. Webster feels is necessary to bring out, he can certainly do that in his redirect examination, and he can do it in closed session if he feels that is necessary.  With respect to the inconsistency, I will make our position very clear, we believe that this witness was not at location A at the time of the meeting that he claims took place in (By order of the Court, this word was extracted from the transcript and filed under closed session) in late 1992.  And that the intercepts which have been admitted into evidence, and testified to, on the 7th of April 1994 were also not at location A but were intercepted from the Gisenyi ops camp.  And, therefore, there is no inconsistency whatsoever in our position.  

Now I don't know what more I can say.  I think we can certainly tell the witness that if he feels that in order to complete his answer it is necessary to refer to matters which might reveal his identity, and we could go into closed session for a few minutes to let him complete his answer, I don't have any problem with doing that.  But at this point, I think the best way to proceed is to let me asked my question, and let him give the answers and let Mr. Webster do his job when it comes his turn.  Thank you. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you mentioned the name of the place which needs to be redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm sorry. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I mean Mr. Robinson's last response just clarifies the issue, Your Honour, because he is relying on testimony from this witness in regard to these intercepts.  The only way that this witness can    explain -- the only explanation that this witness can offer for that information is how he received it.  And what Mr. Robinson is saying right now is that he doesn't believe that the witness received it in the way that he did.  So to me there is an inconsistency that needs to be thrashed out and I should not have to go back to that in redirect.  

The Defence should be able to put their case squarely to the witness and give him he an opportunity to respond.  He is hiding the shadows here.  And it is going to confuse the record at a later point in time when the witness is not here to clarify it.  So my suggestion is that we allow the witness to explain fully.  I should not have to go back to this in redirect.  It is not part of the Prosecution case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think that before I make -- or draw a conclusion that the witness has other information he would like to give, the witness himself would have to say something to that effect.  

Mr. Robinson. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not suggesting that the witness feels like he has other information he has to give.  What I am suggesting is that the way the evidence is coming forward, based on my knowledge through the witness statements and all of the documentation in this case, it is clear, and Mr. Robinson's last statement would -- would affirm that, that we are taking bits and pieces of information and patching them together in a manner to make a presentation to the Court that is disingenuous, that does not reflect the experience of this witness.  

And the Court is not in a position to know that because the witness has not been given an opportunity the answer fully, because we have been worried about taking his testimony in open session.  And if we were to go into closed session then all of these issues could be discussed without hedging.  On several occasions the witness has wanted to give an expansive answer and he has not been able to do so because he has been put on notice that he cannot disclose where he got the information that he has.  So, I am suggesting to the Court either we do this in a way that leads to an ascertainment of the truth and be above board about it, or we limited the questioning because it -- it is creating a record that is misleading.  So that is my concern.  
If the Court thinks that we should go on in this manner then we will do that because ultimately the decision lies with the Trial Chamber.  But I am bringing it to your attention because I see it as a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we feel that we ought to go into closed session now.  We have made a number of redactions, we think we have been making too many redactions and it has been -- we know it is not a matter of anybody being deliberately problematic.  There is that problem.  

Then the other issue, you see the competition between the two fair trial issues here which are conflicting with each other, the issue of trial in public and the issue of full factual explanation is being challenged right now.  And as the Judges we think that it is more important for us to be able to make a proper adjudication of the facts and that all aspects of the testimony should be in public.  This is also linked to the other fair trial issue of the protection of the witness's identity, which is, basically, what is the potential handicap that we are trying to manage right now. 

And for quite some time we have been thinking that the -- that even with the care that has been exercised that this part of the examination has, in fact, given the kind of information which to knowledgeable observers would provide information from which deductions could be made.  So, we think that the time has come where we ought to go into closed session to continue with the testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I will shift away from the events at location A then and go onto a different topic.  And maybe we can do all of the closed session at the end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
However, the next topic that I wanted to go into is a matter that is still under advisement by the Chamber concerning the events in Byahi secteur in 1992.  So, how would you like me to proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What part is this?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
This is a manner in which we objected to the testimony of the events in Byahi secteur because it was not in the indictment or the pretrial brief.  And now I'm to the point that I have to either cross-examination on this if it is admitted, or if it is excluded, I will skip it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it is better to cross-examine him on it.  I don't think we necessarily can save much time if you omitted it, even if we ruled in favour of your submission in due course.  I think it is safer to proceed. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you very much. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, you talked in your direct examination about some action in Byahi commune, or            Byahi secteur that was directed against relatives of an individual named Valens Kajeguhuaka -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
And that is number 38 on the spelling list.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And that action, as you understood it, was taken because it was suspected that that individual was an infiltrator, or an accomplice of the RPF, correct? 
A.	Regarding the presumed member of Kajeguhuaka's family, it was not really Kajeguhuaka who was targeted, but members of his family.  Kajeguhuaka himself was not considered as an infiltrator because he lived in Gisenyi.  He was a native of Gisenyi, but he was a well-known Tutsi.  And by that time, according to officers in Gisenyi, he was suspected of acting as an intelligence agent of the RPF.  And members of his family were also accomplices of the enemy, considered as accomplices of the enemy.  So those people were attacked.  

Byahi secteur is in Bahavu (phonetic) commune in Gisenyi.  So militia in Gisenyi, at the requests of the conseiller, and acting in coalition with other persons who were not militia, but fanatics of the MRND party, and who were acting with the conseiller, these were the people who went and killed those people.  According to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and the conseiller of the secteur, the bodies of those people were thrown into the toilet, in the secteur itself. 
Q.	Now, Witness ZF, are you aware that after he left Rwanda, Mr. Kajeguhuaka wrote a book?
A.	Counsel, I have not yet seen that book. 
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Mr. President, I would like to distribute an exhibit which is just a few pages from that book.  And I am going to ask this witness about some things that are written.  We actually have the book here, but I have taken the pages that are relevant and copied them.  So, with the assistance of the registrar, I would like to have shown the witness an exhibit.  This was not among the ones that I distributed earlier, so I have multiple copies for everyone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, have you seen this book?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson, gave me a copy this morning, Your Honour.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I enquire through the Court if this is being -- if we are moving onto the book for purposes of impeaching this witness or for going into new avenues with the witness? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
This is for impeaching the witness. 

Mr. President, with your permission, what I would like to do is have my legal assistant read five brief portions of this.  And then I am going to ask the questions about that to the witness.  They are in -- we don't have an English version of this, and I have highlighted, there a small line on the side of the page where the portions would be read from on the two pages.  So may that be done?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, Your Honours, I have read through the material.  And I'm a bit confused as to how this is going to impeach the witness, having read it myself and having listened to his testimony for the past two days.  Perhaps, before we read it into the record, Mr. Robinson could give us some explanation of how this is going to impeach the witness's prior testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, these events have been introduced into evidence, include the events of killings.  And it is suggested that this was part of the effort to exterminate the Tutsi for which liability for war crimes, conspiracy, genocide, et cetera, can be held.  It is our position that this individual and his family were targeted because they were, in fact, keeping arms and conducting activities, military related activities with the RPF.  In the passages that I would like to read, Mr. Kajeguhuaka himself admits that that is exactly what he was doing; include the possession of large amounts of weapons.  So the character of the attack that has been described in direct examination is being impeached by the information that I'm trying to present. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My recollection of the witness's testimony was that certain persons were targeted as enemy.  And as a result of that, action was taken against them.  And I fail to see how the passages of this book contradict that or impeach that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if we can have this discussion outside of the presence of the witness, I think that would be most appropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think the question should be permitted.  The problem has been -- we are worrying about the practice of reading so much material into the record, which takes so much time.  That is what's bothering us, the procedure by which you actually cross-examine on this material.  It may be that if it -- since it is only five sentences, and you do not have an English translation, we would permit it on this occasion.  But I'm just letting you know, that we are concerned about this practice.  And we would prefer if that -- if the translation is available, which would make it unnecessary for reading large sections of material onto the record. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I appreciate that, Mr. President.  I think this is going to come up again with Witness T in a lot longer form.  And what I had suggested is that I be able to meet with the witness so I can familiarise him with that material, I even asked you to subpoena him so that I could do that.  To me that is the easiest way.  And I also tried to meet with this witness, but it was refused.  So, I understand the problem, but when I have a text that is not translated into English, I don't know any other way to do it.  So I will try to limit the amount of text to be read as much as possible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

You may proceed now.   
MR. NIMY MAYIDIKA NGIMBI:
"I brought firearms which could easily be transported across the border by the guerrillas and secretly stored in my home in spare parts.  The number of militiamen and logistical service was to the tune of about 30.  The 30 ex-serviceman received training every evening from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.   And all was done in a deafening din accompanied by protractive (sic) sounds of liberation movements in Mozambique and Uganda.  The final phase was the demonstration of our arsenal, which triggered the greatest panic ever imagined even -- every imagined in the national guard and Rwandan armed forces.  The weapon which was most bothersome which bothered the two soldiers the most is an enormous weapon in the form of a machine gun, covered by a tent in Uganda military colours.  Our real weaponry was symbolic.  We had 15 Kalashnikovs, four fall UZI pistols, and about 50 grenades of all categories.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ZF, having heard what Mr. Kajeguhuaka said in his book about his own activities in Rwanda, can you tell us whether or not the actions of the Rwandan military and gendarmes that you have described may well have been justified by the information that existed?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  When is this account supposed to have taken place, are we talking about 1990, 1991, 1986, 1994?  I believe the witness was a bit more specific in his testimony, and I don't think that reading this passage out of context from a book that you have held up, that seems to be over 400 pages long, gives us a clear idea of what the author was referring to. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Maybe I can ask the question in a more general way, because I don't have the answer to Mr. Webster's question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And that is, given that Mr. Kajeguhuaka has acknowledged participating with the RPF, do you believe that it was justified for the military to take action against his -- himself and his associates?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question.  What difference does it make whether this witness thinks that the military action was justified or not?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, the witness has presented the events in Byahi secteur as a war crime.  And it is relevant to a war crime whether or not the person who is targeted was a combatant.  We now have evidence that at least the individual he has mentioned -- although we don't know about his family -- was a combatant on behalf of the RPF. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My recollection is when we were discussing the war crime that had to do with the incident in Bigogwe in 1992.  This is a completely separate incident; we're at two separate portions of the witness's direct examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the witness's opinion is not really evidence.  What is evidence would be whether the witness is aware that this type of information existed with the people who made the decision.  But his opinion as to whether it was justified or not is not evidence, really. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
The point well taken. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, were you aware whether or not this information was available to the persons who made the decision to conduct an operation in Byahi secteur in 1992? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, with respect to this document that I have read to the witness I would like it to be marked as ID NZ. 14 and we may come back to it with some other witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID NZ. 14 admitted for identification) 

MR. ROBINSON: 
You would like to take the afternoon break now?  I am about to move into another area. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We can take the afternoon break now.  We will take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1529H) 
(Pages 19 to 43 by Donna M. Lewis)
































(Court resumed at 1556H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, I want to ask you about the occasions in which you encountered Mr. Nzirorera in Gisenyi.  And is it true from your testimony that you claimed to have seen him three times, once at location A in 1992 and the other two times at the Gisenyi ops camp after 6th April 1994? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel.  I do not have that information which you were referring to.  I'm at a loss.  
Q.	Okay.  So can you tell us, then, how many times you encountered Mr. Nzirorera in Gisenyi? 
A.	From my recollection, Counsel, if you are talking about meeting, I remember that I saw him, not really met him, for the first time in 1992, sometime in that year, in location A.  

After April 6th I saw him again, more than once, in the Gisenyi ops camp. 
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your ability, when in 1992 you saw him at location A? 
A.	The second half of that year. 
Q.	And to try to narrow that down a little bit more, was it before the 15th of November, when President Habyarimana made his speech in Ruhengeri, and the 22nd of November when Léon Mugesera made his speech in Kabaya? 
A.	It is actually before those two dates, sir. 
Q.	And how much before those two dates, approximately?  A week?  A month?  Two months?  Can you give us some estimate? 
A.	Counsel, I am not ready to give you an approximate date.  I would simply say that it was in the second half of 1992, a long time before the dates when the two speeches you just referred to were made. 
Q.	Okay.  And so if we consider the second half of 1992 to begin the month of August and -- well, the month of July, and continue to, let's say, November 1992, where within that spectrum would this meeting have occurred? 
A.	I am unable to venture any such estimates, I'm afraid. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us the time of day which this meeting began? 
A.	Before noon.  The meeting started before noon. 
Q.	And when did it conclude? 
A.	That meeting ended during the afternoon. 
Q.	And approximately how long did the meeting last? 
A.	I am sorry, Counsel.  I do not have any time estimates. 
Q.	So you're unable to say whether the meeting concluded, for example, at around 3 o'clock, or whether the meeting went into 5 o'clock, for example? 
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you who were -- was present at this meeting.  And you've already provided that information on direct examination, and I've compiled this into a -- a document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'd like to have the registrar show the document to the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, directing the -- your attention to the document that's been placed in front of you, it contains 15 names.  Is that an accurate list of the persons that attended that meeting, according to you?  
A.	Yes, sir. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer this as Exhibit DNZ. 103. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 103 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	It's your testimony that Colonel Bagosora presided over this meeting, correct? 
A.	That's right, sir. 
Q.	And, Witness ZF, I put it to you that Colonel Bagosora has stated that he never participated or attended any such meeting.  Would you have any comment on that?? 
A.	Counsel, regarding what Colonel Bagosora may have said, I have nothing to say.  You see, you don't know why he said that.  However, I said what I saw.  I believe I have answered your question, sir.  
Q.	The second name on the list, Colonel Nsengiyumva, it's true, is it not, that in 1992 Colonel Nsengiyumva was assigned to Kigali, correct? 
A.	Counsel, I was not very familiar with the postings of army officers at that time.  But from what was being said amongst officers, at that time he was serving as G2 officer in the Rwandan army staff headquarters.  
Q.	And, Witness ZF, I put it to you that Colonel Nsengiyumva had stated that he never attended any such meeting.  Would you like to comment on that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.  Where is it that Colonel Nsengiyumva and Colonel Bagosora have made these statements?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, these are statements made to my Defence team. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So would you like to comment on the fact that I'm putting to you that Colonel Nsengiyumva has stated that he never attended such a meeting? 
A.	Counsel, concerning what Colonel Nsengiyumva said, just as what Colonel Bagosora said, I have nothing to say.  That is their word.  What I have said is what I saw, and that is my answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think I should comment that we don't regard the question as evidence.  It's what the witness says that goes as evidence in our consideration.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, the third person on the list -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand that the question is not evidence until it's completed with an answer, Your Honour.  But the point I'm trying to make is that there should be a -- it's -- it's appropriate for me to ask for an offer of proof from the question -- the questions have to be asked in good faith.  And that's my concern.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm accustomed to a practice where counsel would not put a matter in cross-examination if he wasn't in a position to lead evidence to support the question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, my concern is -- I expressed earlier is that some of the questions that have been made -- have been asked have not been asked in good faith, and that's why I -- I -- I pop up and request these clarifications.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is -- this list of -- I've just handed to the witness is virtually a witness list for me, and I'm going to intend on bringing these people.  And they're going to testify to what I'm putting to the witness.  When I do that, if I hadn't put it to the witness, Mr. Webster would be arguing that I should give it less weight because I hadn't put it to the witness.  So this is what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ZF, number 3 on the list, Colonel Bureyega (sic), what position did he hold in 1992 in the Rwandan government -- in the Rwandan army? 
A.	Counsel, I think you need to cross-check the spelling of those names.  You see, that colonel is called Buregeya, not Bureyega.  

At that time, from what I knew, that is, what I had been told, he was already on retirement.  Prior to his retirement he had been the commanding officer of the École supérieure militaire. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  

And inasmuch as he is deceased, I am not able to put what he would say about this meeting to you.  

Now, the next name, number 4, Major Ngendahimana, could you tell us what his position was in the Rwandan army in 1992? 
A.	Major Ngendahimana was the commanding officer of the 42nd battalion at that time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could be shown document number 9 on my list of exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you have any additional copies of the list?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry, I don't.  I -- I'm sorry.  I don't have it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A spelling check is needed for the (unintelligible).  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  In fact, I can go back and ask the witness.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you correct the spelling of Colonel Buregeya on that document by writing the correct spelling? 
MR. ROBINSON:
And it's number 20 on our spelling list.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm going to request the registrar to photocopy the list. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Make a few copies of those.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I continue with respect to Mr. -- Major Ngendahimana?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, (inaudible).  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, what's been placed in front of you is the minutes of a cabinet meeting of the Rwandan government chaired by President Kagame on the 23rd of November 2005.  On the second page at the bottom, it indicates that the cabinet approved the following military promotions for several officers, including a list from colonel to brigadier general.  And on page 3, number 15 of the list of people who were promoted from colonel to brigadier general is Colonel Jerome Ngendahimana.  Is that the same person who you say attended the meeting at location A in 1992?  
A.	Yes, sir. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, if the witness could be shown item number 10 in my list of exhibits -- I see that Issa is not here to do that.  May I ask that Stephanie (sic) do that?  And I could give you a copy, if you like. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, number -- document number 10 in front of you is an article from the New Times newspaper in Kigali on the 9th of April 2006.  And it indicates that the cabinet of the Rwandan government will appointed a group of people to investigate the alleged role of the French government in the 1994 genocide.  And among the persons appointed to this commission is former FDLR commander, Brigadier General Jerome Ngendahimana.  And is that the same person you say attended this meeting in 1992? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I think so, because his name was Jerome Ngendahimana. 
Q.	And is it your testimony that the very same person who in the RPF government has been promoted to brigadier general and appointed to a commission to investigate the genocide was in 1992 a participant in a meeting to discuss the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	Well, Counsel, about that, I wouldn't know.  What I know is that he was there.  Whether he was there on his own account or whether he was there to represent the battalion which he commanded, that is, the 42nd battalion, or there -- whether he was there to represent the ops commander, I wouldn't know.  What I know is that he was present there.  
Q.	Mr. -- 
A.	I wouldn't be able to explain the rest. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would like to offer my document number 9, the cabinet meeting minutes, as 
Exhibit DNZ. 104 and number 10, the news article, as Exhibit DNZ. 105. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
 (Exhibit No. DNZ. 104 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. DNZ. 105 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  And, Mr. President, has the list now been distributed to you?  Do you now have the list? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You may proceed with the list.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, going to the number 5 person on the list -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
And maybe I'll just pause for a moment.  
Issa, do you have everything that you need?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness ZF, do you still have that list in front of you, numbers 1 through 15? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	So number 5 on the list is Major Ntabakuze.  And if you could tell us what position he held in 1992 within the Rwandan army.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And it's number 66 on the spelling list. 
THE WITNESS:
At that time he was a major.  Now, considering the position he held, he was the commanding officer of the paracommando battalion in Kanombe. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So he was based in Kigali, correct? 
A.	Based in Kigali?  I do not know what you mean, Counsel.  
Q.	The -- the place where he regularly worked was in the Kigali area, correct? 
A.	Yes.  More specifically, in Kanombe. 
Q.	And, Witness ZF, I put it to you that Major Ntabakuze has stated that he never attended any meeting that you've described.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	What I can tell you is that I saw that major at that location at that time.  Now, concerning what he may have said, I know nothing about that. 
Q.	Now, moving to the civilians who you say attended this meeting, number 6, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza.  Can you tell us what position he held at the time of this meeting? 
A.	At that time I was not interested to know what his position was.  I was simply able to know that name.  And I was told by the sous-préfet who was there, that is, Bikumbi, that he was a civil servant. 
Q.	And was it your understanding that he was also working in Kigali? 
A.	I think so, but I was not interested in such questions.  
Q.	And I put it to you, Witness ZF, that Mr. Barayagwiza has stated that he never attended any such meeting.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I have nothing to say to what he has said.  What I know is that I saw him. 
Q.	Number 7 on the list is Léon Mugesera.  Could you tell us what his position was at the time of this meeting? 
A.	About him also at that time, I was told that he was a government employee. 
Q.	And was he working in Kigali? 
A.	Probably, but I also did not ask such a question.  What I was able to know was that he lived in Kigali and that he was a state employee. 
Q.	Now, I'm not in a position to make any representations to you as to what Mr. Mugesera would say about this because he's been involved in his own legal proceedings and I haven't had the ability to have that question put to him at this time.

Going to the next number, number 8, Joseph Habiyambere -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, on that point, since Mr. Robinson was mentioning someone who hadn't been put -- who that question had not been put to, I don't recall a similar statement being made for Major Ngendahimana.  Is it the Defence position that Ngendahimana also denies being present at that meeting?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to put that question to the major as of yet.  So, no, I'm not in a position to make that statement as -- as of now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So with respect to Joseph Habiyambere, can you tell us at the time of this meeting what position he held? 
A.	At that time Joseph Habiyambere was director-general in the ministry of public service and employment. 
Q.	And was that also in Kigali? 
A.	Probably.  I do not very well know whether he resided there or he was there only for work.  
Q.	And since Mr. Habiyambere is deceased, I have not been able to ask him about his attendance at this meeting. 

Turning to the next number, 9, Raphael Bikumbi, can you tell us what position he held at the time of this meeting? 
A.	He was sous-préfet at Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	And I'll represent to you that Mr. Bikumbi has stated that he has never been to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under closed session) camp -- actually, has never been to location A -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Redacted. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll ask that that be redacted. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	-- nor participated in any meetings there.  And I'd ask if you'd like to comment on that.  
A.	What I said was that Sous-Préfet Bikumbi was at point A with the others on that occasion.  
Q.	The next name, number 10, Protais Zigiranyirazo, can you tell me what post he held at the time of this meeting?  
A.	Counsel, at the time he was préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Witness ZF, I put it to you that Mr. Zigiranyirazo stopped being the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture in 1989 and, in fact, was out of the country in Canada until late 1992.  I further put it to you that Mr. Zigiranyirazo has stated that he attended no such meeting.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	Regarding what his duties were, I know nothing.  All I know is that he was préfet.  And when I saw him, the sous-préfet who introduced him to me told me he was sous-préfet of Ruhengeri.  And I do not know whether he was from Ruhengeri or from elsewhere, but at the time he was at that particular location.  
Q.	Going to the next name, number 11, Robert Kajuga, can you tell me what his position was? 
A.	Still as concerns this one, I did not know him.  But the person who introduced him to me told me that he was a national president of the Interahamwe, that is, the MRND youth wing.  
Q.	And was he based in Kigali, as far as you knew? 
A.	Probably, but I -- I am not very sure. 
Q.	And Mr. Kajuga has died in 1994, and I am unable to ask him about whether he attended this meeting. 

Turning to number 12, Côme Bizimungu, can you tell us what position he held at the time of this meeting? 
A.	At the time Côme Bizimungu was préfet of a préfecture, that is, Gisenyi.  He was préfet of Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	And, Witness ZF, I put it to you that Côme Bizimungu stopped being the préfet in Gisenyi préfecture in July 1992 and has stated that he never attended such a meeting and had no knowledge of it.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, regarding the date on which he stopped working in that capacity, I do not know very well.  But I know that, during that period, he was present at that location. 
Q.	The next name, number 13, is Ambassador Ubarijoro.  Can you tell us what position he held at the time of this meeting? 
A.	According to Sous-Préfet Bikumbi, Ambassador Ubarijoro was a civil servant in the ministry of foreign affairs.  He was also an adviser to President Habyarimana at the presidency.  
Q.	Witness ZF, I put it to you that Ambassador Ubarijoro was in 1992 a leader of the MDR party and a close supporter and associate of the portion of that party led by Faustin Twagiramungu and a strong opponent of President Habyarimana and the MRND.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness could be shown Exhibit 8. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would object to going any further with this document.  I don't know if I need to go any further with my objection, but, I mean, we can -- I mean, I suppose I should allow Mr. Robinson to ask his question.  But, looking at it, what does it achieve other than Mr. Robinson making the same representation, that he has spoken to this person and the person has denied being present at the meeting?  

I see what looks like a signature.  I would never think that that was a signature.  It wasn't on something that purported to be some sort of affirmation.  There's no seal.  This is not an original.  I can't understand what purpose this is going to serve.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  This is somewhat of an unusual situation in that Ambassador Ubarijoro is quite ill, and, as a result of that, I took the opportunity to stake (sic) a statement from him under penalty of perjury in the event that he is unable to attend the trial at such time as the Defence has the opportunity to call its witnesses.  And so, unlike these other situations, I have this statement in writing.  

It's not my intention to offer this in -- into evidence at this time, but since I do have it in writing, I thought it would be a good thing to do to show it to the witness, to confront him with the statements that are contained in -- in there, to give him an opportunity to comment on it, and then to move on.  

I recognise that the statement is not evidence.  I am going to have to take some measures to get this testimony.  It may be by a motion for deposition or some other means, but for now, in putting my case to the witness, I would like to do it in a way in which it's the strongest.  So that's why I -- I propose to read to him what Ambassador Ubarijoro has said and ask him to comment on it.  

And I'm going to substitute "location A" for the location as it's stated in the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can put it to him.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, the document that you have in front of you reads as follows:  "I, Bonaventure Ubilijoro, hereby declare under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct:  Number 1, I am a former ambassador for the Rwandan government.  Number 2, I have been advised that a person known as Witness ZF gave a statement to the Office of the Prosecutor, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in which he said that I had been present at one or more meetings at location A, Gisenyi préfecture, between late 1990 and late 1993.  

"I have been advised that Witness ZF further testified under oath in the trial of Prosecutor versus Bagosora that he had seen me in attendance at a meeting there between 1990 and 1993.  These statements are untrue.  I have never been to location A in my life.  Furthermore, I never attended any meetings at which the extermination of Tutsis was planned or discussed."  

Signed on the 28th of March 2005, Bonaventure Ubilijoro, and witnessed by three people.  
And so I ask you, Witness ZF, if you would like to comment on what I'm putting to you that Ambassador Ubarijoro has said about this matter.  
A.	Counsel, the first thing I would tell you is that I saw him with my own eyes.  He was introduced to me.  This is not something I heard from someone.  

The second thing concerning MRND, the MDR, or any other party in Rwanda, there were many events, many wings of the various parties, or factions of the various parties.  I don't know whether you've not heard of MRND Power or MDR Power.  Someone could claim to have been in one party, whereas he was in another -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry to have interrupted you, but could you speak a bit slower?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  

I was talking about parties, since counsel referred to the MDR Power, which was Ubilijoro's party.  And at that time the MRND party had been registered, and it was in government.  Furthermore, those state employees could be members of the MDR party, but that was no guarantee that if someone was in the MDR he was a sworn enemy of the MRND or the CDR or any other party, for that matter.  It all depended on the individuals concerned.  Everything was possible.  That is why I cited the case the period when members of MDR Power were considered as members of the opposition.  They became members of the opposition overnight, even in the PL and other parties.  

I don't know whether this is a guarantee of state employees.  I was told that he was working at the ministry of foreign affairs and was an adviser to the president.  Whether he came here to represent the ministry or to follow the proceedings of the meeting, I do not know.  What I know is that he was present, and I saw him as he was introduced to me.  I saw him in the capacity in which he was introduced to me.  

That is my answer, Counsel.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if we could mark this statement as ID NZ. 15 for now.  

May it be so marked for identification?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'll mark it for identification.  There is a slightly different characteristic because this cannot be admitted in evidence without a judicial order.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, actually, none of these identification (sic) can be admitted into evidence without a judicial order, but I -- these are documents which I hope at some point may be converted into exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll mark it for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
What difference does it make at this point if the entire contents of the document have been written into the -- have been read into the record?  I mean, we've made it evidence by simply allowing Mr. Robinson to ask the question of the witness.  The only thing that is not in evidence at this point are the three names that are completely illegible at the bottom of the document, who are the witnesses, who nobody knows who they are.  I can't make anything out there.  But everything else has been read.  So, I mean, the document itself is superfluous at this point.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, it's not -- just because it's been read, it's not in evidence.  It's been put to the witness as a question.  It has no evidentiary value, and I think we all agree to that.  But the purpose for marking something for identification is that, if later, for example, if Ambassador Ubarijoro were to come to testify and we were to refer to this declaration, we could link it to the document that was presented to this witness.  But it has no evidentiary value, so I don't see any harm in keeping it in this status.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have marked it for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. ID NZ. 15 admitted for identification)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Number 14 on the list is Joseph Nzirorera.  Can you tell us what post he held at the time of this meeting? 
A.	Counsel, at the time of this meeting, I did not quite know what he was doing because I was already in Gisenyi.  But before I left Kigali for Gisenyi, I knew him to be minister of public service.  As for what happened thereafter, I do not know.  I wasn't very interested in that.  

Shortly after that event, I again heard that he was an authority in the MRND party.  But regarding this specific -- the specific period we are dealing with, I do not know what he was doing. 
Q.	And as far as you knew, was he residing in Kigali at this time, at the time of this meeting? 
A.	I do not quite know where he was residing at the time.  I do not know where he came from to point A. 
Q.	And, Witness ZF, I put it to you that Mr. Nzirorera states that he never attended any such meeting.  Do you wish to comment on that? 
A.	I cannot say anything on his statement.  That is why he's here.  What I know is that I saw him being introduced on that occasion.  
Q.	And, finally, number 15, Juvénal Kajelijeli, what did you understand his position to be at the time of this meeting? 
A.	From what Sous-Préfet Bikumbi said, Kajelijeli was bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 
	Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	And I'll put it to you, Witness ZF, that Mr. Kajelijeli has stated that he never attended any such meeting.  Do you want to comment on that?  
A.	I don't know what to say, Counsel, but I am surprised that everyone says they were -- they were not there, which means that nobody attended the meeting.  That is what they are saying.  But I saw all those people.  

It is up to you to follow the matter up in order to ascertain whether all those people were there or whether nobody attended the meeting.  Because if you, yourself, catch a thief stealing, that thief will not accept that he stole anything.  

That is all I can say by way of an answer, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness ZF, just to be clear, it is our case that there never was a meeting at location A and that's why all of these people, who you claim attended, are saying that they never attended such a meeting.  Anything you'd like to comment on that? 
A.	You want to know what I have to say in that regard?  This is what I would like to say:  What they said -- they have said, as far as I'm concerned, is normal.  It is normal that they should deny being there.  It would be abnormal for them to accept that they were present.  It would be like tying the rope around their necks.  

That is all I can say for an answer, Counsel.  
Q.	Can you tell us, do you know why this meeting, which involved virtually all people from Kigali, was held in Gisenyi? 
A.	In answer to this particular question, Counsel, I would say that I know nothing.  Even the mere fact of attending that meeting, or being present at that meeting, was the work of chance.  I did not even know that such a meeting could be held.  I could not even know why that meeting was being held, why they chose that specific location, and at that particular time.  I know nothing about that. 
Q.	I want to go over with you what you say that you heard at this meeting.  And I'm going to try to do it quickly, so I'm going to summarise what I believe your testimony was, and you tell me if I -- you can correct me if I'm wrong.  

But, as I understand it, you indicated that you heard Colonel Bagosora say that there was a plan by Tutsi to exterminate Hutus and they had to do everything to preempt that and make sure that the plan did not succeed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And you went on to testify at this trial that you heard Colonel Nsengiyumva speak and say something to the effect that those people are playing with fire and that they would show them; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, it's true, is it not, that on the 4th of December 2002 you testified at a trial here in Arusha in which the accused included Colonel Bagosora and Colonel Nsengiyumva?  Correct? 
A.	Counsel, you are referring to a specific date.  I do not quite remember, but I know that I did give evidence in that trial, that is, the Bagosora and Nsengiyumva trial. 
Q.	I'm going to read some questions and answers that were given from the -- that are from the transcript of this trial on the 4th of December 2002 at page 70.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, this testimony was given in closed session, this portion of it.  However, the -- the actual text of the -- doesn't -- don't reveal his identity or even come close to it.  It just talks about what he heard being said.  But how would you like me to proceed in light of that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this in the electronic bundle you submitted? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, this is on the electronic bundle that the Prosecution, I believe, submitted, which is the prior testimony of the witness.  Although, I have to say that we received the closed session testimony late, so it may not be in your electronic bundle. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How large a portion is that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's only -- essentially two sentences. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we have -- see it? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Unfortunately, I only have it in electronic here. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could you give me the -- the date and the page numbers again, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  It's the 4th of December 2002 on page 70.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And which -- the lines are numbered, so if you could tell me which lines. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It would be essentially line 10 through line 14.  
I wonder now that Mr. Webster has read that portion whether he would indicate if he has any objection to it being suggested to the witness in open session.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll -- I've already made clear that I thought that most of this testimony should have been in closed session, so I'm not prepared to concede that point.  But the Trial Chamber can overrule my objection, and Mr. Issa can take the transcript up to the Judge.  
(Pages 44 to 57 by Ann Burum)































1700H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's line 10 through 14, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, the issue is now just the content of the questions you are putting.  And the issue is the protective orders.  We think we would be in breach of the protective order if we read closed session testimony in open session without an order from the Chamber that -- so, the evaluation of the content of the material is not important in our ruling, but this should not be done in open session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, I understand, Mr. President.  So I would then ask us to go into closed session very briefly so I can confront him with this part of the transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much material do you have to do in closed session?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Just the one or two questions that it takes to ask him about this particular part of it.  This is -- I don't want to leave this for my whole closed session thing, because this would be totally out of context.  I'm going over this meeting, and I want to make this point on this meeting, and then we can go back into open session, if you don't mind.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, we go into closed session for a very short time.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 59 to 61] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 58 by Kirstin McLean)















MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we take the adjournment for the day now.  We resume tomorrow morning.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry, Mr. Sow.  Does it concern the witness?  
MR. SOW: 
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well perhaps the witness can be allowed to leave now.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. SOW: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.  Mr. President, Mr. -- Ms. Dior Diagne, lead counsel, sent me a message a short while ago and asked me to advise you of the problem she's encountering.  And this is in connection with her trip to Europe to attend the video conference.  She's just been informed by the registry that she will not be able to travel there, simply because the registry is of the opinion that, for purposes of judicial economy, they would request one Defence counsel to be present there.  

Ms. Diagne, as well as Mr. Édouard Karemera, who I have consulted, are of the view that this measure is not in accordance with the Trial Chamber decision.  Above all, even though we are in a joint trial, each and every accused has the right to present a separate Defence.  And I think that is what warranted your decision.  

So, today, from the email she has sent, she will no longer be able to go there.  It is for this reason that I was asked to advise you of this problem so that the necessary measures are taken for all teams to be there.  Personally, I was contacted by the registry, but I think that in that regard, my opinion is not of major importance.  

Be that as it may, in accordance with the Trial Chamber decision, I would like to pray you, on behalf of Ms. Diagne, to order the registry to take all measures indeed for her to travel and attend the video conference.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would like to add to what Mr. Sow just said a discussion which I had in that connection with the representative of DCDMS.  You see, as far as I'm concerned, we need a specific interpretation -- spacious (sic) interpretation of your order.  You see, they have their order, but decide not to respect it.  They decide to apply their own rules, and I am reminded that the same arrangement had been made for the evidence of Witness G, and they actually dragged their feet before complying.  And I said to -- we are going to request you to support us in complying with the decisions that you take.  That is the decision -- or, the difficulty which we would like to convey to you this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, we obviously cannot make any mandatory orders without hearing the party against whom the orders are requested.  So, you've made your application quite informally this afternoon.  We can't respond to you now, but we will look into it, and see what will happen by tomorrow morning.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  However, Mr. President, I simply want to draw your attention to the fact that we did not agree on the video conference, and that even for purposes of judicial economy, it would have been more pragmatic for it to take place here in Arusha.  So, let it not be that today, after we were not agreeing with the video conference, that we are not being allowed to go to the location of the video conference, and today we are being subjected to budget constraints.  It's not our fault, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We will take your comments -- we will take note of your comments and we will consider them, and consider what other action we can take.  

We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1729H)
