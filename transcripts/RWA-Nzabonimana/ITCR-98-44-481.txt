P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 28th of June 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Appearances are the same?  Ms. Hounkpatin?  Sorry. 

Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Our lead counsel, Peter Robinson, is not here in the courtroom, but he shall be joining us later.  Otherwise, the composition of our teams remain the same. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  The composition of my team has changed significantly.  Mr. President, you will notice that my learned friend, Frédéric Weyl, is not here, but he will join us later.  

And the main person concerned in this case, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, is not here in the courtroom.  He -- his ex -- absence can be explained by the -- the decision that you made on the 24th of June.  The way the decision was implemented in that -- it was incredible.  Because when we left this courtroom at -- on Friday at 12:30 p.m., he was asked to immediately go to the UNDF instead of being taken to the safe house where he had been living for more than a year.  

If you remember, he left his cell at UNDF in October 2008.  And he requested to be returned to UNDF so that he could work properly in the preparation of his defence, which is due to start.  Your decision granted his request.  And you wanted that his return to UNDF should be implemented as soon as practicable and not forcibly, as has been the case.  

So at 4:30 p.m. he got to UNDF.  He was taken to a cell which was dusty, which was not properly prepared.  And his personal belongings were thrown all over the place.  And when he got to UNDF, he had to start arranging his room.  And this was not what -- your decision.  

In any case, there is solidarity among detainees.  The detainees themselves cleaned up and adjust themselves so that they could sleep in that cell.  Because up to now when I'm talking to you, he cannot use the cell allotted to him.  So it is these circumstances that has made him be absent from the proceedings today and absent from this courtroom today.  

A few minutes ago I spoke to him on the phone.  And he told me that he had seen the nurse as a matter of routine.  And I heard that he should be taken to the UN clinic here, maybe because his health condition has worsened.  Be that as it may, I would like to speak to him after he has attended clinic so that I can have further information regarding what is happening.  It's only today when I came here to the courtroom that I became aware of the developments which I have just explained before you in summary.  

I would also like to tell you that, in view of the special circumstances of our witness currently and in view of the -- my learned friend, Raphaël Constant's, situation, I was able to obtain from Mr. Ngirumpatse the authorisation of representing him in his absence so that the proceedings this morning may continue.  

In any case, I would like to protest vigorously against the manner in which your decision was implemented.  Mr. Ngirumpatse is not refusing to go back to his cell.  He requested to go there.  However, there is a humane manner to ex -- implement the decision.  So what I am protesting against is the inhumanity in the manner in which your decision was implemented, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  As you could imagine, the Chamber and the President's office had sought information as well.  And I -- I had arranged for the commander of the prisons of the UNDF to be present in court.  And I would invite him to give a statement as to the manner in which the decision was implemented.  

Mr. Guindo.
MR. GUINDO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  It is with great pleasure that I am here in this courtroom this morning because I have just heard counsel.  But I have to say -- I'm sorry that -- to have to say that I'm shocked.  

We received your decision instructing us to take Mathieu Ngirumpatse to UNDF.  Before doing that, we contacted Mathieu Ngirumpatse when you adjourned proceedings on Friday.  I sent a team to ask him to get ready for the transfer because we had received a decision from you asking us to send him to UNDF.  He told members of my team that he was not ready and that he would not go back to UNDF before the 15th or the 20th of July because he had to be ready.  

So when I received that information, I personally went to the safe house in order to meet Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  However, before going there, I met the chief medical officer, Dr. Epée, and I told her, "This is the situation.  Do you think that there would be no problem health wise if Ngirumpatse goes to UNDF?"  She told me, "Yes.  You -- he can go there because the decision has been taken."  

So I went to the safe house, called him, and I spoke to him.  During our conversation he told me that no, he needed -- he did not refuse to go there but he needed adequate time.  So I asked him, "What do you mean adequate time?  Because the proceedings have been adjourned today, so we are taking you to UNDF and you will have the whole weekend to prepare your cell."  Because the practice at UNDF is that each detainee cleans his cell.  Each detainee is responsible for the -- for the maintenance and prop -- of his cell.  That is clear.  

He told me.  Very well.  But he needed some time because -- because his daughters were visiting him and he wanted me to come back at 4:30 p.m.  So at 4:30 I sent a team, and they took him quietly without any problem to UNDF.  And since his cell had been locked for two years -- the cell could not have been cleaned in his absence.  He had to be there physically.  Otherwise, if we were to open the cell and anything disappeared, then we could have been accused of having taken away documents from his cell.  

So we took him to UNDF.  We cleaned one empty cell next to his with the support of co-detainees.  And the cellule (sic) was clean, and he went in that cell.  

Now, regarding his personal effects, when he got there, it is normal for us to search his personal effects so that his effects could enter in due and proper form in UNDF.  So he got into UNDF.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday I did not receive any complaint at UNDF to the effect that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's cell was not appropriate and that it did not meet standards.  

All UNDF cells are identical.  They have the same amenities, and I do not see any problem in that regard.  We did not ill-treat him.  We did not dump him into a car.  It was with assent on -- consent that he went to the vehicle without handcuffs, without any restraint up -- and we took him to UNDF.  That is what I can say, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Guindo. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would like to make a small comment.  Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excuse me.  First -- first -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
You understand why I would like to meet my client. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, Ms. Hounkpatin, first -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Your comment may have a relationship to what I was going to say.  I was going to enquire whether you had any questions you wanted to put to Mr. Guindo. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What would you like to ask him?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I would like to ask Mr. Guindo if he's gone back to the UNDF since Friday and if he met Mr. Ngirumpatse since -- if he's met Mr. Ngirumpatse since Friday.
MR. GUINDO:  
I haven't returned to the UNDF.  I didn't go there.  I have services, and I have staff working there, staff who are responsible for giving an account of the entire situation in the UNDF to me.  That's how a detention centre is managed.  I don't have to go there.  There are detainees there.  There are people who are working there.  And there are some detainees who don't see me for the month.  

But I have services, and I have a duty officer who would -- to whom peep -- people report any problem.  And he reports back to me.  And I did not receive any information to the effect that there was something that was amiss in the UNDF up until this morning. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I believe that we are going to ask questions -- we are going to receive answers that do not reflect the reality.  Mr. Guindo gave us a report of a perfect cell.  

Mr. President, I would like to meet my client and discuss with him because we have two totally different versions insofar as the manner in which the transfer was carried out on Friday and the manner in which things were organised to enable him to sleep in one of the clean rooms -- in a clean room at the UNDF.  

And this may take the entire morning, but that is not our purpose.  Our -- our goal is that I should be able to discuss with Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And he has given you the authorisation to proceed with these proceedings.  But as things stand now, if need be, we will revisit this problem of his transfer and the conditions in which the transfer was carried out, which does not seem to be -- to reflect exactly what Mr. Guindo has told us here this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  In those circumstances it's clear that the matter has to be closed for now -- at least for now.  There's no point in carrying on on this issue any further at this time.  So we will allow Mr. Bagosora to continue giving his testimony. 

Mr. Guindo, thank you very much for attending the court this morning and for giving your report.  But you are now excused. 
MR. GUINDO:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Colonel Bagosora, good morning. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I regret that we have such a late start.  But your testimony will continue now.  I hope that there will be enough time for you to complete it before Mr. Constant leaves.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  And Mr. Nimy will now continue his examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could interrupt briefly, Your Honour, to address a -- a brief housekeeping issue that should take no more than a minute or two, something I've discussed with Mr. Nimy already.  It concerns the exhibits that we tendered -- or that was tendered by the Nzirorera Defence on Friday.  I had promised to provide a French printout of the book of Filip Reyntjens, which was offered as D. NZ835, and I have that here for Mr. -- for CMS.  I showed it to Mr. Nimy this morning.  
And when I handed up the English translation on Friday, it didn't include the conclusion, which I've copied now, and I showed that to Mr. Nimy as well.  And this would be D. NZ835B.  And I've discussed both with Mr. Issa.  So he understands what is entailed.

And then last week I had an email exchange with Mr. Robinson about one of his previous exhibits.  It's D. NZ751.  It's an exhibit that was admitted some time ago.  But in going over it, I noticed that several pages were missing, and that came to my attention because I had gotten a French translation of the complete exhibit.  And I brought this to Mr. Robinson's attention.  And he and I agreed that the entire exhibit should be re-scanned and submitted to CMS.  And I showed that to Mr. Nimy this morning as well.  

So now I have the complete English exhibit, which is D. NZ751A, and a complete French translation.  And I've requested both be re-scanned and that this complete exhibit be substituted for what CMS had previously.  And I think my -- all of the email correspondence on this issue was copied to the Trial Chamber coordinator and to CMS, and then I discussed it with Mr. Nimy this morning as well.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Mr. Nimy, that's -- is consistent with your recollection as well, I take it. 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor talked to me about this a short while ago, and I observed that what he said was a result of ex -- correspondences (sic) that he had with Mr. Robinson.  And I told him that I won't have any objections under the circumstances. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Registrar, we make the appropriate orders.  Thank you.  

You will now proceed with your examination of the witness, Mr. Nimy.
THÉONESTE BAGOSORA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morning, Colonel.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Colonel, when we adjourned last week, we had finished discussing the first meeting that you held at the army headquarters in the night of the 6th of April 1994; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	We are now going to discuss the second meeting, Colonel, the second meeting that you held at the army headquarters in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994.  Who initiated that meeting, Colonel? 
A.	When I returned from the residence of the UN Secretary General's representative at about 2 a.m. on the 7th of April, Dallaire, Rwabalinda, and myself went to the army headquarters where we had left the other officers waiting.  And when I got there, we resumed our meeting, which is what we referred to as the second meeting of the night of 6 to 7 April.  

And I probably can straightaway tell you how things played out.  When I arrived at the army headquarters from Mr. Booh-Booh's residence, that is, the representative of the UN Secretary General, I gave a report of the meeting we had with Mr. Booh-Booh, namely, or, that is, that I had told Mr. Booh-Booh that the Rwandan armed forces had no intention of staging a coup d'état and that they were supporting the implementation of the Arusha Accords and, lastly, that they were contemplating setting up a crisis committee that would manage the situation.  

And then I told them what Mr. Booh-Booh had given to me as answer, namely, that the UN Secretary General's representative, Mr. Booh-Booh, had entrusted me with the responsibility of contacting the MRND executive committee in order to convey to them or to it the message of designating the representative of the president who had just died -- or the replacement of the president who had just died and that Mr. Booh-Booh had also invited a delegation of the Rwandan armed forces to the meeting that he had just held with the US ambassador, a meeting that was going to bring together the ambassadors who were sponsoring the Arusha Peace Accords and so that they could look into the situation as it was and thereto look -- consider the measures that they could take.  

After I had submitted my report -- after I had made my report, the officers that had gathered at the army headquarters where General Dallaire was present renewed my mandate to the effect that I remained the chief of delegation of the Rwandan armed forces that had to meet the ambassadors sponsoring the Arusha Peace Accords at the residence of the US ambassador the following day in the morning.  To this delegation was added on -- upon the decision of the meeting of the officers, General Ndindiliyimana, who was also going to be a member of that delegation that had to go to the 
US ambassador's house the following day.  

Thereafter, we immediately asked General Dallaire to contact the RPF and to make them stop bring -- prevent them from bringing out any of their troops from the CND.  General Dallaire accepted that proposal, and at around 3 a.m., in the morning, that is, General Dallaire returned to his quarters but before the communiqué that had to be addressed to the population was considered.  

That communiqué -- well, we mandated colonel -- Colonel Kayumba, that is, before we went to the UN Secretary General's representative, Mr. Booh-Booh -- so before we went to Mr. Booh-Booh's house, we asked him to write this communiqué.  So by the time he left, General Dallaire was aware that there was a communiqué by the Rwandan armed forces that was going to address the population, informing it of the prevailing situation at the time and asking it -- the conduct to have during that tragic moment.  

Paradoxically, General Dallaire went away, and he went and gave the order to give an assignment to Colonel Luc Marchal that he escort Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana for her to go and deliver a speech over the radio.  And he did this without my knowledge -- without the knowledge of the -- a command of the Rwandan armed forces.  That situation, that is, the decision to take Agathe to the radio for her to deliver a speech, cannot be explained because General Dallaire cannot justify -- cannot come up with justification for what were the bases for him to take Agathe Uwilingiyimana to the radio to deliver a speech without having informed the Rwandan armed forces about it and without having informed the government about it, a government that -- a government of which Agathe was a prime minister.  

I have already read an excerpt of the letter written by the ministers of Uwilingiyimana's government who were asking her not to make any statement anymore on behalf of the government without having been mandated to do so beforehand.  Now, General Dallaire, by which power -- or who gave him the power to take Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana to the radio without the knowledge of the Rwandan armed forces and without the knowledge of all the ministers of the government?  

This can only be explained as within the framework of the coup d'état that I have talked to you about, in part, the coup d'état that General Dallaire had contemplated to have staged with the support of the officers that he referred to as the moderate members of the gendarmerie.  So it was after their departure, after general -- General Dallaire had left at about 3 a.m. in the morning.  And I told you we had -- that we, the officers that were present at the army headquarters and myself, examined the communiqué that had been drafted by Colonel Kayumba.  We considered it, we examined it, approved it, endorsed it, and then assigned it -- for it to be broadcast over the radio.  So for that first part -- that is what we did insofar as that first part is concerned. 
Q.	Colonel, no doubt we will revisit some points that you have mentioned subsequently.  But I put a question to you.  I don't believe that you answered it.  My question was, who had convened that second meeting? 
A.	That second meeting was a continuation of the first one.  I told you that the first meeting was convened without my knowledge by General Ndindiliyimana in complicity with Colonel Murasampongo, that is, insofar as that first meeting is concerned but that -- before that fait accompli in spite of everything -- in spite of the situation that was prevailing and since they were not opposed to the fact that I co-chair that first meeting.  

So when we went to see the UN Secretary General's representative, the officers with whom I had been at the first meeting remained at the army headquarters.  And when we returned at around 2 a.m., this was, therefore, the meeting that had resumed, and that is what we are referring to as the second meeting. 
Q.	Very well, Colonel.  So you talked about a communiqué that was prepared and drafted by Colonel Cyprien Kayumba.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was the role that you personally played in the drafting and design or conception of that communiqué? 
A.	Before I went to see the UN Secretary General's representative, Mr. Booh-Booh, at around midnight, the officers that were present at that meeting and myself asked Colonel Kayumba, who was the duty officer of the minister of defence on that day, to draft that communiqué.  I don't know the person with whom he worked to draft it, but I didn't play any active part in the drafting of that communiqué.  

However, when it came to our examining it, I discussed with the officers present when I returned from Mr. Booh-Booh's house.  So we examined it and approved it.  And it is upon its approval that I signed it -- for it to be broadcast over the radio.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, can you kindly hand over document number 15 to the witness.  I'm talking about -- I -- document number 15 of our bundle of documents. 

This is -- these are the minutes of the office of the prosecutor of Brussels as -- of the crowned counsel.  It is dated November 1997. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Doc -- Colonel, do you have that document with you? 
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	Please go to page 5 thereof.  
A.	Yes.  I am on that page. 
Q.	Look at page 7.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And page 8 as well.  So those are the three pages that we will be examining in that document.  
A.	Yes.  I can see it. 
Q.	On page 5 you have the first paragraph.  Can you see it? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	Can you please read the end of that last paragraph -- of that first paragraph.  
A.	What you say -- what did you say?  The end of what?  
Q.	The end of the first paragraph, where is -- where it is said "I drafted".  
A.	"I drafted the message that had to be read to the nation.  After the consent of the committee, the message was taken away to be read over the national radio." 
Q.	So who is the person speaking here?  Is that indeed Colonel Kayumba? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	Now turn to page 7 of the document.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you read the very last paragraph and proceed to the next page, that is, on the first paragraph in the next page.  
A.	Yes.  I can see it.  "I am indeed the person who drafted the message that was read over the radio.  It had -- the decision had been taken that no politician should take the floor on national radio so long as the new government had not been formed.  General Dallaire and Colonel Marchal had been informed about this.  It was never a question for Madam Agathe to go to the radio to give a message to the population.  We felt that during her tenure at the head of the Rwandan government she never enjoyed credibility and consequently, if she had gone to the radio immediately after the assassination of the president, she would have run the risk of fanning the flames, in particular, insofar as the supporters of the MRND were concerned." 
Q.	Very well.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, can you please give document number 18 of our bundle to the witness.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document? 
A.	Not yet. 
Q.	Do you have the document, Colonel? 
A.	Yes, I do.  Yes, I have it. 
Q.	Go to page 296.  If you would also look at 19 -- 297.  Are you on it? 
A.	Yes.  I have located the pages. 
Q.	Can you read the passages.  
A.	The passage that I am going to read -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could you describe what he's reading from so the record will be clear on the point. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, the witness is going to describe the atmosphere surrounding the meeting and with the statements of Mr. Dallaire in order to show clearly -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You misunderstood my question.  We might know what the witness is reading from because we know what document 18 refers to.  But that's not really clear for the record.  So if you could just describe what is the document from which he's reading, it would clarify the situation considerably. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, can I make another proposal to you.  Since the witness is in the box and since he had already started reading, wouldn't it be clearer for him to read instead of my having to make a description; whereas, he has the document that he has to read before him.  Wouldn't that be faster?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, is he reading an extract from a book written by Mr. Dallaire entitled Shake Hands with the Devil at the particular page?  That's all that is required. 
MR. NIMY: 
I think your ans -- your question is clearer now, Mr. President.  Yes.  This is a book by General Dallaire, I shook hands with the devil:  The failure of humanity in Rwanda.  In fact, we are dealing with that book indeed here, which, by the way, has already been admitted into evidence.  And we are taking an excerpt from page 296 and page 297. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

You will proceed, Colonel Bagosora. 
THE WITNESS:
The passage that I am going to read will be meant to prove that General Dallaire hid from me the assignment of taking Agathe to the radio to deliver a speech.  And I quote -- and I'm quoting Dallaire here:  "At the time that Booh-Booh was re-accompanying us towards the car, I sent the others ahead and asked the UN's Secretary General representative for a few moments for us to discuss in private."  

And I'll move on to the following page.  And I will be reading the third -- or fourth line of the first paragraph.  "I told him about our decision to provide an escort to Madam Agathe so that she can safely go to the Radio Rwanda broadcasting station."  

So when General Dallaire informed Mr. Booh-Booh about his decision, he kept me in the dark.  I was not aware of what they had told each other.  

And General Dallaire, in his testimony here in 2004, that is, in January of that year, he reiterated more or less the same thing.  He said that he did not want people to know -- he did -- that he did not want the Rwandan armed forces or any other person to know that he had decided to take Agathe to the radio to deliver a speech.  And he was saying that the fewer people knew about it, the better it would be.  And he confirmed that he hid this from me.  He hid his intention of taking Agathe to the radio to deliver a speech from me. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well.  Thank you very much.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to point out that the -- we were dealing with pages 296 and 297 of this book by Dallaire that has already been admitted into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The page numbers are in the French version?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes indeed, Mr. President.  These are page numbers in the French version of the book. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Colonel, let's continue discussing that second meeting.  After having addressed the issue of the communiqué that was drafted by Colonel Cyprien Kayumba, you yourself, personally, what else did you do in the course of that meeting? 
A.	During that meeting -- or in the meantime, at around 2:15 a.m., I made a phone call to Colonel Gatsinzi, who was in Butare, in order to invite him to come back and resume his position as ad interim chief of staff the following day as early as possible.  I can already say that he did not come at the appointed time and that, rather, he came to Kigali the following day at around 4 p.m.  

And then at about 2:30 a.m. I placed a phone call to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who was the MRND chairman, and I invited him to a meeting with all the members of his committee at the ministry of defence on the 7th at 7 a.m.  He accepted to attend the meeting.  In other words, after the two messages that I sent out and the signing of the communiqué that had to be broadcast over radio -- over the radio at around 4 a.m., I returned home, that is, to the Kimihurura neighbourhood at about 4:30 a.m. 
Q.	And won't -- what did you do when you returned to your home, Colonel? 
A.	When I got home a few minutes later, the duty officer at the ministry of defence, Colonel Kayumba, Cyprien, called me and asked me to go to the general staff of the army as a matter of urgency without further details.  At 6:30 in the morning, I went to the general staff of the army where the officers present there, including General Ndindiliyimana -- all of us were informed of an issue that had arisen following the fact that some members of the Presidential Guard had gone out of the -- their encampment and in -- and in Kimihurura neighbourhood.  

So we discussed the issue, and we agreed together to send out members of the reconnaissance battalion in order to go and neutralise the units of the Presidential Guard which were creating disorder in that neighbourhood and to take them back to their camp. 
(Pages 1 to 12 by Tanya West)


1130H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
After that agreement made by the officers present at the headquarters of general staff, I ordered the army's general staff to carry out that operation.  However, unfortunately, I later learnt that 
Colonel Murasampongo, who was the acting chief of staff of the army, did not implement the mission and did not inform me of the fact that he had not carried out the order he should.  

That mission, I insist, was paramount, because if it had been implemented in the agreed time frame, then some politicians in the Kimihurura neighbourhood would have been saved because most of them were attacked after 7:30 in the morning, whereas an order had been issued at around 6:30 in the morning. 

So this shortcoming on the part of Colonel Murasampongo, that is, his failure to act in Kimihurura in order to send members of the Presidential Guard to their camp, was used as a pretext by the RPF, who, in the afternoon of the 7th of April, attacked the camp of the Presidential Guard and other neighbourhoods in Kigali city that very afternoon, that is, of the 7th of April. 

So after I had issued an order to the general staff to act in Kimihurura area, I had an appointment at seven in the morning with the MRND committee.  So I went to MRND, and by 7 o'clock I was there.  The other invited guests were there.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, his vice-chairman, Édouard Karemera, were there.  In fact, they were amongst the first people to get there.  And in the following 15 minutes, 
Mr. Nzirorera, Joseph, the national secretary of the MRND, was also there as well. 

In the meantime, General Ndindiliyimana also came there.  So this means that, if I'm not mistaken, we were five in my office in -- for that meeting. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Have you finished your answer, Colonel? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Colonel, why did Colonel Murasampongo not execute the order which you've issued that morning, prior to 7:30 in the morning, to the effect that the Presidential Guards should be stopped from committing the reprehensible acts? 
A.	I can say that that order was not implemented, and I can say that in the afternoon when 
	General Dallaire called me on the phone and said something which seemed to me to be like an 
	RPF ultimatum to the effect that we if we didn't stop the Presidential Guards' reprehensible acts then the RPF forces would attack us.  

So that -- I can say that that telephone -- was not an ultimatum because the RPF had already launched an attack.  So that was just a pretext to justify the RPF attack which had already occurred that afternoon. 

Now, coming back to your question, I did not have any explanation from Colonel Murasampongo, because after the RPF attack the situation worsened rapidly and I could not ask him for explanation.  Furthermore, I did not have any disciplinary control or authority over him in that I could not punish him. 

However, I knew that he had not carried out the order that I had given him in my capacity as someone who had replaced the minister, and he did not do so, and that was the situation up to when the RPF attacked. 
Q.	Now, Colonel, in the context of the refusal to execute your order on the part of Murasampongo, we saw that Kavaruganda, Nzamurambaho, Ndasingwa Lando, Rucogoza were killed in the morning of the 
	7th of April 1994. 
A.	That is correct.  And the reason is that the politicians you mentioned, as well as Kavaruganda, Frédéric Nzamurambaho, Landouald Rudasingwa (sic) and Rucogoza all lived in the
	Kimihurura neighbourhood where the soldiers of the Presidential Guard had sowed disorder during the period in question. 

So when I say that the operation to -- if that operation to neutralise the Presidential Guard had taken place immediately after 6:30 in the morning, I could say that by 7 am the situation would have been restored.  Calm would have been restored.  

And I can mention Musagora (sic), Rudasingwa (sic), most of them were attacked and killed after 7:30 in the morning.  In other words, if the order had been implemented, then we would have saved the lives of most of them. 

From what I remember -- Kavaruganda's wife testified in my case -- Kavaruganda was attacked between 6:30 and 7.  Maybe for him it was just too early.  But for the others, like Nzamurambaho, attacked after 8:30, according to a witness who testified here, his life could have been saved.  Landouald was also killed at around five minutes to eight, according to testimony in my case.  So we can see clearly that if the army had intervened in the time frame when they received the order to that effect, most of those politicians' lives would have been saved. 
Q.	Colonel, what happened to Colonel Murasampongo, who was the acting chief of staff of the 
	Rwandan armed forces? 
A.	I think you should ask that question to -- you should put that question to the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphone not activated)...that last question.  Has it been established that Murasampongo was the acting chief of staff?  Was that the witness's testimony?  If Mr. Nimy can clarify that point for us it would be helpful.  Thanks. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the witness has just said that it was Colonel Murasampongo who was the acting
	chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces.  In other words, he was the ad-interim chief of staff.  That is why I repeated word for word what the witness had said.  Maybe we can ask the witness to either confirm, or otherwise, his assertion. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, at the time of the events in question, what was the position of Colonel Murasampongo? 
A.	Colonel Murasampongo was the -- the G1 officer, that is, the chief of personnel of the 
	Rwandan armed forces.  He was the most senior officer with the highest rank amongst the officers of the general staff who were present at that time. 

The G2 officer was on mission in Cameroon.  General -- G3, Colonel Kabiligi at that time, was in Egypt on mission.  So on that day -- during that period, Murasampongo was the most senior officer with the highest rank at the army headquarters and according to the rules and regulations of the army at that time, and I think even today, the army's command is never absent; there is never a vacuum in terms of command.  When the substantive leader is not there, there is always someone under him.  So there are criteria followed in the army and in that -- in this case Murasampongo was the most senior and most highly ranked officer at the general staff, that is, the headquarters of the army at that particular time. 
Q.	Colonel, after your explanation I'll put to you my question again:  What happened to Colonel Murasampongo? 
A.	I was saying that you should put that question to the ICTR Prosecutor.  Because when I was in detention I saw on the list of the Prosecution witnesses that Murasampongo was supposed to be called to testify for the Prosecution, but he never came to testify for the Prosecution, but his name was on the Prosecution witnesses' list. 
Q.	Colonel, let's now talk about your meeting -- your meeting with leaders of the MRND party.  You said that there was Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the chairman of the party; Édouard Karemera, the vice-chairman of the party; Joseph Nzirorera, the national secretary of MRND.  And then there was you, as well as General Ndindiliyimana; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Do you know someone called Lieutenant **********************************? 
A.	Yes, I know him.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Mr. President, could the spellings -- could counsel spell the names please. 
BY MR. NIMY:  
Q.	Was he present at the meeting? 
A.	I told you that there were only five of -- there was only five of us.  There was nobody else.  The other four people, that is, apart from me, were there.  Ndindiliyimana was there.  The three others who -- in this trial were there and they can testify to that.  So there were only five of us in my office.  

And if -- I didn't -- that colonel was not there because he had nothing to add to us.  There was -- there were no minutes in that meeting.  I had a message which I wanted to pass on to the 
executive committee of the MRND.  So he was not there.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Mr. President, the interpreters were requesting for spellings, if possible, by -- on the part of counsel.  Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, could you get the witness to assist in spelling the -- 
MR. NIMY:
********************  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes.  The last name.  
MR. NIMY:  
************* is the first name.  I shall try to do that because it's a difficult Rwandan name.  

Could I ask the assistance of colonel to spell this Rwandan name, which, to me, is a real tongue-twister.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.       So, Colonel, could you kindly help us and help the Trial Chamber, please, to that effect. 
A.	I can use the military language.  ************************************************************************* *********************************************************.  In other words, it's ***************************** (sic). 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, for further clarification, I would like to add that he was not a lieutenant, as I mistakenly said.  Actually, he was a major, ****************************************. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, I know you said this, but please be more specific.  Why did you really have to have a meeting with the leadership of MRND? 
A.	I told you that on the previous day when I spoke to Rwabalinda and General Dallaire, we were at Mr. Booh-Booh's place, that is, the representative of the UN Secretary General.  And he gave me a message to transmit to the MRND party and the message consisted of asking them to nominate a candidate who would replace the deceased president.  So I had a message to give them.  So when they got there, that is the message which I gave to them fully. 
Q.	So what was their reaction when you gave them that message? 
A.	Paradoxically, they did not accept Booh-Booh's proposal.  They said that they were not in a position to nominate a replacement for the president, because according to the rules of their party it is the party's congress that has the prerogative of appointing a candidate to the post of president, and that in the circumstances -- under the circumstances at that time they were not in a position to convene a meeting of the party congress, therefore, they did not accept the offer. 
Q.	How can you explain to the Trial Chamber this attitude?  Because you're talking about people who were supposed to -- who were supposed to actually have carried out a constitutional coup d'état.  Well, at least according to the indictment.  But you, as a factual witness, because you were there, how do you interpret this situation? 
A.	This I say:  It was a paradox that they refused.  Furthermore, it is ironic that they refused to take power. And being accused of wanting to seize power through a coup d'état, that is where the paradox lies.  They refused to take power offered to them by the international community.  The special representative of UN Secretary General, Mr. Booh-Booh, said, "You are the people who are supposed to nominate the president and -- so appoint him and then take power."  They refused.  

	So I would like to add that in my -- in the indictment against me it says that I was the most extraordinary authority in the country.  They refused the offer in the message by the UN Secretary Seneral's representative, which to the effect granted them power, but they did not obey that message; they did not take the message.  They were asked -- requested to take power but they refused.  So this means that the theory to the effect that they wanted to launch a coup d'état in order to seize power is not true because they refused to do so, even when the United Nations -- when the United Nations and the army asked them to do that.  Because I took the message to them, which means I was a party to that message, asking them to designate a president.  So they refused.  This means that I did not intend to ask the army to carry out a coup d'état.  I told Booh-Booh that we did not intend to carry out a coup d'état, the soldiers did not want a coup d'état.  And the people who were supposed to take power did not want power.  That was the situation. 
Q.	Colonel, lastly, what was your conclusion -- what conclusion did you and the three MRND leaders come to? 
A.	There was no conclusion.  We parted ways.  I had a meeting.  I was the chief of the delegation -- of the Rwandan army delegation at the residence of the United States ambassador at a meeting at 9 o'clock in the morning.  At around 8:30 I told them, "Look, I am going to the meeting."  So I left them at the ministry of defence and I went to the meeting at the residence of the ambassador of the United States. 
Q.	Colonel, please tell us about the meeting at the ambassador of the United States on the 7th of April.  What time was it? 
A.	It was around 9 o'clock in the morning at his residence in Kacyiru. 
Q.	So how did the meeting proceed?  For example, who was there, who presided over the meeting and what were the recommendations and proposals at the meeting? 
A.	Of course, there was the ambassador, Rawson, of the United States.  General Dallaire was not there.  The special representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Booh-Booh, was not there. 

He talks about this in his book, when he says that General Dallaire had promised to provide him with bodyguards to escort him to the meeting but Dallaire did not do so and that's why he did not attend the meeting.  No other ambassador was present, because they did not have escorts, which Dallaire refused to provide.  I'm saying this based on an account given by Mr. Booh-Booh in his book.  The book is called Dallaire's Boss Speaks Out.  In short, General Dallaire was the one who made that meeting fail. 
MR. NIMY:  
Mr. Issa, do you have D. NZ838?  D. NZ838, which I entered into evidence. 

Could you please give it to the witness. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, please go to page 149, second paragraph.  Can you please read out that part.  
A.	"It was unthinkable" -- 
Q.	Let me remind you, this is an excerpt from Jacques Roger Booh-Booh's book called Dallaire's Boss Speaks Out:  The Shortcomings of a UN General in Rwanda.  Can you please read out that portion, Colonel. 
A.	Yes, I will quote from Booh-Booh's book:  "It's unthinkable for a force commander, General Dallaire, not to mobilise the necessary UNAMIR means in order to see to it people invited to that important meeting could go to the meeting.  It seems to me that he deliberately had that meeting fail so that he could -- so that that meeting's success would not be credited to the UN special representative, who was the effective UN chief of mission there." 
Q.	So this is what you have just told the Trial Chamber; right?  
A.	Yes.  It was General Dallaire who sabotaged that meeting which was very important. 
Q.	Very well, Colonel.  Murasampongo did not execute orders and senior leaders were massacred.  Dallaire sabotaged the meeting by not sending escorts.  So what were the consequences of Mr. Dallaire's acts in respect of the events which followed, according to you?  Because you are a factual witness. 
A.	At that meeting at the residence of the US ambassador, the ambassadors, who were the sponsors of the Arusha Peace Accords, along with the delegation of the Rwandan armed forces.  And I suppose that they were also going to call the stakeholders, that is, those who had -- who were to sign the 
	Arusha Peace Accords to examine the situation and take the necessary measures to ensure the implementation of the Arusha Accords. 

In any case, in order to control a situation that was rather explosive -- and it was obvious that it was so. The situation was not yet explosive, but everybody could see that it could become explosive.  I am saying that this was a meeting of last resort, because at that time the international community should have called the parties in conflict to order and put the responsibilities before them before things became irremediable, because subsequently we are going to see how the war resumed and automatically the Arusha Peace Accords were violated and were the attendant consequences, whereas that morning the positions that could have been taken by those various leaders at the international level and at a national level.  I think the position that could have been taken there would have solved the problems before things went overboard. 
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, let us continue to discuss that day of the 7th of April.  I am talking about the morning of the 7th of April.  And regarding the murder of key figures, who killed the key figures of the opposition, including, in particular, Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, that morning of the 
	7th of April? 
A.	That is a rather broad question which has something to do with the developments that I made in my trial.  I don't think I will have to represent my case in Nzirorera's trial, but I think it is useful and necessary to tell the Trial Chamber how Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, Agathe was killed and who killed her.  There is evidence that point to the murderer and most of the evidence was disclosed by the Prosecution itself. 

The first witness is Alison Des Forges, that is, the expert witness of the Tribunal.  In her book 
Leave None to Tell the Story she describes the murderer of the prime minister and she says that it was a gendarme lieutenant undergoing training as a judicial police officer.  I do not know if she asked whether he was undergoing the training in the ESM or not, but I know that she does say that in her book. 

There is another witness called -- referred to as AE.  In any case, that's how he was referred to in my trial.  He was a ***********************************************************************************************, at the time of the events.  He also -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Pardon me, Colonel Bagosora and Mr. Nimy.  All of this is quite interesting, but I'm concerned about what type of evidence we're eliciting from this witness.  It's one thing to -- for this witness to talk about Alison Des Forges and other witnesses that testified in his trial, but I thought that the purpose of him testifying before us was for him to give us his own personal knowledge of the events.  So I'm certainly not trying to prevent any discussion of Alison Des Forges, but is it really appropriate to elicit this type of testimony?  
MR. NIMY:
I am sorry, Mr. Prosecutor, but we are not receiving the interpretation of what you are saying, that is, the interpretation into French. 

The French channel is not translating what you are saying.  In any case, I am not hearing you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I could begin again. 

I'm concerned about the type of evidence that's being elicited from this witness on this particular subject matter.  If he has direct personal experience or if someone has told him what they observed personally, that's one thing.  But simply to repeat bits and pieces of the evidence that is -- of the narrative that is contained in published books and coming from witnesses in his own trial is really not appropriate.  So I'd ask Mr. Nimy to reformulate his questions so the witness is giving us his evidence and not simply repeating bits and pieces of things that he has read or heard in his trial. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, the witness is giving evidence on specific facts that underpin the indictment.  Not only the indictment against him, but also, to a certain extent, against the Accused here present.  Now the witness is explaining what he knows and that he is also relying on what Prosecution witnesses said of the same facts. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, I think you misunderstood the Prosecutor's enquiry.  What he is interested in is the witness's evidence and he doesn't think it's appropriate for the witness simply to recite what other persons have said in his own trial.  This is not his trial and some of those persons did not testify here before us.  So his record of their testimony in this trial is not really admissible. 
MR. NIMY:
Very well, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:  
Q.	Now, Colonel, can you tell the Trial Chamber what you know of these events or facts on this matter. 
MR. CONSTANT:
May I confer with my client for a moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Mr. Constant, you may.
MR. CONSTANT:  
I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Nimy, you may proceed now. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I'm asking colonel questions concerning the events, those murders, and these are facts.  And I'm asking him to say what he knows of them. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...there was nothing wrong with your question, you know; your question was quite in order.  We just thought that the colonel should be advised, right, that he should rely on his own knowledge and not recite the evidence that was given in his own trial.  It's possible that he may have been so advised by his counsel.  So I think you may proceed. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, before the witness answers the question, I would like to be clarified on something.  Now, does knowledge of the facts by hearsay -- forbidden to be offered before the Trial Chamber?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, hearsay evidence is permitted in his trial; that's quite clear.  But we're not dealing with hearsay here.  He was reciting the evidence that was given in his trial.  That's different to hearsay.  But I think, Mr. -- I think the witness has got the point.  So I think you can simply continue. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Well, Colonel, you heard the question I put to you.  Can you answer it.  
A.	On the very day of the 7th of April 1994, on that same day I did not know how Agathe Uwilingiyimana had been murdered, nor did I know the circumstances in which she was killed.  But as time went by, and with the research that I continued to carry out -- and I'm talking about my personal research -- and relying on documents that I put together, I was able to have an idea as to the person who killed Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  And I wanted to share this with the Trial Chamber, that is, I wanted to share with my Trial Chamber the approach that I used and the conviction that I formed relying on documents that I myself put together on the matter. 

And that is why Des Forges, who was an expert witness, and who still is, even though she has died, from what I have learned -- so what this expert witness of the Prosecution says is that there is -- and there is other testimony that the Prosecution disclosed on this subject. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, actually, I think I should just give Mr. Bagosora some information.  Ms. Des Forges did not testify in this trial, so we have not had the benefit of her evidence.  So she is not a witness before this case. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Des Forges' book, Leave None to Tell the Story, I think that book was admitted into evidence in this trial, and I think that is a document that has been used.  And I -- it is indeed that document, that exhibit, that I myself have used or that I am using to form an opinion.  It is a document that has been admitted into evidence in this trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is accurate. 

Yes, Mr. Constant. 
MR. CONSTANT:  
I would like to point out, including to my client, what his duty as a witness is.  You should say what you know, relying on what you saw.  But then, if one of the parties puts a document to you requesting your opinion on them, you can give your opinion.  But it is not your place to speculate relying on other documents that have not yet been tendered to you. 

My learned friend's question is, "What do you know?", or, "What information did you know concerning the death of the prime minister and other key figures on the 7th of April?"  So you can give your answer now, but as to consulting an exhibit, that is another issue.  But it is not up to you to take the initiative to give observations or comments on exhibits that have not been put before you.  

That is a comment that I was seeking to make, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  I think that's a fair statement of the position. 
MR. NIMY:  
I do share that position as well, Mr. President.  

And I am going to invite Mr. Issa to give to the colonel document 26 of the bundle of documents that we have. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, could you describe document 26, please, Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes.  It is document number 26, Mr. President, Leave None to Tell the Story:  Genocide in Rwanda.  This is a book that was written by Alison Des Forges, and it's on page 224 that I would like to refer to. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, do you have the document before you?  Can you kindly read that passage. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphone not activated)...first of all, the excerpt is available in English.  I made a copy available to Mr. Issa last week and I would assume that he's made the translations available to whoever needs it in English.  So we do have the English text.  And what this text is going to do is tell us who was responsible, which offices were responsible for killing the prime minister, according to 
	Madam Des Forges' research.  

This is a witness who is giving us his direct evidence now.  What should interest us is what he knows or what was told to him back in 1994, or information that he received personally in some manner.  Just to place before him an excerpt from a book and bits and pieces of testimony is not really going to be helpful.  And I -- when I get around to cross-examination, that's another matter.  But I'm not trying to stop this information from coming on the record, it's certainly not hurting the Prosecution case, but I don't see how this is really helping the Trial Chamber in its fact-finding process.  So that's my concern. And if the Chamber finds this useful we'll proceed, but I'm just questioning how -- how this particular way of dealing with witnesses' testimony is going to help us. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, you will understand that I do not quite agree with the Prosecution's position.  I understand that the manner in which I am using this document may be a problem to him because it will reveal that it is not the witness who killed Madam Agathe, and I do understand that.  But what we want is for the witness, who has said that he was not aware, or what we are trying to do is to show a document to him so that from passages that we will read he will be in a position to tell the Trial Chamber what he understands insofar as the facts to which he has come to testify.  

	I'm concerned -- and that is our intention -- and I think that is a concern that Mr. Constant recalled here and with which you agreed.  And I do agree with that approach as well.  So we are the ones who are showing the documents to the witness and the witness makes his observations thereon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, we are interested in hearing the witness's testimony.  The book of Ms. Des Forges is already in evidence for particular purposes, but it does not have the weight of evidence because she has not been a witness in our trial.  

	Now, the witness has said that he has -- he has conducted his own research, and we will hear his conclusions.  But he doesn't need to read Alison Des Forges' book and put it on the record again.  It's already in evidence.  We are going to be reviewing it for the value that -- whatever value it might have. But it certainly does not have the value of testimony, she has not been here as a witness.  So he can give his conclusions based on the research that he has conducted, and that would be evidence before us. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, I agree with you, Mr. President.  But I thought this is what the Prosecution was challenging and didn't want us to do.  But if such is the case -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...objection to Colonel Bagosora's own testimony.  What the objection to was his reciting what other witnesses have said in his trial.  So if he can give his conclusion based on the research that he has conducted, that is evidence, and we will hear that. 
MR. NIMY:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Colonel, you heard the comments made by the Trial Chamber? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you make a comment on your explanations in respect of the death of those key figures from the research that you made to the Trial Chamber, since you, yourself, were not at a spot or on the spot at the time the events occurred.  Am I sufficiently clear?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We don't know if the witness was on the spot or was that the place where the killings took place at all yet; that's the whole point.  If Mr. -- if Colonel Bagosora is going to give us evidence of what he knows, tell us where the information came from and how he came to know it.  And so even the clarification that Mr. Nimy just made is a bit objectionable.  I'm not trying to obstruct the examination or slow things down, but I'm really hoping that somehow we can assist this witness to give us information that would be helpful for our trial. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am sorry, but -- well, I understand the Prosecution, this should be rather disturbing for him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You made a statement you should not have made.  You said:  "Since you, yourself, were not at the spot."  That's giving evidence.  The witness has not said so yet.  That's all the objection, that that is a leading question.  Allow the witness to tell his story, from his own knowledge, that's all the witness has to say, and without reciting the testimony that was given in his own trial.  

Do you understand, Mr. Bagosora?  Do you recall a question was asked you?  We are interested in hearing your testimony about your knowledge on this matter, so please proceed. 
(Pages 13 to 24 by Deirdre O'Mahony)











1230H
THE WITNESS: 
From the research that I conducted subsequently, because I said eventually that I was not supposed to tell how she was killed, but from that time and throughout my trial, I was able to get information and documents that make it possible for me today to say and to assert that Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, Agathe was murdered by second lieutenant -- gendarme Lieutenant Nyaringingira (phonetic), who was undergoing training in the ESM, École supérieure militaire, at the time of the events.  

And I should point out that it was Colonel Rusatira, Léonidas, who was the commander of the École supérieure militaire at the time of the events.  

I got my documentation -- well, for the most part -- from what Prosecution witnesses had to say, and that is why I knew their testimonies by heart.  There is Des Forges, who pointed to that lieutenant.  There is somebody from ESM who was an eyewitness, who indicated that it was a gendarme lieutenant who was undergoing training at ESM who was responsible for the murder.  There is also a bodyguard of the prime minister, who gave the name of the person and who said it was 
Gendarme Second Lieutenant Nyaringingira, who was undergoing training to come out as a 
judicial police officer at the École supérieure militaire.  

And furthermore, during the Military II trial, I read the testimony of another witness who used to be a cadet warrant officer, who was the friend of the person who murdered Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  And in the Military II trial it's also said that it was the gendarme lieutenant who was undergoing training as a judicial police officer in the ESM, École supérieure militaire.  And it was known at the time that the commander of the school was Colonel Rusatira, Léonidas.  

And when I see that the Prosecutor is not very happy to hear me talk about this subject, it is because Colonel Rusatira, in his capacity as commander of that second lieutenant and as the line superior of that murderer -- of the person who murdered the prime minister, I don't know if that is the reason wherefore he was arrested.  But the Prosecutor of the ICTR arrested him some years back, but released him again.  The Prosecutor -- OTP released him without having tried him.  

In addition, Rusatira was also a Prosecution witness in my trial at least.  They didn't bring him to give testimony.  I am not lodging an appeal here, but I am saying that I was convicted simply because Agathe was killed by a soldier.  But I'm saying that that soldier was under the command of 
Colonel Rusatira, that the Prosecution is trying to protect and doesn't even want him to come and give testimony here and explain how his subordinate killed the prime minister, and to tell the Trial Chamber what measures he took against the murderer of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, or to explain what prevented him from taking such measures, because any unit commander had the power to discipline those under them in the same capacity as the president of the republic.  

And that is why I believe that this is a problem, because the command superior of the murderer was Colonel Rusatira, Léonidas that the Prosecutor has spared -- I don't know for what reason so far.  But we can see in the scenario of Dallaire's coup d'état that all officers were very well referred to by Dallaire as the moderate elements of the army and of the gendarmerie.  So these people knew that Uwilingiyimana, on the night of 6th of April -- all those the people who are referred to as -- who are characterised as moderates were not bothered at all by the Prosecution, because those people that they referred to as the moderate elements of the gendarmerie have been characterised as officers that were pro-RPF, the RPF that was supported by the American government.  And I'm going to demonstrate this in a short while, if not tomorrow.  

So they were pro-RPF, and they were supported by the Americans.  And I'm going to demonstrate this.  And that is why these people, just like the RPF soldiers that have not been arrested, whereas, they committed crimes, which -- and the Tribunal is aware of this -- and the same way these so-called moderates are protected today for the same reason, because they were on the same side, because they were the same people that had to hush the plots to stage a coup d'état.  But I can explain this in greater detail subsequently.  
MR. NIMY: 
I don't know what our programme for this morning is, Mr. President, in view of the distractions which we had earlier on.  I don't know if we should take the lunch break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's appropriate to take lunch now.  We'll resume at 2 o'clock.  

Mr. Bagosora, we'll take the lunch break now. 
(Court recessed from 1240H to 1409H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Nimy, before you start, I'd just like to enquire from Ms. Hounkpatin.  

In light of the permission that you have had to proceed in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, and bearing in mind the special circumstances of the witness's testimony and the availability of his counsel, we're proposing that it may be possible to sit a bit longer this afternoon so you can have a real chance of completing his testimony before Thursday, when his counsel has to leave.  

Would you have any objection to that?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, basically, I have no objection.  But I have not been able to meet my client since this morning, so I thought that, by 3:30 this afternoon, I will try to go to the UNDF to visit him and discuss with him about the true circumstances in which he was taken back to UNDF.  

So I do not know how long you intend to extend the session for this afternoon, but I would like to be able to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse this afternoon, at least.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, about how much more time do you think you need to complete your examination-in-chief?
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, if we had started on time this morning, I should have been done by today.  However, what I can say is that by the mid-morning break tomorrow I should be done.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, Mr. Nimy, that's not -- that is not -- you misunderstood me.  We lost over an hour and a half this morning.  And if we sat for an extra hour and a half this afternoon -- Mr. Ngirumpatse is not here.  The reason why we break at 3:30 is just for his personal convenience.  And since he's not in court today, we could sit until 5 o'clock or 5:30 this afternoon, which will give you a chance to complete your examination-in-chief and have a real chance for Mr. Bagosora to complete his testimony before Thursday.  

So -- so if we sat -- if we rose at 3:30 for a 15-minute break and then sat for an extra hour, 
an hour and 15 minutes, would that be enough time for you to wrap up?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, sincerely, and without committing myself, let me say that I will do my level best to move as quickly as I can without botching the task.  That is what I can say.  But it is not a firm commitment.  I might be able to complete this afternoon, but I do not make a firm undertaking in that respect. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, we have no desire or intention to diminish the quality of your examination-in-chief.  There's a question of making appropriate logistical arrangements.  

So -- yes. 
MR. MJUI:  
Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like to clarify one matter -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, not yet, Mr. Issa.  I just want to clarify first.   It has to do with the time of adjournment?  

MR. MJUI:
No.  I want to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It has to do with exhibits?
MR. MJUI:  
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Ms. Hounkpatin, we think if we stopped at 5 o'clock, it will still give you an opportunity to see Mr. Ngirumpatse this afternoon, and, if necessary, we could ask the registry to make 
special arrangements to facilitate such a visit.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, so long as the UNDF staff -- that UNDF is notified that I will arrive at 5 p.m., that should be fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We have just had a brief consultation with the registrar and he's agreed to make all necessary arrangements to facilitate that.  So we will sit until 5 o'clock this afternoon. 

Mr. Nimy, you can proceed now.  

I'm sorry, Mr. Issa.  
MR. MJUI:  
Thank you, Your Honour.  

This morning when Mr. Nimy was continuing to examine the witness, he mentioned documents -- a book by Jacques Booh-Booh, as Exhibit 838, but this document was not tendered as an exhibit.  It's Prosecution Exhibit 432.  

So, to correct the record, I should like to say that this document is not a Defence exhibit.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's already an exhibit as a Prosecution exhibit?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Nimy, is that okay with you?  

MR. NIMY: 
No.  No, Mr. President.  Mr. Issa provided an explanation to us a short while ago in that connection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you accept its accuracy?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes; that is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

And thank you, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good afternoon, Colonel.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Colonel, as far as you know the facts, at what time was Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana killed? 
A.	From information available to me, she was killed at around 11:45 on the 7th of April 1994.  
Q.	Where were you, yourself, at that time?  
A.	I was in a meeting with officers and General Dallaire at the military academy, the ESM.  
Q.	Yes, Colonel.  Let us talk a little bit more about that.  Who convened that meeting at the ESM?  
A.	I have already provided that information, but I will repeat myself.  The meeting of unit commanders was convened by the officers who had remained at the headquarters of the army when I went to see Mr. Booh-Booh with Mr. Dallaire.  

Let me point out that the meeting of unit commanders was held at a decision -- following a decision that was taken unknown to me, by the way, which was a blatant violation of the rules governing the operations of the ministry in the absence of the minister.  
Q.	Colonel, could you be more specific as to who attended the meeting?  
A.	The meeting was attended by officers of the general staff of the Rwandan army and the 
	gendarmerie officers of the cabinet of the ministry of defence; officers who were commanders of operational sectors or camp commanders and unit commanders, as well as the 
	UNAMIR commander, General Dallaire.  
Q.	What was discussed at that meeting?  
A.	The purpose of the meeting was to assess the situation and to share information with a view to determining to -- determining what to do in order to address the prevailing situation.  
Q.	Colonel, was an anticipated military coup d'état discussed? 
A.	Not at all.  I co-chaired that meeting with General Ndindiliyimana, and General Dallaire joined us at around 11 a.m.  I drafted a report of all the discussions we had had the day before and informed them of our meeting with UN Secretary General's representative, Mr. Booh-Booh.  I also told them that -- on behalf of the armed forces which I was representing, I had told them that the armed forces did not have any intention to carry out a coup d'état and that the armed forces supported the Arusha Accords.  I told them also that during that night, the idea had crossed our mind to create a crisis committee with a view to managing the situation, but that the idea had not yet been transformed to reality.  

Then, I went on to narrate to them what Mr. Booh-Booh had told us, namely, that the MRND was expected to designate a candidate to replace the deceased president.  I also told them that Booh-Booh had asked us to send a delegation to meet the ambassador of the United States to discuss the 
Arusha Accords, but I also clarified that such a meeting had not taken place.  

Following my presentation of the situation, there was a discussion involving the participants at that meeting.  They then decided to set up a crisis committee and assign a mission to the crisis committee.  In fact, a two-pronged mission:  On the one hand, to provide security for the country; and on the other hand, to support political leaders in order to fill the power vacuum that had been created.  
Q.	Colonel, at the end of that meeting, was a communiqué released?  
A.	Yes.  Following that meeting we set up a committee of five persons, chaired by Colonel Rusatira and including General Dallaire.  That committee drafted a communiqué. 

I have read Colonel Renzaho's testimony before this Tribunal, and he testified that he was a member of that committee.  He also testified that the communiqué was ready at 2 p.m. in the afternoon, when he handed it over to Colonel Rusatira for final touches.  

He -- there was also another witness who appeared on my behalf.  And what he said was true, namely, that the press release was given to me at about 3 p.m., and that I signed it without any amendment prior to its broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	What was the content of the communiqué?  
A.	The communiqué dealt essentially with three points:  Providing security for the population; a call on political leaders to deal with the power vacuum; and then also the creation of the crisis committee, whose mission was clarified or specified.  
Q.	Colonel, did you refer to anything that the government in power at that time had to do?  
A.	No, not at that level.  At that level the unit commanders who were attending that meeting realised that, indeed, there was a power vacuum in the country.  I had just told them that the MRND had refused to designate a candidate to replace the president.  So the question was:  What do we do?  Now that there is a vacuum, a power vacuum, noticed by the committee members, they, therefore, decided to call on political leaders to ask them to do everything within their power to fill the power vacuum that had been created. 

So, at that time, they did not know what the political parties were going to do.  There were no instructions to set up any kind of government.  So the decision that was taken was to call on 
political leaders to make the necessary decisions and provide the necessary support in the discharge of that noble task.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, please, would you kindly place before the witness document number 19 --
	document number 19 in my bundle of documents.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, do you have that document?  It is the second communiqué of the Rwandan armed forces of the 7th of April 1994, following the meeting of the FAR officers at the ESM.  Do you have that document?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Could you read out the communiqué of the Rwandan armed forces to the Court?  It is not long; simply five points.  
A.	"Communiqué of the Rwandan armed forces:  Following the untimely death of the heads of state of Rwanda and Burundi and their retinue, the high command of the armed forces held a meeting this day, 7th of April 1994, at the École supérieure militaire, to review the situation in terms of security around the country in general and, in particular, security in Kigali préfecture.  It also considered the various measures to be taken to ensure a quick return to public security and a resumption of normal activities within the institutions of the country.  

"All members of the armed forces were shocked by the tragic event and hereby express their condolences to the families of the two heads of state and to the other bereaved families.  

"After an overview of the situation prevailing across the country, and in Kigali town in particular, participants at the meeting took the following decisions and made the following recommendations:  One, do everything possible in collaboration with the other involved services to ensure that the situation in the country returns to normalcy quickly.  In that connection, the members of the armed forces are called upon to promptly do their level best and exercise restraint and discipline in order to reassure the population and restore calm in the country.  

"Two, create conducive conditions for the leadership of the country to work in a congenial atmosphere.  For these reasons, on behalf of the Rwandan armed forces, the participants urge political leaders to be more fully involved in the discharge of their duties, particularly in these times of crisis.  

"It is within that context that the government in place is called upon to discharge its duties.  Similarly, the political authorities and institutions are also called upon to accelerate the implementation of the transitional arrangements under the Arusha Accords.  

"Participants at the meeting, that is, point number three, set up a crisis committee whose duty was to closely monitor the security situation in the country and to provide support to political leaders.  Therefore, the political leaders are, therefore, called upon to maximise this contribution in order to" -- 

I do not see the rest of that sentence.  It's illegible.

Yes, this is not legible, indeed.  But I think what is written is to get the country out of the crisis.  

"Four, the high command of the Rwandan armed forces called on the population to remain calm and to abstain away from any incitement to hatred and all manner of violence.  The population, and the youth, in particular, should abstain from engaging in any acts of vandalism; otherwise, they will be exposing themselves to severe repression.  

"Following the problems that were raised, participants at the meeting called on the préfet to review the security situations in their various préfectures and consider setting up curfews as the case may be.  They further encouraged the population to show courage in supporting -- or, rather, that they provide support to the population in the face of these challenges that we are facing, as the expectation is 
for -- can't return."  

The communiqué is signed and dated.  
Q.	When was this communiqué read over radio, Colonel?  
A.	Well, I do not know, but I have already told you that I saw it at about 3 p.m. and I signed it at about that time, 3 p.m. in the afternoon.  
Q.	When was this communiqué drafted?  
A.	It was drafted immediately -- well, between 12 and 2 p.m., that is, immediately after the meeting of 
	unit commanders.  A committee was set up to draft the communiqué, and that was done between 
	2 -- 12 noon and 2 p.m.  

I have already told you that one witness for Renzaho, who was a member for that committee, has testified already that the last draft of that communiqué was handed over at 2 p.m.  
Q.	Colonel, when the communiqué was being drafted, were you aware that 
	Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana had died? 
A.	Personally, I was not aware, because, you see, General Dallaire was involved in drafting this communiqué.  He did not tell me anything.  Colonel Rusatira chaired that committee.  I did not see him.  He simply handed over the communiqué to an officer of the ministry who was in charge of information, who then brought it to me for signature.  So I did not know, because those who were supposed to inform me, if they had known, did not inform me.  

So what I think -- and this is only my opinion -- is that, by the time they were drafting this communiqué, they were not aware of that information, because if they had been, they would not have been calling on the government in place to function normally had they known.  
Q.	Very well, Colonel.
MR. NIMY: 
I think this document is already an exhibit.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Well, Colonel, this communiqué, is it related in any way to massacres, planned killings or genocide? 
A.	When you read this communiqué, you can see that it calls on the people to be calm; it calls on the people to respect the implementation of the Arusha Accords; it calls on the soldiers to do everything possible to provide security to the population and to the country; and it also calls on the -- the commanders who drafted this communiqué asked the crisis committee to provide necessary support to political leaders so that the political leaders can fill in the political vacuum, particularly within the context of the Arusha Peace Accords. 

This is clear here.  I do not see anything here which is related to massacres or killings.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, just for our assistance in future review, are you able to identify the exhibit number of the document at this time?  If you can't, we will find it.  But it will help us if you have it at your fingertips.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I could -- perhaps I can assist.  It's D. NZ at 018, D. NZ18.  And we also have it in English translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  It is, indeed, D. NZ018. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I thank you.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, why did the situation deteriorate to such an extent that there were massacres and killings?  How could you explain this to the Trial Chamber?  
A.	I think that there are three basic reasons:  Firstly, there was a meeting of the last -- a last-ditch effort meeting, which was supposed to take place at the residence of the United States ambassador.  But it did not take place because the participants, invited guests and ambassadors, who were concerned with the Arusha Accords, did not have security escorts to take them to the meeting, to attend the meeting.  

Secondly, there was a resumption of hostilities.  The RPF resumed the war in the afternoon.  The general offensive had already started on the previous day in the north.  But in the afternoon, in 
Kigali city itself, the RPF troops left the CND encampment at around two or three in the afternoon, and the war started.  

This is a very important event if you are to understand what happened later, that is, the resumption of hostilities by the RPF forces on the 7th, in the afternoon.  

Thirdly, there was also the passivity of the UNAMIR forces.  On the previous day, we had requested General Dallaire to intervene with the RPF in order to prevent the RPF from leaving the 
CND encampment, and Dallaire had accepted that.  However, RPF troops went out of the CND encampment while UNAMIR just stood by looking.  They did not try to interpose themselves; they did not try to prevent them from going out; they did not tell them to go back to their camp.  So the war started and the excesses also started.  
Q.	Colonel, now, let's look at your timetable on the afternoon of the 7th of April 1994 and in the night of the 7th to the 8th of April 1994.  What did you do in the afternoon of the 7th of April 1994?  
A.	From two to three in the afternoon, I was at the ministry of defence, together with General Dallaire and General Ndindiliyimana.  At around three in the afternoon, I signed the communiqué which you have just seen.  And since I had just heard that the RPF had attacked the Presidential Guard camp, and since I was living in that neighborhood, I took the decision of taking my family to Camp Kanombe.  However, before leaving, I made sure that I instructed the officer on duty at the ministry of defence to, once again, contact the MRND executive committee so that we could have a meeting on the following day at the ministry of defence at around nine in the morning.  

So after that I went with my family to Kanombe, with the intention of returning.  However, when I tried to return, the road had been cut off by fighting.  After that I sent my condolences to the president's family, because they were near the camp.  I spent the night at the house of an officer at Kanombe camp, and the following day -- or, rather -- yes, the following day, that is, the 8th, I found a way to the meeting of the crisis committee.

1445H
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So what happened at that meeting of the crisis committee on the 8th? 
A.	What interests me in particular is the fact I was given the mandate by the crisis committee to go and contact the leaders of political parties as part of the mission that the committee had been entrusted with by the unit commanders.  So I requested the political leaders how we could fill in the institutional vacuum as well as how we could provide the necessary logistical support so that they could work in a safe environment.

And immediately after that, I left.  After I carried out my duty, I left.  And at 9 o'clock in the morning, I was at the ministry of defence where members of the MRND executive committee were present.  And here I'm referring to Mathieu Ngirumpatse, chairman of MRND; his vice-president, Édouard Karemera; and the national secretary of the party, Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  They were there.

And immediately after that, I gave them the message from the unit commanders.  I repeated to them the mission that the crisis committee had received from the unit commanders, in other words, to assist politicians to fill in the power vacuum.

And after exchanging some information, I gave them a meeting room, a conference room.  And since other -- since in the previous day I had not given instructions regarding the invitation of other political parties, I had only invited the MRND executive committee whom I had met earlier so that I could update them about the situation.

But the crisis committee had entrusted me with the task of contacting all politicians on the 8th.  So by that time I met only the executive committee of the MRND, and I gave instructions to the duty officer of the ministry of defence to get into contact with the leaders of other political parties and to see to it that they have the necessary means that would actually bring them to the ministry of defence to a meeting.

Those who could be contacted came to the meeting.  And at around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the PSD representative had not yet arrived.  The duty officer said that they could not contact them because -- him because they did not know where he lived.

So I had to personally go and look for him because I knew someone called Hyacinthe, Rafiki, who was the directeur de cabinet of the ministry of works and energy who was a member of that party, PSD.  So I went to see him so that he could assist us in finding the leaders of that party.

Rafiki here since enabled us to get into contact with the leaders of that party.  And they arrived there shortly after 2 p.m., and they were able to take part towards the end of the meeting involving other political parties. 
Q.	Colonel, in as far as possible, could you please spell Rafiki.
A.	Rafiki is written R-A-F-I-K-I. 
Q.	Thank you.  Colonel, apart from that, were you not asked to control or to keep in check units of the Presidential Guard?
A.	Well, that must have been on the previous day, that is, the 7th and not on the 8th.  On the 7th at around 3 p.m., General Dallaire called me, telephoned me.  And next to my office there was a telephone.  
	I don't know how he managed to contact RPF, but he called me -- actually, we had landlines.

And what he did was he connected me to RPF.  I don't know how.  And he passed me on to them, and they told me that, "You should have your troops withdraw", the troops who were killing people in Kimihurura and other neighbourhoods.

So at around 3 p.m. we acted.  This is when I started thinking why was this order which I gave in the morning not implemented?  Why were the soldiers still wreaking havoc in Kimihurura?  But that call was not an ultimatum as such because Dallaire -- as he himself said, the RPF left its encampment at CND at 2:10 in the afternoon.  And in his testimony -- and shortly after that I received a call, but Dallaire says that the call was made at 3:30 p.m.  But that was not an ultimatum because the RPF forces had left their encampment an hour earlier.

And in spite of everything, I called the Presidential Guard, and even on the phone I could hear gunshots.  So that was the end of my message, because there was already war because they told me, "Look.  We've been attacked by the RPF forces."  So I didn't have anything to say. 
Q.	Let's come back to the 8th of April when you said that you had representatives of political parties who came to the meeting.  How was the interim government set up?  Who established the interim government, Colonel?
A.	I have just said -- first there was the MRND executive committee members who came first, as I've already said.  And then you had other leaders of other political parties who came in response to an invitation and to whom I provided the necessary security escorts so that they could come to the meeting.

And you had the leaders of PSD whom I personally went to look for and who attended the meeting towards the end of the meeting.  So they were the people or parties who agreed on the formation of the interim government because I did not attend their meeting.  I did not participate in their discussions or the choice of the president or the choice of a prime minister or discussions concerning the appointment of ministers.  I was not in the conference room.
So it were the politicians themselves who reached an agreement and who set up an interim government. 
Q.	Colonel, is it true that the government was -- the formation of the government was submitted to the crisis committee? 
A.	Yes.  They submitted to the crisis committee the fact that the government had been formed.  You have to understand the following things in order to understand that.  You have to take into account the following things:  You have the representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Booh-Booh, who asked MRND to appoint someone who would replace President Habyarimana, and then you had MRND which did not want to do that.  They said that they were not in a position to appoint or nominate a presidential candidate.

And then you had the meeting of unit commanders which came later.  I informed the unit commanders about the situation, and they took note of the power vacuum.  So they decided to call on the politicians to assume their responsibility in order to fill in the power vacuum.

And that meeting also decided to support by all necessary logistic means the politicians so that the politicians could fill in the power vacuum.  That was the decision of the unit commanders' meeting.  And while the unit commanders were making their decision, they were not aware at that time of the fact that the opposition politicians were being -- were being assassinated.  They were not aware that the prime minister was in danger, other politicians were being killed.  They did not know that at that time.

Secondly and very importantly, they did not know that -- they did not know that RPF was going to resume hostilities.  In the afternoon the RPF resumed hostilities.  That was on the 7th.  Another element is that I, prior to the 8th, prior to the 8th at eight in the morning, I did not know that I would be given the mandate to contact politicians.  I thought that that task would fall on someone else.

So before being given that mandate, no one knew how the government was going to be formed.  Even after being entrusted with that task, I did not know how the politicians were going to meet and what solution they would agree on in order to fill in the power vacuum.

The reason why the government formation was presented to the crisis committee in the evening of the 8th is because the crisis committee was contacted by the unit commanders and the crisis committee had to make sure that its mission had been accomplished before being phased out.  

The crisis committee, which I referred to, including General Ndindiliyimana, who contacted the supérieure militaire to see to it that their mission that had been received from the unit 
commanders' meeting would be accomplished and come to the necessary conclusion.  
And the reason why the politicians submitted the results of their deliberations to the crisis committee was to actually make sure that the crisis committee had fulfilled its mission.  I think that was the reason.   
Q.	According to you, Colonel, how can you explain that "war", if I can use that word -- and especially I would like to know whether there was actually a squabbling between you and Ndindiliyimana regarding who should be the chairman of the crisis committee.  Was there such a thing? 
A.	No, there was no such thing. 
Q.	So what happened?  What actually happened? 
A.	The crisis committee was set up -- was appointed by unit commanders, and they appointed members of that crisis committee.  The most senior officer in the committee would be the chairman.  There was no election.  That is how the military was run.  I read Ndindiliyimana's testimony to the effect that he explained how the meeting occurred and he provided a list of members of the committee, and he said that I closed the meeting.

But I would like to point out that during the same testimony or regarding the same testimony, in the afternoon when they were leaving my office at around 3 p.m., they went to the army's general staff.  They convened the first meeting of the crisis committee which took place on the evening of the 7th.  I did not attend that meeting because, firstly, I did not receive an invitation, maybe because they could not contact me.  Secondly, because I was in Kanombe and not being able to return to Kigali.

So what I want to say is that the chairman of the crisis committee -- the issue of the chairmanship of the crisis committee was never raised.  What happened on the following day, that is, on the 8th -- on the 8th at around eight in the morning, some members of the crisis committee asked whether Bagosora as a retired officer had the right to be a member -- to be a part of the crisis committee.

The issue was not discussed, but it was duly noted.  Because in his testimony, General Ndindiliyimana mentions it.  He mentions that that issue was raised.  So members of the crisis committee -- some members at least of the crisis committee did not want to see me be a member of the crisis committee. 
Q.	Colonel, can you tell us specifically what your exact role was in the constitution of the 
	interim government.  What role did you play specifically? 
A.	My role -- well, I contacted leaders of the political parties beginning with the executive committee of the MRND.  I provided escort for these leaders to the venue of the meeting.  I provided the facilities, the meeting halls.  I provided security for the various facilities.  And when they came to the end of their deliberations, I provided escort for them to the ESM where the crisis committee was waiting for them.  That is what I did.  That is all what I did in the midst of all that. 
Q.	Colonel, it has also been said that the interim government was illegal; that it was a government of criminals, and that, particularly, it did not have any pro-RPF members within the government.

What is your understanding or your take on this point?
A.	Let me start by addressing the last point you made.  How could one expect the RPF to have been part of the interim government which was set up in the evening of the 8th?  The RPF had breached the Arusha Accords by resuming the war from the 5th of April, from the time of the attack from the north which ended up in Kigali on the 7th in the afternoon.

How could it then have been possible for me, who had been dispatched by the crisis committee, to contact the political leaders?  How could it have been possible for me to invite the RPF to join the political parties in forming the government; whereas, the Arusha Accords had already been breached the day before?

The government in place had a three-pronged mission:  Namely, provide security for the country, renegotiate with the RPF for the implementation of the Arusha Accords that had been breached, and then fight against famine.

Therefore, the purpose of setting up the government was also to negotiate with the RPF to ensure that the Arusha Accords were implemented.  Therefore -- I think I've lost my line of thought.  What was the question again?  
Q.	I can help you.  The question was -- 
A.	Oh, okay.  Now -- I now know what I was trying to say.  Now, what I was saying was that there was an argument to the effect that the government was illegitimate.  Well, the legal counsel for the UN, whose name I forget, sent a cable on the 27th of April 1994 I believe in which he stated that the government was illegitimate and how could it then be contacted to solve the problems of the country.

And as I have just stated, political parties which were part of the interim government simply amended the protocol agreement of April 1992 regarding the formation of a government.  They simply amended that protocol by using the same procedure that was set up -- was used to set up the Nsengiyaremye and the Uwilingiyimana governments.  So what they did was simply to amend the procedure in line with efforts to seek to implement the Arusha Accords. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, do you have D. NZ425?

An exhibit in evidence already, Mr. President, D. NZ425.  
THE WITNESS:
Ralph Zacklin is the legal counsel I was thinking about, the UN legal counsel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, do you have that document before you?  Do you read English?
A.	With a lot of difficulty.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"No comment in English," said counsel.  
MR. NIMY:
Maybe my assistant can read out an excerpt of that document.  That document reflects the position of Mr. Zacklin.  

Mr. Issa, please.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA:
I'm reading from the middle of that page, L0001889, from the United Nations documents written by Zacklin, director and deputy to the Under-Secretary General of the office of the legal counsel:  "Although the Arusha agreement, by its terms, had come into effect upon signature and President Habyarimana was subsequently sworn in as president, the transitional assembly and the other organs of the transitional government were never established.  Therefore, the government of Rwanda, which ceased to exist shortly after the death of the president on 6 April 1994, was not the transitional government.  

"Consequently, the Arusha Agreement, including its succession provisions, are not applicable to the succession issue.  That question would, therefore, be governed by the constitutional law of Rwanda.  Moreover, the factual situation inside Rwanda has yet to stabilise with the de facto authority apparently being exercised by several competitors for power.

"The interim government seems, nevertheless, to be operating, at least in some parts of Rwanda, as the de facto authority.  As such it can, in our opinion, legally be contacted and dealt with by the United Nations in the same manner as other potential contributors to the peace process in Rwanda."   
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, you have listened to the reading of Mr. Zacklin's document and his position on behalf of the United Nations.  Is that what you want to convey to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	That is correct.  I thank you. 
Q.	Now, Colonel, I would like to ask you -- at least ask you a question.  After all the explanations you have provided to the Court, how is it that Bagosora is portrayed as the choirmaster, the mastermind behind everything?  Can you explain that to the Trial Chamber?  
MR. CONSTANT:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I would rather not have my client answer that question because it calls for speculation.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, learned colleague.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would like to interject something.  I do appreciate Mr. Constant's assistance for us in hearing the testimony of Colonel Bagosora.  But my understanding is that his role is simply to indicate to his client whether he thinks he should answer the question or not and, finally the decision remains with Mr. Bagosora.

So that's my understanding of the procedure.  Although I appreciated his contributions this morning, that's not my understanding of how he should assist us.  He should simply indicate that the question may not be in Mr. Bagosora's best interests to answer, and then Mr. Bagosora can make the decision whether he wants to go ahead or not.

So if the Court can kindly comment on my intervention so that we know how we should proceed with the rest of this witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not necessary.  We don't see anything inconsistent with what has happened this morning.  In any event, I got the impression from Mr. Nimy's response that he was about to withdraw the question.

You can proceed, Mr. Nimy.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, are you uncomfortable with the question that I put to you, particularly in respect of your own trial which is still ongoing?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, do you persist with putting the question?  
MR. NIMY: 
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then let's move on.  Let's move on.  
MR. NIMY: 
Well, Mr. President, I'm not insisting.  I simply wanted to get the opinion of the witness himself as to whether the question is relevant or not.  But if he agrees with his counsel, then I'll move on to something else.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Bagosora, let us move to another line of questioning, and this will relate to your activities from April to July 1994.  

MR. NIMY: 
However, Mr. President, it would seem that as I look at the clock, which seems to bear the same time as my watch, I wonder whether this would be a good moment to take the break, and I could resume after the break with the next question without having to break up my line of questioning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Nimy.  We agree with you on something.  We will take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1525H)

(Court resumed at 1552H) 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, it seems that the witness is nowhere to be seen. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, is this the case of the disappeared witness?  
MR. NIMY:
It's only an ordinary notice, but not a judicial notice, Your Honour. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  He's reappeared.  

Thank you.  You may continue. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, I was talking about your activities from April through July 1994.  From the 9th of April up to July 1994, what did you do? 
A.	After the formation of the interim government, the minister of defence, Mr. Augustin Bizimana, was once again appointed minister of defence in the interim government.  I remained the directeur de cabinet at the ministry of defence up to July 1994. 
Q.	Colonel, did you remain -- in other words, were you in Rwanda up to July 1994? 
A.	No.  From the 23rd of May up to the 22nd of June 1994, I was on mission -- on an official mission outside Rwanda. 
Q.	In your capacity as the directeur de cabinet of the ministry of defence, what were your activities from April to July 1994? 
A.	I discharged my usual duties, that is, as a directeur de cabinet, and my duties were known.  When the minister is present, he's the one who issue -- who issues instructions as to what is to be done, and I was working for him. 
Q.	Please tell the Trial Chamber, according to you, why did the Rwandan armed forces lose the war? 
A.	There are several reasons to that.  However, the principal reason which I would underscore is that the RPF had a strong ally.  And here I'm referring to the government of the United States of America. 

The US government from -- when the war resumed in April 1994, the US government aligned itself with the RPF and supported the RPF in order to see to it that the RPF would win the war.  

And I'm not the only person saying that because Des Forges in her book, Leave None to Tell the Story, she says that as early as end of January -- as early as the end of January, the American government was aware of the fact that should war resume in Rwanda, there would be three scenarios.  

The worst-case scenario would be the death of 500,000 people as a direct consequence of the war.  So when after -- after the resumption of hostilities figured by the RPF in the night of 6th to the 7th of April the -- in the evening of the 7th, the American government decided that the mandate of UNAMIR should not move from chapter 6 to chapter 7.  It should not move forwards in other words.  So at that point the American government started to envisage actually removing the mandate of UNAMIR.  And here I'm referring to the evening of the 7th of April.  

On the 12th -- on the 12th of April 1994, the RPF issued an ultimatum to Belgian and French troops who had come to help their nationals in Rwanda by giving them 60 hours to leave Rwanda.  And failure to do so would mean that those Belgian and French troops would be considered to be enemies.  

So the language of RPF, they are an American government language look-alike in that RPF did not want to have interposition troops between the two belligerents.  The American government wanted to remove UNAMIR; in other words, elimin -- remove forces which should have intervened and interpose themselves between the belligerents.

So on the 15th of April 1994 the American government decided that UNAMIR troops should withdraw from Rwanda, purely and simply.  That was done on the 15th -- that was decided on the 15th of April.

On the 21st of April 1994 the United States government, with other countries, actually reduced 
UNAMIR troops significantly -- reduced UNAMIR troops significantly, because that's what the 
United States government wanted.  

And that's not all.  With resolution 912 of the Security Council, UNAMIR's presence in Rwanda was reduced.  And it became useless in that they could not interpose themselves between the RPF forces and the governmental forces since the US thought that the RPF would win the war rapidly at a time when the UN Security General and some African countries, such as Nigeria, at the 
end of April and beginning of May were saying that they should strengthen UNAMIR forces so that UNAMIR forces could interpose themselves between the belligerents and stop the massacres.  

And this was said by Des Forges.  What I'm saying was supported by Des Forges.  

At that time the American government prevented its representative to use the word "genocide".  And the reason for doing that is that if the word "genocide" was used then such use would justify strengthening UNAMIR forces in Rwanda from over 200 people to a more significant force which could have intervened and prevented the massacres.  

But with resolution of 918 of the 17th of April 1994, the US government actually opposed the 
signing -- the passing and signing of that resolution at the UN.  But in the end they agreed to sign that resolution only when it was agreed that they should include a clause regarding an embargo on weapons examination in respect of Rwanda, in other words, an embargo against 
Rwanda's government forces.  

So resolution 918 has a clause on embargo, and subject to the inclusion of the embargo clause the 
US government signed in the end the resolution.  

However, once again -- Des Forges once again here, like another writer Jacques Castonguay, who was a director of the Canadian university, they all agreed that the American government, subsequent to resolution 918 of the Security Council, added another clause to the effect that UNAMIR II forces could not be deployed before the American government -- before the American government received a report on what was happening on the ground in Rwanda, and that was in May.  So -- and what was happening on the ground was there was war, and one side was losing.

The American government, therefore, did not allow UNAMIR II forces to be deployed before the victory of the RPF.  The first detachments of the UNAMIR team, I think, arrived in Rwanda on the 18th of July, and they were Canadians.  They came there on the 18th of July, in other words, two days from the victory of the RPF, whereas initial -- you had all these 5,000 UNAMIR soldiers coming there after the victory -- the UNAMIR victory.  

This is my understanding, and I'm actually summarising what Des Forges wrote in a book:  
Leave None to Tell the Story.  And then Castonguay, whom I referred to, also wrote in his book called:  The UN Peacemakers in Rwanda.  They said that the American Government prevented 
UNAMIR II forces to intervene prior to the RPF winning the war.

In conclusion -- and it's not my conclusion, it's Human Rights Watch's conclusion that I'm taking, and this is what Des Forges wrote.  There was an interview with their -- an American official in Washington.  And the American official spelt to Human Rights Watch the position of the American government in relation to the war between RPF and the Rwandan government.  

And that position can be summarised as follows:  The American official said that, "We do not have a choice between choosing a government of genocide perpetrators and RPF, because it's impossible for us to support a government of genocide perpetrators, and therefore it's unthinkable for us not to support RPF.  So if we don't support RPF, then the genocide government, who didn't win the war -- and that's totally unacceptable."  So they had to support the RPF so that RPF should win.  
So what this shows is that even if there were other reasons which made us lose the war, in terms of our organisation, in terms of our political leaders, as well as in terms of various differences and plots and betrayals, by people such as Rusatira, the traitor, as I mentioned earlier.  

So you can imagine that RPF was being supported by the United States, the biggest power in this world.  The Rwandan armed forces -- what could the Rwandan armed forces have done to win the war?  

So we lost the war because we did not have allies.  Our ally was France.  France saw what happened.  They -- France sent its troops for Operation Turquoise.  And they noticed or realised that the ground, as to speak, was already occupied.  So the French forces left.  They left by the back door.

And now they're starting to go back to Rwanda also through the back door with President Sarkozy currently.  So if we -- if the US government had decided to either support us or not to be involved -- even the American official I mentioned said that if they'd not supported the RPF, we'd not have lost the war. That is why we lost the war.  And there is documentation to that effect, such as in Des Forges' book:  Leave None to Tell the Story, as well as in the book written by Jacques Castonguay entitled:  
The UN Peacekeepers in Rwanda. 
Q.	I thank you, Colonel, for your lengthy explanation.

Now, Colonel, I want to put some very specific questions to you now.  A witness appearing before this Tribunal testified about distribution of firearms at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 12th of April 1994.  Such weapons were distributed to the Interahamwe of the MRND according to that witness.  They said a witness also testified that you allegedly participated in that distribution exercise.  What is your reaction to that? 
A.	I did not participate in that distribution of firearms, and I'm not aware of that meeting. 
Q.	Very well.  Another witness, AJY, also testified before this Trial Chamber that after the 6th of April 1994, without providing any further details as to the date, the witness alleged that you were with 
	Joseph Nzirorera at a house in Kigali. 
A.	That is totally incorrect. 
Q.	Did you ever meet Nzirorera after the 6th of April in any house whatsoever in Kigali, Colonel?  
A.	No, not at all. 
Q.	Very well.  Another witness, XPM, testified before this Trial Chamber on a ceremony which is said to have been organised in May/June 1994 at the MRND palace in Gisenyi with a view to raising funds for the war.  Did you attend that ceremony, Colonel? 
A.	I did not attend that ceremony, but if I were aware of the dates maybe I would be able to provide an alibi because between the 21st of May and the 22nd of June 1994 I was not in Rwanda. 
Q.	Did you hear mention of any such ceremony that may have been organised at the 
	Gisenyi MRND palace to raise funds for the war? 
A.	Never.  I never heard mention of such ceremony. 
Q.	The same witness testified before this Trial Chamber and asserted that an MRND meeting purportedly took place at the Umuganda stadium in 1993, which you allegedly attended.  What is your reaction to that, Colonel? 
A.	I did not attend that rally or meeting, but allow me to provide some details.  Now, in 1993 I retired on the 23rd of September, and prior to that date I was an active soldier.  And in that capacity I was not authorised to participate in any public political activities.

Then after the 23rd of September I was free to do so.  But in order to attend a rally organised by any party one had to be interested in such a rally.  

So I could not attend MRND rallies for the following reasons:  First of all, I had just been retired because I had reached the retirement age.  However, if I had been retired within the context of the demobilisation of the armed force, I would have received some allowances.  

The Arusha Accord of the 4th of August had divided the armed forces into two categories:  Those who would remain within the army and those who would be demobilised.  And those who were to be demobilised were entitled to an allowance.  

The minister of defence, Mr. Bizimana, Augustin, of the MRND party asking the Uwilingiyimana government to retire me, whereas I could have been allowed to be demobilised so that I -- I obtain the attendant allowances.  So I was deprived of those allowances.  In which case, I went on retirement on the 23rd of September.  I was not recruited by the MRND party.  And I was replaced by 
Munyampundu, Cyprien, who replaced me as director of cabinet under the circumstances at the time.

Clearly the Arusha Accords provided that the political parties will share power.  And at that time I did not belong to any political party.  So they were entitled not to give me any position.  But if they had needed my services, they would have made the necessary arrangements to maintain me in office.  That is why my position is that the parties did not want my services.  The ministry of defence had deprived me of my allowances.  And, therefore, I had no interest whatsoever in participating in any political party rally. 
Q.	Now, Colonel, can you spell Munyampundu. 
A.	Munyampundu is spelt M-U-N-Y-M-P-U-N-D-O (sic).  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  Perhaps I had misheard or I didn't quite follow.  Did the witness say that he was no longer director of cabinet after he retired?  Or if Mr. Nimy wouldn't mind going over that portion of his testimony again because I didn't quite follow. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, you heard the question and the concern of the Prosecutor? 
A.	Well, I can answer.  I can answer.  
Q.	Please do.  
A.	The Arusha Accords of 4 August 1994 -- rather, 1993, those accords called for implementation within 35 days following the signature thereof.  

On the 23rd of September when I was retired, the due date for the implementation of the 
Arusha Accords had already elapsed, and that should have been on the 10th of September adding up to 35 -- 35 days.  

Now, when Munyampundu, Cyprien, who was appointed by the party to replace me -- could only have taken that position if the transitional institutions were in place.

So from the time he was appointed in September, there was an expectation that the institutions will be set up the very next day.  And the very next day I had to keep waiting to be replaced.  And I was in that position from September to the 10th of April.  I was not replaced.  And I remained in that position as directeur de cabinet, although I had been resigned, so to speak, but not replaced.  And I was in that position till the events of the 6th of April happened upon me, whereas I was supposed to have been out of that office.  

So I don't know if you -- if I have answered your question. 
Q.	Very well, Colonel.

Colonel, did you attend one or several meetings of the CDR political party in Rwanda? 
A.	Never.  Never. 
Q.	The same witness testifying before this Trial Chamber again said the following:  That the meeting took place at the Hôtel Méridien in June 1994 at which you allegedly congratulated the perpetrators of the killings that had taken place in Nyundo. 
A.	Never did I do any such thing, and never did I ever attend any such meeting. 
Q.	Colonel, do you know Camp Butotori?  
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	A witness has testified to this Trial Chamber that you attended a meeting with civilians in that camp; is that true? 
A.	I never attended such a meeting. 
Q.	Did you hear mention of such a meeting having taken place in that camp? 
A.	Never.  However, let me add that during my trial one witness talked about it.  And it is from that witness that I learned about that meeting.  Apart from that testimony from one witness, I think it was 
	Witness ZF -- it was from that witness, ZF, that I learned about such a meeting. 
Q.	Colonel, the friends of the alliance or les Amis de l'alliance, the Dragons, the Abokozi, the 
	Zero Network; do those names ring a bell? 
A.	Not at all, not at all, except that during my trial, and in a similar manner, a witness talked about these things. 
Q.	A witness has asserted before this Trial Chamber that on the 6th or 7th of April 1994 you had a telephone conversation with Anatole Nsengiyumva; what is your reaction to that? 
A.	That did not take place.  And the Trial Chamber which handled my case decided that such a thing never happened, and the false testimony of that witness was simply set aside. 
(Pages 43 to 49 by Melissa Hook)



























1630H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Colonel, are you in a position to explain to this Trial Chamber the goals and objectives of the civil defence programme in Rwanda prior to and after the assassination of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Well, I -- I cannot answer that question because that is a question you should be putting to members of government.  But I never was part of any study or any analysis of that -- that area.  
Q.	Very well.  Now, if you are aware of this, can you tell the Trial Chamber how the authorities proceeded to stop the killings from the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Well, that is a matter for the government.  I was never part of the government.  I was in Kigali while the government had sought refuge in Gitarama.  Later on, I went abroad from the 22nd of May to the 
23rd of June.  Then I came back to Gisenyi where the government was already seeking refuge.  
But if I were to say anything about what the government considered doing in order to stop the killings, it will amount to speculation.  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, have you ever been a member of a joint criminal enterprise, including one designed to exterminate Tutsis in Rwanda? 
A.	Never.  I have never been a member of any criminal enterprise whatsoever.  
Q.	Colonel, can you tell the Court something about the purported military training of Interahamwes in Rwanda.  
A.	No, I cannot.  I was not aware of that.  
Q.	Can you talk about efforts made to evacuate refugees from the Hôtel des Mille Collines during the tragic events of 1994? 
A.	No.  I was not aware of that evacuation exercise.  
Q.	Colonel, do you know that after 1990, there came a time when the Rwandan armed forces had to define the enemy?  Do you have anything to say about that to the Court? 
A.	Yes.  A commission was set up in -- in 1991, I believe.  December of 1991, I believe, and I was the chair of that commission.  The mandate of the commission was to study -- and this happened during the 
war -- was to look into ways and means of winning or defeating the enemy.  So we needed to analyse the situation, identify our strengths and weaknesses, as well as identify the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy, and I was the chair of that commission.  
Q.	Very well.  Colonel, did you go on mission to South Africa and to the Seychelles? 
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	Do you want to tell the Court when.  
A.	I do not have the dates upfront, but I think I left Kinshasa on the 3rd or 4th of June for Johannesburg.  On the 4th of June, I went to the Seychelles where I spent some time up till the 19th of June, I believe -- 19th of June.  Then I returned to Kinshasa and then to Rwanda on the 22nd.  
Q.	What was the purpose of that mission? 
A.	The -- the acquisition of weapons and ammunition for the Rwandan armed forces.  
Q.	Did you get those -- did you get those weapons and ammunition? 
A.	Yes, to a certain extent because I was found out by the CIA in the Seychelles; I was almost arrested there.  I managed, however, to return to my country with part of the ammunition.  The rest of the ammunition remained there where they are up till now.  
Q.	Colonel, with regard to weapons and Nzirorera, there is a witness who claimed before this Trial Chamber that on the 12th of April 1994, weapons were distributed to Interahamwes at the house or residence of the president at Kiyovu.  And, according to the same witness, it was Nzirorera who facilitated the distribution of those weapons by asking them to contact you.  What do you have to tell this Trial Chamber in that regard, Colonel? 
A.	First and foremost, on the 12th of April, I did not meet Mr. Nzirorera.  Secondly, on the 12th of April -- I think I had a similar testimony in my case -- on the 12th of April when the witness claimed that I was in Kigali, I had a witness who testified on me -- on -- on behalf -- on my behalf who said that I was in Gitarama where I spent the night and returned to Kigali only the following day -- on the following day.  

I brought here my driver who said that he had driven -- when -- when asked whether he drove them to the president's residence to get weapons, he said no.  But the -- the Prosecutor had called that witness, but since his testimony did not interest them and support their cause, we -- we -- he testified on my behalf.  

He told the truth about what actually happened.  He was -- he -- he was an honest young man.  He said that he was not aware of Interahamwes going to Kiyovu to get weapons.  He was not aware of that.  
For -- as far as I'm concerned, I was never aware of such a thing.  
Q.	Thank you, Colonel.  

Colonel, I have no further questions for you.  I thank you for being available to testify.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have completed my examination-in-chief, and I would like to thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Do any -- yes, Mr. Sow, do you have any questions to put to the witness? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, you can be sure that I have no questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Ms. Hounkpatin?  Do you wish to put any question to the witness? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Colonel Bagosora, you've completed your examination-in-chief, but now you have respond to the Prosecutor to cross-examine you.  

Mr. Webster, are you ready to start? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, no, Your Honour.  I'm -- I'm certainly psychologically ready and rearing to go, but I didn't anticipate Mr. Nimy completing 20 minutes before scheduled, and I have documents to distribute and my outline to get which I've left in my office.  So I'm sorry to inconvenience the Court and the parties, but I don't have the materials I need to go forward now.  

I thought that we would be starting tomorrow.  In fact, when Mr. Nimy ended earlier this morning, I got the impression that his examination may even be extending into tomorrow morning.  So I apologise, but it will take me, at least, 10 or 15 minutes to get those materials, and we're already at 20 to five.  

So if the Court would allow me to start tomorrow morning, I'd appreciate that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Webster, we expect that if -- when your examination is finished -- cross-examination is finished -- as there are no other witnesses here for -- for the Defence of Nzirorera, so we imagine that his cross-examination would continue at the completion of this testimony. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I'm ready to proceed.  I mean, it's -- it's not a question of trying to back off.  I simply don't have the materials that I need to rely on with me in the courtroom. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  I asked you -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- a different question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I went on to something new. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't understand you.  I thought you were suggesting that Nzirorera -- that Nzirorera --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm saying -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that at the conclusion of Colonel Bagosora's testimony, because it appears that they have no other witnesses  -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
	Oh, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- for the Nzirorera Defence, that his cross-examination would continue at that time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's my understanding, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I would expect it would be completed by midday on Thursday.  
MR. WEBSTER:
With -- with Mr. Nzirorera or with -- with -- with -- with Colonel Bagosora? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I understood that Colonel Bagosora's cross-examination will be completed tomorrow or thereabouts. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You gave roughly the same kind of indication that Mr. Nimy gave -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and the Nzirorera Defence.  So it's not a binding order, but -- but I understand that's the schedule that you're working towards, isn't it?
MR. WEBSTER:
That's my understanding as well.  I would like to finish my cross-examination of both Mr. Bagosora and Mr. Nzirorera by the end of this week or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is going to end at midday on Thursday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I will try to work within those parameters, but, of course, you know, we all understand that it depends on how the -- the rhythm that we move.  But clearly, it would be in everyone's interest for us to finish both witnesses by the end of this week, which the Court has just clarified will be at midday on Thursday.  
So we'll work towards that, but if we go beyond that, I hope the Court will understand that we've made -- we're making best efforts in that regard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, so the Court will have to understand that you're...
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm hoping that, with the cooperation of Colonel Bagosora and Mr. Nzirorera, my best efforts and their best efforts will be just to finish both examinations by midday on Thursday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Fine.  On that note, we'll take our adjournment now.  

Colonel Bagosora, we -- although we had planned to sit until 5 o'clock, we -- Mr. Nimy's efficient examination of you has left us with a few extra minutes this afternoon.  So we -- we'll take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1643H)
