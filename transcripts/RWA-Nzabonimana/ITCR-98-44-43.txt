         2            MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

         3         Interpreter, could you please tell Witness RHU 25 that 

         4        the Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn declaration 

         5         he made yesterday, and that he will continue with his 

         6         evidence today on that same solemn declaration.  Yes.  

         7                                    

         8                 Yes, Counsel, could you continue your 

         9        examination-in-chief?  I think we were in closed session 

        10        when we adjourned yesterday.  Do you intend to continue? 

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct, Your Honour.  We'll go into 

        12                              open session.

        13                      MR. PRESIDENT: Continue?

        14          PROFESSOR HINDS: No, we'll go into open session.

        15    MR. PRESIDENT: Into open session, okay.  Advise the witness 

        16        that we are now getting -- we are back to open session.  

        17         He should be careful not to mention names which have a 

        18                        bearing on his identity.

        19                       THE WITNESS: Agreed. 

        20

        22                        BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.                         Good morning.

        24   A.                 Good morning to you, Counsel.

        25   Q.      Witness, as we begin your testimony at this point, 

        26          please try not to mention names of places where you 

        27          worked and so on.  Sir, I draw your attention to the 

        28        time that you first heard of the president's death.  Can 

        29         you tell this Trial Chamber when did you first hear of 

        30                       the death of the president?

         1   A.   I first heard the news about the president's death early 

         2        in the morning of the 7th of April 1994, at dawn, and I 

         3        heard it from a colleague, a working colleague who came 

         4           and gave me the news he had heard himself over the 

         5                                 radio.

         6   Q.     And could you tell the Trial Chamber the name of the 

         7                colleague, and you can mention his name?

         8   A.     That workmate in question -- colleague, was ****

         9              *******************************************

        10         ************************************************.

        11   Q.    And could you tell the Trial Chamber what you did, if 

        12            anything, after you got the news*****************?

        13   A.     As soon as he told me the news, I thought it wasn't 

        14        possible.  I hurriedly went to listen to the radio and I 

        15        saw that, indeed, the news he had given me was true.  It 

        16                 was being talked about over the radio.

        17   Q.      Do you recall, sir, whether or not there were any 

        18         specific instructions given to the population over the 

        19            radio that morning when you listened to the news?

        20   A.    There was a communique broadcast several times on the 

        21          radio, and that communique asked everyone to stay at 

        22              home; no one should leave his place of abode.

        23   Q.    Now, sir, could you tell the Trial Chamber what shift 

        24        you were working on?  What were the hours that you were 

        25         working on at the time that you heard the news of the 

        26                           president's death?

        27   A.    I had stated that when he came to give me the news, it 

        28         was 5:00 in the morning.  I stayed at my place of work 

        29        until 8 a.m. which is when other people were supposed to 

        30                          come and relieve me.

         1   Q.   What time did you start work that particular day or that 

         2                     shift, when did you begin work?

         3   A.    I had started my shift in the evening at 6 p.m. on the 

         4           6th of April and I spent the night there as I was 

         5                supposed to until the following morning.

         6   Q.    Now, did your replacement ever arrive that morning to 

         7                              replace you?

         8   A.     The staff of that institution did not come to work.  

         9            Only the whites who had jobs there came to work.

        10   Q.      Now, what job function were you performing on that 

        11              particular day?  What was your job function?

        12   A.      When the president died,*************.  It was 

        13                 therefore the week that I was on duty.

        14   Q.   Did there come a time when someone came to inform you on 

        15                        what you should do next?

        16   A.     At 8:00 -- no one had come to work at 8 a.m., that's 

        17          when a white man arrived and explained to us that we 

        18        should go home because we had already been on duty that 

        19          night, and since there had been a communique asking 

        20        everyone, the population not to leave home, he asked us 

        21          to go home and told us that they would go on working 

        22        until the centre was closed, even if it meant reopening 

        23                   once peace had been re-established.

        24   Q.   Witness, I'd like you to repeat what you have just said 

        25         and let me -- just wait for me to ask you the question 

        26         again.  Did you say that a white man came to instruct 

        27                            you that morning?

        28   A.     I told you before that that white told us to go home 

        29         because we had already been on duty all night.  So, we 

        30        couldn't work the day also.  It would be too tiring.  He

         1           also told us that he would do all he could at the 

         2        clinic, and that if the situation did not improve, they 

         3              would close until peace was re-established. 

         4   Q.          Was it a white man or was it a white woman.

         5     MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, I object to my learned friend 

         6        cross-examining his own witness now.  He got one answer, 

         7        he stood up and cross-examined him on that answer.  Now, 

         8        he is cross-examining him a second time and I object to 

         9                                  that.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is not cross-examination, 

        11        because my interpreter told me that there was a mistake 

        12         in the initial interpretation where the witness said a 

        13         white woman, it was translated as a white man.  So, I 

        14                   just wanted to make sure of what --

        15     MR. PRESIDENT: In the original -- in the first answer, he 

        16                         said it was white man. 

        17         PROFESSOR HINDS: That is what -- that's what we --

        18    MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And in the second answer, he has also 

        19                       said a white man, I think.

        20     MR. FLEMING: Yes, and continued on to say "he" used "he", 

        21                        thereafter, Your Honours.

        22     MR. PRESIDENT: At least from the translation that came in 

        23                         English.  I don't know.

        24    PROFESSOR HINDS: Again, I am listening to the English and I 

        25          am hearing the same thing.  And I'm hearing that the 

        26         Kinyarwandan -- what the translation was, white woman, 

        27                                 but --

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: No, the interpreter has the answer.  If he has 

        29                    the answer, he can read it back.

        30              MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

         1    THE WITNESS: I had answered in saying that this white came 

         2        and asked us to go home because we had already spent the 

         3        night on duty and it would be too tiring for us to also 

         4        work in the day.  He said that he would do all he could 

         5        at the clinic, and if the situation did not improve, he 

         6         would close the clinic until peace was re-established.

         7                        BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Witness, what was the profession of the person who came 

         9                      to give you that information?

        10   A.    That person was ****************************and was 

        11          therefore an employer, and was also in charge of the 

        12         convent, the sisters.  She was also one of those nuns, 

        13                          one of those sisters.

        14   Q.   Now, Witness, when you were given instructions, were you 

        15                   alone or were you with anyone else?

        16   A.   When that person gave us those instructions, I was with 

        17        *****************************************************

        18          ************************.  As for me, I had also 

        19                        spend the night there.  

        20    THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: The witness said what he was doing 

        21        there, but I am not saying it.  The interpreter said so.

        22    PROFESSOR HINDS: Is it for security reasons, Interpreter?  

        23         THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: I do think so, yes. 

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, maybe we should go into closed 

        25                 session so that we can find out what --

        26    MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, it's important to know what the witness 

        27             has said.  We'll go in closed session for that 

        28        particular purpose only and hope it won't take long.  We 

        29           regret members of the public.  And please, advise 

        30           Witness RHU 25 that we are -- we are going back to

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: And, Interpreter, could you advise the witness 

         2        accordingly that we are back to open session.

         3   THE WITNESS: Agreed.

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, after that occurred, what, if anything, did you 

         6        do?

         7   A.   After that we had the opportunity to leave work.  I took 

         8        a path to go home, the path towards my home, but I was 

         9        with *******.

        10   Q.   Now, the path that you took to go to your house, was 

        11        that the same path that ******* had to take to go to 

        12        his home?  Did both of you need to travel in the same 

        13        direction?

        14   A.   There is a way from the parish that leads to another 

        15        road that goes to my place.  And from that intersection, 

        16        that cross-road, there is a path going to ********s 

        17        home.

        18   Q.   Now, while you were travelling, did you hear anything on 

        19        your way?

        20   A.   We could hear from there firing everywhere, all around, 

        21        and we couldn't go quickly down the path we were on, 

        22        because we didn't know what the situation was in the 

        23        direction we were heading.

        24   Q.   Sir, did you hear any other sounds other than what you 

        25        described as firing when you were heading home from the 

        26        place that you mentioned that particular morning?

        27   A.   Within a few hundred metres from our place of work, we 

        28        met people fleeing from Rwankeri and we asked them what 

        29        the firing was that we heard.  And they said that people 

        30        had attacked Tutsi and were killing them at Rwankeri.

         1        We were four when we heard that news about the firing 

         2        and after ten minutes, we heard two shots very near us.

         3   Q.   Sir, I'd like you to make your answer short and let me 

         4        ask follow-up questions.  Could you tell us the names of 

         5        the individuals who were present during that 

         6        conversation you just spoke about, who was there?

         7   A.   Can I mention these names safely without any problems?

         8   Q.   Yes, you can.

         9   A.   I was at the time of the conversation in company of 

        10        ****, who came from Rwankeri, where they 

        11        were killing the Tutsi; *** was also there, who was 

        12        a refugee from Kinigi, but who lived at Busogo parish at 

        13        that time.  There was also a person whose Christian name 

        14        is **** who was a teacher at the ISTB, and there was 

        15        me and Gateyiteyi.  **** is spelt 

        16        **************************************************  

        17        **************************************************.

        18   Q.   Did you at that time, besides those people you've 

        19        mentioned, did you see anyone else on the road at that 

        20        time?  Could you describe what you saw?

        21   A.   We did not see anything, and because we were afraid 

        22        because of the firing which we could hear and which had 

        23        surprised us, we left the parish fearing that someone 

        24        else would surprise us on the path, intending us harm.

        25   Q.   Before leaving the path, did you see people in the area?

        26   A.   No one else was there, because that morning people were 

        27        not going aboard, were not moving around.

        28   Q.   Now, did there come a time, sir, when you left the path?  

        29        Can you tell the Court what you did and was it just you 

        30        alone or with someone else?

         1   A.   When we left that place, Gateyiteyi and I went towards 

         2        the forest -- a wood, and we wanted to see which 

         3        direction the person we just heard shooting was going 

         4        in.  ***** started to go back to school, the ISTB 

         5        where he was teaching.  And that's when ****

         6        ****`, I don't know which direction they took, they 

         7        ran off, but I don't know what direction they took.  And 

         8        when we were in that wood, Gateyiteyi and me -- and I, 

         9        we could see people -- Tutsi that were going to the 

        10        convent.

        11   Q.   Now, how long did you and Gateyiteyi stay in that place 

        12        which you called the woods?

        13   A.   Gateyiteyi and I stayed at least ten minutes and then 

        14        Gateyiteyi wanted to go to see his house, if it was open 

        15        or if it was closed, rather, so that he would then go to 

        16        the convent.

        17   Q.   And what happened after that, sir?

        18   A.   After Gateyiteyi left the wood -- at the time he left 

        19        the wood, he was spotted by someone called Ndayambaje 

        20        who shot at Gateyiteyi.  I will spell Ndayambaje, 

        21        N-D-A-Y-A-M-B-A-J-E, Ndayambaje, N-D-A-Y-A-M-B-A-J-E.

        22   Q.   Did you see Ndayambaje actually shoot Gateyiteyi?

        23   A.   Yes, I saw him shoot at Gateyiteyi.

        24   Q.   And do you know whether or not he hit Gateyiteyi with 

        25        the bullet from his gun?

        26   A.   Yes, Gateyiteyi was hit by the bullets, because after 

        27        that Ndayambaje had shot at him, Gateyiteyi fell.

        28   Q.   And could you describe for the Trial Chamber where you 

        29        saw Gateyiteyi fall?  And did he get up after that?

        30   A.   Gateyiteyi fell next to the peasant -- the house of the

         1        peasants who were Gateyiteyi's neighbours.  As to 

         2        whether he could get up again, I don't know because I 

         3        myself made a U-turn at that point.

         4   Q.   Do you know whether Gateyiteyi was killed?

         5   A.   I can't assert whether he was killed or not on the spot, 

         6        because I couldn't check for myself.  By then I was 

         7        afraid also.

         8   Q.   How far were you from Gateyiteyi when you saw him being 

         9        shot?

        10   A.   There was about 50 metres -- there was 50 metres between 

        11        him and me when he was shot at.

        12   Q.   And what was the name of the person's home that you said 

        13        he fell close to?

        14   A.   Can I safely say the name?

        15   Q.   Yes, you can.

        16   A.   His name was Elias Ruziga.  I will spell Ruziga, 

        17        R-U-Z-I-G-A, Ruziga, R-U-Z-I-G-A, Elias.

        18   Q.   Do you know, sir, how far from Gateyiteyi's home or what 

        19        was the distance between Gateyiteyi's home and where you 

        20        saw him being shot and him falling?

        21   A.   I will try and estimate it.  I think it was at least 20 

        22        metres.

        23   Q.   What did you do next when you saw Gateyiteyi being shot 

        24        and falling?

        25   A.   I made an about turn and I wanted to take the path to 

        26        the clinic, to then take another path to my place.  A 

        27        bit further, I met a sister, a nun, and she asked me to 

        28        come with her to give biscuits to the children there, 

        29        distribute biscuits.  I informed the sister, the nun, of 

        30        Gateyiteyi's death and she said that she would telephone

         2        were displaced persons who had sought refuge there.

         6        that we go into closed session.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, we'll go into closed session to 

         8        enable counsel to raise questions with the witness, some 

         9        of which could have a bearing to his identity.  We

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: We will be taking a break at eleven, so you 

         3        can organise your work.

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, do you have Picture 53 in front of you? 

         6             

         7        Witness, as you testified at some point in time, 

         8        soldiers and other individuals came to the place where 

         9        you and Georgette were standing.  Was there any 

        10        conversation between the soldiers, or any of those 

        11        people and either you or Georgette?

        12   A.   The soldier known as Rachel spoke with Sister Georgette.

        13   Q.   Could you overhear what he said to Sister Georgette?

        14   A.   Yes.  I followed what was said by Sister Georgette and 

        15        Rachelle because they were speaking in Kinyarwanda.

        16   Q.   And can you hear that -- with the Court -- what did you 

        17        hear them say to each other?

        18   A.   Rachelle was asking the sister to ask the people, who 

        19        had hidden in the convent, to come out, for fear that if 

        20        these persons were to be found within the convent the 

        21        convent might be destroyed.

        22   Q.   And what was the response of Sister Georgette?

        23   A.   For Georgette, it was out of the question to bring these 

        24        people out, because she knew that these people had been 

        25        targeted by the killers.

        26   Q.   And do you know who were the people who were in the 

        27        building?

        28   A.   Do you want to know the number of these people? 

        29   Q.   No.  I want to know the ethnicity, if you know?

        30   A.   It was Tutsis who were at the convent.

         1        building?

         2   A.   In about a period of three minutes, Sister Lennie Roger 

         3        (ph) came out of the convent when she realized that 

         4        people had gathered and were about to attack, and she 

         5        had come to find out what was going on.

         6   Q.   Was there any conversation between Sister Lennie and 

         7        those people who were there?

         8   A.   Sister Georgette spoke to Sister Lennie, telling her, 

         9        and this was in French, that these people that she was 

        10        seeing had come in order to kill people who had sought 

        11        refuge in the convent.  Furthermore, Georgette had 

        12        telephoned the commune to ask for help in order to 

        13        protect the refugees, and the commune had refused to 

        14        provide the assistance which she had sought.

        15   Q.   Now, did you see Sister Lennie exit or come out of the 

        16        building and if so, how did she exit the building?  How 

        17        did she come out?

        18   A.   When Sister Lennie came out of the convent, she looked 

        19        surprised when she saw this group of people in front of 

        20        the convent.

        21   Q.   Did you see her come out of the convent, and if so, how 

        22        did she come out of the convent?

        23   A.   Yes, I saw Sister Lennie come out of the convent.  She 

        24        opened the door, and when she realized that there was a 

        25        large group of people in front of the convent she closed 

        26        door again and locked it, and she came towards us.

        27   Q.   Now, the door that you said that she came out of, is it 

        28        the door that is shown on --

        29   MR. FLEMING: I object to my learned friend leading, Your 

        30        Honours.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: This is the only way, Your Honour, that we 

         2        can deal with the photograph.  I don't have to do it, 

         3        but... Your Honour, you want to rule on that?  We have 

         4        the photographs in front of us here.  He described the 

         5        door.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: He can describe the door, point out the door 

         7        that you are making reference to.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Can you, Witness, point out the door or describe the 

        10        door -- where is the door located?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: He has a photograph in front of him, we all 

        12        do.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: That is Photograph No. 53.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Fifty-three.  And just for record, I wanted 

        15        him to locate the door.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  He can describe it, if he has the 

        17        photograph in front of him.

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   Can you describe the door, Witness, with respect to the 

        20        windows seen on Photograph No. 53; in other words, is it 

        21        between the first and second window, or the third and 

        22        fourth from the left?

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Or simply, which door on that building?  Can 

        24        you point it out?

        25   THE WITNESS:  Sister Lennie came out of the door, which you 

        26        can see between the window, which is on the laundry 

        27        room, and the one of the bathroom which was used for 

        28        showers.

        29   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        30   Q.   Now, sir, did you at that time see Juvénal Kajelijeli

         1        there in this area?

         2   A.   I never saw it.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: "I never saw it"?  That is what came into the 

         4        English translation.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, just so we are clear that he understood my 

         7        question.  Witness, did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli at 

         8        that time, or any time that morning?

         9   A.   No. I didn't see Juvénal Kajelijeli at all in that 

        10        location throughout the day.

        11   Q.   Do you know the type of vehicle that Juvénal Kajelijeli 

        12        drives, or drove at that time in April of 1994?

        13   A.   Kajelijeli was driving a Hilux vehicle, which was red.  

        14        On it was written "ISTB."

        15   Q.   Did you see that vehicle any time that morning?

        16   A.   No, I didn't see the vehicle.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: This would be a good place for us to stop, 

        18        Your Honour. 

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  So we take a break for 15 minutes, and 

        20        resume our work at 25 past, past 11.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour. 

        22             

        23        (Court recessed from 1110H to 1130H)

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  Learned Counsel, 

        25        Professor Hinds.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Witness, you recall telling the Trial Chamber that after 

        29        you saw Gateyiteyi shot and ran back to the convent, you 

        30        told Sister Georgette that Gateyiteyi had been killed.

         1        Do you recall saying that?

         2   A.   Yes, I do remember.

         3   Q.   Now why did you tell her that you thought that 

         4        Gateyiteyi had been killed?

         5   A.   I couldn't conceal from Georgette that Gateyiteyi had 

         6        been killed, because Gateyiteyi was a member of the 

         7        staff, was an employee of the convent.

         8   Q.   Now, Witness, you told us that Sister Lennie exited the 

         9        building and had a conversation with Sister Georgette.  

        10        Is that correct?

        11   A.   Yes, that's what I said.

        12   Q.   Were you able to follow the conversation between Sister 

        13        Georgette and Sister Lennie?  You said they spoke in 

        14        French.  Could you follow that conversation?

        15   A.   Yes, I followed the conversation.

        16   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber what was the nature 

        17        of that conversation?

        18   A.   Georgette, Sister Georgette, informed Sister Lennie that 

        19        the reason why the people had come to the convent was to 

        20        kill the Tutsi that had sought refuge there.

        21   Q.   And did you hear what the response of Sister Lennie was?  

        22        What did she say, if anything?

        23   A.   Lennie, Sister Lennie, very angry, spoke to the crowd in 

        24        Kinyarwanda, telling them, "Go away.  I know that you 

        25        hate the Tutsi." 

        26   Q.   And was there any response from the crowd who had 

        27        gathered?

        28   A.   Someone in the crowd slapped Sister Lennie, she fell, 

        29        and part of the group immediately stormed inside the 

        30        convent after having opened the gates, the doors, and

         1        immediately started shooting.

         2   Q.   Now, could you estimate the number of people who were 

         3        involved in this attack, both civilians and soldiers?

         4   A.   There were many people, maybe a thousand.

         5   Q.   What, if anything, did you do after you saw these 

         6        individuals attacking the convent?

         7   A.   As I could see the situation was very dangerous, I 

         8        thought immediately about saving myself, and I fled.

         9   Q.   And in what direction did you flee?

        10   A.   On photo 53, you see a tree.  I fled towards that tree, 

        11        to pass between the convent and where the priests were 

        12        in the direction of the ISTB school.

        13   Q.   Now, the tree that you are describing, is that the tree 

        14        that is shown in the right-hand corner of Picture 53?

        15   A.   Yes.

        16   Q.   Now, do you know what happened to Sister Georgette and 

        17        Sister Lennie?

        18   A.   Those nuns immediately ran away towards where the 

        19        priests were.

        20   Q.   And before you ran away, were you able to observe what 

        21        the crowd of individuals and soldiers were doing with 

        22        respect to the convent?

        23   A.   I noticed that the people who had entered the convent 

        24        had begun to kill people and to loot the convent.

        25   Q.   How did you know that there was looting taking place?  

        26        What did you see?  What did you observe?

        27   A.   In as much as I fled, I couldn't see immediately what 

        28        was going on inside the convent, but the next day, on 

        29        the 8th of April, I came back to the convent.  I saw 

        30        that it was empty.  All the doors had been broken, there

         1        was nothing left inside the convent but bodies, corpses 

         2        lying on the ground.

         3   Q.   Before going to these, let us stay a bit on the 7th.  

         4        After you ran away, where did you go to?  That is on the 

         5        7th; where did you go to?

         6   A.   I fled towards my home, and my home is in Rwankeri.

         7   Q.   Witness, did you arrive at home?

         8   A.   I got home, but -- indeed, but I didn't stay there, 

         9        because there was no one in the houses roundabout there.

        10   Q.   Could you observe whether or not any of the houses were 

        11        destroyed?

        12   A.   At my place, some houses had been put fire to, and some 

        13        people had been killed, because there were Tutsi living 

        14        in our neighbourhood and they already had been killed 

        15        before I arrived.

        16   Q.   Now, Witness, remember we are in open session, and so 

        17        you should be careful about naming individuals or places 

        18        that might reveal your identity. 

        19             

        20        Were your family at home at your house?  Did you see 

        21        your family there when you arrived?

        22   A.   Because of the massacres that had taken place there, 

        23        even the members of my family, even my family had taken 

        24        fright and had fled to the mountains.

        25   Q.   And what did you do, then, when you found those 

        26        conditions that you have described in your community?  

        27        What did you do?

        28   A.   Given that I was still afraid myself, I decided to flee 

        29        towards the mountains, because I was afraid that the 

        30        Inkotanyi, who were at Muhingo, might come to our place

         1        to avenge the people that had just been killed, and I 

         2        was afraid that the Inkotanyi, when they arrived, would 

         3        kill me.

         4   Q.   Now, what reason did you have to believe that the 

         5        Inkotanyi were in Muhingo?

         6   THE INTERPRETER: Could you please repeat the question.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   What reasons did you have to believe that the Inkotanyi 

         9        were in Muhingo?

        10   A.   Not "Mukingo"; "Muhingo", M-U-H-I-N-G-O.

        11   THE INTERPRETER: And the interpreter apologizes if he 

        12        mispronounced.  Muhingo.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Could you put the question to the witness, please, with 

        15        respect to Muhingo?

        16   A.   The reason why I thought the Inkotanyi were in Muhingo 

        17        was because the Inkotanyi had been skirmishing with the 

        18        government soldiers often in that place.

        19   Q.   And can you tell us what commune Muhingo is located in?

        20   A.   Muhingo is in Mukingo commune, but at the edge of the 

        21        Kinigi (ph) commune, not far from the Volcano National 

        22        Park.

        23   Q.   Now, did there come a time, sir, when you returned back 

        24        to your home after the events that you have described?

        25   A.   On the 7th, I spent the night in the hills.  I spent the 

        26        night of the 7th in the hills.

        27   Q.   And did there come a time when you returned home on the 

        28        8th?

        29   A.   On the 8th, I returned home.  I arrived home at ten.

        30   THE INTERPRETER: 10 a.m., I suppose.

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   And when you arrived home -- withdrawn.

         3             

         4        Was that in the morning, or in the evening, when you say 

         5        you arrived home at ten?

         6   A.   I arrived home on the 8th at 10 a.m., ten in the 

         7        forenoon.

         8   Q.   And when you arrived home, sir, did you find your family 

         9        there, or were they still away?

        10   A.   On my arrival, my family had only been there a few 

        11        moments.  They had come back from where they had spent 

        12        the night.

        13   Q.   And, sir, could you tell us what occurred after you got 

        14        home?

        15   A.   Five minutes after I arrived back home I received a 

        16        message, a messenger told me that the sisters, the nuns 

        17        wanted to see me.

        18   Q.   And did you respond to that message, and if so, what did 

        19        you do, if anything?

        20   A.   I answer that message, I responded to that message.  I 

        21        went to see the sisters, the nuns where they had taken 

        22        refuge at the -- where the priests were, sounds like it 

        23        was a monastery.

        24   Q.   And was the place where the nuns were, had taken refuge, 

        25        was that shown on any of the photographs that we looked 

        26        at earlier today?

        27   A.   On the photos we saw, you can't see that place, because 

        28        the church masks the fathers' convent.

        29   Q.   So is the fathers' convent in back of the church, which 

        30        was shown on Photograph 51?  Is that correct?

         1   A.   Yes.

         2   Q.   Now, as a result of the conversation you had, without 

         3        telling us what it is, with the sisters, what did you 

         4        do?

         5   A.   I don't know whether Learned Counsel would let me say 

         6        everything that happened after my conversation with the 

         7        sisters, because it could be a long story.

         8   Q.   Now don't -- just tell us what you did first, and then I 

         9        will ask you follow-up questions.  So just tell us, as a 

        10        result of the conversation you had, what did you do 

        11        immediately?

        12   A.   In point of fact, the sisters wanted to see me to get 

        13        their travel documents so that they could go back to 

        14        Europe, because they were afraid to go back to the 

        15        convent alone.

        16   Q.   Did there come a time when you went to the convent to 

        17        obtain those documents, and could you tell the Trial 

        18        Chamber what observations you made, if any?

        19   A.   I responded to the sisters' request, even though I was 

        20        afraid myself.  I got other people to come with me, and 

        21        we went to the convent and we saw that it was impossible 

        22        to see anything, because everywhere there was blood, 

        23        there were corpses.  The sisters' cells, rooms, had been 

        24        broken into, and there was complete chaos, everything 

        25        had been ransacked, we couldn't find anything because in 

        26        the courtyard there were corpses in the sisters' cells, 

        27        in the sisters' rooms there were also corpses.

        28   Q.   When you say in the courtyard there were corpses, do any 

        29        of the photographs that we have seen depict the 

        30        courtyard?

         1   A.   Photo No. 54 shows that courtyard.

         2   Q.   And was it within that courtyard you saw corpses?  Is 

         3        that correct?

         4   A.   Yes, in that courtyard I saw the bodies, but also in the 

         5        sisters' cells, the sisters' rooms there were also 

         6        corpses, bodies.

         7   Q.   Now, sir, did there come a time when you were instructed 

         8        by the sisters to perform any other task?

         9   A.   It was necessary that I should report back to the 

        10        sisters as to what I had seen, and after I had reported 

        11        to them they asked me to go and see the stables where 

        12        the livestock was, and come and tell them whether the 

        13        livestock was there, still there, so that the sisters, 

        14        the nuns could give instructions as to how the livestock 

        15        should be shared out among the staff.

        16   Q.   Now, sir, did you perform that particular instruction, 

        17        and can you tell the Court what you, in fact, did and 

        18        saw?

        19   A.   I went to look at the stable where the livestock was, 

        20        and I realised that the stable had not been damaged, and 

        21        the livestock was there.  Further, in our stable I found 

        22        three persons who were hiding.  There was a woman and 

        23        two boys.

        24   Q.   Do you know the name of this woman who you say you saw 

        25        hiding in that place?

        26   A.   Yes, I know the name of the woman.  I am not sure if I 

        27        should mention her name.

        28   Q.   Yes, mention her name.

        29        

        30        Now, where did you see that particular --

         1   A.   This woman is called Beatrice Ntacyonanze.  I spell 

         2        "Ntacyonanze:" N-T-A-C-Y-O-N-A-N-Z-E.

         3   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber -- describe to the 

         4        Trial Chamber the place where you saw this person, and 

         5        two children?

         6   A.   I stated a while ago that, this building was located 

         7        behind the nutritional centre and that in that building 

         8        there were two walls that had been built.  And that the 

         9        space between the two walls was for -- was meant for 

        10        turkey that they were rearing, which normally they would 

        11        lay their eggs there, and that the people who came to 

        12        hide removed the wooden boards that were there and hid 

        13        themselves under them.

        14   Q.   Now, do you know, sir, what, if anything, occurred with 

        15        respect to Beatrice and her two children?

        16   A.   When I realised that the livestock was there, and that I 

        17        saw people, I went to report on what I had seen, and 

        18        Sister Lennie took this woman and her children with her, 

        19        since this woman was a health assistant in the clinic.

        20   Q.   Do you know whether or not -- withdrawn.

        21             

        22        Did there come a time when the sisters left the parish?

        23   A.   At one point in time these reverend sisters left.

        24   Q.   Do you know the day or date when they left?

        25   A.   They left on the 8th, around 14 hours.

        26   Q.   And do you know whether or not Beatrice and her children 

        27        were taken with them on the 8th?

        28   A.   Yes.  These reverend sisters took with them these 

        29        people.

        30   Q.   And do you know where they were taken to?

         1   A.   These reverend sisters took them to Rwoza (ph) and the 

         2        sisters themselves went to Rwoza.  Sister Lennie 

         3        intended to take them to Europe, but I don't know what 

         4        happened subsequently.

         5   Q.   Do you know, sir, whether or not those bodies that you 

         6        say you saw on the 8th, were they ever buried?

         7   A.   On the 8th, these bodies were removed from that place, 

         8        and they were buried.

         9   Q.   Did you participate in the burial?

        10   A.   No.

        11   Q.   During the 8th, did you at any time see any officials 

        12        from the commune at the Busogo parish?

        13   A.   I saw the bourgmestre.

        14   Q.   Did you have -- who was the bourgmestre? 

        15   A.   I was Emmanuel Harerimana. I spell "Harerimana" 

        16        H-A-R-E-R-I-M-A-N-A.

        17   Q.   Do you recall around what time you saw Harerimana?

        18   A.   I saw Harerimana on that day at seven.  At the time, the 

        19        sisters were leaving the place.  I saw Harerimana on 

        20        that day at the time the sisters were leaving the place.  

        21        It was 14 hours.

        22   Q.   Now, Witness, do you have any idea how many people were 

        23        killed at that particular -- at the nuns' convent and 

        24        the area around there?

        25   A.   I did not count the number of these people, but I am 

        26        trying to think, and I think these people should be 

        27        around a hundred.

        28   Q.   Now, sir, are you aware of what the charges are against 

        29        Juvénal Kajelijeli?  Do you know what he has been 

        30        charged with?

         1   A.   I wouldn't know the charges brought against Kajelijeli.  

         2        But generally, I know these are charges relating to 

         3        genocide.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Did the witness say "killings" or did he say 

         5        "genocide" to the translator?

         6   THE INTERPRETER: Witness used the word which can be 

         7        translated as "killings" or "genocide."

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Now, Witness, why did you come here to testify in the 

        10        case of Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        11   A.   I came to testify in favour of Kajelijeli because I know 

        12        I had never seen him at that place, and I know very well 

        13        that what I am saying is the truth, before God.  I would 

        14        like to repeat that he played no role in these events.  

        15        I did not see him at that place.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that may have been my 

        17        last question, but let me just check with my client.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel. 

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions, Your Honour. 

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        21        

        22        What did the witness want to say?  

        23        

        24        Translate that. 

        25   THE WITNESS: What I would like to tell the Chamber is that, 

        26        in my entire life this is the first time I have appeared 

        27        before a court, and since I have had to answer several 

        28        questions I feel tired, I feel mentally worn out.  I 

        29        would, therefore, like to request the Chamber, if it 

        30        were possible, to grant me some time to rest and to come

         1        back tomorrow to continue with my testimony.  If that 

         2        were possible.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Now we have just finished the 

         4        examination-in-chief, and we will be starting the 

         5        cross-examination for about half an hour.  We then take 

         6        a break, a lunch break, and then we resume our work in 

         7        the afternoon.  We normally don't sit on Friday.  

         8        Depending in the cross-examination would have been 

         9        finished by the end of the day today, that would be it.  

        10        If not, we will come back to his evidence on Monday.  

        11        

        12        So if he is not sick, or what have you, and has a 

        13        particular problem, we will continue the 

        14        cross-examination for this half an hour, then we have 

        15        that one hour and a half of rest.  Right?  

        16        

        17        Can you translate slowly to the witness, please. 

        18   THE WITNESS: Thank you.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Any cross-examination? 

        20   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        22                        CROSS-EXAMINATION

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:

        24   Q.   Witness, you told this Court, didn't you, that on the 

        25        7th of April before you left the convent, one of the 

        26        sisters told you that a certain family was present 

        27        there.  That's what you told this Court, isn't it?

        28   A.   Thank you for the question.  That precisely is what I 

        29        said with regard to the question that was put to me.

        30   Q.   And what family was it who had gone to the convent

         1        before you left that morning?

         2   A.   As I stated earlier on, this reverend sister spoke to 

         3        Gateyiteyi and told him that his family had taken refuge 

         4        in that place, just as other people who had taken refuge 

         5        there, and were being kept by the gendarme.

         6   Q.   So Gateyiteyi, knowing that his family was resident in 

         7        the convent, nevertheless went away from the convent.  

         8        Is that your evidence?

         9   A.   I never stated that he went away from this building or 

        10        from this place.  All he did was to try to reach his 

        11        house to see if the doors of the house had been closed, 

        12        and then to come back to the place where the family was 

        13        taking refuge.

        14   Q.   He didn't greet his family?  He just left with you to go 

        15        to see if his doors were closed.  Is that what you are 

        16        telling us?

        17   A.   He did not go to the convent immediately.

         1        1230H

         2   Q.   So, he didn't greet his family whom he knew were taking 

         3        refuge at the convent.  He went straight to see if his 

         4        doors were closed, that's your evidence, isn't it?

         5   A.   That's correct.

         6   Q.   How many people had taken refuge in the convent before 

         7        you left your place of employment on the morning of the 

         8        7th of April?

         9   A.   Prosecutor, I didn't go to the convent on that morning 

        10        of the 7th.  So, I am unable to know the number of the 

        11        people who took refuge there.  This is the information 

        12        which the reverent sister gave us and who said that the 

        13        family of Gateyiteyi had sought refuge there.  I, 

        14        therefore, will not be able to answer the question about 

        15        the number of people who sought refuge there.

        16   Q.   Witness, I want you to look at a statement please, the 

        17        one which you have already identified as yours and I 

        18        call for the original of the witness's statement which 

        19        was dated and signed the 25th of September 2001.

        20   A.   I don't understand English, so I cannot read this 

        21        document.

        22   Q.   Right.  Is it your signature at the back of that 

        23        document?

        24   A.   Yes, it is there.

        25   Q.   And you said, immediately above your signature, "I swear 

        26        what I said today is the truth," is that not correct?

        27   A.   That is correct.

        28   Q.   Tell me, Witness, if the name Rachelle appears in the 

        29        statement anywhere, whether you discussed what you have 

        30        told us today about Rachelle, the soldier?

         1   A.   If you read the statement carefully, you'll realise that 

         2        the content of the document is on the circumstances 

         3        surrounding the death of Gateyiteyi, and if by any 

         4        chance you do not find the name of Rachelle, it is 

         5        because the questions put to me did not relate to the 

         6        attack on the places that were referred to.

         7   Q.   Let me understand this, there wasn't a single question 

         8        addressed to you.  Are you telling me in respect of the 

         9        fact that you were an eye-witness of the attack on 

        10        Busogo parish, not a single question?

        11   A.   I told you that if it does not appear in this English 

        12        document, it's simple because the question was not put 

        13        to me.

        14   Q.   Well, nothing about the attack of Busogo parish appears 

        15        on this document.  Surely you would have told the 

        16        Defence Counsel when they came to see you that you were 

        17        an eye-witness to the attack on Busogo parish.

        18   A.   Mr. Prosecutor, on that subject, I will tell you that 

        19        wherever I went, I heard it often said by Prosecutors 

        20        that one should answer the questions asked only without 

        21        giving additional details, hence, there was no reason 

        22        that would have driven me to talk of things if I wasn't  

        23        asked the question related thereto.

        24   Q.   So, let me understand this finally, is it your evidence 

        25        that you were neither asked any questions about the 

        26        attack on Busogo parish, nor did you volunteer any 

        27        information in respect of the attack of the Busogo 

        28        parish, is that your evidence?

        29   A.   You all have this document before you, according to what 

        30        you said, and I don't speak English, but if you have

         1        read this and you see that that item of information is 

         2        not there, it's because I was not asked any question 

         3        about it.  If you see that it is mentioned, it is 

         4        because I was asked questions about it.  All that I can 

         5        say is that the information contained in the document is 

         6        correct.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         9   Q.   Witness, tell me again, how far it is from Ruziga's  

        10        home to Gateyiteyi's home?

        11   A.   Between Ruziga's home and Gateyiteyi's home, there is, 

        12        it is not far from one to the other.  I would say it is 

        13        about less than ten metres.  It is certainly not more 

        14        than ten metres.

        15   Q.   Is Gateyiteyi's home the same as Munyemvano's compound?

        16   A.   Yes, it is the same kraal, it's the same compound.  

        17        Their houses are next to each other and that constitutes 

        18        Munyemvano's family.

        19   Q.   Witness, is there a compost heap at the Munyemvano's 

        20        compound?

        21   A.   As far as I remember, near the compounds down below 

        22        Gateyiteyi's house was a hole where earth had been 

        23        removed to make bricks.

        24   Q.   Do you recall if there was a rubbish heap outside of 

        25        Munyemvano's compound?

        26   A.   That I can't know because I am not an agronomist to go 

        27        around checking households.

        28   Q.   Witness, I am suggesting to you that Gateyiteyi was shot 

        29        just beside a rubbish heap or a composite heap  outside 

        30        of the Munyemvano's compound.

          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1   A.   I should like to ask you, Mr. Prosecutor, and please 

         2        tell me and truly, do you know Gateyiteyi when you speak 

         3        of the place where he was shot?  I should like to ask 

         4        the Chamber to take you to the place, to the site, the 

         5        place where we talked about and you will see that, 

         6        rather than having been shot where you say next to that 

         7        compost heap, it was at Ruziga's house and that is the 

         8        truth and that is what the whole population knows.

         9   Q.   Witness, are you conceding now that you know of the 

        10        compost heap outside of --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has 

        12        just refuted what Mr. Fleming has said about the compost 

        13        heap.  He has just not conceded anything.  He has just 

        14        refuted what counsel has said with respect to the 

        15        compost heap.  He said they were not there.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        17   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, with respect, he didn't say 

        18        anything about the composite heap.  He said it wasn't 

        19        beside a composite heap.  It was at Ruziga's house and 

        20        I am following it up by saying, do you concede that 

        21        there was a composite heap?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Where that might not be the necessary 

        23        conclusion to that.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Absolutely.

        25   MR. FLEMING: But he can say that, Your Honour, I am 

        26        cross-examining.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, you can put it to him but another thing 

        28        perhaps witness -- you can ask, tell witness if he knew 

        29        that he can answer the questions if he understands them 

        30        straight away without any further comments.  If he does

         1        not understand the question, he can say so and as we 

         2        said earlier on, it can be repeated or explained.

         3   BY MR. FLEMING:

         4   Q.   Are you conceding, Mr -- I am sorry.  

         5   THE WITNESS:  Agreed.

         6   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         7   Q.   Witness, are you conceding that there was a composite 

         8        heap outside Munyemvano's compound?

         9   A.   I told you that below Gateyiteyi's house, there was a 

        10        hole from which earth had been taken to make bricks and 

        11        that one time or another, household effects were thrown 

        12        to that hole.

        13   Q.   Now, Witness, I am suggesting to you that there was in 

        14        fact, a compost heap between Munyemvano and Ruziga 

        15        houses; what is your response?

        16   A.   In fact, in Rwanda, we do distinguish between a 

        17        composite heap which provides fertilizer that we can use 

        18        for agriculture with a ditch or hole from where earth 

        19        has been removed to make bricks which one wants to fill 

        20        in.

        21   Q.   Well, I didn't mention the hole, but you might like now  

        22        to answer my question.  There was, wasn't there, a 

        23        compost heap between the Munyemvano compound and the 

        24        Ruziga house?

        25   A.   No, there was no composite heap between Munyemvano house 

        26        and Ruziga's house, but there was this hole that I 

        27        referred to.

        28   Q.   Between the two houses?

        29   A.   That house was -- hole was closer to Gateyiteyi's house 

        30        but more or less between Ruziga's house and Gateyiteyi's

         1        house.

         2   Q.   And Gateyiteyi was shot according to your evidence, 

         3        within ten metres of his own front door or the door of 

         4        the opening of the compound.  That's your evidence isn't 

         5        it, that is the Munyemvano's compound?

         6   A.   Yes, that is what I stated.

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, would you tell me, please, who the 

         8        Interahamwe are, or were in 1994?

         9   A.   In fact, we had heard the term Interahamwe when it was 

        10        used by the president of the republic in his speech, but 

        11        I know that there were associations of young people 

        12        throughout the country and those young people started  

        13        killing people in 1994, called themselves Interahamwe.  

        14        That is all I know because I was not interested in 

        15        power.

        16   Q.   There, weren't there Interahamwe at Busogo parish on the 

        17        morning of the 7th of April in 1994?

        18   A.   I don't know what you want to know exactly.  You are 

        19        asking me if the Interahamwe went there early in the 

        20        morning.

        21   Q.   Witness, on the morning of the 7th of April, 1994, at 

        22        Busogo parish, you saw, didn't you, people who were 

        23        known as Interahamwe?

        24   A.   I told you that on the morning of the 7th at Busogo 

        25        parish, displaced people, people displaced by the war 

        26        who came from Zaire, from Butaro and from Kinigi and 

        27        these displaced people, people displaced by the war were 

        28        with the young people from Busogo secteur.  I can't tell 

        29        you if those people were Interahamwe because I don't 

        30        know what your understanding of Interahamwe is.

         1   Q.   I am not using my understanding, I am using your 

         2        understanding of Interahamwe, people that you knew.  

         3        They called themselves Interahamwe, you saw such people  

         4        didn't you, and on the morning of the 7th of April 1994 

         5        at the Busogo parish?

         6   A.   I didn't see them.

         7   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, is it not an appropriate time.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We will stop here and resume our work  

         9        at 2:30 in the afternoon.  Could you please tell the 

        10        witness accordingly, Interpreter.  Until 2:30, these 

        11        proceedings stand adjourned. 

        12        (Court recessed from 1305H to 1430H)

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  We 

        14        continue with the testimony of Witness RHU25, 

        15        cross-examination.  Mr. Fleming?

        16   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   Witness, you talked previously of why ************

        19        *****.  Remember you told us of certain things that 

        20        you were supposed to have pointed to somebody else in 

        21        1991. Do recall telling us that?

        22   A.   Yes, this was my testimony.

        23   Q.   I think it was your neighbour, wasn't that, you were 

        24        allegedly to have pointed out, is that the case?

        25   A.   I did not say that I pointed out the person.  I said 

        26        that they came to arrest the person while I was there.  

        27        I was present at his arrest.

        28   Q.   I didn't say that you pointed him out either, I said 

        29        that it was a neighbour that you were supposed to have 

        30        pointed out or alleged to have pointed out, isn't that

         1        the case?

         2   A.   What you are saying is a pretext for the son of this 

         3        person to arrest me, otherwise those people are my 

         4        neighbours.

         5   Q.   Witness, just listen to the question and answer the 

         6        question, please.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Try to listen to the question and if you 

         8        don't, if you don't understand the question just say so.

         9   BY MR. FLEMING:

        10   Q.   The man that is alleged --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Listen to the Court's instructions that the 

        12        interpreter translates them before the witness answers.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Interpreter, could you do that.  Yes, and 

        14        while on this, please, tell the witness not to mention 

        15        the names of that person.  Use the formula that is being 

        16        used in the question.

        17   MR. FLEMING: I am not sure there is a problem with the name 

        18        of the person who was --

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, no.  That is not a problem.  He might 

        20        mention the name.

        21   MR. FLEMING: I am going to actually put it to him, the name.  

        22        I don't think that is going to be the subject of any 

        23        witness protection.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: There is no problem with that. There is no 

        26        problem with that name.  Okay.  Go ahead.

        28   Q.   Witness, the man that I alleged that you pointed out was 

        29        ****, wasn't it?

        30   A.   That is correct.

         1   Q.   And his son is called or was called ***** wasn't that 

         2        right?

         3   A.   Yes.

         4   Q.   They were both arrested on the same day?

         5   A.   No, his son's name is not *****.

         6   Q.   Was there a man named **** that was arrested at the 

         7        same time as ****?

         8   A.   Yes, this person called **** exists and he was 

         9        arrested at the same time as *****.

        10   Q.   Neither of them exist any longer?

        11   A.   These people were taken away by the soldiers and since 

        12        then we have not seen them.

        13   Q.   That was in 1991, wasn't it?

        14   A.   That is correct.

        15   Q.   They were Tutsi, weren't they?

        16   A.   Yes, these people were Tutsi.

        17   Q.   And Kajelijeli was bourgmestre at the time that the 

        18        incident occurred, wasn't he?

        19   A.   Yes, Kajelijeli was the bourgmestre.

        20   Q.   You witnessed the event, didn't you?

        21   A.   Yes, I was witness to that event.

        22   Q.   Do you know a man named *****, 

        23        H-A-S-E-N-G-I-N-E-Z-A?

        24   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Can you spell the name again slowly?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  We thought so too.  Can you spell the name 

        26        again, Mr. Fleming? 

        27   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour --

         5   MR. FLEMING: I am sorry, Your Honours.  I will withdraw that 

         6        question.  I will withdraw that question.

         7   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         8   Q.   Do you a man by the name of Pierre Kajelijeli?

         9   A.   I do not know the person.

        10   Q.   Witness, you were present, weren't you, when these two 

        11        people were arrested in 1991?

        12   A.   I was present when these two persons were arrested.

        13   Q.   And it was you who identified those people for the 

        14        authorities who came to arrest them, wasn't it?

        15   A.   No, I did not identify these people for the authorities.  

        16        When the authorities arrived in front of my house, they 

        17        called me and asked me to show them the house of 

        18        *****, of the IPJ.

        19   Q.   And you did that, didn't you?

        20   A.   I showed them the house of ***** and the authorities 

        21        went in that direction.

        22   Q.   And was it from there that the both ***** 

        23        **** were arrested?

        24   A.   That is correct.

        25   Q.   Now, it is alleged by the authorities that you were 

        26        implicated in that arrest.  That's the allegation 

        27        against you; isn't it?

        28   A.   Yes, that is **** accusation against me.

        29   Q.   He is not the only one who has made that allegation 

        30        against you in respect of that; was he?

         1   A.   No, it is only **** who is accusing me of that.

         2   Q.   Witness, I will give you another opportunity to answer.  

         3        There were other people who have made accusations 

         4        against you, weren't they?

         5   A.   If you look at my case file closely, you will realise 

         6        that it is only ****who is making those allegations 

         7        against me, because at one point in time, the 

         8        prosecutor's office realised that there was no evidence 

         9        to sanction the allegation against me and I was freed.  

        10   Q.   Witness, you were released provisionally; weren't you?

        11   A.   Yes, I was released provisionally, initially, and I was 

        12        requested to regularly report to the prosecutor's office 

        13        and after three months, I was released definitively.

        14   Q.   When do you say that occurred?

        15   A.   This final release occurred in October, but I have no 

        16        specific recollection of the day.

        17   Q.   The year?

        18   A.   The year was 1997.

        19   Q.   Witness, in 1997, you weren't released at all, 

        20        absolutely.  I suggest to you that at first you were 

        21        released provisionally and then you were taken back into 

        22        custody all in 1997?

        23   A.   No, that is not true.

        24   Q.   In any event, Witness, you have not had a trial yet on 

        25        this issue, have you?

        26   A.   No, I have not been tried yet.

        27   Q.   Nor have you seen your dossier, have you?

        28   A.   No, I know the entire content of my dossier because I 

        29        have gone through it fully.

        30   Q.   Witness, on the morning of the 7th of April in 1994,

         1        you were present, weren't you, when the slaughter of the 

         2        Tutsi began at Busogo parish?

         3   A.   That is true, I was present.

         4   Q.   Were there women and children involved in that massacre?

         5   A.   I didn't see women among the killers.

         6   Q.   Were women and children killed?

         7   A.   Yes, Tutsi women and children died on the spot.

         8   Q.   It is your evidence, isn't it, that the killers came 

         9        looking for the Tutsis who had sought refuge at the 

        10        Busogo parish?  That is your evidence, isn't it?

        11   A.   Yes, I confirm that.

        12   Q.   And the people who were killed up to hundred, you told 

        13        us earlier on, on that morning, were in fact Tutsis; 

        14        weren't they?

        15   A.   That is correct.

        16   Q.   Witness, I want to come back, please, to Gateyiteyi. 

        17        You have told us before that one of the Sisters informed 

        18        you or informed him that his family was within the 

        19        compound of the Busogo parish.  That is your evidence,  

        20        isn't it?

        21   A.   I confirm that a Sister told Gateyiteyi that his family 

        22        had taken refuge at the Sisters convent.

        23   Q.   And there were Tutsi who had been living at Munyemvano's 

        24        compound, weren't they?

        25   A.   They were Tutsi who belonged to the Munyemvano family 

        26        but there also Tutsi who had sought refuge in 

        27        Munyemvano's house.

        28   Q.   Now, that day, after you left the compound or you left 

        29        where up you had been, you walked with Gateyiteyi and 

        30        you have told us that you stayed for about ten minutes

         1        in the forest.  That is the case, isn't?

         2   A.   I told you that I was with Gateyiteyi and we asked the 

         3        people we had met what were the gunshots we were hearing   

         4        were coming from, and they said these were people who 

         5        were killing Tutsis.  Immediately, we heard gunshots not 

         6        far from where we were standing and we moved towards the 

         7        forest, the bush to see who was firing and what that 

         8        person wanted.

         9   Q.   Witness, just listen to the questions, please, and then 

        10        answer the question that I ask and not the ones that you 

        11        think you want to answer.  You went with Gateyiteyi into 

        12        a forest for about ten minutes, didn't you?

        13   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        14   Q.   And the only people you saw moving around then were 

        15        those who were coming from the direction of the 

        16        explosions and shots, isn't that the case?

        17   A.   I have told you that no one was moving in the 

        18        neighbourhood.

        19   Q.   No Tutsi were moving in the neighbourhood at this stage, 

        20        were they?

        21   A.   There were only Tutsi who were coming from very far off 

        22        places from Gateyiteyi's house and who were moving 

        23        towards the convent.

        24   Q.   From what direction were the shots and the explosions 

        25        coming?

        26   A.   They were gunshots that were coming from Rwankeri 

        27        direction and there is something I do not want to 

        28        mention so as to protect witness's identity, but there 

        29        were also gunshots from the neighbourhood in 

        30        relationship to the place we were standing.

         1   Q.   Witness, is Rwankeri in the same direction as Byangabo 

         2        from where you were standing, that is?

         3   A.   The Byangabo market is located between Rwankeri and 

         4        Busogo parish.  Rwankeri is located between the parish 

         5        and Byangabo market.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel, there is a part of the answer 

         7        which was not read out for the reasons that the 

         8        interpreter gave.  So, either the interpreter takes note 

         9        of that, we will come back to it or the other 

        10        alternative because you must have a complete answer of  

        11        that aspect that was given by the witness.

        12   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I was going to come back to it when 

        13        we come back into --

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Interpreter, can you keep that, that 

        15        part of the answer that was fully read out?  Can you do 

        16        that?  Okay.

        17   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Yes, I will do that, Your Honour.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  You can go on, Counsel. 

        19   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        21   Q.   You met, didn't you, and two people ****and 

        22        ****? 

        23   A.   Yes, I met these people.

        24   Q.   They were coming from the direction of Byangabo, weren't 

        25        they?

        26   A.   These people were coming from Rwankeri, from where we 

        27        were hearing the gunshots.

        28   Q.   So they weren't coming from Byangabo, is that your 

        29        evidence?

        30   A.   No, these people weren't coming from Byangabo because

         1       ***** lives in Rwankeri and when he realised that 

         2        the Tutsis of his locality had fled, he joined us at the 

         3        parish.

         4   Q.   Did you ask them about the explosions that you heard?

         5   A.   Yes, I asked them what the gunshots we were hearing were 

         6        about, because the gunshots were very frightening.

         7   Q.   And what did they tell you?

         8   A.   Since **** is a neighbour of **** and their 

         9        families are living there in the neighbourhood, he told 

        10        me that there were persons who were attacking the Tutsis 

        11        and killing them.

        12   Q.   Did they tell you that it was the Interahamwe that were 

        13        attacking the Tutsis?

        14   A.   Yes, he told me it was the Interahamwe who was attacking 

        15        them.

        16   Q.   And where did he say that these Tutsis were being 

        17        attacked?

        18   A.   In their house.

        19   Q.   Were was their house?

        20   A.   The house was at Rwankeri and it was at that same place 

        21        that **** lived.

        22   Q.   Witness, I want you please, to look at your statement of 

        23        the 25th of September 2001.  Now, I want you to identify 

        24        again, is that your statement, check the signature at 

        25        the back?

        26   A.   Yes, I can recognise my signature.

        27   Q.   And I want you to follow please and on page 2, at about 

        28        the 9th line down, there is a sentence starting, "When I 

        29        and Gateyiteyi left ****-- " For the purpose of 

        30        the booth, it is in the third paragraph of the statement

         1        at about a quarter of the way through that long 

         2        paragraph.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that there should be  

         4        some caution with respect to the place.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Mr. Fleming?

         6   MR. FLEMING: I can delete one word.

         7   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         8   Q.   And Witness says this, doesn't it, "when Gateyiteyi and 

         9        I left a particular place, we began to hear weapons 

        10        explosions."  So I will pause there for a translation.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: And, Interpreter, can you take note of the 

        12        witness's microphone with regard to the location of that  

        13        place.  We will certainly come back to them because we 

        14        must have a full record at some stage.  

        15   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Can you repeat the question, 

        16        Counsel?

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   I am reading a far longer passage than that to him.  The 

        19        second sentence is between, and I will substitute A and 

        20        B.  "Between A and B, we met two persons who were coming 

        21        from the direction of Byangabo.  ******** and 

        22        ******."  I pause there again for you to translate.  

        23        

        24        Next sentence is:  "We asked them about the explosions 

        25        that we heard and they told us that it was the 

        26        Interahamwe who were killing Tutsis at Byangabo."  

        27        Now, Witness, these men were coming from the direction 

        28        of Byangabo, weren't they?

        29   A.   Thank you, Counsel.  First of all, I would like to point 

        30        out that the Byangabo market itself is in the Rwankeri

         1        cellule.  Therefore, when someone tells you that 

         2        somebody is coming from the Byangabo direction, that 

         3        does not necessarily mean that the person is coming from 

         4        the Byangabo market.  

         5        

         6        Further, these Tutsis who were being attacked lived -- 

         7        they lived at a distance of less than a kilometre from 

         8        the Byangabo market.

         9   Q.   I am sorry, Witness.  I didn't mention Byangabo market.  

        10        Why did you mention Byangabo market?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour --

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, counsel?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Mr. Fleming mentioned Byangabo.  There is 

        14        only one Byangabo, it's a market.  Everybody knows that.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  Is that so, Counsel?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Put it to the witness.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        18   BY MR. FLEMING:

        19   Q.   Witness, you can do that later on?  Witness, 

        20        you mentioned Byangabo market, why did you mention 

        21        Byangabo market?  I didn't. 

        22   A.   I am saying that because it seems to me that your 

        23        understanding of this region makes it that Byangabo is 

        24        somewhere separate and Rwankeri another separate and 

        25        distinct location.

        26   Q.   I am sorry, I don't have an understanding of it.  I am 

        27        just working from what you told us, and you have said in 

        28        your witness statement which you have signed as being 

        29        the truth and I quote: "We met two persons who were 

        30        coming from the direction of Byangabo."  That is what

         1        you said, didn't you?

         2   A.   Well, quite so, you need to understand that it was from 

         3        the direction of Byangabo and not from Byangabo. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

         5   BY MR. FLEMING:

         6   Q.   Then I told you, didn't I, that the Interahamwe were 

         7        killing Tutsis at Byangabo.  They said that; didn't 

         8        they?

         9   A.   No, that is not what they told us.

        10   Q.   Witness, I want you to look again, please, at the 

        11        statement.  It bears your signature on the last page.  

        12        You have agreed with me that it bears the words: 

        13        "I swear what I have told you today is the truth."  Then 

        14        I want you, please, go back up to the sentence which we 

        15        have dealt with and I will read it again and what it 

        16        says is this and I quote:  "We asked them about the 

        17        expositions that we heard and they told us that it was 

        18        the Interahamwe who were killing Tutsis at Byangabo." 

        19        That is what you said in your statement, isn't it?

        20   A.   Yes, that was my testimony.

        21   Q.   If we take up something that Defence counsel said a 

        22        moment ago that Byangabo was, but Byangabo market -- we 

        23        would be able to read, wouldn't we, that the Interahamwe 

        24        were killing Tutsis at Byangabo market.  Can't we read 

        25        that?

        26   A.   That wouldn't be quite right since there were no Tutsis 

        27        living at the Byangabo market.  So, to the contrary, 

        28        there were Tutsis who lived up above the Byangabo 

        29        market.

        30   Q.   What in Byangabo?

         1   A.   Until now, I don't understand what you understand by 

         2        Byangabo.  I have told you that Byangabo was a market 

         3        which was in Rwankeri in the area of the Rwankeri and I 

         4        have also testified that Tutsis lived up above the 

         5        Byangabo market, except one Rukara who lived near that  

         6        market.

         7   Q.   You see, Witness, today you told us in evidence, that  

         8        just yesterday afternoon again, that it was in Rwankeri 

         9        that these two men said that people were being killed 

        10        and today in your evidence, in this cross-examination, 

        11        you have substituted Rwankeri for Byangabo; haven't you?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: It is a long answer.  Could you please 

        13        interpret slowly?

        14   THE WITNESS:  No, I never replaced Rwankeri with Byangabo.  

        15        All I said was there was a difference between Rwankeri 

        16        and Byangabo and I did, indeed, specify that Byangabo 

        17        was a market and I said that that market was within the 

        18        general area of Rwankeri such as another place which is 

        19        known as Gahanga, which is within the Rwankeri area.  

        20        Now, when I say that Tutsis were killed in the 

        21        neighbourhood of Byangabo, doesn't he mean that it was  

        22        at Byangabo market itself.  Gahanga is spelt, 

        23        G-A-H-A-N-G-A.

         1        1530H

         2   MR. FLEMING: 

         3   Q.   So, Witness, thank you for that, because now you have 

         4        conceded that there is a distinction between Rwankeri 

         5        and Byangabo.  In that answer that is the case, isn't 

         6        it?  There is a distinction between Rwankeri and 

         7        Byangabo. 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  Objection.  This 

         9        has been asked and answered.  The witness has clearly 

        10        said Byangabo is a market within Rwankeri.  I mean -- 

        11        that is what the witness said.  He has explained 

        12        Byangabo.  He has explained Byangabo as a market and I 

        13        don't need to testify, but that is in the record.  Where 

        14        are we going with this, back and forth, back and forth?  

        15        There is no distinction to be made other than what the 

        16        witness had already said, asked and answered.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will get that into the record.  

        18        

        19        You can put any specific questions that you want to 

        20        clarify.  For the rest of it, we will get when issues 

        21        are argued.

        22   MR. FLEMING: I want to pursue the distinction, Your Honours. 

        23        He did say in the last answer.  

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   You see, Witness, it is your view, isn't it, that there 

        26        were no killings in Byangabo market?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  That is not what 

        28        this witness has said, that there were no killings in 

        29        Byangabo market.  I am objecting.

        30   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I am cross-examining.  I am putting

         1        propositions to him.  My Learned Friend well knows that, 

         2        and he wants to give his client a little -- or this 

         3        witness a little comfort.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this witness -- in other 

         5        situations, I probably would agree with Mr. Fleming, but 

         6        I don't have the luxury.  The witness says, no, he 

         7        doesn't have the vaguest clue of what I am saying.  I 

         8        can't influence him, as we lawyers normally do, with our 

         9        objections.  The witness is standing up, he doesn't know 

        10        what I am saying.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: But, Counsel --

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: But I am making an objection, Your Honour, 

        13        based upon the fact that it is an improper proposition 

        14        to put.  He is assuming facts that are not in evidence.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: The witness has said, if you followed the 

        16        evidence that we have been able to follow, that, 

        17        according to his evidence so far, that the market -- the 

        18        Byangabo market, when it comes to Tutsis who were living 

        19        up above that market.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: He said with the exception of ^^Rukara who 

        21        lived just outside, okay, but we know where Rukara was 

        22        killed.  But the witness does not say there was no 

        23        killing in Byangabo market.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: I think Counsel is entitled to pursue that 

        25        aspect to get clarification. 

        26   BY MR. FLEMING:

        27   Q.   Witness, it is your view, isn't it, that nobody, no 

        28        Tutsis were killed in Byangabo market?

        29   A.   I didn't reach that place in order to realise that it 

        30        was only Rukara who had been killed at the market, since

         1        it is understood that Rukara lived near that market.  

         2        The other Tutsis were killed in their houses.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         4   BY MR. FLEMING:

         5   Q.   Witness, you have discussed this fact, haven't you with 

         6        Defence Counsel? 

         7   A.   Yes. 

         8   Q.   And you were told by Defence Counsel that no Tutsis were 

         9        killed in --

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.

        11   MR. FLEMING:  -- in Byangabo market.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: I think --

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I mean -- Mr. Fleming, as an 

        14        experienced lawyer -- I mean, I rise because -- I mean, 

        15        I would never even say that to any of the Prosecution's 

        16        witnesses, and I was here for several months, never 

        17        once.  And I am accused of giving a lot of sneaky 

        18        things.  I haven't done that once, and he knows that is 

        19        improper. 

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel, we will not allow that question 

        21        unless there are some specific aspects you want to 

        22        pursue. Can you move on to the next question, 

        23        Mr. Fleming?

        24   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours won't hear me on that?  I move on 

        25        to the next question. 

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        27   BY MR. FLEMING:

        28   Q.   Witness, you have been told, haven't you, that nobody 

        29        was killed in Byangabo market, no Tutsi was killed in 

        30        Byangabo market?

         1   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Mr. Prosecutor, this part of the 

         2        answer which I will not interpret, the Tutsis lived in 

         3        Rwankeri except Rukara who lived behind the Byangabo 

         4        market.  So from what I heard, it was only Rukara's body 

         5        which was found in front of the shops at that market.  

         6        For the remainder, all the Tutsis were killed in their 

         7        houses.

         9   Q.   There is not something you know of your own knowledge.

        12        continually referring to something which refers to his 

        13        identity.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we shall have to go into closed

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: We cannot go on keeping things in abeyance

        16   Q.   Witness, immediately before we had that short break, you 

        17        told us that nuns' of those Tutsis who were moving 

        18        around came from Gateyiteyi's house or Munyemvano's 

        19        compound; didn't you?

        22        have it still in front of you.  This is the statement 

        23        that you signed, dated 25th September 2001, and you talk 

        24        of when Gateyiteyi and yourself left a particular place, 

        25        and I am reading: "We began to hear weapons explosion 

        26        between --" and I will use A and B as before to denote 

        27        the same places.  "We met two persons who were coming 

        28        from the direction of Byangabo, ************ and 

        29        *******.  We asked them about the explosions that we

         1        were killing the Tutsis at Byangabo".  That is to give 

         2        it the context.  Then you say:  "It was at that time 

         3        that I saw that all Tutsis who were living at 

         4        Munyemvano's compound where Gateyiteyi lived were going 

         5        to the nuns' convent."  You said that, didn't you?  

         6   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Counsel, may I know where you 

         7        are reading from?

         8   MR. FLEMING: The same place that we were reading before. 

         9        I am sorry, it might have been not you who was doing it, 

        10        in the second page of the handwritten statement at about 

        11        the 7th or 8th line down, "when I and Gateyiteyi".

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Have you located it?  

        13   MR. FLEMING: Ninth line down, in fact. 

        14   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: I do not have the French version 

        15        of the document.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Do you not work in English, Interpreter?  I 

        17        wanted to work from the original handwritten.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Do you have the French text as well?

        19   MR. FLEMING: Yes, we do, Your Honour.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I thought that we were working 

        21        from the original which the witness signed and then, 

        22        because I don't think there is any signature on any of 

        23        the other documents.  I mean -- I have no real objection 

        24        except if the witness is following and understands that 

        25        whatever the document, the French document is the same 

        26        as the other document that he was previously shown.

        27   MR. FLEMING: Well, I am not prepared to vouch for that, Your 

        28        Honour, because my learned friend gave us all documents, 

        29        the original handwritten one, the typed version and the 

        30        French translation.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, if they are using our documents, I 

         2        have no problem with it, but the point I am making is 

         3        that the witness has identified a document with his 

         4        signature on it.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  If that be the case, then of 

         6        course, Mr. Fleming, you could read it in English, then 

         7        it will go through the whole process and the interpreter 

         8        will put it to the witness.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, and if the interpreter -- I thought 

        10        that was being done before the interpreter, because the 

        11        interpreter would be getting it in French and he will be 

        12        following it.

        13   MR. FLEMING: That is exactly what I did. 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: So, Interpreter --

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Then I don't know what the problem is, 

        16        because what was done in the past, it seems to me and 

        17        the interpreter seemed to be -- we were moving smoothly 

        18        before. 

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think the interpreter wanted to get a 

        20        French text, but I think the easiest way would be to do 

        21        as we have been doing, read through the statement and 

        22        then go through the whole process and the interpreter 

        23        will ultimately put it to the witness in Kinyarwanda. 

        24   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Mr. President, what I meant was 

        25        that, if we are given the English version which is the 

        26        original, we will prefer to -- I would prefer to have 

        27        the typewritten version because it is easier for me to 

        28        read. 

        29   MR. FLEMING: I had in mind what he has, Your Honour.

         1        I think you were just given a document, Mr. Translator.  

         2        They came in a bundle.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: In English?

         4   MR. FLEMING: There is -- Your Honour, the bundle that we 

         5        have, and it has a cover page, as first, an English 

         6        typewritten version, second, a French translation and 

         7        third, a copy of the handwritten version.  So, we are in 

         8        the French.  If we are looking at the French typed 

         9        version, it is the third paragraph and the fifth line 

        10        down.  

        11   BY MR. FLEMING:

        12   Q.   Witness, let me start again, then. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        14   BY MR. FLEMING:

        15   Q.   "When Gateyiteyi and I left, we began to hear the 

        16        weapons explosions between A and B.  We met two persons 

        17        who were coming from the direction of Byangabo, ***** 

        18        ********.  We asked them about the 

        19        explosions that we heard, and they told us that it was 

        20        the Interahamwe who were killing the Tutsis at 

        21        Byangabo".  

        22        

        23        And then, importantly, the following sentence:  "It was 

        24        at that time that I saw that all Tutsis who were living 

        25        at Munyemvano's compound where Gateyiteyi lived were 

        26        going to the nuns' convent".  Do you agree that is what 

        27        you stated? 

        28   A.   I see that in this document there is a slight problem.  

        29        I did say that it was a reverend sister who told us that 

        30        the Tutsi who was at Gateyiteyi's house and members of

         1        his family had sought refuge at the convent.  And when 

         2        we moved, we met the persons, those persons that we 

         3        asked about events in Rwankeri.  

         4        

         5        After we heard two gunshots, we hid ourselves in the 

         6        bush, that is Gateyiteyi and myself.  However, these 

         7        people who came from Rwankeri told us that the gunshots 

         8        we were hearing were coming from the direction of 

         9        Byangabo where the Tutsis were being killed.  And while 

        10        we were still hiding in the bush, Gateyiteyi and myself, 

        11        we saw Tutsis coming from various directions towards the 

        12        Sisters' convent.

        13   Q.   Witness, please listen to the question and answer only 

        14        the question.  You said in your statement, didn't you, 

        15        "It was at that time that I saw that all Tutsis, they 

        16        were living at Munyemvano's compound where Gateyiteyi 

        17        lived were going to the nuns' convent".  You said that, 

        18        didn't you? 

        19   A.   But I told you that I thought there was a problem with 

        20        this document, because in my explanation I did say that 

        21        the Tutsis that we saw came from the Manjeri cellule 

        22        where Gateyiteyi lived, and not from Gateyiteyi's house.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel would like to -- the question from 

        24        Counsel is that, did you say what has been read out to 

        25        you, Witness, in your statement?

        26   MR. FLEMING: I am sorry, Your Honour.

        27   BY MR. FLEMING:

        28   Q.   Witness, did you not say these words in your statements: 

        29        "It was at that time that I saw that all Tutsis who were 

        30        living at Munyemvano's compound where Gateyiteyi lived

         1        were going to the nuns' convent".  You said those words, 

         2        didn't you? 

         3   A.   I made a statement which was recorded.  I said the words 

         4        which were recorded in this statement, but that does not 

         5        mean that all the Tutsis came from Gateyiteyi's house.

         6   Q.   Thank you.  Witness, I want you to look at Exhibit 7, 

         7        please, Prosecution Exhibit 7, and I want you to look at 

         8        photographs 52 and 53. 

         9   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I have them up on the screen, if 

        10        they can be put onto the screen generally.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I assume that the Prosecutor is 

        12        not going to -- is going to be extra careful at this 

        13        point.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The only problem is I do not know how 

        15        far we can be sure about the witness's answer, that is 

        16        the problem.

        17   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I will be putting to him only two 

        18        propositions.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Maybe the --

        20   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour is anxious, should we go into closed 

        21        session?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thus the problem is -- I am sure the 

        23        questions can be very precise.

        24   MR. FLEMING: They will be, Your Honour.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: But we are not very sure about the answers,  

        26        particularly in view of what we went through this 

        27        morning.  I don't know whether we --

        28   MR. FLEMING: I don't object going into private session, 

        29        Your Honour -- in to the closed session. 

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think -- maybe to be able to move fast,

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  And, Interpreter, could you tell Witness RHU 

         2        that we are back into open session, he should be 

         3        careful. 

         4   BY MR. FLEMING:

         5   Q.   Witness, one last matter.  On the 7th of April 1994, 

         6        I am suggesting to you that Kajelijeli was at Busogo 

         7        parish with those who were there to kill.

         8   A.   Counsel, I want to tell you that, even if some people 

         9        have told you that Kajelijeli was there, those people 

        10        lied to you, because I was present at that place and if 

        11        Kajelijeli was present there, the sisters who knew him 

        12        would have seen him. 

        13   Q.   Witness, I suggest to you that the killers that day were 

        14        a mixture of Interahamwe, their leaders who had been 

        15        thrown out of the army for discipline, soldiers and 

        16        gendarmes. 

        17   A.   Counsel, I cannot agree with you that the perpetrators 

        18        of the killings on that day were Interahamwe, for the 

        19        simple reason that currently, there are persons who were 

        20        Interahamwe who are free and who are not being 

        21        prosecuted for having committed any killings.  Amongst 

        22        those persons who were present at the place, there were 

        23        some young men who were members of that group called 

        24        Interahamwe, but not everybody.

        25   Q.   The bulk of the killers were in Interahamwe, I suggest 

        26        to you.

        27   A.   No, it was not the bulk of the group.  The Interahamwe 

        28        did not constitute the bulk of the group.  Most of the 

        29        people involved were war displaced persons and deserters 

        30        of the army, just as you said.

         1   Q.   Witness, the army didn't participate in the shooting, 

         2        did they?  They distributed ammunition, weapons and 

         3        grenades to the Interahamwe, isn't that what happened? 

         4   A.   The events -- or from the events as I saw them, it was 

         5        not just the people who had weapons, the people who had 

         6        rifles or guns were deserters of the army, RPF 

         7        deserters.

         8   Q.   And Tutsis were there? 

         9   A.   Are you referring to the soldiers?

        10   Q.   Witness, you said they were deserters of the RPF. 

        11   A.   These were members of the Rwandan Armed Forces.  The 

        12        only problem is that they had deserted from the army and 

        13        were living among the people. 

        14   Q.   How long did you stay there and watched the slaughter of 

        15        that day? 

        16   A.   As soon as they started attacking the nuns' convent, I 

        17        ran because I was very scared.

        18   Q.   How far did you run?  Could you still see it happening? 

        19   A.   From that place, I ran and I went past the buildings of 

        20        the institution ISTB and I continued all the way to the 

        21        football stadium, that is at the football park of the 

        22        ISTB institution.  Then I went to Urusugu hill.  I then 

        23        continued all the way to Rwankeri.

        24   Q.   So, your evidence is that you saw the attack begin and 

        25        you left immediately.  Is that your evidence, isn't it? 

        26   A.   That is correct, after the attack I ran.

        27   Q.   So, Witness, you are in no position to tell us what 

        28        happened there from your own observation the moment you 

        29        left, are you?  You didn't see it after that, did you? 

        30   A.   That is correct.  Since I left, I was not witness to the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        destruction of that institution.

         2   Q.   Nor whether or not Kajelijeli might have come there that 

         3        day after you left, you can't tell us that either, can 

         4        you? 

         5   A.   I am not able to say if Kajelijeli came to that place 

         6        after my departure because when we were drawing up the 

         7        list of persons who perpetrated the killings, his name 

         8        was not mentioned.  If by any chance his name appeared 

         9        on that list, if he was one of the perpetrators of the 

        10        crimes that occurred at that place, his name would have 

        11        appeared on the list.  So, since no one mentioned him, I 

        12        cannot say that he came to that place after my 

        13        departure.

        14   Q.   And the list you talk about is the list drawn up in what 

        15        you described as the Gacaca process****************? 

        16   A.   This list was drawn up by people who hailed***********, 

        17        and the list contains the names of persons who were 

        18        involved in the killings in that locality.  The list was 

        19        drawn up on the request of the prosecutor's office and 

        20        those who were in detention, but who were not on the 

        21        list were subsequently released. 

        22   Q.   Witness, the list was drawn up by the prisoners 

        23        themselves in detention, by the 47 people that you 

        24        referred to yesterday, wasn't it?

        25   A.   Yes.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.  That is the 

        27        cross-examination. 

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        29        Any re-examination?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.

         1                           RE-EXAMINATION

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Witness, the events you described to this Court that 

         4        occurred on the morning of April 7th in 1994, had you 

         5        ever witnessed anything like that before in your life? 

         6   A.   Since my birth, that was when I witnessed similar 

         7        events.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: It is not clear -- similar events.  

         9        

        10        Can you read back the answer of the witness please, the 

        11        translation does not seem to be clear.  

        12   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: "I have never seen any such 

        13        events since I was born, events that happened on that 

        14        day of the 7th of April 1994." 

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        16   Q.   Witness, those events that occurred, will you ever be 

        17        able to forget them? 

        18   A.   I can never ever forget these events because they were 

        19        unfortunate incidents. 

        20   Q.   Witness, the day after the attack, on the 8th, did you 

        21        hear the name of Kajelijeli being mentioned by the nuns 

        22        or anyone in that vicinity, the other people who were 

        23        eyewitnesses with you? 

        24   A.   I have never heard anyone say that he ever saw 

        25        Kajelijeli on the site. 

        26   Q.   At the time that you have testified that you ran away, 

        27        you were afraid and ran away, around what time of day 

        28        was that, if you know? 

        29   A.   On that day when the building belonging to the sisters 

        30        was attacked, I remember that it was around 9:30 in the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        86



          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        morning. 

         2   Q.   Between the time you say you left your location where 

         3        you were and 9:30, did you see Kajelijeli? 

         4   A.   I didn't see him nor did I see him on the 8th. 

         5   Q.   Witness, did you see anyone on the 7th who was involved 

         6        in any killing, that you knew to be Interahamwe or who 

         7        identified themselves to be Interahamwe?  

         8   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  This is supposed to be 

         9        a re-examination.  I don't know what my learned friend 

        10        is trying to do.  Is he examining his witness again?  It 

        11        didn't arise out of the cross-examination.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Precisely, Your Honour, that is exactly what 

        13        I am doing because there was a question -- several 

        14        questions raised about the Interahamwe.  And, so, 

        15        therefore, it is proper for me to raise it on re-direct.  

        16        That is what a re-direct is all about. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  You can ask that question. 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour. 

        19   THE WITNESS: There were people whom I was able to identify on 

        20        that occasion and who were part of the youth who were 

        21        calling themselves Interahamwe.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        23   Q.   Now, Witness, concerning the statement that you gave to 

        24        Defence Counsel, when was the first time that questions 

        25        were put to you concerning the attack at Busogo parish, 

        26        when? 

        27   A.   I recall that I met Counsel for Kajelijeli on the 25th 

        28        of September 2001.  On that occasion, he asked me 

        29        questions concerning the death of Gateyiteyi and the 

        30        role that Kajelijeli may have played in his death.  So, 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        87



          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        we didn't say anything about the attacks on the parish.  

         2        No question was put to me in that regard. 

         3   Q.   Where -- is he finished?  When was the first time that 

         4        you were asked any questions concerning the attack at 

         5        the parish? 

         6   A.   First of all, the office of the prosecutor for the 

         7        Republic of Rwanda asked me questions on the attack on 

         8        the parish.  Later on, when I had already met Counsel 

         9        for Kajelijeli, there was a team of individuals who came 

        10        to see me and they informed me that they were coming 

        11        from Arusha.  The team was made up of three individuals, 

        12        one white man, one Indian and one African, and it is 

        13        these individuals who asked me questions about the 

        14        attack on the parish. 

        15   Q.   Witness, was I the person who took your statement in 

        16        Rwanda on September 25th of last year? 

        17   A.   Yes.

        18   Q.   And was I the person who put questions to you that you 

        19        have just testified about? 

        20   A.   The questions you asked me dealt with the circumstances 

        21        under which Gateyiteyi met his death and the role that 

        22        Kajelijeli may have played in his death.  Those were the 

        23        questions that you put to me. 

        24   Q.   Now, when after September of 2001 -- when was the next 

        25        time you saw me where questions were put to you?

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Are you personifying it, Counsel?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am just asking the witness to tell us the 

        28        times --

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Because, I don't know what could happen.  We 

        30        can understand, Counsel, but if you are putting yourself

          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        in that way, you can go ahead.  I don't know what would 

         2        be the significance of that.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Witness, when was the first time that questions were put 

         5        to you concerning the attack on the nuns' convent by 

         6        Kajelijeli's defence team? 

         7   A.   When I was meeting Counsel for the Defence on the 25th 

         8        of September 2001, that was the very first time that I 

         9        was meeting Kajelijeli's defence team, and the team put 

        10        to me questions concerning the death of Gateyiteyi.  

        11        During that interview, I was able to indicate where I 

        12        was working and where I was at various times.  It was 

        13        possibly during this interview that I may have referred 

        14        to that attack even though I don't remember that very 

        15        well. 

        16   Q.   Witness, do you have any recollection of within the last 

        17        few days being asked specific questions about the attack 

        18        at the nuns' convent?

        19   A.   There is something which is not clear to me, Counsel.  

        20        Do you want to ask me whether you asked me that question 

        21        here or elsewhere?

        22   Q.   Yes.  I want to know whether or not, prior to you coming 

        23        to court and testifying, were you asked that question 

        24        about which you testified concerning the attack, and 

        25        when was the first time you discussed that with 

        26        Kajelijeli's team? 

        27   A.   I think I met Counsel for the Defence the day before I 

        28        testified here before this Chamber, that is when we saw 

        29        one another again and he was able to ask me questions as 

        30        to whether I could still remember the content of the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        89



          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        statement I had issued or given last year, that is when 

         2        we saw one another again. 

         3   Q.   Now, at that time, Witness, were you able to complete 

         4        your statement to -- withdrawn, withdrawn.  I go to 

         5        another area.  Witness, at the time you said that you 

         6        saw the military arresting *****, was 

         7        Juvénal Kajelijeli present or among them? 

         8   A.   No, he wasn't present. 

         9   Q.   After you were released in 1997, who was it who attacked 

        10        you?  Could you tell the Court who attacked you 

        11        anywhere?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: That doesn't arise, does it?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, of course it arises, because it was a 

        14        major issue raised in cross on that.

        15   THE WITNESS: After the prosecutor's office decided to release 

        16        me once and for all, one day ***, who is ***

        17        **, found me at the Bureau Communal.  I had gone there 

        18        to look for the usual documents and following his 

        19        becoming very angry, **** beat me up in public, in 

        20        front of everyone.  At that point in time the present 

        21        first trial attorney of the prosecutor's office was an 

        22        inspector of the judicial police in Mukingo secteur.  

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        24   THE WITNESS: May I continue? 

        25   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes. 

        26   THE WITNESS: The judicial police inspector, the inspector who 

        27        was present ****, he was present.  Since 

        28        what had been done by **** was unpleasant for him, he 

        29        asked me to lodge a complaint with the authorities.  I 

        30        filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office.  At that 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        90



          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        point in time though, I was made to understand that I 

         2        couldn't lodge a complaint against him at the 

         3        prosecutor's office and that I needed to approach 

         4        another institution, given the fact that ******had 

         5        brotherly relationship with the authorities of that 

         6        prosecutor's office.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Let's get the translation.  Do we need all 

         8        that, please?

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Witness, try to answer the questions that I have asked 

        11        you in a short possible sentence, and then if I need to 

        12        get more information I will give you a follow-up 

        13        question.  Do you understand that? 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Let's have the translation.

        15   THE WITNESS: Subsequently, I went to see the prosecutor 

        16        general of the Ruhengeri Appeals Court.  But since the 

        17        prosecutor often didn't live in Ruhengeri, I wasn't able 

        18        to see him, he was often in Kigali.  Under the 

        19        circumstances, I went to speak to the préfet of 

        20        Ruhengeri préfecture.  After he heard my complaint, he 

        21        told me that the best thing I could do was to wait for 

        22        the prosecutor general and speak to him about the 

        23        matter.  In the meantime, I was afraid that *** may 

        24        come up to my house and do me harm.  So, I decided to go 

        25        back to Congo.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel. 

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Just one final question. 

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        29   Q.   What you have just testified to, Witness, is that the 

        30        reason why you have said that **** was the one who 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        91



          KAJELIJELI                                      21 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        had instigated your arrest? 

         2   A.   That is correct.  It was **** who instigated my 

         3        arrest and up until today, he is still after me. 

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that would be our last question, but 

         5        I just have to check with my client to make sure. 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is the end of re-direct, Your Honour. 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thank you, Learned Counsel.

         9        

        10        Judge Ramaroson has some questions to ask.

        11   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, Mr. President.  

        12        

        13        Witness RHU25, you said that one nun said that members 

        14        of Gateyiteyi's family had come to seek refuge at the 

        15        convent.  Was this before your departure and 

        16        Gateyiteyi's departure that the nun told you this? 

        17   THE WITNESS: This was reported to us at the time when we were 

        18        being informed that, since we had spent the night at 

        19        that location we couldn't remain there during the day. 

        20   JUDGE RAMAROSON: That is not very clear.  Was this before you 

        21        and Gateyiteyi left that you got to know that members of 

        22        Gateyiteyi's family had come to seek refuge at the 

        23        convent?  Is that yes or no?  Was it before or after? 

        24   THE WITNESS: We were told about that before we left the 

        25        convent. 

        26   JUDGE RAMAROSON: So, had Gateyiteyi gone to see members of 

        27        his family which was in the building across the street? 

        28   THE WITNESS: Actually, at that location there was the convent 

        29        and the health centre, and the nun who came to tell us 

        30        about this came from the convent.  So, Gateyiteyi rushed

         1        back home to see whether, before leaving, members of his 

         2        family had locked up the house.

         3   JUDGE RAMAROSON: You are not answering my question.  I am 

         4        saying, did Gateyiteyi go to see members of his family 

         5        who were opposite and asked them why they left the 

         6        compound? 

         7   THE WITNESS: Gateyiteyi didn't immediately go to see members 

         8        of his family, as you seem to believe.  After having 

         9        learnt that members of his family were at the convent, 

        10        rather, he decided to go and see how the house had been 

        11        left because he was himself thinking of coming back to 

        12        the convent.

        13   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But he knew very well the risk he was 

        14        running, why did he insist on going back to his house 

        15        and come back to the convent, whereas the whole of his 

        16        family was already at the convent at the time? 

        17   THE WITNESS: While we were at that place, Gateyiteyi and 

        18        myself, the killings had not yet started.  We were 

        19        simply hearing explosions coming from far off, and no 

        20        one knew that killings were taking place because we 

        21        hadn't been informed of any killing whatsoever. 

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: My next question is this:  When you met the 

        23        nun who asked you to accompany her to distribute 

        24        biscuits to the children, when was that exactly?  Where 

        25        was that?  Was it at Gateyiteyi's -- was it close to 

        26        Gateyiteyi's house? 

        27   THE WITNESS: I have told you that I met this nun in front of 

        28        the convent and that was after Gateyiteyi had been shot 

        29        at and I was going back to the convent. 

        30   JUDGE RAMAROSON: My last question is rather a clarification

         1        I am seeking.  Were there Tutsi refugees in the church, 

         2        or were they only at the convent? 

         3   THE WITNESS: There were no refugees in the church.  All the 

         4        refugees were gathered around the convent. 

         5   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you.

         6   THE WITNESS: I also wish to thank you. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Judge Maqutu has questions to ask. 

         8   JUDGE MAQUTU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  

         9        

        10        It has been brought to our attention that Munyemvano's 

        11        compound was a refuge, an appointed refuge of Tutsis 

        12        near the parish.  Do you know of that? 

        13   THE WITNESS: The Tutsis only went to hide in Munyemvano's 

        14        compound in 1993, at the time when the bourgmestre had 

        15        asked for people to provide protection to these Tutsis 

        16        since there were people who wanted to cause prejudice to 

        17        their security and safety.

        18   JUDGE MAQUTU: Yes, in 1993.  Now, how many people lived in 

        19        Munyemvano's compound for their security, approximately? 

        20   THE WITNESS: It is true that there were some Tutsi families 

        21        at Munyemvano's, but I cannot give you the number of the 

        22        people there, because I never went to Munyemvano's house 

        23        in order to count those family members.

        24   JUDGE MAQUTU: You are not in a position to make an estimate?

        25   THE WITNESS: If I were to make an estimate, I would say that 

        26        they wouldn't have been more than 30 people at 

        27        Munyemvano's compound.

        28   JUDGE MAQUTU: During cross-examination, you said Manjeri 

        29        cellule is where Munyemvano's compound is.  Now, could 

        30        these be among the Tutsis that were running to the nuns'

         1        convent? 

         2   THE WITNESS: When someone talks to you about cellule, you 

         3        need to understand that a cellule is a place which is 

         4        more or less big and Tutsis who went to the parish after 

         5        we ourselves had left the parish, these Tutsis came from 

         6        in Manjeri cellule.

         7   JUDGE MAQUTU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Judges.  I just have one question.  

         9        

        10        In 1994, to which ethnic group did you belong to, 

        11        Witness RHU25?

        12   THE WITNESS: Thank you very much, Mr. President.  In 1994, I 

        13        belonged to the Hutu ethnic group, and I am still the 

        14        same today. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Witness.  

        16        

        17        Now, Interpreter, could you please tell Witness --

        18        We take it that even if there may be exhibits, perhaps 

        19        at a later stage, the witness would not be required.  Is 

        20        that the position?

        21   MR. FLEMING: Sorry, Your Honour, we will be seeking to tender 

        22        the statement in the traditional way. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, that is the position with regard to the 

        24        presence of the witness, that is what we are addressing.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: I know, Your Honour.  No opposition.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Thank you, Counsel.

        27             

        28        Interpreter, could you please tell Witness RHU25, this 

        29        marks the end of his testimony and we thank him.  We 

        30        shall have time at a later stage to consider and review

         2        going to be adduced in the course of this trial.  But 

         3        once again, we thank him. 

         4   THE WITNESS: I also wish to thank you very much, 

         5        Mr. President. 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: And he may leave after the curtains have been 

         7        drawn. 

         8   THE WITNESS: Thank you.  

         9        (Witness excused)

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, who will be your next 

        11        witness?  Maybe perhaps as a precautionary measure, 

        12        perhaps we can have an alternative or alternatives.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am glad, Your Honour, that you have 

        14        mentioned it, because I was just about to discuss this.  

        15        Our next witness is MEM.  

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: M -- oh, okay  

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: That was the witness who was scheduled 

        18        before this witness.  To the best of my knowledge, he is 

        19        all right, there is no problem.  We'll have a backup 

        20        witness just in case, RHU27.  But there is a matter that 

        21        was just brought to my attention and I would like to 

        22        make application to the Prosecutor's side of taking a 

        23        possible witness out of turn.  

        24        

        25        We have -- we were told that we have five witnesses 

        26        coming in this weekend some time.  One of those 

        27        witnesses is from (By order of the Court, this name has 

        28        been extracted and filed under seal) and he has some 

        29        problems.  We need to get him in next week and we would 

        30        like to propose taking him perhaps out of turn when one

         1        of these detained witnesses -- so that we can move him 

         2        out.  I know that the Prosecutor has said that they are 

         3        willing to accommodate us in that regard.  I don't know 

         4        if that gesture is extended to this witness. 

         5   MR. FLEMING: I still don't know which witness he is talking 

         6        about, Your Honour.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe you can --

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, we'll let him know the name.  In fact, 

         9        I don't have a pseudonym name right now myself.  I was 

        10        just told that there was a problem with a witness from 

        11        (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and 

        12        filed under seal)

        13   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, there remains another issue with 

        14        some of these witnesses.  My learned friend told us that 

        15        he doesn't have statements from a number of the 

        16        witnesses.  I think we have statements from the next 

        17        couple of witnesses but that is about all.  Is this one 

        18        of the witnesses from whom he doesn't have a statement?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct.  We do not have statements 

        20        in this trial, anyone other than the alibi -- the six 

        21        alibi witnesses and witnesses from Rwanda.  We took no 

        22        statements from any other witness. 

        23   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we are in the dark, then, and we 

        24        don't know apart from the very brief outline in the 

        25        pre-trial brief what any of these witnesses are going to 

        26        say, indeed, even with the statement.  As Your Honour 

        27        will see when you get, for example, the last statement 

        28        tendered, there is scant material even in the statement.  

        29        So much more was led in evidence than that which we had 

        30        knowledge from the last witness.  Now, we won't allow

         1        that to stop the matter progressing, but we do at least, 

         2        for the benefit of any material that they have, no doubt 

         3        my learned friend is saying, when we took notes 

         4        ourselves and that's counsel's work and you are not 

         5        entitled to see that but that's going to be led in 

         6        evidence.  So, we are ignorant of who these witnesses 

         7        are and what they are going to say substantially. 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, let me just deal with the last 

         9        issue first.  And I am making this representation to the 

        10        Court that the last witness who was on the stand, I met 

        11        with this -- him and about four or five people at the 

        12        place where he was located, I was probably with him for 

        13        about 30, 35 minutes dealing the translator and so on.  

        14        

        15        My main concern with that witness was, as he said, with 

        16        respect to one issue.  For the first time I talked to 

        17        him more extensively and found out that he may have 

        18        information that will be helpful not just to us but just 

        19        so that everyone would know what was happening.  This is 

        20        the first witness who, in fact, was able to go to a 

        21        photograph and show us what happened in a locale.  I 

        22        thought that that was extremely important that we have 

        23        that full picture beyond the essence of what I initially 

        24        talked to him about.  And so, that is what I got then.

        25        

        26        Now, based upon my interviews with all the other 

        27        witnesses, we, as we were obligated to do, set forth the 

        28        summary substance of what they would testify about in 

        29        our pre-trial brief.  But I have taken no statement.  

        30        Nuns' of the witnesses, in fact signed any statements

         1        and so, therefore, we have nothing to turn over. 

         2        

         3        Now, I intend to prepare those witnesses.  I prepare to 

         4        sit down with them and talk to them and find out what 

         5        they have to say beyond what the summary that we have 

         6        submitted and what I suspect that they would have to say 

         7        which is relevant and material.  Beyond that, we do not 

         8        have any statements of these witnesses.  

         9        

        10        Now the request that we are making is to take one of the 

        11        witnesses out of turn.  If the Prosecutor says no, then 

        12        we accept that, but the situation is going to be no 

        13        different with respect to any of those witnesses except 

        14        those that we have statements for.  But if he does not 

        15        want to accommodate us, we will stick with what we have. 

        16   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we are not saying we won't 

        17        accommodate him.  We are saying that if he knows what 

        18        the witness is going to say, we would like to know as 

        19        well.  I presume he does know what the witness is going 

        20        to say, otherwise he wouldn't have gone to the trouble 

        21        and expense of bringing the witness here.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: What I know, you know, and that is in the 

        23        summary. 

        24   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, before you finish deliberating, the 

        25        only thing that we've ever had in respect of the 

        26        witnesses, is the pseudonym and the name.  We have no 

        27        other particulars.  We don't know where they live, we 

        28        don't know where they come from; we don't know where 

        29        they lived then.  Nothing at all.  Just a pseudonym and 

        30        then a name, and that is all.  And that is what we've

         1        been working with all the time from this Defence 

         2        Counsel.  We just want to know a bit more. 

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we had 11 witnesses from the 

         4        Prosecutor, they didn't give us any more information 

         5        except the statement, the identity of and the names of 

         6        the individuals within the context of their statements.  

         7        We had no addresses, phone numbers, nothing.  So, I 

         8        don't know what they are saying that they are entitled 

         9        to that we have not given them.  We have given them the 

        10        identity of the individuals.  I don't know, perhaps 

        11        Mr. Fleming could take a look at what was submitted to 

        12        us as a disclosure statement, and maybe if there is 

        13        something more that we can give him concerning their 

        14        identities and what they provided us, we are prepared to 

        15        do that.  We have given the names of the individuals.  

        16        We have given the date when the statement was taken.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  I think we are not going to go into the 

        18        specifics of what may be contained in the statement, but 

        19        suffice it to say and observe that it is true, there may 

        20        be situations where statements are not made or were not 

        21        recorded and what-have-you, and you go by the summary in 

        22        terms of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, but we 

        23        would expect if it was not done in the past, but I think 

        24        in future and even from now, that if you are going by 

        25        summary, the summary should be adequate to give an 

        26        indication of what the evidence of a particular witness 

        27        would be, because it is true, I think it is a fact, 

        28        disclosure is an essence, an essential essence -- is an 

        29        important element in the administration and the search 

        30        for justice.  So we wouldn't go into the specifics as to

         1        what needs to be contained.  These are matters that can 

         2        be worked out.  I think it is the principles that 

         3        underline the disclosure aspect must always be borne in 

         4        mind.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we feel that we have complied 

         6        with that.  We have indicated, one; what the witnesses 

         7        will say, whom they are going to contradict, what 

         8        specific facts we are dealing with.  I mean, that is 

         9        more than I get in trying cases in the United States.  I 

        10        have given the Prosecutor the names of the witnesses, 

        11        what Prosecution witnesses we are in fact contradicting, 

        12        a summary of their statement with respect to what they 

        13        will be saying.  And that is what --

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, as we said, we are not going to -- 

        15        there is no specific aspect, you are not going into 

        16        specifics.  But you must remember the -- bear in mind 

        17        the provisions of Rule 73bis and ter with regard to 

        18        disclosure aspect and that is what is supposed to be 

        19        borne in mind.  And since there is no specific aspect, 

        20        we can only make these general comments, and we assume 

        21        and we expect that Counsel, both as officers of the 

        22        Court, would be able to look into these aspects as we go 

        23        along.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: We think that we are complying, Your Honour.  

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: We will adjourn these proceedings to Monday.  

        26        But before we do that, perhaps is that -- it is 

        27        important because we have a number of witnesses standing 

        28        by now to have possible alternatives.  So, this could 

        29        always be worked out by the parties, so that should 

        30        anything happen to a particular witness, a stand-by

         1        witness is able to take the stand.  We are already 

         2        behind the schedule, going by the list of witnesses that 

         3        have been made available by the witness protection unit. 

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am conscious of this.  I am 

         5        trying to -- if they will accommodate us, we will move.  

         6        If they don't accommodate us, we are stuck and we move, 

         7        however.  I mean, I am not the one who is the fly in the 

         8        ointment.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  We will adjourn these 

        10        proceedings to nine on Monday in the morning.  Until 

        11        then, these proceedings stand adjourned.
