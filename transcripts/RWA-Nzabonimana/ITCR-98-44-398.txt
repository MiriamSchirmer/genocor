P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 1st of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Appearances on the Prosecution side are the same, yes?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, they are, Your Honour.

There's a couple of housekeeping matters that I'd like to address, but I can do that once the witness is off the stand and shouldn't take more than two or three minutes, if the Court -- there's an email -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Let me take the appearances from the Defence please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think there might be a slight difference to report. 
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  

I am Counsel Moussa Felix Sow.  I'm taking over the witness, and I take advantage of this moment to extend my best wishes to yourself, Mr. President, and to all those who are here, even though belatedly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow, and your greetings are reciprocated. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  

Chantal Hounkpatin is my name.  I just returned to follow up this session, given that my counsel, Frédéric Weyl, is absent today.  

Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you and welcome back.  

And for Mr. Nzirorera, the appearances remain the same. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  There's an email correspondence between myself and Mr. Robinson that I wanted to be part of the record.  And I have a printout with me this morning and I would like to have it admitted as a Prosecution exhibit.  Then there's an interview note of Witness GNK that I used when I was cross-examining the last witness, and I would like it to be given an IP number.  And then there's the document that Mr. Robinson was trying to get into evidence, which is a consent form, which I think should be identified for the record with either an IP number or a D. NZ ID number.  

So two documents to be marked for identification and one document to be admitted into evidence, and I have discussed this with Mr. Robinson already.  It was his application.  So I didn't raise it with the other Defence teams, but I don't think there's any controversy with this application. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  

As far as the email correspondence, I have no objection to it being marked as an exhibit for the Prosecution and admitted.  

With respect to the interview note of the witness we interviewed in Ruhengeri prison, I have no objection to that being marked for identification as an IP document.  With respect to the WVSS forms and the Witness GAP's consent or preference not to be interviewed by the Prosecution, I believe -- I still really believe those things should be admitted as exhibits and I'd ask you to reconsider that because really those documents are something that were referred to by Witness Munyeshuli.  He identified the witness's signature, and I think that those ought to be admitted as an exhibit.  But failing that, I accept that it can be marked for identification as ID. NZ.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
 
We grant the Prosecutor's application to have the correspondence admitted as an exhibit and we mark the other two documents for identification.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 419 admitted)
(Exhibit P ID. 55, marked for identification)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
With regard to the WVSS documents, we will continue to reconsider.  We have not made a final decision yet.  But as of now, we will mark them for identification. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to clarify the record, Your Honour, the Court characterised them as WVSS documents, and that's where the point of contention arises because, as I view them, they are documents produced by the Nzirorera Defence team and not WVSS.  

So Mr. Robinson and I are already in conversation to obtain WVSS forms so that we can compare them and have both admitted.  So maybe at a later stage, we can spare the Court a reconsideration by consenting to admitting both, both the Defence documents and those that originate from WVSS.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that clarification and we can -- it will be some time before making a final decision.

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We welcome you to the stand and we have to allow you to take an oath to tell the truth before you can testify.  And the registrar will assist you to do that now. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
(Declaration made by Kim Hughes in English) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Mr. Robinson, you'll take this witness now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.
Mr. President, the witness before you is named Kim Hughes.  He's an expert witness.  And the 
first order of business will be, pursuant to your decision on the voir dire of Kim Hughes dated the 
7th of January 2010, to determine whether or not he would be allowed to give his expert opinion before the Chamber.  

So I propose to ask him a few questions at this stage, only concerning his expertise, to yield the floor to the Prosection for cross-examination on that issue and any other questions by colleagues on the Defence or the Chamber and then ask you to make a decision that he can be qualified as an expert and his testimony can be admitted.  

So if that's in accordance with what you had in mind, I can proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  That was in fact what we anticipated would happen, and you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.

If the witness's curriculum vitae can be placed before him. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the interpreters be provided with the document, Mr. President?
KIM HUGHES,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF ON VOIR DIRE 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Mr. Hughes, you and I are going to be speaking the same language in this courtroom and that can sometimes cause problems for the interpreters, so we're going to try to make a pause between my question and your answer and your answer and my next question.
A.	Yeah, I understand that. 
Q.	I'll probably be the worst offender of that rule, but I'm going to try anyway. 

First of all, my first question to you is whether or not you recognise the document that's been placed in front of you.
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	And what is it? 
A.	It's my curriculum vitae. 
Q.	And does it detail your education and experience in the field of document examination? 
A.	Yes, it shows that quite neatly. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ724. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.

Mr. President, I'm informed that that should be admitted as D. NZ725, as another exhibit has been admitted in the meantime pursuant to a decision of the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We order the adjusted numbering.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ725 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Hughes, can you tell the Trial Chamber what is your educational background? 
A.	I have a first-class honours' bachelor of science in chemistry which I obtained at Queen Mary College in London in 1975. 
Q.	After obtaining that degree, what work -- what did you do for employment? 
A.	Straightaway from leaving university, I joined the Home Office in the United Kingdom and started to train as a document examiner. 
Q.	Could you just tell us what the Home Office is? 
A.	The Home Office is a part of the government in London which is largely concerned with matters within the UK, such as policing, et cetera. 
Q.	How long did you work for the Home Office as a forensic document examiner? 
A.	Between 16 and 17 years. 
Q.	And what did you do after that? 
A.	With a number of my colleagues from -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Will Counsel Robinson slow down in the interests of the French booth, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  I already forgot my behaviour.  Sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So if you could tell us what you did after leaving the Home Office. 
A.	With a number of my colleagues from a particular section within the forensic science service in the Home Office, we formed our own business to look at matters involving questioned documents. 
Q.	And how long have you been doing that? 
A.	Since 1992. 
Q.	Now, in the course of your work for both the Home Office and as a private document examiner, have you had the opportunity to examine documents to determine whether or not they were written on the same type of paper? 
A.	That is part of the work we had to undertake on a regular basis. 
Q.	And have you also had occasion to do comparison of ink on various documents to determine whether or not the same type of ink wells are used? 
A.	Yes, again, that is the type of case that we encounter quite regularly. 
Q.	And finally with respect to the tear or edges of a particular document, have you had experience in comparing whether or not the tear on two documents came from -- were once -- were once together as one? 
A.	That is not the type of case that you see on a week-to-week basis, but I have examined cases of that type a number of times during my working life. 
Q.	Now,have you also testified in court as an expert witness before? 
A.	I cannot tell you an exact figure, but I would estimate that I have probably testified over 300 times in the United Kingdom during my working life. 
Q.	And have you also been engaged as a forensic document examiner for any international tribunals? 
A.	I have done other work for the United Nations before. 
Q.	Which particular part of the United Nations? 
A.	I was instructed by the people in The Hague to do some work for war crimes concerning the 
	former Yugoslavia. 
Q.	Have you also done document examination in the Lockerbie case? 
A.	I would imagine that the Court would be familiar with the Lockerbie bombing where the Pan Am flight was bombed over Scotland.  Within the last 18 months, I was instructed to assist the Defence in Mr. Megrahi's appeal against conviction and I spent, not every working day, but perhaps two to three days a week for a period of six months approximately working on that case leading up to his appeal, which, as again as you may realise, he dropped at the last minute.  But I was instructed by the Defence in this case. 
Q.	Okay.  Now turning from your personal expertise to the particular kinds of work that you have done in this case, I would like you to tell the Chamber what it is about examination of the type of paper, the type of ink and the edges of paper that you were able to do that a layperson couldn't do.  That would assist the Chamber in coming to a determination about these documents.  
A.	Simply, a layperson would just have his eyes to look at the document perhaps in a room similar to what we sit in today.  I have had the opportunity in this case to look at the documents, not only with my eyes, but using sophisticated scientific equipment which is not available to the layman, for example, a good microscope to look at the edges of the paper, to look at the colour and the form of the inks actually on a page.  I've also had equipment which assists in differentiating inks which uses infrared light obviously not available to the layman.  

Part of my examination was to look for indented impressions of handwriting on documents.  What I mean by indented impressions is if you write with a pen on a pad of paper and apply some pressure with the pen to the paper, you will almost certainly disturb the paper fibres on the page below.  And that disturbance is what we normally call indented impressions of handwriting.  And I've had equipment to look for evidence of such impressions which is not available to the layman. 
Q.	And in addition to equipment, do you have yourself a body of knowledge that helps you determine paper type, ink type and edges of document that a layman doesn't have? 
A.	Obviously, yes.  I have 34 years' experience as a forensic scientist.  Those examination types crop up regularly in case work, so I have the experience of looking for evidence of that type, how to find useful evidence in case work.  Also, I think crucially, while the layman may be able to find some evidence that I can see with my eyes, I have the experience of knowing how to correctly interpret the evidence that I see and, perhaps crucially, not how to misinterpret evidence. 
Q.	And do you have a body of knowledge about the manufacture of ink and the manufacture of paper that the rest of us don't have? 
A.	I do have some knowledge of that, yes.  In particular, I have the knowledge that papers, whilst manufactured in large bulk, do differ from one manufacturer to another.  And similarly inks, whilst obviously manufactured by many companies, each company will use a slightly different mixture of coloured dyes when they produce an ink.  And that tells me, whilst it may not be possible to differentiate between pens that are manufactured by one particular manufacturer, it is usually possible to differentiate between inks that are produced by different manufacturers. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Hughes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't have any further questions at this time on his qualifications. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Do any of the other Defence teams wish to put any questions to this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I don't have any questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
No questions, Mr. President. 
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning to the Court.  Good morning to the parties.  

Mr. President, we have a few questions for the witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION ON VOIR DIRE 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Hughes.  
A.	Good morning, sir. 
Q.	My name is Takeh Sendze.  And I'm Prosecutor and I'll be asking you just a few questions.  

Now, I understand that you've examined quite a lot of documents in your professional life, is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.  I've not counted but I've done a considerable number of cases in my 34 years. 
Q.	Where did most of the documents that you examined originate? 
A.	In my life, within the Home Office, the vast bulk of the documents that I would examine would have been presented to me by police forces in the United Kingdom, and the case work would have been involved in criminal trials.  

When I became part of the private company, Document Evidence Limited, still the large majority of my work would be to examine cases submitted by police forces in criminal trials, but also then my 
case work expanded in that our company would look at cases sent in to us by defence lawyers in criminal trials and also examinations in civil litigation.  

Now, in the latter category, those cases may come from lawyers, possibly from banks, from companies, basically anyone who wished to use our services. 
Q.	So most of the documents that you examined originated from the continent, which is Europe.  
A.	They would almost exclusively be from the United Kingdom, albeit I have over the last 15 years done a reasonable amount of work from Ireland. 
Q.	And you were examining them to determine the irregularities as it relates to the regular course of business or the regular manner in which documents are produced? 
A.	The vast majority of my work is to examine handwritings and signatures to determine authorship, to look at inks, to look at papers, to look at indented impressions of handwriting, to look at 
	counterfeit documents, basically to test a theory proposed to me by those instructing me as to whether the documents were potentially genuine or false. 
Q.	Have you visited a Rwandan prison before? 
A.	I have never been to a Rwandan prison. 
Q.	You're therefore not familiar with the manner in which documents are produced in the Rwandan prison? 
A.	I would have no knowledge of that. 
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Any redirect, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, at this time I request that Mr. Hughes be accepted as an expert and be allowed to give his testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any submissions on the Prosecution side?  
MR. SENDZE:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Yes, we are satisfied on the evidence, and there being no submissions in opposition, we declare that the witness can testify as an expert. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, before commencing the substantive testimony, I just want to make some introductory remarks because we're going a little bit out of order here.  We've sort of abandoned our Ruhengeri part of our Defence case for the moment and interrupted it to go back to evidence relating to events in Kabuye.  And in particular I ask the Chamber to recall the testimony of Witness BDW and Witness BDW when he testified as a witness for the Prosecution and produced two documents which he claimed he had written while in Rwanda and before he had gone to the Ruhengeri prison where we claim he fabricated, or got the idea to fabricate, evidence against Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera.  

So the first document that he produced was marked as Exhibit D. NZ445.  It's a three-page document.  And that's the first document that we're going to be discussing today.  It's the position of the Defence that the second and third pages of that document, which refer to Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Karemera, were added later by the witness.

The witness then produced a second document in order to show that he sometimes used different types of paper when submitting documents to the Rwandan authorities.  And that's a four-page document.  That's Exhibit D. NZ463.  The third page of that is on lined paper.  And it's -- it was our position that the witness had likewise substituted that page in an effort to falsely convince the Chamber that he had written documents on plain and lined paper within the same document.  And so we'll be discussing 
D. NZ463, and in particular page 3.  

So with that background I'll now ask that the witness be shown his report that he submitted now, dated the 21st of October 2008.  

And I have a copy if Mr. Issa needs one.

Mr. President, this report was filed on the 30th of October 2008 as part of the Nzirorera filing of the statement of expert witness Kim Hughes.  And I alerted the registrar that we would be using -- and the parties that we would be using this report during the testimony today. 
KIM HUGHES,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Hughes, do you have that document in front of you now? 
A.	I have a copy of the report.
Q.	Okay.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And maybe Issa can put the document that I've just handed to him in front, so there's no confusion. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you recognise that document? 
A.	I do, indeed. 
Q.	And what is that? 
A.	That is a copy of the report that I submitted to Mr. Robinson's team in October of 2008. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I ask that the document be admitted as D. NZ726. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ726 admitted)

MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Hughes, we're going to talk first about document D. NZ445.  And, first, I would like to ask you whether or not you examined Exhibit D. NZ455 to determine whether the same type of paper was used on all three papers. 
A.	Yes, I made that type of examination.
Q.	And what was your conclusion? 
A.	I found that you have two different types of paper that have been used to manufacture that item. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us between pages 1, 2 and 3 which paper is different and which is the same? 
A.	Page 1 is on its own.  It is a plain sheet of paper.  Page 2 and page 3 are different to page 1 in that they are lined sheets of paper, and page 2 and page 3 are indistinguishable from one another. 
Q.	What observations did you make with respect to pages 2 and 3 to determine that they're indistinguishable? 
A.	I made a number of examinations of those pages.  They are examinations that do not destroy the page in anyway.  I would have measured the size of the paper and, as you will see, they were approximately four identified pages.  I would have looked at the colour of the paper by eye and also microscopically.  I would have looked to see if there was any watermark in the paper, the watermark being in the manufacture of the paper.  There is no watermark in the paper in this particular instance.  It would be rare to find notepaper that did have a watermark in it.  

Having said that, I would look at the paper with light shining through the paper, not just for the watermark but to see the visual effect of what the paper looked like with transmitted light.  I measured the thickness of the paper.  I also looked at the reaction of the paper when placed under ultraviolet light.  And as on the two pages with lines, when we have lines on the page, I would look to see that the distance between the lines was similar between the pages and also look at the colour of the ink used to make the lines.  

And having done all of those tests on pages 2 and 3 in D. NZ445, I was not able to distinguish between the pages.  I found them to be similar. 
Q.	Now, did you also examine the inks used on page 1 of D. NZ445, and pages 2 and 3? 
A.	Yes, I did various types of examination of the ink, first of all, just a look with the eye at a distance.  Clearly, if you have black ink and you have blue ink, you have different pens, but here we have blue ink written with a ballpoint pen.  

I would then examine the inks using a low-power microscope, firstly, to look at the colour.  Sometimes when you look at inks at a distance they may appear the same.  When you look under a microscope and you're looking far more closely at the ink, you can see colour differences.  

Also by using a microscope, you can look for imperfections in the pen line.  Some ballpoint pens when you write with them give a very solid ink line onto the page with no imperfections.  Some ballpoint pens do show imperfections.  So you can sometimes potentially differentiate between two pens of exactly the same manufacture which contain the same type of ink, if one pen is working correctly and one pen shows imperfections.  

Having looked at the inks in that way, I would then move on to looking at the inks using a machine called a Projectina which uses infrared light to attempt to differentiate between inks and there are two different types of technique that that machine employs.  So for both of those techniques I would look at the inks to see again if they were similar or if they were in fact different. 
Q.	And what was your conclusion with respect to D. NZ445? 
A.	On that particular item there were two inks.  The ink on page 1 of 445 was different to the inks on 
	pages 2 and 3.  However, the inks on pages 2 and 3, using all the tests that I utilised, I could not differentiate between the inks. 
Q.	Now, does that mean that they were written with the same pen? 
A.	What it means is that the ink on page 1 was clearly written with a different pen to the ink on 
	pages 2 and 3.  Now, as to whether or not pages 2 and 3 were written with the same pen, it is not possible to say.  Certainly the evidence is consistent with that being the case.  But as pens, such as the one I have here, are manufactured in large numbers and it would be -- if there are no imperfections in the ink line on the page, it would be impossible to tell between this pen and any other manufactured at the same time within a company, as the inks are similar on pages 2 and 3, it may be that two different pens of corresponding manufacture were used.  

So the ink is similar on those two pages.  Whether it is the same pen or two identical pens, it is impossible to say. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that these two pages, pages 2 and 3, appear to be the same type of paper and the same type of ink as each other but different than page 1.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Is there any way to tell of the time a document has been prepared or written? 
A.	As a forensic scientist and a document examiner, it would be marvellous if we could pick up a 
	piece of paper, perhaps put it under a machine, press a button and tell a court such as this, or a police officer, that a particular document was written at a particular time on a particular day, but there is no machine available to forensic science that can do that.  We cannot correctly date ink on a page.  And it is largely impossible to say exactly when a document came into being.  
It may be possible sometimes to say that a document could not have been manufactured at a particular time.  And to give you an extreme example of that, if the Court gave me a piece of paper today, a document dated 1910, for example, and it was written in ballpoint pen, I could say to the Court that is not possible.  Ballpoint pens did not come into existence until the end of the Second World War in the 1940s.  So clearly a document written in ballpoint pen dated 1910 could not exist.  So I could say that document was false, but what I could not say is exactly when that document was written. 
Q.	Now with respect to D. NZ445, as another point of circumstantial evidence concerning the difference between pages 1 and 2 and 3, did I ask you to look at the letter, the subject line of the first page and the reference to "1993" to determine whether or not that had been written at a different time than the rest or with a different ink than the rest of page 1? 
A.	There is a reference towards the top of page 1 of 445, which -- I'm sorry.  I can't read the language.  But clearly you have a date "1993".  An examination of the inks of the entries associated directly with that date, 1993, in comparison to -- with the ink in what I could call the main body of the document, it is clear that the 1993 entry is different to the inks around it to that of the main body of the document.  

The interpretation of that is that obviously you have a different pen that has been used to write that 1993 entry and it must have been added into the main text of the document with a different pen at some point after the main body of the document was written.  So it's written out of sequence with the entries around it.  

Now again I can say it is out of sequence because it is with a different pen.  What I cannot tell the Court is how long after the main body of the document was written the 1993 entry was added to the document. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And now I want to turn to Exhibit D. NZ463, where it was our contention that page 3 had differences with the other pages.  And I want to ask you, first of all, if you examined the four -- the type of paper used in D. NZ463 and were able to make any conclusions with respect to that.  
A.	Yes, I examined the paper of the four pages in D. NZ463.  Firstly, page 1 is on a type of paper that is different to pages 2, 3 and 4.  And also page 1, the paper is different to the pages within D. NZ445.  That piece of paper is, within the documents I examined, unique.  It is the only piece of paper of that type.  

Page 2 of 463 is on paper different to page 1 and page 3 -- I'm sorry -- but a similar type of paper to page 4.  So page 2 and page 4 are on similar paper.  And again those papers are different to all of the other papers in the items that I have examined.  

Page 3 is on the same type of paper that you have for D. NZ445, pages 2 and 3.  It is lined paper.  So you have a correspondence there between that particular piece of paper and the latter two pages of 
D. NZ445.  Excuse me.  

Continuing on from just looking at the basics of the paper, in my examination it was noticeable that on that type of paper, the lined sheet of paper, the edge of one side of the paper had obviously been torn from another sheet.  And it would appear to me that what you have is perhaps a book of paper where you have sheets that are obviously folded over and these sheets have been torn from the middle along the spine of the book.  Now, that is different to the other pages in 445 and 463 where they're clearly single sheets of paper, not pages from a book.  

Having noted that you have torn edges on the pages, the next part of my examination was to compare those edges together to see if potentially any two of those pages wanted to form part of a larger sheet of paper, the one piece of paper within the book.  And I found that the torn edges on 445, page 3, and 463, page 3, corresponded closely.  In my opinion, they were once part of the same sheet of paper. 
Q.	Okay.  Staying within the document 463 for the moment, and comparing the four pieces of paper in that document, there was one lined sheet of paper, and that was page 3; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, did page 3 differ from the other three pages with respect to the type of ink that was used? 
A.	The inks on this document, first of all, on page 3 you have an ink which is different to any of the other inks used on the pages in 445 and 463.  So, again, that really is consistent with the paper.  The paper is different to everything else.  The ink is different to everything else.  

On pages 2 and 4 in 463, if you recall, we have the same type of paper.  Again, we have the same type of ink on those two documents.  I was unable to distinguish between the inks that were used.  

That leaves us with the lined page, 463.  Now, there were two types of inks in the main on that document.  It would appear that the documents were started with a particular blue ballpoint pen and at some point on the page, I think it's approximately two thirds of the way down on -- around the word, I think it's called Bacala (phonetic), it is clear that shortly after that the pen begins to fail.  The ink is running out.  It won't write anymore and the writer has had to switch pens to continue the text on the page.  

So the top part of the page you have one ink and then approximately for a third of the page you have a second different ink.  And that second different ink, I could not differentiate between that ink and the inks on pages 2 and 3 of D. NZ445. 
Q.	Okay.  Staying within document 463, we're going to compare this with 445 in a minute, but I just want to have the Judges understand the integrity of the document itself, 463.  There's four pages.  And page 3 is different than pages 1, 2 and 4 because it is obviously on lined paper and it's different paper; correct?  
A.	It has different paper and also the inks on that page do not correspond with the inks elsewhere in 
	pages 1, 2 and 4. 
Q.	Okay.  So now we've looked at document 445 and document 463.  Now I want to ask you about what I consider the suspect pages on both documents, which are pages 2 and 3 of 445 and page 3 of 463.  Now, first of all, are all three of those pages on lined paper? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And were you able to find anything to distinguish between pages 1 and 2 of 44 -- 2 and 3 of 445 and page 3 of 463 and determine the type of paper? 
A.	No, I've already told the Court the type of examinations I carried out on the paper:  Size, colour, reaction to ultraviolet light, et cetera.  Having tested those three pages together with all of those different tests, I could not distinguish between them.  So the evidence is consistent with them being of exactly the same manufacture. 
Q.	And then you told us that those pages were -- looked as though they had been taken out of a book; correct?  
A.	It looks to me, because you have the tear down the centre of the page, and it looks like a tear that is pretty well parallel to the edges, that it's been something that has been torn from the spine of a book, rather than being a big A5 sheet where someone would perhaps grasp it in the middle and rip.  Perhaps if that was the case you wouldn't expect a parallel tear.  It looks to me as they've probably at some point been part of a book where pages are folded in the middle and the book is composed of pages of that type. 
Q.	And then you told us that you matched page 3 from Exhibit 445 with page 3 from 463, and when you put them together they fit exactly, so you could determine that they had once been joined together in the same book; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  You have a torn edge along the edges of the two pages, and it's not a perfect straight line.  It's as you would expect if you tear a page in the centre of the book, that if I perhaps -- not exactly the right shape, but it is imperfect.  It's like a zigzag almost shape in parts.  When you put the two bits of paper together, you can see the edge of one page fits exactly against the edge of the other.  And I interpret that in meaning that they -- that those two pages, and conveniently for the Court, for you to remember there, that page 3 of both of those items -- that they were once part of the same sheet of paper. 
Q.	Now, these two documents are dated two months apart from each other.  Is - now, is there any way for you to tell whether or not these three pages we suspect might have been added to the documents were written at the same time as each other? 
A.	As I have said already, it's impossible to date the documents exactly.  So I can't say that they were all written out within moments of one another, but clearly they are the same paper, and after the pen has changed part-way down page 3 of 463, the ink that is used at the bottom of the page is the same as the ink that is used on page 2 and page 3 of item D. NZ445.  

Now, again to be fair, I can only say that the ink is similar.  By using all the techniques I have applied, I cannot differentiate between the inks at all.  It could be that the same pen was used for the bottom half of 463, page 3, and the two pages on 445 with possibly two pens of exactly the same manufacture may have been used.  I can't differentiate between those two possibilities. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I have no further questions, Mr. President.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Any of the Defence teams have any questions to put to this witness?  

The answer is no, I think.

Mr. Prosecutor.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Greetings again, Mr. Witness.  

Now, you have told the Court extensively about differences in inks and paper types constituting a particular document.  

Now what I want to find out from you is in your regular course of business when you are drafting probably a manuscript for a report, expert report, you normally have sheets of paper available at your disposal?  
A.	I would have sheets of paper, and my recollection is at the time I examined this particular case I would have written down a report on those sheets of paper which would then be handed to a secretary who would type the report.  But the type of paper that we would use in doing that at our laboratory would be paper that would be bound into a pad of paper.  They would not be loose sheets of paper. 
Q.	Would you imagine that this would also be a case in a prison cell? 
A.	I've no idea what type of paper may be available to people within a prison cell.  It has been suggested to me by the people who instruct me that loose sheets of paper were available in the prison cell and that there would be several types of paper.  I cannot disagree with that.  I have no knowledge of what might be going on within a prison cell. 
Q.	So we'd agree, therefore, that the mere fact that a document is drafted on two or three different types of paper, given the circumstances under which they were drafted, in a prison in this case, you cannot say with certainty that the documents were not created at the same time or together.  
A.	As I've said several times, it's impossible for me to see exactly when documents are written, sadly, otherwise we would know the truth in this matter.  If various sheets of paper, different types, were available as loose sheets of paper within a prison cell, well, that's different to my working environment where I work with the same sheet of paper and a pad.  So it may be if someone was writing a long letter, writing a report, a narrative or whatever in a prison cell, it's possible therefore that more than one type of paper could be used within any one set of documents which constituted a whole set of documents.  That's possible. 
Q.	Considering the possibility of scarcity of paper, would it be strange if one had in his possession a double sheet of paper, each side constituting an A4 sheet, for that person to sever the sheets in order to make available to himself two A4 sheets which he can use probably at different times to draft the different documents? 
A.	That's really impossible for me to answer.  I don't know what someone might think of doing within a prison cell.  You may have a book of paper or you might have been given part of a book where a section of the book has been torn from a whole book as two A4 sheets together and that was handed into the prison cell.  Whether someone would think to tear those sheets apart before writing on them or whether someone would write them with the sheets as a whole, it's impossible for me to say. 
Q.	In relation to ink, I suppose that at your office you have at your desk available to you lots of different types of pens that you could use.  
A.	The ink that we would -- or the pens that we would use at the office would normally be the fairly cheap type, exactly the same as the ones that we have -- I have in my hand.  So, largely speaking, when I make my scientific notes I would use blue or black ballpoint ink to make little annotations to the notes.  Things of importance, I would use red or green, as that stands out in colour.  

At any one time there may be several pens of this type on my desk.  There may be similar pens of similar manufacture on other desks.  For example, if I just sit at my normal desk and write notes, I would pick up a pen on that desk.  If I move into the part of the laboratory which has the specialised equipment, there would be other pens within that part of the laboratory.  I wouldn't necessarily carry my pen around with me.  So there are different pens in different parts of the laboratory and it may be that some of those pens have similar ink.  It may be the inks are slightly different.  So potentially we have different pens within the laboratory. 
Q.	So admitting that you could use different pens to draft a particular document, you would agree with me, therefore, that the mere fact of having different inks used to draft the particular document does not really question the authenticity of the document, does it? 
A.	It's difficult to know what you might do if you sat in a prison cell with sheets of paper and you wanted to write a three or a four-page document.  If it was me, and I was sitting and I was drafting the document, even over a period of a few hours, I would probably use the same pen.  There would be no need after page 1 to put the pen down and pick up another pen.  

If I was drafting a document over a longer period of time, perhaps if I wrote page 1 on a Monday, 
page 2 on a Tuesday, page 3 on a Wednesday, et cetera, then between the days obviously the potential is you could pick up a different pen from one day to the next.  

So it's difficult to know exactly what it means when you have, in this case, pens on one page which are different to pens on another.  If the document was written out -- if a four-page document was written out in -- that would take what?  Normally 40 minutes, you would normally expect perhaps the same pen to be used.  If it was written out over a period of days, there is nothing inconsistent with more than one pen being used because at the end of the day you might put a pen down and pick a different one up the following day.  

So it's difficult, pretty well impossible to comment on what it means that you have different pens and different papers in any one particular item there regarding the timing of the document. 
Q.	I appreciate your difficulty.  And I would like to ask if you found yourself in a situation of this sort where you had used different types of paper and different types of ink to draft one particular document, and somebody tried to challenge the authenticity of that document, do you think you would be in the best position to explain the reasons why you used different types of paper and different types of ink? 
A.	If you knew exactly what -- you could remember exactly what you had done in a document written some time ago, and you knew that you had used a particular pen to write on a particular piece of paper and then you changed the following day, and now two hours later to pick up a different pen with different paper, if you could remember that, then you're in a good position to explain to people why the pens are different.  I'm not in that situation.  All I can do is look at the differences in the paper and the inks and report back to the Court with some indication as to what may have happened in the production of these documents. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now let's talk about the insertion of the date 1993 on the first page of D. NZ445.  
A.	Okay.  I have a copy of that in front of me. 
Q.	You agreed at the beginning that you have written quite a -- well, a lot of opinions for courts and police and other authorities.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Has it ever been the case that you drafted your manuscript over the course of many days? 
A.	Normally when I'm writing a report on a case which is ultimately then typed up by a secretary, for the vast majority of cases I would have examined -- I would have written my report over a short period of time perhaps, and in those instances, perhaps almost certainly, with the same pen.  

A lot of cases that I examine are fairly short and the report would be three or four pages, at most.  It's possible that I could have written a report on a much larger case, therefore, a lengthier report, perhaps over a period of days, perhaps in part as I looked at different aspects of the case.  For example, there might be a handwriting aspect of the case which I would write after I've examined the handwritings.  

I then may have to go on to examine inks and would write my report on the inks section of the case when I've examined the inks.  

In that particular case, therefore, the two sections of the report could be written in a couple of days, maybe a week apart in the larger case.  And I suppose it's possible that I could use a different pen for the two sections of the case.  And at the end of the report, being finished, I may go back and make alterations to the first part with a different pen.  I'm sure that must have happened in my working career. 
Q.	Thank you.  So having written, say, two or three pages over the course of two days in your own handwriting, is it unusual for you to remember or spot an omission that you made, and for you to go back to probably page 1 and include what you thought you omitted on page 1 after having written 
	page 3 of the document? 
A.	It's possible I could do that when writing a report. 
Q.	You agree that that insertion that you would've made would be out of sequence from the main body of page 1? 
A.	Yes, it clearly would have been written out of sequence from the main body of page 1. 
Q.	But that would not make your page 1 invalid or seem like the information you included was not appropriate.  
A.	Not necessarily in that case, no.
(Pages 1 to 19 by Melissa Hook)

















1015H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	So that could be the case with D. NZ445, page 1?
A.	Well, it's possible but, as I don't understand the language in which the page 1 is written, I do not know what difference it makes to the reading of that page, the fact that you have an insertion of writing out of sequence with others, so I can't comment. 
Q.	Now, the main issue before the Court in respect of these documents relates to when they were created, when the various pages of D. NZ445 and 463 were created? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	If I told you that these documents were created in 2002, as the date on them seems to suppose, will you have any reason to challenge that? 
A.	I cannot tell the Court when these documents were produced.  Sadly, as I've said a few times now, we don't have any technique in forensic science.  When I say "we", I don't mean my particular company, I mean forensic document examiners worldwide.  We don't have any machine, any technique available that could tell exactly on what date a document was written out.  So I'm in no position to challenge the arguments that these were written out in 2002.
Q.	In your -- in your report, you also discussed the stapling on D. NZ445 and D. NZ463.  
A.	Yes.  I noticed that there were staple holes in the documents and I examined those staples to see if it was possible to tell that certain pages had been stapled together with others and, perhaps, certain pages could not have been stapled to others.  Now, just talking very generally, in the pages there are staple holes, there are a number of staple holes in various pages that have staple holes approximately in that position on the page, and the potential, therefore, that with those staple holes as they were common within the pages, the pages have been stapled together.  Some of the pages had two sets of staple holes, some only one set.  They were all roughly in the same area on the page and the potential is that, yes, they could have been stapled together. 

Having examined the position of the staple holes and the gaps between the holes and tried to work out which pages might have been stapled to others, and also perhaps to try and work out if there may have been other pages stapled with these documents that have since been destroyed and are now not part of them, I was unable to come to any conclusion whatsoever as to which pages had been stapled together and, perhaps, not to others.  It was impossible to tell. 
Q.	But you did observe that D. NZ -- the pages of D. NZ445 had been stapled together with a rusted staple pin? 
A.	There were -- or there's some evidence of rust on the documents in the area where you have the staple holes.  On some of the documents the rust is on the top surface of the documents which must have come -- it's a little line of approximately a centimetre, the size of a staple -- and you can see pretty well the whole of what must have been the top of the staple sitting on the top of the paper.  That is present only on certain documents.  On others, you can see where the end of the staple has curled back in and pinched on to the back of the document and there's evidence of rust, if you like, from the ends of the staple.  So, yes, there is rust there.  All I can say from that is that some pages look to have been the top page in a bundle when pages were stapled together because you see the whole of the staple indented with rust within that, some pages are the back of bundles of documents, but I'm unable to say which was the top and which was the bottom of any of the pages.  In other words which -- which pages have been stapled to others from that evidence, merely that staples have been there and rust has transferred to the surface of the pages. 
Q.	The rust on D. NZ445, page 1, did indicate that it was a first page of a stapled document, correct? 
A.	I think that's correct if I can just check that, but from my memory that seems correct.  Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And the last page of D. NZ445 also bore staple evidence of the fact that it was a last page of the document? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Would that be the same in respect of the first page of D. NZ463 and the last page of D. NZ463? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Mr. Hughes, what would a rusted staple on a document indicate to you? 
A.	Just that at some point after the documents had been stapled together you have a staple that has rusted and transferred some of that rust onto the surface of the document, simply that.  The only thing that I've already said you can indicate is that one page would have been the top of a bundle of documents and one page would have been at the bottom.  But anything more than that, the rust does not give me any evidence that I think is useful to the Court in this case. 
Q.	Very good.  So it would suggest to you that the documents had been stapled together for quite some time? 
A.	It's impossible to tell really.  It would depend.  Well, the rust could have been partially on the staple before it was applied to the document.  You may get that in the staple itself, staples that had started to go rusty.  Therefore you would expect transference onto the paper a lot quicker than if you've applied a staple which is not rusty and pressed and used on a particular document.   Speed with which rust might show on a staple and then transfer to the document would, to some degree, be dependent on the quality of the iron and the steel used in the staple.  If it's very good quality stainless steel, which I'm sure would probably not be used for staples, it would not be cost effective to do that, but if it were you might expect a staple to be in a document for some time before it started to go rusty.  If it was not such a good quality steel or iron the rust may set in somewhat quicker.  

Atmospheric conditions will play a part as well.  If you keep a document in a sort of coolish, very dry atmosphere you would not expect something to rust as quickly as if it was in a damp or humid atmosphere.  So it's pretty well impossible without knowing the quality of the staple, the conditions in which the documents were kept, whether the staple was rusty before it was applied or whether it became rusty after it was used to bind pages together.  It's impossible to give any time indication as to how long the documents might have been held together with a staple.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Hughes, for coming.
A.	My pleasure.
Q.	Thank you for answering the questions to assist the Court.  The Prosecution wishes you a safe trip back to the U.K.
A.	Thank you.
Q.	And do say hello to the Queen.
MR. SENDZE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, any redirect?
MR. ROBINSON:
No.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, thank you, Mr. Hughes.  The Court thanks you, as we do all witnesses.
THE WITNESS: 
It's been a pleasure to be here.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much and you are now excused.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
(Witness excused)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am just going to need to just check with WVSS concerning the availability of Mr. Kajelijeli, who is anticipated to be our next witness.  He was supposed to go to the clinic this morning when he first arrived.  So if we could take our mid-morning recess now, that would be helpful.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we can take the mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1022H to 1114H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
	(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yeah.  I wasn't sure if your microphone was on when you first responded to me, but I just extended --

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you begin your testimony you have to take an oath to tell the truth and the registrar will now administer that to you.  
(Declaration made by Juvénal Kajelijeli in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you'll give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose and you'll respond, first of all, to counsel representing Joseph Nzirorera.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  For the record, the witness who is before us is Juvénal Kajelijeli.
JUVÉNAL KAJELIJELI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:  
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	And, Mr. Kajelijeli, mwaramutse.  Amakura ki.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Welcome back to Arusha.  Mr. Kajelijeli, have you yourself been tried here in the ICTR? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And were you sentenced? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And are you serving that sentence now? 
A.	Yes.  However, I am not happy about the sentence I am facing.  I still consider myself as innocent. 
Q.	And what was the final sentence that you received?  
A.	Forty-five years' imprisonment. 
Q.	Do you presently have a petition for review pending before the Appeals Chamber? 
A.	In the year 2009, July 2009, I filed an appeal with the Appeals Chamber and I got a response and the Prosecutor also reacted to that appeal.  As at now, the Appeals Chamber has asked me to submit reasons for which I believe I am innocent, and I have been assigned a counsel and alongside this counsel, we are working towards the review of the case, given that we have obtained further proof that show that the Prosecutor did not tell the truth. 
Q.	And where are you serving your sentence? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Presently I am detained Port Novo in Benin at the prison known as
Akpro-Missérété prison. 
Q.	Now, what's been placed before you is a personal information sheet containing some information.  And I understand you have made a correction to that personal information sheet, so can you tell us what you have corrected.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  There was an error in this document.  My commune of residence is, 
rather -- is Mukingo, even though I have another residence within the Nkuli commune. 
Q.	So where the document says your commune in 1994, you have corrected it from Nkuli and it now reads Mukingo, is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may that information sheet be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ727.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  Exhibit No. D. NZ727 admitted.
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ727 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you tell our Trial Chamber where you were when you learned of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I was in my residence within the Nkuli commune. 
Q.	And approximately what time and what day did you first learn about the death of 
President Habyarimana? 
A.	I learnt about the death of President Habyarimana on the 7th, around five, or rather 6 a.m., that is the 7th of April 1994. 
Q.	And how did you get that news? 
A.	I turned on my radio and I heard classical music being broadcast over Radio Rwanda and whenever we heard such music over the radio, we knew there was an extraordinary, unusual event.  And it was later on at 6 a.m., 6:30, that we learnt that the president of Rwanda, the president of Burundi, as well as their delegation members, had perished following the crash of their aeroplane.  After receiving that piece of news, we were deeply shocked. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'm going to read to you what has been taken as judicial notice of adjudicated facts in our case from paragraph 469 of the judgement in your case, and when I finish reading these adjudicated facts, I am just going to ask you if you could tell me whether or not that's true. 

So adjudicated fact number 41 in our case says that "There was a meeting on the evening of 
6 April 1994, following the death of the president at the canteen next to the Nkuli bureau communal."  

Adjudicated fact 42 says that Kajelijeli seized the leading role in the meeting and addressed those persons present, who were all of Hutu ethnic origin, and he said to them, "You very well know that it was the Tutsi that killed -- that brought down the presidential plane.  What are you waiting for to eliminate the enemy?"  

Adjudicated fact 43 says, "By 'the enemy'," a witness present "...understood..." Kajelijeli..."to mean the Tutsi ethnic group."  

Adjudicated fact 44 says that, "After receiving information from Sendugu Shadrack that there were no weapons available to attack the population,"...Kajelijeli..."left the meeting with Deputy Brigadier Boniface Ntambareshya."

Adjudicated fact 45 says that, "When he returned he informed those present that Major Bizabarumana had agreed to provide them with 'equipment' at the commune the following morning." 

Adjudicated fact 46 --
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, it's not my intention to disturb Mr. Robinson, but I'm not pleased with the way the questions are being formed.  Mr. Robinson's asked five questions now and he hasn't gotten a single answer from the witness.  If the witness is denying being present at this meeting, there's no way that he can respond to some of the questions that have been asked.  So I think it would be much more effective to go statement by statement and the ones where he clearly cannot respond should not be answered, and here I would refer specifically to adjudicated fact number 43, which refers to what another person thinks Kajelijeli meant by the term "the enemy".  

So can we do this in a different way? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I had intended to just ask one question when this was all over and I think I can do it that way.  

And Mr. Webster, I don't think there will be any confusion when the witness answers the question, 
but I -- we're going to -- if I have to go back and read every fact, we are going to waste time.
MR. WEBSTER:  
Well, I mean there's no way that the witness can answer some of the questions that are being put to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We've got a submission, already.  Mr. Robinson, even though it might require a little extra time we think it's better that -- that the witness answers each fact separately because there's the presup -- there's the concern that one global answer may not be applicable to each fact.  So just in order to avoid any interpretation issues as far as that is concerned it would be useful if you dealt with it separately.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Kajelijeli, returning now to adjudicated fact number 41, which provides that there was a meeting on the evening of 6 April 1994, following the death of the president, at the canteen next to the bureau, Nkuli bureau communal; do you know of any such meeting? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I will answer that question. That meeting never took place.  This is (inaudible) invention and it was Witness GDD who mentioned it.  He signed a contract with the Prosecution and the Rwandan authorities for him to come over here and tell the public that that meeting took place.  In fact, that witness made two statements and in the first statement he did not mention that that meeting ever took place. 

Now, that statement was taken up by staff of the Prosecutor's office.  He was asked to do that so as to obtain in exchange his release, because while in Benin, staff of the Prosecutor came, Duclos and Wagala, they came and arrested me and they told me that that night I was going to spend the night in (inaudible) Mukingo.  And when they learnt that, they fabricated this meeting.  But as a matter of fact that meeting never took place.  During that period, I was not a staff of the state, a civil servant, I was working on my own, and the Nkuli commune had its own bourgmestre, which bourgmestre does not know anything about that meeting.  And even the population does not talk about that meeting.  

This witness, GDD, lied, prompted and influenced by the Prosecutor.  He's already been judged and his trial took place in Rwanda. 

In conclusion, to say that this Nkuli meeting took place is no longer valid and I do not think that this trial, this Trial Chamber, this Tribunal, should waste its time on this issue.  

And if I have requested that my -- that I should have a retrial it was because I proved that that meeting at the canteen never took place and I submitted proof to that effect.  So whosoever says we cannot discuss that matter any longer is not right. 

I wrote to the Appeals Chamber and, after considering the facts I submitted, they are working, they are assessing the facts and evidence again.  And so, if indeed this Trial Chamber is out to know the truth then it should not take into consideration that item.  There is only one witness who testified to that effect and we all know that he lied and we have facts to buttress that fact.  And I have prepared evidence on which I have already submitted to the Appeals Chamber and it is on that basis that counsel was assigned to me.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Adjudicated fact 42 says that Kajelijeli seized the leading role in the meeting and addressed those persons present, who were all of Hutu ethnic origin, and he said to them, "You very well know that it was the Tutsi that killed -- that brought down the presidential plane.  What are you waiting for to eliminate the enemy?"  Is that true? 
A.	That is a fat lie.  As I said before, that meeting never took place.  So if that meeting never took place where could I have said such a thing?  If people claim that I said so to many Hutus then you would have many witnesses who would be able to corroborate what Witness GDD said.  So this is clearly a lie.  And there is evidence to show that what GDD said was a lie and I have enough evidence to be used to request my judgement to be re -- for it -- reviewed, and it is likely that this would be before this Chamber.  Thank you. 
Q.	Adjudicated fact 43 says that, "By 'the enemy',"...a witness present..."understood"...Kajelijeli... "to mean the Tutsi ethnic group."  Now, could anyone have understood you to have spoken about the enemy if you did not attend this meeting? 
A.	I already told you that meeting never took place.  I further stated that there's only one witness who talked about this -- witness -- that is Witness GDD.  Did the Prosecutor bring another witness to buttress what witness GDD said?  If GDD accepted to say what he said, it is because there's a contract between him and the Prosecutor for his -- him to be released.  But that did not stop GDD to be tried in Rwanda and during that trial that he referred to.  That -- that is -- that is the reason why I said that GDD -- what GDD said was untrue. 

They shouldn't take into account what GDD said.  We proved that GDD lied and that it's rather officers of the OTP who persuaded GDD to lie.  This other person who fabricated that lie has to be prosecuted and, as I told you earlier, the Appeals Chamber is aware of this and, as a matter of fact, I have accused the Prosecutor and that witness before the Appeals Chamber. 

I wonder whether I'm allowed to state the entire truth and everything that really happened.  As far as I'm concerned, I don't think we should say that we cannot discuss this topic, but the Appeals Chamber has admitted that we discuss -- re-open discussions about this case.  The Appeals Chamber has decided that this case can be re-opened and discussed. 
Q.	Okay, I'm going to read you three more adjudicated facts one by one.  It's not necessary to give a long explanation after each one, but I'm obligated to put each one of these to you.  So I'm just going to ask you if they are true and you can say "yes" or "no" because I think you've fully explained the source of this allegation. 

Adjudicated fact 44 says that, "After receiving information from Sendugu Shadrack that there were no weapons available to attack the population," Kajelijeli "left the meeting with
Deputy Brigadier Boniface Ntambareshya."  Is that true? 
A.	That is not true.  You asked me to be concise.  Ntambareshya had stayed in the Rwankeli health centre and people say he was at the commune, but it's proved that he was elsewhere and we're going to use it in our defence. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Number 45 says that when you returned, you "...informed those present that 
Major Bizabarumana had agreed to provide them with 'equipment' at the commune the following morning."  Is that true? 
A.	That is not true. 
Q.	And, finally, adjudicated fact 46 says that Kajelijeli "...also promised to bring Interahamwe reinforcements from Mukingo commune for the attack on Kinyababa cellule."  Is that true? 
A.	That is not true.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now returning to the morning of the 7th of April, what did you do after you heard the news of President Habyarimana's death? 
A.	The minister of defence made a communiqué requesting the populace not to move about until further orders.  So I respected that instruction and stayed indoors, but later on I went to the commune office, which is not far away from my home, and I spent very little time there and returned home.  That is what I did.  That is the only movement I did.  We were all in mourning. 
Q.	Do you know a man named Aloys Bataganira? 
A.	Yes, I know Bataganira. 
Q.	And did you hear from Mr. Bataganira on the 7th of April? 
A.	On the 7th of April, Bataganira called me on the phone.  We chatted.  Subsequently, as he was unhappy with what we had said over the phone, he came to my home. 
Q.	At what time of day or what part of the day did he call you? 
A.	It was between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.  In any event it was very early in the morning, I can't recall the exact time. 
Q.	And what ethnic group does Mr. Bataganira belong to?
A.	What we knew was that he was Tutsi.  In any case, up till the 6th of April we thought he was Tutsi and I believe he is still Tutsi. 
Q.	What did he say to you when he called you on the morning of the 7th of April? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  He was asking me if I had heard about the death of the president of the republic and the -- and what he was to do.  I told him that we were saddened by the news and that we were mourning.  I told him that if he was concerned about what would ensue, he could keep his calm and stay indoors and not panic unduly, that irrespective of what the situation was, we were going to continue -- or, no, to continue monitoring it very closely.  Thank you.

1145H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And when did you next see him in person? 
A.	I saw him when he arrived at my house around 6 o'clock -- 6 and 7 a.m.  In the meantime, I wouldn't say he came later than 8 a.m.  He came to my house that morning.  I can't tell you the specific time.  We were confused.  We were not quite prepared.  We discussed his problems, and I told him what he was to do.

We were worried and concerned about what would happen afterwards.  The death of a president of a republic is not a minor issue.  We were pretty much discouraged.  After our discussions he went back to his house.  That's all.  
Q.	Were you still in your pyjamas when he arrived? 
A.	Yes.  I told you that when he arrived I was not ready yet.  I was still in my pyjamas.  I still had slippers on.  We didn't know what to do. 
Q.	What advice did you give to Mr. Bataganara when he came to your home? 
A.	I repeated what I had told him over the phone.  I told him that he was lucky to have gendarmes at his home, but before that he had asked me if he couldn't come and live in my house.  I told him that was impossible because he already had gendarmes.  I also told him that I couldn't accept that gendarmes would come and stay at my home; whereas, I didn't stay far from the bureau communal, and I told him that he was to remain in his house with the gendarmes and that if I had any specific information to transmit to him, I was going to do so.  But he wasn't happy with my answer.  

So he came in hiding through the eucalyptus trees and came to see me, and I told him what I had told him and asked him not to show himself in public so he could stay away from problems, from trouble.  So he returned to his house. 
Q.	And did you have any contact with him, either directly or through someone else, later that day? 
A.	Yes.  We had some contacts.  I had a brother-in-law who was a warrant officer and who lived in Ruhengeri, and I asked him to get in touch with a gendarmerie lieutenant and to talk to him about Bataganira's problem and asked that lieutenant if he couldn't go and assist him because he was in danger so that he would be evacuated.  My brother-in-law made arrangements for Bataganira to be evacuated.  

In any event, the gendarmerie group commander promised that they were going to evacuate him on the 8th of April.  I sent a child to tell Bataganira that the gendarmerie group was aware of his difficulties and that the following morning of the 8th he was going to be evacuated.  So I sent a child to inform him about that.  That is what I did.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that on the 7th of April you went to the commune office.  Can you tell us approximately what time you did that.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I told you that I have two houses, one in Mukingo and the other in Nkuli.  So I was concerned with respect to my Mukingo -- my family in Mukingo.  I met the bourgmestre going towards the commune -- commune office.  And I went to his office to ask him about what the situation was in that commune.

He told me that at the time he left the commune there were -- there was no trouble.  I didn't spend much time with him as he also wanted to know what the situation was in his secteur.  So I returned home, and he left.  
Q.	Can you tell me -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  Can you elicit from the witness what commune he's talking about, what commune office and what bourgmestre.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes.  You told us that you were at home in Nkuli commune on the morning of the 7th of April.  And which commune did you go to that morning? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I said that I went to the Nkuli commune office about 
	100 metres from there.  I saw the bourgmestre coming from Mukingo, and I went to his office in 
	Nkuli commune. 
Q.	And who was the bourgmestre of Nkuli commune? 
A.	Dominique Gatsimbanyi. 
Q.	And in what commune did he live?
A.	He lived in the Mukingo commune, Busogo secteur, Rwankeli cellule. 
Q.	So when you saw him on the way to the Nkuli commune office, you were asking him for news about Mukingo; is that correct?  
A.	I went to ask him about the prevailing situation in the Mukingo commune as the RPF was found in the Kinigi commune and that they were likely to resume hostilities marching toward the Mukingo commune.  So I wanted to ask him what was the prevailing situation on the roads so as to see how my family -- if I could have my family evacuated from the Mukingo commune.  He told me that when he left Mukingo, there were no -- there was no trouble so to speak.  I returned to my house.  I didn't spend much time with him as he also had to go to the secteur. 
Q.	And approximately what time of day was it that you encountered the bourgmestre Gatsimbanyi? 
A.	I didn't pay attention to the time, but I would put it at between 10 and 10:30 a.m., maybe 10 and 11 a.m.  The prevailing situation did not allow me to remember time.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, did you -- you told us you saw the bourgmestre on the way to the commune office.   

Did you actually go to the commune office that morning? 
A.	I am talking about Nkuli bureau communal.  I went to the Nkuli bureau communal, and then I returned home. 
Q.	And while at the Nkuli commune office, did you see any other persons there? 
A.	I saw traders there, traders who had come to ask for assistance from the bourgmestre.  I saw the president of field in Rwankeli known as Ignace Karakezi, and when all those people arrived, the bourgmestre was oversolicited by everyone.  For example, the president of field in Rwankeli to whom I talked said he had problems in his area, and he went back to his field in Rwankeli, and I returned to my house. 
Q.	While you were at the commune office, did the bourgmestre Gatsimbanyi take any action with respect to problems that the president of the Adventist college in Rwankeli had raised? 
A.	I don't know what he told the bourgmestre, but the bourgmestre quite simply told me that he did not notice any problems in Mukingo.  So I left.  I can't tell what was the discussion between the bourgmestre and the president of the field.  I left without knowing what they had said to each other.  I don't know whether the bourgmestre went to Rwankeli or not.  I can't tell what answer he gave the president of that Adventist region in Rwankeli. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.

Now, after you went back to your home, did you see the bourgmestre of Nkuli, 
Dominique Gatsimbanyi, again that day?  
A.	No.  I no longer talked to him, but I saw him leaving the commune office when he was going back and forth. 
Q.	At any time on the 7th of April were you and Bourgmestre Gatsimbanyi together at the ERP filling station in Nkuli commune? 
A.	I no longer saw Gatsimbanyi except when I did in the morning as I told you a while ago.  As a matter of fact, I no longer left my house after I had gone to the commune office.  This issue about the 
	ERP filling station never existed. 
Q.	In our trial a witness with a pseudonym of FAL has had her statement admitted pursuant to Rule 92 bis.  It's Exhibit P. 112.  And in this statement she claims to have seen you and Bourgmestre Gatsimbanyi leaving a gathering at the ERP filling station on the morning of the 7th of April at which both of you were encouraging the people to kill Tutsis; is that true?
A.	That is mere propaganda.  It was something that was fabricated.  It's something that never existed.  
	No one in Nkuli would be in a position to confirm to the -- to you that that event actually happened, and I would like to pray this Chamber not to pay attention -- lay any credence to that statement. 
Q.	After returning from the commune office, did you leave your home again at all on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	As I already told you before, when Bataganira came to my house, he met my sister there who had come to visit me without knowing what had happened.  And that's the only person whom I accompanied up to 20 metres away from my home.  As for everything else, I did not leave my house.  Quite simply, I was in my courtyard, the courtyard of my house, to try and see what was happening outside.  

When you are in my house in Nkuli, you have a bird's eye view allowing you to see people going about.  So I stayed -- I moved -- I was only at the distance of 5 metres from my house.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you ever go to Mukingo commune on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Counsel, I just told you on that day I did not go beyond the limits of my residence to go to Mukingo.  The entire day I did not set foot in Mukingo. 
Q.	Did you have any contact by telephone with Joseph Nzirorera on the 7th of April? 
A.	I am telling the truth, Mr. President.  On that day we had something happen that did not allow me to talk with anyone apart from the people to whom I discussed.  Nzirorera did not talk to us.  Rather, we were afraid that the RPF had killed him considering the place where he was living.  His house was close to the CMD where the RPF was based.  On that day we were so concerned about his fate that we felt that he had been assassinated by -- murdered by the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Now, turning to the 8th of April, can you tell us what you did on the morning of that day.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.

In the morning of the 8th of April 1994, I was in my house when I woke up.  And while I was there, I heard gunfire and bombs, and we heard that the RPF had started hostilities again.  I was worried.  I alerted my family and asked the family to prepare a place where my family in Mukingo could be kept while waiting to see how things unfolded.  

In the afternoon around 2:30 or 3:00 p.m., I took the risk of going to Mukingo where I went to the Mukingo commune office where I arrived around 1, 1 o'clock.  I asked the bourgmestre what the situation was like, and it was in the secteur of Rwinzovu where my house was.  He told me that there was no problem and I could go there.

That is when I decided to go to Rwinzovu to meet my family in view of moving out from Mukingo as we were worried because of the hostilities that had resumed in Kinigi.  The RPF, indeed, had already taken a part of the south -- of Mukingo.  That is what I did on the 8th. 
Q.	Now, when you first arrived at the Mukingo commune office on the 8th, was the bourgmestre present? 
A.	Yes.  The bourgmestre was present between 1 and 1:30 p.m.  I chatted with him, and he reassured me telling me that there was no problem in Rwinzovu.  So I went there to meet my family. 
Q.	What was the name of that bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	His name was Harerimana, Emmanuel. 
Q.	Now, did you receive any information concerning problems that had occurred in Mukingo on the 7th of April in other secteurs besides Rwinzovu? 
A.	He told me that he was returning from the burial of some innocent people who had been killed 
	on the 7th.
Q.	And what did he tell you about the killing that had taken place on the 7th as best you can recall? 
A.	He was in shock because of the situation.  He told me that he had just conducted funeral services for people who had been killed in Busogo and Rwankeli.  He told me that brigands had killed people on the 7th.  In a nutshell, considering the prevailing situation, I left him because I was concerned by the insecurity of my relatives, of my family members. 
Q.	Did you have any discussion with Bourgmestre Harerimana about whether it was advisable for you to evacuate your family from Rwinzovu?
A.	I talked to him about that situation telling him that people were likely not to be happy with the movement, the evacuation of my family, because that would create a problem resulting in other members of the population leaving their house.  

He said I had to act with a lot of tact.  But when I arrived in Busogo, my family told me that they were not ready to leave because my father and my mother were unable to move and the other relatives had also had problems with respect to the fact that they had visitors, that some relatives had had some problems recently.  

So I left before I could do much, and all I did was to encourage them to hang in and to be strong considering the prevailing situation, and I promised them that I would continue monitoring the situation closely.  And as a result, I explained to my family that it was not necessary to move them, and I left. 
Q.	Among the family members that you visited in Rwinzovu that day, did you also go to the house of your wife, where your wife was? 
A.	Yes.  I went to my wife's residence -- or my residence.  We just had a baby recently, and I met some people there who had found refuge at my wife's residence, and at this residence we talked about their situation.  And by the way, that was one of the reasons why I did not move my family.  

I asked the members of the family to think over the situation, and I noticed that we could not abandon these persons who had found refuge in our home on their own.  People could notice that by moving my family it was a sign of insecurity.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	And what was the ethnicity of the people who had taken refuge in the home of you and your wife? 
A.	I would say they were Tutsis, as a matter of fact four Tutsis -- a couple, a lady and her child. 
Q.	And what advice did you give these Tutsi about what they should do? 
A.	My wife had provided them with a room, and I told them that they should not go outside in the course of the day particularly.  And I asked that the children should not go into that room at any time and that they should also permanently block the back door of the room.  And I told my wife to do the best she could to help these people disguise themselves such that their security is not jeopardised maybe because of persons who may come to visit and notice that they were there.  That is what happened. 
Q.	And what was the fate of those people? 
A.	I returned to my home in Nkuli having left my home in Mukingo, and later on I learnt that one of these persons spent an entire month there at my wife's residence and one of the ladies stayed there for a week before going back to her own home.  But I would confirm that all these persons in question survived and came over here to testify in my defence before the Trial Chamber that was handling my case, and these persons stated that I had saved the lives of Tutsis even before the 
	death of President Habyarimana.

So that is what happened.  Those persons stated that I did not abandon them and that even before the death of Habyarimana I had helped them. 
Q.	After leaving Rwinzovu having visited your family, where did you go on the 8th of April?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you.  Now, after having left Rwinzovu, I went directly to my residence in Nkuli.  And I was moving rather cautiously because the RPF had set up people to observe and monitor my movements.  I, therefore, told members of my family that they would not be seeing me very often in Mukingo, particularly on board my car.  So I went directly towards my residence in Nkuli. 
Q.	At any time on the 8th of April did you go to Busogo parish? 
A.	Please, would you take your question over, Counsel. 
Q.	At any time on the 8th of April, did you go to Busogo parish? 
A.	I already told you that I left my residence heading to Nkuli.  I did not go past the Busogo parish. 
Q.	Did you have anything to do with the burial of the bodies of Tutsis who had been killed in Mukingo commune? 
A.	No.  I played no role in the burial of Tutsis that had been killed in the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	At any time on the 8th of April were you together with Bourgmestre Harerimana at a bar owned by Semahimane? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I said that on the 8th of April I saw Bourgmestre Harerimana at his office between 1 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. and I asked him the question concerning the evacuation of my family.  I never saw him in any other venue on that day. 
Q.	Did there come a time when you learned that Bourgmestre Harerimana had died?
A.	Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I would like to inform the Trial Chamber that I learned about the death of Bourgmestre Harerimana on the 9th at around 6 a.m.  That is all that I learnt concerning the bourgmestre.  And the others and myself -- we were very, very heart broken when we learnt this information which came to compound all the problems that had preceded his death including the death of President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Had you poisoned the bourgmestre of Mukingo? 
A.	Please, Counsel.  Can you take that question over. 
Q.	Had you poisoned Bourgmestre Harerimana of Mukingo?
A.	Now, that is a story that I heard right here from the mouth of the Prosecutor.  It is in fact a case I will file against the Prosecutor.  This is an assault.  It's just meant to sow confusion among Rwandans.  Why would I have poisoned the bourgmestre?  I didn't do that.  Harerimana was a friend of mine.  He was an exceptional civil servant, and I am one of those persons who elected him as bourgmestre to replace me.  

Now, this is a story which was concocted by the Prosecutor for his own interest.  In fact, I participated at his burial.  I read a eulogy at his death, and I did all that a close relative of the family would have done.  And as a close relative of his family, I couldn't have done that.  His family was even grateful towards me for all that I did for him.  

You see, this matter has been fabricated by the Prosecutor to arouse hatred against me, and I have proof to that effect.  And that is one of the charges that I am putting against the Prosecutor.  Nobody -- I mean nobody -- in the Mukingo commune would ever say that I poisoned Bourgmestre Harerimana.  

Nobody ever heard about this.  And I pray the Judges to lay no credence to such false charges levied against me by the Prosecutor.  I played no role in the poisoning of Bourgmestre Harerimana.  These are slanderous allegations which I will use to prosecute the Prosecutor and all those persons who have libelled me. 
Q.	What did you do on the 9th of April?  You told us you learnt of the death of Bourgmestre Harerimana that morning.  What did you do that day? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you.  On that morning, after having learnt about this shocking, painful news of the death of Harerimana, I went to enquire further exactly on what had happened.  And sometime after I went back home to move my family and then go over to participate at the burial.  

And as a result, my family and myself -- we went over to bury the bourgmestre at his residence as his family had requested.  But, unfortunately, the RPF bombarded the area not far from the 
bureau communal and shortly after the burial ceremony was interrupted.  And it took us quite some time to finish up with the burial ceremonies.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, during the next week -- let's say from the 9th to about the 14th of April -- did you go to Mukingo commune?  
A.	During that day I did not set foot in the bureau communal of Mukingo because hostilities had resumed in that region.  And so I did not go to the communal office there at the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Now, did there come a time on the 14th of April that you heard about an attack on the court of appeal in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Please can you take over your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you hear about an attack at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri that had taken place on the 
	14th of April?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I learned over the radio that some persons had found refuge at the appeal court and that the RPF had fired a Katioucha missile at the appeal court there in Ruhengeri.  That was information which was broadcast by a journalist over the radio, but on that day I did not go to the Mukingo communal office.   

I had work to do at Kareba very close to the Giciye commune, and there were workers of mine there who were felling wood and were piling them into trucks that I was supplying to clients.  And this was firewood that I was supplying.  I, therefore, learnt this information by radio.  But I for one did not show up at the Mukingo communal office there in Mukingo on that day. 
Q.	And had you had any contact with persons who were intending to go to Ruhengeri to attack those at the court of appeal on the 14th of April?
A.	Please consider the response I just gave you.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I just said that I was with my workers who were felling firewood there at Kareba, firewood that was meant for my clients.  I had no contact with whosoever among those who attacked the appeal court.  I was very, very far away from the Mukingo commune, and the area in which I was was also very close to the Nkuli commune.  It was between 20 or 30 kilometres from the Mukingo commune.  In short, I simply wish to say I contacted none of the persons among the assailants of the Ruhengeri appeal court.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us who it was who took over the duties of the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune immediately after the death of Harerimana.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  From the information which I had, I must tell you that I was very, very busy at the time.  It was only much later that according to the law organising communal activities which stipulates that in such a case the bourgmestre is replaced by one of the conseillers.  And it was Ndisetse who had what it took to replace him.  And that is in fact what happened according -- pursuant to the law on communal organisation.  That is what happened. 
Q.	And did there come a time when you presented your candidacy for bourgmestre of Mukingo commune after the death of Harerimana? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  After the death of Harerimana, at the time I was going to visit my workers working at the Mukingo commune, I learnt that there was a development meeting at the Mukingo community office.

And since I was on my way, I went there.  And I was told that they were going to elect the bourgmestre.  I asked what were the conditions for anyone to be eligible for any candidacy.  I was told that there were no special conditions and that whosoever would like to file his candidature could do so, and I did so.  

I was not expecting this.  And, in fact, in the past, it was often said that the population is not for Kajelijeli.  And so to counter that defamation, I was forced to present my candidacy again just to counter against all those who had been spreading news that the population did not want me.  
And so I put in my candidature against two others, and at the end of the day, I was elected at the end of these elections which took place, if I'm not mistaken, on the 26th of April 1994.  That was the day I was going past the communal office at Mukingo and where I submitted my candidature.  To be more precise, that is what happened.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you very much, Your Honours.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that there was a meeting of the communal development council.  Can you tell us who comprises the community development council in Mukingo commune.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I will ask the interpreter to be very specific.  There were many types of meetings.  You need to let me know exactly the name of that meeting.  Are you referring to the Mukingo communal meeting?  Are you referring to the council development meeting?  What meeting exactly was it?  
Q.	Yes.  I'm referring to the meeting of the 26th of April which you told us was from the Mukingo council of community development.  What was that council?  Who made up the members of that council? 
A.	Normally the development council of the commune is made up of members of the technical committee, communal conseiller, experts working at the communal office including chiefs of services, members of the clergy, heads of religious groups, as well as some people representing associations within the commune.  The members of this board are people who are in constant contact with the population.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	Okay.  And you mentioned the technical committee.  What was the technical committee of the commune? 
A.	I'm talking about the technical committee.  In the Mukingo commune, the technical committee was made up of eight persons.  If I'm not mistaken, that committee had eight members, well, 
	eight to nine members.  I do not recall exactly, but it is between eight and nine.  But you can consult documents to that effect. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of the technical committee of the commune of Mukingo? 
A.	We would differentiate things.  Well, the technical committee of the Mukingo commune I would say was the brain of the commune.  It helps the commune to draft projects and to harness funding and follow or monitor the execution.  And so, in short, to help the commune and the bourgmestre, the committee is there to help for the development of the commune and to implement projects and to seek the necessary funding.  

So in a few words or very briefly put, it was this committee -- this committee that helps the bourgmestre and the commune to prepare development projects, find funding, and things like that.  It's a 
technical committee made up of members who are experts and who were technicians who were carefully chosen according to their expertise and their specialties.  I thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera ever a member of the technical committee of Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes.  At a certain point in time, he was a member of that committee.  Yes.  You are right. 
Q.	Did he attend meetings regularly from, let's say, 1990 through 1994 of the technical committee? 
A.	If you specify the time bracket, that would make things much clearer.  I did not see him between 
	1990 and 1994, and until 1993 I was no more bourgmestre.  But from 1990 to 1993, I did not see him participating within the technical committee.  Since from the moment the war broke out in Rwanda, I did not see him participating within the technical committee.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Q.	And was Joseph Nzirorera present on the 26th of April when the communal development council met to consider who would be elected bourgmestre? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I thank you.  I would like to tell you that on the 26th of April 1994 that was when big problems broke out and residents of Kigali began fleeing.  I did not see Nzirorera.  I did not as much as hear his voice.  And, unfortunately, he was among the refugees, among those who were fleeing.  I never had the opportunity to even ask him exactly what the situation was, but that which I am certain about is on that date he did not -- at that time he never set foot in the region. 
Q.	So he was not present on the 26th of April during the meeting in which the election was held; correct? 
A.	He was not there.  I did not see him there.  I never heard anyone mention that he was there.  He did not even congratulate me. 
Q.	Who chaired the meeting at which the election was held? 
A.	It was Simon Kagano.  Simon Kagano was the president of the technical committee.  And permit me to add or specify that when he was leading that meeting, he was in the company of the 
	sous-préfet Ntarwanda, who was representing the préfet.  And I would rather say that the sous-préfet who was representing the préfet -- it was he who led that meeting. 
Q.	And you told us that you were the first among three candidates.  Who were the other two candidates? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The other two were communal office staff, the assistant Félicien Semahane, and another staff known as Maniragaba.  And I cannot recall his first name.  There also was present Ndakaza, but among all the candidates it was those who had the highest number of votes, and I was among the first.  I was the first. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, this would be a good time to take our afternoon recess if you would like to do that now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

We take our luncheon break now.

(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Kajelijeli.  Are you ready to continue? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, I'm ready.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President, I'm ready too.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you have told us now that you threw your hat in the ring for the position of bourgmestre on the 26th of April 1994.  Why did you want to become bourgmestre again? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  You have heard that in other countries -- like, Italy, Berlusconi left power and returned to power because there is democracy in those countries.  
I, therefore, do not see why there should be any limitations because one should be able to run as a candidate at any time, so I don't think you would blame me for wanting to run again.  It is for this reason that I positioned myself as a candidate because I didn't see any obstacle in the way, and I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	But people seek office for different reasons, maybe to try to be of service to the community, or perhaps to clear one's name from something that had happened in the past, or for other reasons.  Can you give us the reason why at that time you felt you would like to be the bourgmestre again.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe it was for the very reasons that Mr. Robinson has put to the witness in his question.  I think the question is inappropriate.  He's already told the witness what to answer, so nothing can be done, but I think he should be instructed not to do that in the future. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I -- I presented some examples.  He's free to either choose from those examples or to give his own reasons.  I don't think I suggested any particular answer to that question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I do think the question is leading, but we'll let the witness answer it.  

I do think the question is leading, but we'll let the witness answer it.  
THE WITNESS:
As far as I am concerned, there was no reason that came to my mind that would have stopped me from running for that position -- running to be elected to that position.  You see, any citizen could have run for the position.  Now -- and by the way, when I left that office, members of the public did not want me to do so, and it was for the purpose of helping the population and assisting my people, particularly in those difficult times, that I decided to do so in a quest to restore calm and security.  So it was an opportunity for me to sacrifice myself for my people, particularly as I had the possibility of running like any other citizen.  

My people, therefore, had the opportunity to proceed democratically to elect the candidates.  There had been democratic and political reforms in the country with the advent of multiparty politics, and so any citizen who felt that they could help the population was free to do so, particularly given that people wanted peace to be restored.  And if somebody felt that they could do so, they were free to run, and that is what I did, particularly given that there was no reason that would forbid me from running.  

And as I have already stated, when I left that post -- or, that office, no one had told me that I would be barred from running again.  That is why I availed myself of that democratic opening to present my candidature.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, as of the 26th of April, had any of the people who had killed the Tutsis on 7th of April been arrested or punished in any way? 
A.	Please kindly repeat your question, Counsel.  I did not quite understand it.  
Q.	As of the 26th of April, when you put forth your candidacy to be the next bourgmestre, had any of the people who killed Tutsis on 7 April in Mukingo been punished or arrested? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, since that day, the day on which I decided to run, I was not in possession of any information of people having been prosecuted and punished for the killings in Mukingo commune.  I had spent most of my time conducting private business outside of that commune and I was not in possession of any information relating to those people.  Thank you.  
Q.	Now, after you became bourgmestre and up until the time you went into exile, were any of those people arrested or punished? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, those were times of war and hostilities had resumed, and you certainly know that when the RPF attacked Rwanda from 1990 to 1994, there was a power vacuum in the country.  So the RPF did everything to discourage the authorities and create that power vacuum.  So a large number of refugees were in the country.  Prisons were destroyed, judges were killed, members of the security services were assassinated, deputy prosecutors were also murdered and, to some extent, there was little power vested in the communal authorities, but they did not have enough power to prosecute criminals.  

You may also want to recall that at that time the Ruhengeri prison had been destroyed.  When I took up office again as bourgmestre, I did not have the required resources; however, we initiated some investigations with a view to arresting some criminals.  

I do recall the case of one criminal whom we arrested, but we were told that negotiations had to be conducted all over again with a view to restoring peace, and that is why we had to discontinue our investigations, believing that negotiations would come to a conclusion and that at such a time all criminals will be prosecuted and punished.  

So there was so much insecurity at the time that it was practically impossible to prosecute anyone.  We did not have time to do so and the war was still going on.  There were displaced people and there was also misplaced property occurring on a daily basis.  
Q.	Were the courts working in Ruhengeri préfecture after the 6th of April? 
A.	What I can say is that the courts did not even exist.  The Ruhengeri court of first instance had been destroyed by the RPF.  The RPF had destroyed the state prosecutor's office in Ruhengeri when it attacked in January 1991.  The prison had also been destroyed.  Therefore, the courts were not operational, so to speak, properly.  

But you may also want to know that in 1990, several deputy prosecutors and judges were murdered and the various levels of the ministry of justice were, should I say, dysfunctional at that time, particularly at the communal level.  In any event, in the communes which were already occupied by the RPF, the courts were not operating and the various levels of services provided by the ministry of justice were no longer available.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, turning back to the procedure for selecting the new bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, can you tell me what was the next step that occurred after the meeting of the 26th of April at which you received the most votes.  What happened next? 
A.	The law provides that the ballots will be counted and a record will be drawn and forwarded to the préfet, who would then forward the record of the vote to the ministry of home affairs, who would then pass it on to the cabinet, the government in council, which would then announce the results of the elections, providing the name of the winner.  This is what happened.  

But in the meantime, the préfet wanted to act in violation of the law by forcing into place his own candidate, but ultimately had to comply with the law when the votes were properly tallied, and I was the one who came up with the highest votes during that election.  
Q.	Now, what was the name of the préfet of Ruhengeri as of the 26th of April 1994? 
A.	There was a new préfet in office, and his name was Basile Nsabumugisha.  Nsabumugisha. Basile Nsabumugisha.  
Q.	And to which political party did he belong?  
A.	Préfet Basile Nsabumugisha was a member of the MDR political party. 
Q.	Now, the person who came in second in the election, Semahane, what political party did he belong to? 
A.	He was also of the MDR party.  
Q.	And did there come a time when the préfet selected Semahane to be the bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes.  This was a unilateral initiative of the préfet, which was in violation of the law on elections.  He installed him, but did not declare that he was a bourgmestre as such.  He simply said he was the interim bourgmestre.  So upon learning of that fact, I wrote a letter challenging his decision as being undemocratic, particularly given that it was taken at the time of multiparty politics.  

You see, the political parties wanted to enjoy vast opportunities of democracy, and so the population did not agree that the préfet should act contrary to their wishes, given that they had elected their bourgmestre.  And it is in this context that I wrote to the minister indicating that the préfet was acting outside the scope of the law.  And my request was heeded and the cabinet ultimately upheld the results of the election and announced that I had been elected to the position of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  

A presidential order was issued on the 17th and broadcast on the 18th of June 1994.  In fact, it is on the 18th of June that I heard the announcement over the radio, an announcement from the cabinet confirming me to the position of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  
Q.	Was there a period of time when Semahane took up the duties of acting bourgmestre in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And can you tell us approximately what period he served.  
A.	He was appointed by the préfet on the 29th of May, and from that date up until the month of June, when I was confirmed in office -- well, in fact, the handing over ceremony was between himself and I when I was confirmed as the elected bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  
Q.	And can you repeat the date that he took up the office.  When did he begin? 
A.	If memory is not failing me -- well, we may need to cross-check, but I think it was from the 25th of May that he took office as -- 29th, rather, 29th of May that he took office as interim bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  He was, therefore, appointed to that position as interim bourgmestre on the 29th of May.  

And I think it is on that date that the préfet sent his appointment letter, and that ran up to the 22nd of June, the date on which I was officially confirmed as bourgmestre and on which the 
handing-over ceremony took place -- rather, towards the end of the month of June.  It was towards the end of the month of June that I replaced him. 
Q.	And who performed the duties of bourgmestre in Mukingo commune prior to the 29th of May? 
A.	I learnt that Ndisetse was replaced by Jean Damascène Niyoyita, and Semahane replaced Jean Damascène Niyoyita.  And when I won the elections, I then replaced Semahane.  Therefore, there were three other bourgmestres after -- including, rather, Niyoyita, Harelimana and Ndisetse -- and Semahane before I took office.  
Q.	And do you know whether -- 
A.	That is three bourgmestres after the death of Habyarimana before I took office.  
Q.	And do you know whether or not Niyoyita actually took up the duties of bourgmestre and, if so, for how long? 
A.	I heard that he was bourgmestre.  I heard that being said because I did not go to the communal office myself.  He was rejected by members of the population, and all I know is that he was in office for only about three weeks.  He's the one who had replaced Ndisetse following the decision of the 
minister of internal affairs and communal development.  So he held that position for about three weeks.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that you wrote a letter complaining about the fact that, despite your receiving the most votes, you hadn't been selected as bourgmestre.  Who did you write that letter to? 
A.	I wrote that letter to the prime minister.  
Q.	Approximately when did you write that letter? 
A.	I wrote that letter on the 5th of May, but that date needs to be cross-checked in the archives.  I believe that letter still exists.  
Q.	Now, did there come a time when some university students from Mukingo wrote a letter on your behalf? 
A.	All the members of the population were for me.  Shortly after having won the elections, I heard that those students allegedly wrote that letter, but I didn't receive that letter myself as I was not copied.  
Q.	Now, did Joseph Nzirorera have anything to do with your appointment as bourgmestre by the cabinet? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I'd already heard it said that Nzirorera supported me, 
but my answer was as follows, namely, that the people who said that lied.  Nzirorera was not a 
cabinet member -- or, in any case, did not attend their meetings, and I had bore a grudge against him at the time because he did not send me a message of congratulations.  I walked on my own and he had his own business issues.  

There was no special relationship between him and myself, and he couldn't have any form of influence in elections, which he did not take part in, and there was little he could change with respect to the results of those elections.  And, as a matter of fact, the préfet tried to influence the outcome of those elections to replace me by Semahane, who was a member of his political party.  But he didn't succeed.  

Furthermore, Nzirorera could not do anything.  How could he have supported me, whereas, first of all, he did not take part in the elections and he was in opposition to change the outcome of the elections?  So he played no role in my appointment and the confirmation of the election results.  So it's a lie.  If there are people who are saying that, those people are lying.  That never happened.  

The people who said that are attempting to show that between Nzirorera and myself there's some form of relationship, but he had no role to play in my election and in the confirmation of the results of the elections by the cabinet.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	From the time you became a candidate on the 26th of April until the time that you were selected in June, did you ever ask Mr. Nzirorera to use his influence on your behalf? 

Okay, let me repeat the question.  From the time that you -- 
A.	Okay, please, carry on.  
Q.	From the time that you became a candidate on the 26th of April 1994 until the time you were selected as bourgmestre in June 1994, did you ever ask Mr. Nzirorera to use his influence on your behalf? 
A.	But I had already been elected.  Elections had been held and there was little he could change with respect to the results of the elections.  What sort of role could he have played?  

People who said that -- that he allegedly -- allegedly used his influence for me to be confirmed surprise me.  The cabinet meeting based itself on the outcome of the elections.  I did not ask Nzirorera to vote for me or for him to increase the number of votes or to change the results of the ballot.  There was nothing that could have hindered me from becoming the bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune.  
I had -- I had been -- I had the majority vote, and that is why I challenged the préfet who did everything to replace me with someone.  As a matter of fact, had he succeeded, then the population had -- would have rose against him.  
Q.	Well, since you were petitioning to the prime minister to override the decision of the préfet and the matter was going to be decided by the cabinet, during that time did you ask Joseph Nzirorera to use his influence on any of these people to persuade them to select you as bourgmestre and override the decision of the préfet? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would pray you to ask Counsel Robinson to understand, since Nzirorera had no power to change the results of elections, I had the majority of the votes -- unless he tried to change the results of the votes, in which case that would have been tabled before a court.  The council simply entrenched the decision of the population that voted me.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Okay.  I just want to insist one more time because I'm asking you a question that you're not directly answering.  So I want you to give me a direct answer.  We know the situation.  But my question to you is whether you, Juvénal Kajelijeli, ever asked Joseph Nzirorera to use his influence to assist you in becoming the bourgmestre?  You can just say yes or no to that.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  What I am stating here is the truth.  And I swear in the name of God, Nzirorera never met Kajelijeli for the latter to ask Nzirorera for Nzirorera to assist him in becoming the bourgmestre, whereas, Kajelijeli had won the elections.  Kajelijeli never met Nzirorera for Nzirorera to use his influence for the cabinet to confirm Kajelijeli as bourgmestre.  Therefore, I never got in touch with Nzirorera for him to assist me for the cabinet to confirm me as bourgmestre of Mukingo.  Thank you.  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, to your knowledge, had there ever been an occasion around the 22nd of April, or a few weeks after the death of President Habyarimana, in which the new bourgmestre, Basile, had come to Mukingo and had been introduced to the population at a ceremony near the commune office? 

I think we -- let me ask that question again because there may be, I think, an error either in the translation or in my question.  

Was there ever an occasion about two weeks after the death of the president when the new préfet, Basile, came to Mukingo commune and was introduced to the members of the population near the commune office, to your knowledge?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I told you that I did not go back to the Mukingo commune office when I was no longer bourgmestre.  But what I heard people say is that Basile never set foot in the Mukingo commune office to be presented to the pop -- to the people.  And a new préfet is not pro -- presented in a commune office.  Well, what -- my understanding is that he was presented in the office of the Ruhengeri préfecture, in the meeting hall of the préfecture, and that is where he took the oath of office.  

Therefore, he never came to the Mukingo commune office; that is a lie.  And if there are witnesses who testified to that effect, it is under the influence of some -- some people who do not wish them to speak the truth.  Préfet Basile never came for presentation to the population at the Mukingo commune office.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  And did Préfet Basile attend your swearing-in ceremony after you had been selected as bourgmestre? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  He was the préfet of the Ruhengeri préfecture at the time and he is the one who sent me -- who transmitted my appointment letter confirming that I had won the elections.  And he is the one who organised the oath-taking ceremony and chaired that ceremony at the Mukingo commune office.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	And when was that ceremony held? 
A.	Often I forget dates, but I believe it was between the 22nd and the 26th.  There was a 
handing-over ceremony in the meantime.  I believe, Counsel, you would find the exact date in the archives.  It might have been the 22nd or the 26th -- or, in any event, in between the 22nd and the 26th, but that needs to be checked -- confirmed.  
(Pages 39 to 45 by Jean Baigent)




1445H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And that was in the month of June 1994, correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it is between the 22nd and 26th of June 1994. 
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera attend that swearing-in ceremony? 
A.	He came as a floor member of the Mukingo commune.  He was invited just as an ordinary invitee and he was there. 
Q.	Did he make a speech during that swearing-in ceremony? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  During that ceremony Nzirorera did not make a speech.  He was not meant to make a speech during that period.  He was not among the personalities who had to speak to the people.  As a matter of fact, a speech by him had not been on the agenda. 
Q.	Were there some people who paraded during that ceremony? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  On that day we were all worried because here and there in the Kinigi commune there were hostilities and they were closing in on the Mukingo commune.  I would say they had -- pupils had some form of march past.  These were primary school pupils.  You also had youth belonging to an association which was being set up.  Those are the people who were in the march past before the stage where the ceremony was supposed to take place. 
Q.	Now, was there an organisation known as Amahindure which made up those people who were marching past? 
A.	Amahindure was a group of people who called themselves Virunga Force, which subsequently came to be known as Amahindure.  But in our cities we called them Virunga Force.  As a matter of fact, it was a project to set them up.  This started as from June, from the 10th of June.  Indeed, that youth, including pupils, marched past.  In brief I would say that those youth wanted to make themselves known.  As a matter of fact, this was -- they were to prove that it was a youth group that was being established.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	On whose initiative was the Amahindure formed? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I'd like to insist on the fact that these were Virunga Force.  You call them Amahindure but I refer to them as Virunga Force.  When the RPF took Kigali, some people who had fled from Kigali, including a high-ranking servant known as Bernard Ntabahwana of the MDR, he was in the opposition, and he claimed that he wanted to assist his region by ensuring security, and so he set up that association known as Virunga Force, which is known by others as Amahindure.  

This gentleman, Bernard, who was the founder of this group, approached us and told us that we had to look for ways and means of ensuring security for the people.  He also told us that that association would have a military police status and that the members of this association would be done from the Nkuli and Mukingo communes.  And this idea was a good idea for us, as in both communes you had infiltrations which had led to the death of many people in the Kirambo préfecture, in Mutura commune and elsewhere.  

Now, when Bernard proposed -- brought up that idea, many people bought it, and as from the 
10th of June we started to meet to discuss about this project.  That is how Bernard's idea came to be accepted and the project that set up this association was born.  Unfortunately, the association was unable to come out in daylight, as we wished.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  That is how that Bernard's association, who -- which ultimately did not do what it was meant to do, that is to say, reach its objective. 
Q.	Was this Bernard also known as Bernard Suku? 
A.	His name is Bernard Ntabahwana Suku.  Suku is his grandfather's name.  Otherwise in his student documents he had the name of Ntabahwana Suku, Bernard.  Spelling of Suku should be S-U-K-U.  Ntabahwana, N-T-A-B-A-H-W-A-N-A, Ntabahwana.
Q.	Did the members of this Virunga Force that was established in early June 1994 receive military training? 
A.	We were still thinking about ways and means of providing the military training.  Some members of that association did have that militia training, but others were unable to do so until the time when the members of the association fled into exile.  So the Mukingo commune was taken before all the members of that association were provided military training.  The members of that association were able to meet each other and discuss how to conduct themselves.  But, you know, from the 
10th of June we didn't have enough time to provide the military training. 
Q.	Were there some retired army officers involved with the Virunga Force? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Yes, that's correct.  You had some retired 
army ex-servicemen who were to contribute in the training of that youth.  As a matter of fact, these were retired soldiers, and I remember one of their leaders.  There was one.  The name was not given.  So these were retired soldiers who had to provide training to these youths. 
Q.	Do you know Joseph Karorero? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Yes, Counsel, I know Karorero.  He is a soldier who at the time was a warrant officer and who was retired then.  And since we needed somebody to train those youth, we decided that Karorero would be -- would lead all the other retired soldiers who had to train those youth. 
Q.	What was the purpose of training those youths?  Was it to go to the front and fight the RPF or to kill Tutsis? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to pray counsel to desist from saying, "kill Tutsis".  This is something that was fabricated to bring hatred between people.  Nobody was trained to kill Tutsis.  This was something that was concocted in order to divide people.  Now, to answer your question, Counsel, I'll say that this association was established because Ntabahwana Suku, Bernard had convinced us of the relevance of that association when we noted that there were infiltrations in all communes and that youth had to assist us in identifying the people who had intruded the commune.  Our intention was to ask for those youth to become part of the army if, after being trained, if the minister of defence agreed, so that youth had to go to the war front ultimately.  But the goal was not to have them kill Tutsis.  If anybody alleged that these youths were meant to kill Tutsis, well, that person lied. 
Q.	At your swearing-in ceremony, did any speaker thank the Virunga Force for having killed Tutsis?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, but there's a little bit too much leading going on.  This is a witness in direct examination.  If Mr. Robinson can simply ask him what transpired, that would be much more helpful.  I haven't objected many times in the past, but it's getting to be a bit repetitive.  The answer to the question should not be suggested in the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if you look back at that question, the answer is not suggested.  It's not a leading question.  He can answer that equally yes or no.  So I would ask that you allow me to ask that question because it's not leading.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will allow the witness to answer the question.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Kajelijeli, I will repeat the question.  At your swearing-in ceremony, did any of the speakers thank the Virunga Force for having killed the Tutsi? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I had asked Defence counsel not to refer to killing the Tutsis.  You see, Tutsis were my brothers.  I had friends who were Tutsi, and it pains me that Tutsis died.  I never heard anybody make such a statement.  And we are all human beings.  If you have listened to my testimony carefully, Mr. President, Your Honours, I stated that Tutsis who survived because I helped them had come to testify on my behalf.  They testified that I had saved a number of Tutsis at the time.  But before, no one -- no one claimed that Tutsis should be killed.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  And if I am putting these questions to you this way, it's because these are testimonies that we have heard from Prosecution witnesses, and it's necessary to put to you those testimonies in order to hear your side of the story, so that's why I am having to ask you about things that may seem to you to be outlandish.  

Now, after you became bourgmestre, did you take any steps to distribute the land of the Tutsis who had been killed or fled? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  My answer to Defence counsel will be final, once and for all.  The individual who fabricated that story is a Prosecution witness who was prepared to testify on the basis of a document against a promise of being released, and that will be Witness GAO.  These are two persons.  The interpreters missed the second pseudonym.  So two witnesses fabricated this story to the effect that Kajelijeli was involved in the distribution of land.  I saw an exhibit in which it was stated that the communal council of Mukingo had met and decided to distribute the land left by Tutsis.  This meeting was allegedly held in May.  And I read that exhibit, which stated that the préfet of Ruhengeri had allegedly outlined in a decision the manner in which such land distribution was to be conducted.  

Now, in order to put this matter to rest, once and for all, let me state that the préfet in his decision had accepted that the land belonging to Tutsis should be leased or rented out for a specific period.  At the time of that decision the communal authority in -- at the time, that is, in May 1994, decided to lease out that land, and the money was paid into the coffers of the commune.  I was not bourgmestre -- I was not yet bourgmestre at the time.  You see, the results of the elections were only declared after the decision to lease out Tutsi land had been taken, and that is evidence that I'm going to use in order to appeal for a review of my case.  

What I am saying, therefore, is that I also can mention witnesses who have recanted, 
Prosecution witnesses.  So I have that exhibit.  I have the fact that some witnesses recanted, and this all points to the fact as evidence, indeed, that I was not involved in that matter.  This is the answer I can provide to that question, Mr. President, Your Honours, namely, that I had nothing to do with the land issue, that is, the land of the Tutsis.  
Q.	Now, you told us that you became bourgmestre again in late June of 1994.  When did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Counsel, Rwanda has experienced many sad events.  While we were trying to improve the livelihood of our people, the war resumed, and so we left Mukingo commune on the 13th of July 1994.
Q.	And during that short period that you were bourgmestre, were any Tutsis killed in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  During those two weeks, should I say three weeks maybe, I had promised to the population that I will restore security if the RPF agreed to negotiate.  So, Mr. President, the truth is that no witness has come here to Arusha to confirm that after I took over office again as bourgmestre and up until the 13th of July 1994 there has been no witness here in Arusha who has testified that there was any attack in my commune.  So members of the population can confirm that no Tutsi was killed and nobody was attacked.  And to further lend credence to that, I can tell you that I went into exile with some Tutsis, and up until they returned to Rwanda none of them was attacked.  If any witness has testified to the contrary, that would be a lie.  What I have told you is the truth. 
Q.	Between the 6th of April 1994 and the time you went into exile, aside from the swearing-in ceremony, did you see Joseph Nzirorera on any other occasion? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I saw Nzirorera once again as I went to see my workers around the 12th of April, and he was looking for refuge for his family.  He had brought his family to Mukingo commune.  In fact, all figures of authority had left Kigali or Gitarama at that time.  And it is then that in passing I suddenly ran into Nzirorera.  We did not have a discussion, as such, because he was in a hurry, and the war was raging, so it was on the 12th of April that I saw him, if I am not mistaken. 
Q.	And between -- other than the 12th of April and the swearing-in ceremony sometime in late June, did you see Joseph Nzirorera on any other occasion after the death of President Habyarimana and before you went into exile? 
A.	If I have understood your question properly, my answer would be that after I went into exile -- after I went into exile, Nzirorera left Mukingo to settle in Gisenyi.  I did not see him in Gisenyi because we were all struggling to settle here and there.  We were all seeking places where we could feel safe, and I did not meet him.  I think I did not meet him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now I want to ask you about rape.  Were you aware at any time prior to going into exile that some women in Mukingo commune had been raped during the events after the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I am a Christian.  And when people talk about these matters I feel afflicted.  Since I lived in Mukingo, I never heard mention of rape.  If things -- such things took place later on, well, I was not aware of them.  I read some witness statements subsequently, and I only noticed that one Duclos or Rwagala had mentioned that issue of rape in a second statement which had been drafted and placed before the witness for signature.  So this is a lie that has been fabricated by Duclos.  

My observation is that reference to rape was made in that additional statement by a 
Prosecution witness who mentioned incidents of rape.  But I also note that relying on evidence in my possession, this witness recanted.  The witness appeared before the Gacaca courts and never mentioned anything about rape.  

So, to be brief, I want to say that I am not aware of any incidents of rape.  Mention is made of it, but it is a pure fabrication, and this has been crafted by Duclos and Rwagala.
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Robinson could enquire about the identity of the witness that this witness is referring to.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I am going to do that, and I'm going to, first of all, ask the registrar if, Mr. President, he can come and retrieve a piece of paper with the name on it so we can get more information without revealing the identity of the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, what I've seen written on that paper is a new name to these proceedings.  I think it would be better to have the witness himself write the name as opposed to having it suggested to him on the piece of paper, if Mr. Robinson doesn't mind.  

MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think I am suggesting anything, and without giving you more information in the presence of the witness, I don't want to say any more, but given the testimony -- there was testimony from that witness, and this testimony of the contact concerning events relating to that witness and Mr. Kajelijeli was made by a relative of that witness.  And I think this is the best way to do it, if you just bear with me.  It's not suggesting anything.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this is direct examination.  The witness can tell us who he has in mind.  He doesn't have to receive that information from Mr. Robinson.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, why can't the witness write down the name himself?  
MR. ROBINSON:
He can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you give the witness a pen and paper.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like you to write down the name of the woman who you were referring to when you said that the person's account had been suggested by these two individuals.  Do you remember the woman's name that you were referring to who's the witness? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I don't know whether you understood me very well.  I said that there was an additional statement by one Duclos who wanted to include the incident of rape in the trial.  That was done through a Prosecution witness whom I do remember.  So I do not know what problem you are encountering.  The Prosecutor knows that witness and I don't see where the problem arises.  
Q.	So just put the name of that witness down on that piece of paper and that way we can speak about that witness without mentioning her name in public.
A.	The pseudonym of that witness exists.  Why don't you want me to give you the pseudonym?  Anyway, I will proceed as you request.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I'm sorry about that, but we seem to be having a problem doing it this way because it's confusing.  What I was asking you to write down is the name of the woman who allegedly was raped, not the name of the witness who was talking about that.  Do you know -- without saying it out loud, do you know the name of the woman? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I do not know the name of the woman who may have been raped  and whom the witness was referring to.  What I know is that the said witness stated that one of his colleagues had raped some women, and that is contained in that witness's statement.  That is why we need to look into or at that witness's statement to find this information.  Otherwise I don't have any other details relating to that incident. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And now, Mr. President, if the registrar could give the witness the piece of paper that I had written the name on so we can make some progress with this.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So what is the question that is going to precede the piece of paper being shown to the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think at this time that we should ask that the witness be excused so we can discuss that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will allow the paper to be shown to the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, without repeating that name, do you know that person? 
A.	I know the name of that person, but I have never seen that person, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I have seen this name in witness statements in my case, but I have never seen the face of this individual.  Thank you. 
Q.	And did this individual ever report to you that his daughter was being raped by Michel Niyigaba and other members of his group? 
A.	Mr. President, I would like to say that I -- my understanding was that this person was a woman.  But if it is (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover), I know him.  He is someone who never came to my house to tell me that his daughter had been raped.  I know that person.  He is actually my relative.  But he has never complained to me about his daughter having been raped.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the witness inadvertently mentioned the name that's on the paper, so I'd ask that that be redacted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I make the order for redaction. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the piece of paper be admitted as D. NZ728, under seal.
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ728 admitted, under seal)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did you ever write a letter to Michel Niyigaba asking him to stop raping someone?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I do not know when I would have done such a thing.  The truth of the matter is that such a thing never happened, because I could never have written to 
Michel Niyigaba if that incident had occurred while I was bourgmestre and he was in the position in which he was.  If such a thing had happened, I would simply have arrested him and taken him to court.  So I would never have written such a letter.  I do not know how some people understand how the administrative hierarchy works.  I wouldn't have had to write to an inhabitant who has committed an offence.  All I would simply have done would have been to arrest him.  So this never happened. 
Q.	Now, did you hear about the death of a person named Noël Ndayisaba in Mukingo commune in 1994?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Yes, I heard mention of that, indeed.  I was returning from a private activity, and I heard that one soldier, Mburuburengero, had killed Noël Ndayisaba.  I did not have the opportunity to investigate why he had been shot.  We were really grieved, and we were burying some victims, and as the war was raging, when someone was killed, that person would be buried before investigations were conducted.  But also we had the problem that many of those who could have conducted the investigations had left the country.  It is in those circumstances that I learnt of the death of Noël Ndayisaba. 
Q.	Did you receive any information that Noël Ndayisaba had been shot because he was raping women on a bus, or who had been on a bus? 
A.	People were saying that he had stopped a bus from driving on.  Nobody ever said that he had been shot down because he had raped women.  What people were saying was that he was shot because he had stopped a bus from driving on.  The préfet had been asked to send soldiers to release that bus, and so when Noël stopped the bus from pursuing its journey, the soldier known as Mburuburengero shot him dead, and the reason being that he had stopped the bus from driving on and it had nothing to do with any rape.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Kajelijeli.  Maybe my last topic for today.  When you were arrested in 1998 in Benin, you were in the home of Joseph Nzirorera.  Can you tell us how it was after going into exile that you ended up in the home of Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  We went into exile abandoning our homes and our property behind as we went out, not knowing where we would end.  So I was in Kinshasa, and when the RPF brought the war to Kinshasa we went in different directions.  I went to Brazzaville and then on to Benin where I met Nzirorera as I was looking for a home.  And while looking for my own home I asked him to host me temporarily and he accepted to do so.  So before I got my own home I was in Nzirorera's house.  And he was arrested pursuant to a warrant -- an arrest warrant.  

So while I was there they were mistaken as to Nzirorera's identity and arrested me.  So when we got to the central police station, they noticed that they had been mistaken.  So when I introduced myself, they said, "Oh, let us arrest that fat man.  We will conduct the investigations subsequently."  So I was jailed for four months without an arrest warrant, without any charges, and so I spent all of that time in Benin.  
And then later on I was taken to the UNDF here in Arusha.  

Now, if you look at the indictment, at my indictment, you will note that the indictment was drafted after I was arrested.  So the fact of the matter is that there was an issue of mistaken identity.  I was arrested because people believed that I was Nzirorera.  And then accusations were fabricated against me, and it is on the basis of those false accusations that I have been prosecuted.  But if justice does really exist, then the time must come when justice will be done and justice will triumph, and I will be found innocent.  

And I think, Mr. President, that this will do honour to the Rwandans.  These are the circumstances in which I was arrested.  I met Nzirorera in Benin.  He was kind enough to host me in his house while I was still looking for my own house. 
Q.	And approximately how long did you live with Mr. Nzirorera in Benin before your arrest? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I can say that I spent about a year with him.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, at this time I suggest we take our recess, and I will continue with a different topic tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much longer do you anticipate going?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe about two hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to take --

Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, with your leave I can say something in one minute.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have one minute.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to call you Father, as we do back home.  

(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and kept under separate cover)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your remarks will be noted.  

THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In relation to our case though, we are going to take our adjournment for today now.  We will resume tomorrow morning.  I should inform you, as I'm sure you know already, that during this or any adjournment while you are a witness you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have taken good note.
(Court adjourned at 1533H)
