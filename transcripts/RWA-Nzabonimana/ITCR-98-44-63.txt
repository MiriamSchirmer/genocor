MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Could the registry introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber this afternoon. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 10th of April 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case, when Defence counsel Mr. Hinds will conduct the examination-in-chief of the Accused Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli, in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.

May we have the appearance of the parties starting with the Prosecution, please?   
MS. OJEMENI:
With due respect, Your Honours, Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney.  I appear with Dorothée Marotine, case manager for the Prosecution.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  

May we also have the appearance of the Defence, please?
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka, who is out of Court but we expect him momentarily, and our assistant, Juliette Chinaud and the interpreter, Emilien Dusabe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, learned counsel for the Defence, Professor Hinds. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we are -- the Defence is having some problems and the Court may be aware of some of them, but we have been working since 9 o'clock this morning and have not gotten as far as we had planned or hoped to in terms of preparing Mr. Kajelijeli.  

In addition, we had planned during this session to introduce into evidence Mr. Kajelijeli's interview in Benin, that is, staff of the ICTR when he was arrested, interviewed him and took statements from him.  

The Prosecutor provided us with copies of the statement and also with a transcript in French.  We plan to play that at this particular session, but there are some technical problems that we now realise exist.  So we would like to apply for an adjournment until Monday.  We feel that it would result in us moving forward more smoothly, but not be an undue delay on the Court.  We have not asked for any adjournment since this trial has started in close to two years.  We are talking now about an essence of two and half hours of Court time, and it would enable us to deal with, hopefully, the technical problems that -- in terms of just the tape and I understand it is not just simply a question of playing the tape, but also the court reporters needing to have at least just not the French transcript of the tape that we have now, but they also need an English transcript, I am told.  I had not --
MR. KIYEYEU:
Maybe just for the record, My Lord, it is not the court reporters, but it is the interpreters.
MR. HINDS:
Oh, I am sorry.  I said court reporters instead of interpreters.  And so I was not even aware of these technical problems.  I just assumed that it would be -- the facilities would be available to plug a tape in, it will go through the PA system and it will be simultaneously translated into all of the languages, since the interview was in French.  But it is more complicated than that, I am told.  And being mindful of all of that, and I think so that we can move through the proceedings, I am asking -- applying for an adjournment until Monday for us to get started. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At what stage do you need to use that tape?
MR. HINDS:
We were going to use it within -- we anticipate one hour or so after we got started. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One hour after you get started?
MR. HINDS:
Yeah, after we get into approximately, I mean -- I can't -- but I assume that it would be, I mean, just taking Mr. Kajelijeli -- I mean, if you put my feet to fire and you say okay, look, you just have to go, then we would proceed with preliminaries.  

I will come to a point when he was arrested and he gave a statement and so on, and we will play it.  I may anticipate about an hour.  But in any event, Your Honour, the other application I was going to make if the Court said no, we have got to start him sometime, let's do what we can, then we would be able to finish his preparation over the weekend.  

So, I am at your disposal however you want us to proceed.  I would prefer if we had an adjournment and then started on Monday and just go through it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, do you have any comments to make on this application by the Prosecution -- by the Defence, I beg your pardon?
MS. OJEMENI:
Perhaps, my learned friend can enlighten the Court more than this playing of the tape, his request to play the tape in Court, because I know that the tape will last about three hours or more.  And I know that yesterday he told me about this when we adjourned.  But he mentioned that it was because the transcripts he has contain a lot of discrepancies.  So if he could point out the areas that he is having problems with or their variations, perhaps we can also look into that because the translation was done by the translation department which translates for both parties, and he has had the documents since for over two years.  So at least in the interests of judicial economy, if he can do that, then we can sort it out before the Accused starts testifying on Monday.  

We are ready to proceed, and if the Accused is not ready to proceed, as my learned friend has said, well, perhaps we would look into the transcript and resolve that tomorrow before the Accused takes the stand on Monday, because we are not aware of what went wrong with the transcription of the tapes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we have -- that is the Defence, have listened to the tape.  My staff tells me that the tape -- I have -- because the tape is in French, I haven't listened to it.  So the French-speaking people have listened to it.  They have told me what is on it, and I have listened to the translation that they have given me.  The information I have is that the interview is 30 minutes in total.  It is about 15 minutes on one tape and the same amount of time on the other tape.  So we are not dealing with -- we don't intend to play it in three hours.  So there is a difference between what we know is on the tape and what the Prosecution suggests is three hours.  We would not play three hours of the tape, that is not our plan.  It is 30 minutes in total.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to play it in Court, in the course of the proceeding?
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the course of the proceedings?
MR. HINDS:
In the course of the proceedings.  The interview of Kajelijeli at the time of his arrest, it's 30 minutes and not three hours.  That is the only point I am making in terms of the information that I have, and maybe we could sort that out with the Prosecution, and that they may have three hours of tape, but what we were given is two tapes, each of it having 15 minutes.  That is the only point I am making in terms of correcting the information that the Prosecutor has just given us, Ms. Ojemeni. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am aware that there is some sort of problem with the tape, you know, even when we tried to play it with the Defence, I remember that we spent more than three hours in 2000, trying to transcribe the tape.  So if they have reduced it to 30 minutes, well we have the original, we will play the original if the Court is minded (sic) to concede to their request, so we will play the original anywhere. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This would be the ruling of the Trial Chamber in this case.  We had expected to be able to start the evidence of the Accused from now up to the end of the day, that is 5:30, but if there are obstacles that we cannot go beyond one hour or thereabouts, because of the problem Counsel for the Defence have pointed out, then we think it might be -- it is practical and it might be the best way of organising our work to start the testimony of the accused person on Monday.  

And in the meantime, we expect counsel from both sides to sort out this problem with regard to the tape, so that when we come on Monday, if there are any problems attended to that tape are resolved and we are able to proceed smoothly.  

And Professor Hinds, in the light of the fact that we have not been able to continue, we are not holding it against the Defence at all, but we would invite that everything possible should be done so that when we begin on Monday, we move on smoothly and maybe speedily, to conduct the evidence of the accused person.  You had indicated to the Trial Chamber that you will need -- you indicated two days, I suppose two days, that is cross-examination and examination-in-chief.
MR. HINDS:
No, no.  Two days for Mr. Kajelijeli on direct and we anticipate an equal amount of time for cross; two days for Kajelijeli on direct and I anticipate two days on cross.  That is why, Your Honour, we said that we were looking at two and a half weeks.  Now, let's look at it.  We said that we would have the first witness, it will be one day.  The second witness, we thought another day, both cross and direct.  And then we thought that we would have four days for Kajelijeli, making a total of what -- of six days, one and a half weeks.  The Court then said okay, under that situation, the Prosecution ought to organise themselves in terms of what they intended to do with the rest of the time.  That is what I understood. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We do understand that, but we invite you to see how best you can cut down at least to a day and a half, so that we are able to move, see what both of you can do.  
So these proceedings stand adjourned till Monday at 9 o' clock in the morning.  Until then, the proceedings are adjourned. 
	(Court adjourned at 1505H)
