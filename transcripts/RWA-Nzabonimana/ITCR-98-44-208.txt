MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Karin Hökborg; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, 29th November 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony will commence again.  Hopefully, it will end during the course of the morning session.  Under the rules of our Court, the lawyer who examined you first will have a chance to re-examine you, and Mr. Hooper will do that this morning.  I remind you that you're under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began giving your testimony last week.  

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS 6/10,
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Now, yesterday you were asked some questions about statements that you had made to the -- to the -- both parties, both in respect of the Prosecution, first of all, and -- and, secondly, to the Defence.  And I want to ask you a little about those statements.  

The first statement, as we heard, that you made was a statement to the investigators of this Tribunal -- or, rather, investigators on behalf of the Prosecution for this Tribunal, dated the 11th of August of 1999.  
MR. HOOPER:
And I've asked that, in fact, a copy, unredacted -- because at the moment I've only got redacted -- of both the French and the English statements be provided by the Prosecution.  I haven't chased that up this morning, but I put in that request yesterday.  Are there copies, please, for the witness, and, in particular, as he's francophone, is there a copy of the French unredacted statement to this witness?  

Is there a problem?  

I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I could have sorted this out -- or, should have sorted this out before we started this morning.  There isn't a copy.  Is it possible, please, for both the unredacted English and French versions to be copied?  And I'll come back to this subject, not at the beginning, but at the end of my re-examination, in about 15 minutes. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I apologise for being late. 
MR. HOOPER:
I was just saying that yesterday, you may recall, that I asked for a copy of the unredacted French and English Prosecution statement made by this witness, and I should have chased that up as an act of housekeeping this morning.  And I think it may be that we've forgotten about it.  And I'm asking in those circumstances, could it be copied over the next 10 or 15 minutes, both the English and the French unredacted, not redacted, as I've got, and -- so that we can provide them to the witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
We'll certainly attend to that now.  But may I just mention -- if the witness might take his headphones off, please. 

I anticipate that my learned friend is going in due course to be inviting Your Honour to admit into evidence his previous statements.  And it will be an application by the person calling the witness to put into evidence, presumably as evidence of the truth of the content of the statements, what the witness has previously said.  Now, under cross-examination it may be that a cross-examiner might invite the putting into evidence of a previous statement in order to demonstrate inconsistencies, but the application which I anticipate is coming will be an application to put in effectively self-serving statements, statements which my learned friend may be seeking to put before the Court in order to demonstrate consistency on the part of the witness.  

It would be my respectful submission, although the application hasn't been made yet, but anticipating it will be, that an application by a person who calls a witness to put into evidence his previous statements as evidence of the truth of that content to show consistency is an application to put before the Court self-serving statements, and that should not take place.  However, insofar as my learned friend needs the statement in order to be able to put it before the witness for questioning, then we're going to provide, of course, a copy.  Anticipating the later application, Your Honour has my thoughts. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Morley, as I understand the law, prior consistent statements are not admissible.  So I accept your proposition that the witness statement is only admissible in connection with allegations of prior inconsistent statements.  

Now, on the other hand, if a cross-examiner puts to a witness that there has been an inconsistency, then it would be useful for the Court to see the statement to make an assessment as to whether that is an accurate representation of the position. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is almost certainly right insofar as an inconsistency is demonstrated not to be an inconsistency.  But what I anticipate my learned friend will be doing is, insofar as there's been any inconsistency, demonstrating that the inconsistency is not an inconsistency, if that is what he is able to do, but will go much further by putting in evidence those other aspects, the entirety of the statement which -- or, the statements which have been made, which do not go to demonstrating that there is no inconsistency on a particular point, which is a subject of cross-examination.  Instead, he will be using the vehicle of demonstrating that there has been no inconsistency on some narrow point, for example, the point we raised yesterday about the older son, the eldest son.  He will be going much further and trying to show that the entire narrative of the witness's testimony and three statements may or may not be consistent with what Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues have heard.  

What I would respectfully submit is that, insofar as my learned friend wishes to demonstrate that there is no inconsistency on a narrow point, he's able to examine the witness in order to demonstrate that within the statement there is no inconsistency.  And that's on a narrow section of the statement.  But to actually apply to put in the entire statement goes way beyond the function of the re-examination and the calling of a witness.  

So it's not limited to dealing with showing that an inconsistency has not taken place.  It goes much further than that.  But the application hasn't been made yet, and we wait to see how it develops. 
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I must admit that your English sounds beautiful; however, I didn't understand a single thing of what you were saying because you were speaking too fast.  English is a foreign language, and I think it would probably not help if I put it into the French interpretation.  So a brief résumé of your whole intervention would be useful if we have to rule on it, or, otherwise, maybe I can get the résumé from my colleague, Judge Byron.  

But please consider that I am here with two foreign languages, and if you want to speak to Judge Byron very quickly and to your colleague, fine, but don't count on me.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
I do apologise, Your Honour.  I understand the point.  I'll go more slowly.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, can I come back to this when the copy has been made of the -- of the statement and, as my friend has put it, we can see how it develops?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Continue.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, appreciate you didn't, and were not meant to, follow that, but we're going to come back to the question of the statements in a short while when we've got a copy of that Prosecution statement you made for you to look at.  

Now, let me just go on to a few points that were raised with you yesterday.  It was suggested that the Prosecution case here involved allegations that André Rwamakuba was with soldiers, and you were asked questions about soldiers coming to Gikomero commune.  In fact, I -- it's not the Prosecution case that André Rwamakuba was ever with soldiers, as I understand it, with perhaps -- and I make one allusion to Kayanga health centre where there was, I think, a reference to soldiers.  Now, in respect to the latter, did you ever see a lorry, a lorry full of soldiers at any time?  
MR. HOOPER:
And I hope "lorry" can be translated.  I notice that sometimes vehicles get mistranslated, and I'm not sure what a lorry is in French. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Camion. 
MR. HOOPER:
Camion.  Thank you.  A camion full of soldiers.  
THE WITNESS:
I stated yesterday that, when I was at Rugogwe, a bus came from Bumgogo (sic)  full of soldiers.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And when you refer to Bumbogo, we can see on our sketch plan where that lies, to the south of the commune -- oh, in fact, is Bumbogo in another commune, or is itself another place? 
A.	Bumbogo is in Gikomero commune, and there passes a road through there coming from Kami military camp. 
Q.	In fact, thinking back to the photographs we saw, did we get a photograph of that road and of 
	Bumbogo hill?  Can you remember that we saw one or not? 
A.	Yes, I pointed out Bumbogo hill in the photographs. 
Q.	Now, you were also asked questions in relation to your meeting with André Rwamakuba in Gitarama.  You may recall those questions.  And -- 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	-- and -- and you were perhaps, as I understand it, criticised for not going into the history of events with Mr. Rwamakuba in greater detail.  And you were telling us that you had a short conversation, and, in fact, that was essentially in respect of the death of his father and his brother-in-law; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And it may be that you've been asked this question previously, but I ask it again now in case not.  What was Dr. Rwamakuba's reaction to that news? 
A.	Quite simply, great sadness.  I would say that he was upset, saddened by the news.  That's all I can say.  And then our ways parted.  
Q.	Now, you were asked some questions about the interim government, and you expressed the view, you may recall, that, in your view, it was a useless government, for it did no good; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  That government did nothing of any good, achieved nothing.  It was named the Abatabazi government, meaning a government of saviors, who saved nothing, in fact.  I don't know whether it was because of lack of will or powerlessness, but that government achieved nothing, did nothing of any value.  
Q.	A number of times your going to -- or, flight to the Congo was referred to, and it was put to you that you had travelled and joined with the murderers who left for the Congo.  And you agreed that you did indeed travel with murderers and end up in the Congo; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, but there weren't only killers among those people.  There were among them people who hadn't taken part in the killings.  
Q.	I don't know if you're in a position to help us, but have you any idea how many people fled Rwanda at that time? 
A.	I am not in a position to give you a figure, but they were very many in the refugee camps.  I think there was a census made, but the figures were skewered (sic).  A person might be counted from two to ten times, so much so that it was impossible to know the exact number of refugees.  However, were I to make an estimate, I'd say that there were more than two million. 
Q.	Now, you were also asked about André Rwamakuba going and visiting his parents, and you explained your word, or the word that was used in English, of "habit" -- and I don't go into that again -- but, to your knowledge, from the time that President Habyarimana was killed and perhaps the chaos descended on Rwanda, from that time, are you aware of André Rwamakuba visiting his mother and father or his sisters, nieces, or nephews who were living there or going there, to help them or to take them to safety?  Are you aware of any visit that he made there? 
A.	He never came.  Had he come, he could have helped some family members to flee or evacuate them because other people, who had the means, were able to evacuate members of their family.  He couldn't make it there, and that is due in part to the fact that there were obstacles on the road.  It was not possible for him to come.  
Q.	Now, you were asked also about number 10 on the list and your conversation with number 10 and why and how you concluded that number 10 was lying, or had lied, by your understanding or assumption of the evidence he must have given.  

Now, would it be correct to say that you assumed that number 10 came here to say that he'd seen Rwamakuba in Gikomero during the war itself?  Would that be your -- your assumption of what number 10 said or not? 
A.	When I met number 10, we exchanged words as usual, and I had no thought regarding his testimony.  As I told you, it is up to my -- *************************************, so it is someone that I see regularly.  I put the question to him that I have put to him, and when he finished telling me about his trip, he told me that he'd come here.  And that's when I put the question to him.  

As to the why of my question, what I thought when I put the question to him, well, I had no thoughts in the back of my mind.  It was a spontaneous question.  I put the question to him after he'd spoken to me about his trip and his testimony here before the Tribunal in Arusha.  
Q.	Let me approach my question another way.  Number 10, in his evidence before -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the witness might take his headphones off, please.  

It's my respectful submission that my learned friend's re-examination should not amount to a cross-examination of his own witness on the testimony of a previous witness.  In order to conduct what I anticipate my learned friend is about to do, he's going to start putting propositions of fact as to what was said in evidence by the Witness GLM -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, slowly, slowly.  
MR. MORLEY:
-- and invite comment from the witness as to the veracity of that evidence.  The veracity of the evidence is a matter for Your Honours, and certainly under re-examination it would not be, I respectfully submit, appropriate, ever, to put propositions of fact about what a previous witness has said.  

So in my respectful submission, Mr. Hooper should not go down the road he's about to go down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I think the cross-examination seemed to proceed on an assumption that number 10 had been claiming that -- or, I'm -- that number 10 -- 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for removing your earphones.  

That number 10 had put André Rwamakuba there during the -- during the events, during the genocide, during the war, and that it -- it appeared, certainly to my ears, that that was this witness's understanding, that that's not, in fact, the evidence of number 10.  And to some extent we've had the comment of this witness in respect of the generality of, for example, the area of number 10's evidence, which was of visits, political meetings, before the 6th of April.  

I was going to put to this witness the specific assertions, not necessarily rooted to number 10, on the basis of if it was suggested that, that there were meetings in October, November, and December and that these things were said, what his reaction would be to that and, given that he's accusing number 10 of lying, invite his view in terms of association of those comments with number 10.  And I'd submit that that would be admissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
The difficulty here is, as my learned friend has rightly pointed out, firstly, this witness has assumed that number 10 has given evidence of seeing Rwamakuba in the Gikomero area during the war.  Secondly, GLM did not give that evidence.  So as a matter of comment on a later date, it would be said that the witness has made an assumption about lies which, on the evidence, were never made, lies or not.  

What has not taken place during cross-examination is an enquiry into the reliability of GLM in his description of seeing Rwamakuba organising rallies in the Gikomero area in October, November, and January '93, '94.  What my learned friend is seeking to do now is open up a different area in re-examination, which was not the subject of cross-examination, and, in any event, it amounts to a cross-examination of his own witness by putting propositions and leading the witness to propositions of fact against a background of inviting the witness to say that anything said by GLM must be a lie.  

So there are two reasons why this line of enquiry is wrong.  Firstly, it did not arise under cross-examination because the witness is plainly mistaken about his assumption of lies; and, secondly, to conduct this line of enquiry would amount to cross-examining his own witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we don't think that it is appropriate for you to re-examine on the testimony of GLM. 
MR. HOOPER:
I won't, then.  Thank you.  

Now, I think we've got the statements (sic) of the original Prosecution statement.  Thank you very much.  And are there sufficient copies for the Judges as well?  

Thank you very much.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe the booths?  No?  Not necessary?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm sorry.  We were rather more hand-to-mouth this morning.  And, in fact, I don't think we've got any copies for the Judges; is that right? 
MR. MORLEY:
We have copies -- we have a copy in French, copy in English for the witness.  And I know that my learned friend has a copy in English.  So -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I've got a redacted -- I have a redacted copy that was served -- apparently served in July of 2005, but this would be the as-yet unserved, unredacted statement.  And I notice that one of the Prosecution team has gone off with alacrity to make the photocopy, and hopefully that will be here in a few minutes.  Will it?  

Thank you very much.  Well, perhaps while we're dealing with that, can we have what we have produced to the -- to the witness, please.  

And I don't know if the Prosecution have available the original signed statement, which is really what we need to see.  

Yes, we have that.  

Very well.  Thank you very much.  And thank the Prosecution for producing that.  

And can the witness, who is French-speaking -- has been handed a copy of the statement he made on Wednesday, the 11th of August, 1999, in French, where we can see he was interviewed by Shiyo Bazo and Pierre Duclos.  And there was an interpreter used as well.  And it contains all the information we're familiar with, with such statements.  And I don't have the -- oh, you have the -- the original, as it were, a photocopy of the original French interview, which is signed by you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that correct, Mr. Witness, signed by you? 
A.	Quite.  I'd signed this document, and I recognise my signature affixed thereto. 
Q.	And in this document *************************************************, where you were living, a history of the administrative background of the commune, ******************************** -- excuse me -- with various bourgmestres within the commune, and you also refer to your knowledge, general administrative or political knowledge, of André Rwamakuba.  And I see --
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  If the French -- if the French -- two French and one English version of this can be provided to the Bench, please, or whatever.  

And if there's an excess of this document that's been brought in, or relative excess, could a copy please go to the interpreters?  Thanks.  They have them.  Thank -- thank you very much indeed. 
MR. MORLEY:
To assist Your Honours, we have a French and an English.  Do we want two French, one English, or two English, one French?  I've got two English, one French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's preferable.  That's preferable. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I thought it might be. 
MR. HOOPER:
The President will take the French one, I think, as well. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President.  Could you move your microphone just a bit nearer, please. 

No, the President's microphone, in case he talks further.  

Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Now, I'm not going to read this through.  Not only would it require a closed session, but we can scan it much more quickly and refer to it perhaps later. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, just as my learned friend has made those observations -- perhaps if the witness might take off his headphones again, please.  

The whole idea of possibly reading the document through, or scanning it, is precisely the point I'm trying to make about that being inappropriate.  What my learned friend is entitled to do, in the usual way, is draw the witness's attention to what may, under cross-examination, have amounted to an inconsistency and invite the witness to look at that section of the statement which shows there has not been an inconsistency, if that is demonstrable.  

But what my learned friend is not entitled to do is simply go through this document, scanning it or reading it out, or otherwise.  It amounts to cross-examining his own witness because he's leading the witness in what the witness has said previously.  And, secondly, it amounts to inviting the presentation before the trier of fact a self-serving statement.  

So if my learned friend has aspects of testimony under cross-examination which suggest an inconsistency which is resolvable, of course he can take the witness there, but what we shouldn't be doing is simply reading through this document.  
MR. HOOPER:
This witness was impugned on the basis of inconsistency, and he was impugned on the basis of an inconsistency that was demonstrated, the Prosecution asserted, through inconsistencies in his statements.  So the trier of fact, in order to be in the best and fairest position, is entitled to have access to the totality of the statements in order to see the generality of consistency.  Earlier this morning when Mr. Morley objected to this because -- on the basis that I was putting previous consistent statements to a witness, I must say, I was -- I wondered whether he meant to say that.  

Is it, indeed -- I ask rhetorically, but -- but also pointedly -- is it the position here that the Prosecution is saying that these statements are consistent or show, indeed, a general consistency?  Because if that's the case, then that's a departure from my understanding of the Prosecution position.  If that is the case, then I needn't trouble Your Honours.  
MR. MORLEY:
The witness was only cross-examined in respect of his previous statements on two points.  The first was that all of his statements refer to his being at Kayanga health centre, and none of them refer to his having seen anything happen there.  The second was in relation to his Defence statements.  He, the witness, on the 22nd of July 2004, referred to the death of his eldest son as having been something that he saw, which was inconsistent with what he was saying in evidence.  

In terms of the statement which my learned friend has, the only aspect of that statement which has been the subject of an alleged inconsistency, but it's a significant one, is there is reference to the witness having been at the health centre, and there is no reference at all to seeing anything happen there.  

Now, my learned friend is not in a position of curing that inconsistency because it's plain on the face of it.  Namely, he can go to the sentence which refers to the family being in the health centre, and he can then, unhappily, demonstrate that there is nothing said about what was seen there.  So that inconsistency is not resolvable.  But it is a description of the cross-examination which is inaccurate to say that the witness was examined extensively on inconsistencies in his previous statements.  It's been on two points, but they may have been significant.  And that does not give licence, I respectfully submit, to simply put in evidence the four or five pages per statement of this witness's unhappy description of those events which befell his family.  
And I respectfully submit that what my learned friend is seeking to do, and I think I know why he's doing it, and I'm not going to say yet, I think I know why, but my learned friend is seeking to put material before the Court under the guise of suggesting that the witness has been extensively cross-examined on an inconsistency.  But, actually, there's another point to this.  If my learned friend wants to know the way my mind is working about why I think he's doing this, of course, I'll elaborate.  But at this point, it is probably inappropriate.  

On a narrow point, this business of putting the whole statement in on two points of inconsistency is entirely wrong.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just before I readdress that, I wonder if in a sentence my friend can tell me what's in my mind about some other purpose because it's a bit Delphic to me. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend's an old hand.  Dates, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm afraid that's passed me by, but -- in all frankness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the point is this:  You see, if a statement is entitled to be admitted to address an allegation by the cross-examiner that there is an inconsistency, isn't the rule that the whole document goes in?  You -- you can't separate a sentence from the statement.  The rule is that the whole document will go -- if it is admissible, if any part of it is admissible, then the whole document goes in. 
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully submit, absolutely not.  On the factual allegation of inconsistency, if that fact can be cured by demonstrating there was no inconsistency in the statement, that's perfectly legitimate re-examination --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 
MR. MORLEY:
-- but insofar as an inconsistency is demonstrable, it doesn't entitle my learned friend to put in the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Morley -- 
MR. MORLEY:
(Microphones overlapping)...to show other consistencies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...you can't -- the document does not become evidence of the truth of its contents.  
MR. MORLEY:
But that's the point behind putting it in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but it's not evidence.  I mean, we are -- we are not a jury.  The document is not evidence of its contents.  The only use to which a document can be put by us is to demonstrate whether or not there is an inconsistency, a prior inconsistent statement.  If there's a prior inconsistent statement that will impact to some extent, it will be a factor to take into account in assessing the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.  If there's no prior inconsistent statement, we could only rue the time spent in cross-examination on the point. 
MR. MORLEY:
However, if there is a consistency demonstrated on matters which are arguably peripheral to the issue before the Court, which is the guilt of Rwamakuba or not, that consistency is offered to the Court as being the truth of its content. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, it's not evidence.  A prior consistent statement is not evidence of the truth of its contents.  I think that's the basic rule.  
MR. MORLEY:
But insofar as a prior consistent statement is not evidence, it is not admissible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but what is admissible is the issue of a prior inconsistency.  If it is contained in a document, the document goes in.  I mean, we are not a jury. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour has -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't see how one can separate the two.  We would be entitled to make an assessment, was there, in fact, an inconsistency or not, and we do it by looking at the document.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour has moved the ball from consistency to inconsistency. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but -- but that's enough.  That's how we understand it.
MR. MORLEY:
Insofar as there is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...I understand your point, you see, but -- but -- but -- but for your point to be accurate, it means that we would have to be doing our job improperly. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, perfectly properly, can look at a document to examine whether an inconsistency is made out -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 
MR. MORLEY:
-- however, where there has not been an allegation on other factual areas of inconsistency, what Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, I respectfully submit, are not entitled to do is to look at the consistency about those matters about which there hasn't been an allegation of inconsistency. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but we (unintelligible) the law.  I don't -- I don't think we have any doubt on that issue, that a prior consistent statement is not evidence of its contents, of the truth of its contents.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  Insofar as a prior consistent statement is not evidence, it's my respectful submission it's not admissible.  What is admissible is a demonstration of how there has not been an inconsistency on a relevant fact. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. -- Mr. Morley, if there is a document which contains a number of statements of fact which are consistent with the witness's testimony, but in that document there are two or three sentences which contradict or conflict or are inconsistent with his testimony, in this Court we are entitled to look at the document to determine whether there is an inconsistency.  And it will impact on our assessment of the witness's credibility.  Now, the mere fact that that inconsistent statement is contained in a document where there are consistency statements, we don't cut out the three sentences and look at that alone.  The entire document will be admitted.  The -- those aspects of the document which are consistent with his testimony are not evidence, and they do not play any role in the decision-making process.  They assist us to evaluate whether there is an inconsistency or not.  That's the extent of it.  
MR. MORLEY:
I see the way Your Honour's mind is working.  It's my respectful submission that that is going too far.  One can look at the material on the inconsistency to see if there is one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean only in court?  You realise that we have to remember what we looked at in court without refreshing our memory when we come to making an assessment of the facts? 
MR. MORLEY:
If I was in Mr. Hooper's position, I would be thinking that I can refer, and read into the transcript of the court proceedings, to those aspects of the statement which were the subject of alleged inconsistency but are demonstrably not inconsistent.  And Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, firstly, hear the evidence and, secondly, have in the transcript what the evidence is for future reference, for memory refreshment.  That is, I respectfully submit, the way that it can be done.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
I agree it can be done that way.  But -- but I don't think that's the only way that it can be done.  But that is certainly how it can be done. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I don't know if I can put Mr. Morley's mind at rest here.  I think the way I would treat this statement, I think, would demonstrate the proposition that you can't see a line or two in isolation.  You have to see it in the context of the entire statement.  And here the inconsistency that's alleged is why didn't you mention killings at Kayanga health centre.  And when we look at the totality of this statement, it's the Defence submission that, taken in its context, it doesn't cry out for such a mention.  That's the relevance of the entirety of the statement.  

So if I may, and my friend -- Mr. President's leave, proceed to just review this evidence -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can do that, Mr. -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I hope, Mr. Witness, you've -- I think you've had the opportunity of at least going through the French version of that statement made by you.  Again, I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a comment I can't resist making, Mr. Hooper.  How much more time do you intend to take with this witness? 
MR. HOOPER:
As quickly as possible. I think that my entire -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope -- I hope that the fact that we have a little extra time allocated to our trial today is not going to cause an expansion of the examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
The lawyers will fit the time available, as you know.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. HOOPER:
No.  In fact, I assess my re-examination as 20 minutes, so that's almost certainly 30 minutes.  It would be that.  And I'll take it, I hope, as briefly as I can.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Looking at this statement dated Wednesday, the 11th of August 1999, provided by you to the ICTR Prosecution investigators -- we now have it, and the Judges have it -- we can see the details of the first and second page.  

And I'm looking at page 3 of the statement, which is a start of the narrative of the statement.  And I'm just going to skim through it, with your assistance, Mr. Witness.  And you declare this to be your first meeting with the investigators, and you state at the beginning that you were willing to testify if your safety and that of your family is guaranteed.  

Now, I just want to pause there and ask you some questions that have got nothing to do with this statement.  

Have you ever been invited by the Prosecution to be a witness in this case, or in any other? 
A.	No.  The Prosecutor never asked me to come and give testimony in this matter, or any other matter.  I tell -- I asked him when I would come to give testimony, and he said that it was a professional secret and that he couldn't tell me.  In any case, he asked me whether I was prepared to come before this Trial Chamber.  I told him that I was ready to come.  And --
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- and he also told me what trial I would be testifying at.  
Q.	Which Trial Chamber was it that you were invited to come before?  In respect of which case? 
A.	When they came to conduct their investigations, they did not tell me what trial I should appear at.  But afterwards, I don't remember the year exactly, I was called to the office of the prosecutor in Kigali, and there I was told that I should appear in the Kamuhanda trial.  So when the time came, they never did ask me to take part in the trial of Kamuhanda. 
Q.	Returning to the statement, you recite, as we can see in the first paragraph and thereafter, ********************************************** your observations generally in the commune and history of some events, administrative events in the commune, refugees and the like.  And then towards the second-but-last paragraph concludes that you mention there Rwamakuba, as we can see.  And then you come to April '94, and at the bottom of page 3, you start your narrative of events there.  And I don't go into that, the 8th, the 9th, the attack on you.  

And I want to come just briefly to the bottom of the second paragraph, penultimate line, where you say, and this dealing with a specific suggested inconsistency in a later statement with your evidence -- this, of course, is a 1999 statement to the Prosecution -- where you say, "As they looted, they found one of the Tutsi refugees inside the house.  They brought this young man into the yard, and I watched them kill him.  I fled to the commune office, and my family and I took refuge at the bourgmestre's house."  

Now, in respect of that, that's what you say then, and I don't ask you to, in fact, comment.  We can perhaps draw our own conclusions.  You then go on about the events on the 10th, 12th, 13th, if you recall these dates.  And over the page, we then have in the context of the paragraph at the bottom of page 4, "And I fled the commune office sector, fled to the eastern part of Gikomero," so-and-so "saved the family by giving them a ride in his vehicle to the Kayanga health centre, where I joined them.  We remained at Kayanga until the 18th of April.  When the RPF soldiers arrived, they questioned me at length and freed me, asking me to leave the Interahamwe.  They took my wife with them." 

And -- and that's, for your reference and the context in your narrative here, of referring to Kayanga health centre.  You refer to arriving in Gitarama in late May "where I met minister Rwamakuba."  

And your -- who you greeted.  There's no reference there to conversations.  Again, a reference to "while working in Gikomero, I met Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, André Rwamakuba, and Anastase Gasana."  And Anastase Gasana, we know, was later foreign minister under the Kagami RPF government, "met them in a professional capacity." 

Then you're asked about political parties, then you make a comment about civil servants, then you talk about media, then you talk about never witnessing crimes of a sexual nature, then you talk about Interahamwe, and that's the conclusion of your statement.  And you formally acknowledge that that statement is indeed -- is indeed yours.  

Now, subsequently, you met two separate Defence investigators; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I met the investigators -- Defence investigators on two occasions, on two different occasions.  But I still deny meeting the Defence investigator on the 22nd of July 2004.  Perhaps you might tell me what the name of the investigator is so that I might see -- try to remember on what date I met him.  
Q.	All right.  Well, let me come to that in -- in due course.  You made a five-and-a-half-page statement in the English on the 22nd -- or, a statement was made from your meeting of the 22nd of April 2004, Defence statement -- 
MR. HOOPER:
And I've no objection to this being exhibited either, or the next one, but -- maybe I can deal with it then, as Mr. Morley gets to his feet with a shake of his head, in a different way.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It's a four- -- five-page statement relating events, and it refers to, on the specific point, "Interahamwe, who attacked me on the 9th of April, were coming from Nyacyonga camp of displaced persons and some locals of Nduba secteur.  There were about 50 persons.  

"After killing that boy I talked about," and earlier you say "On the 9th of April, the Interahamwe attacked my house and killed one boy, who was among those refugees.  I don't remember his name.  They killed him in front of my house."  

So there again is a reference not to your oldest son but to the boy being killed.  
And then you refer later in a narrative of the events, I submit as we've heard, to being at Kayanga health centre, of understanding that your wife and kids -- it's put here -- were at Kayanga health centre.  You went there, found your family there, and you were -- stayed in one of the rooms there, and you put the date you left the health centre as the 17th of April when the Inkotanyi, led by Felix Ntiganzwa, the brother of Rutabagirwa, came there.  And that you're questioned by the RPF, and eventually your life is spared and you leave with your children.  

I think it's right to say that stage, the Prosecution will agree, that on the date that that statement was taken, there was no allegation against Rwamakuba; no allegation had been made by their witness.  

And then we come to the statement, which the date of which you dispute, that may assist, Mr. Witness, if I just indicate that the first statement of the Defence -- sorry, the 5th of April, not the 22nd, the 5th of April 2004, important date in terms of the allegation from the Prosecution, was Martin.  I'll refer to him as Martin.  The second statement -- I won't mention his name in court -- is an investigator who you might know and be able to identify if I tell you he is a Tutsi.  Does that ring a bell with you? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And it -- and he ends up saying (no interpretation) 2004.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That, in English, is "testimony given on the 22nd of July 2004."  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Which you -- your -- your memory, or whatever, you dispute.  You say it wasn't that date; you don't think it was that date.  
A.	No, I do not think that is the good date.  I do remember that this investigator came to my home.  My wife came -- my wife told me about it.  He came on the 21st of July.  I know that I did not meet him on the -- the next day, however.  What I remember that he told my wife was that he also needed me, and he said that he would come back to see me later.  But he never did come back.  

In the course of that year, I believe in August or September, before I met this lawyer, I saw him in the city of Kigali.  We spent about 15 minutes together.  We chatted about the events that had occurred -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	-- he did not even have paper to take notes.
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. MORLEY:
Sorry.  Rather than interrupt the witness, it may be Their -- Their Honours find this very interesting, about the provenance of this 22nd of July statement.  I understand why you want to stop him.  

But it's my respectful submission, Your Honour, that the witness should be allowed to speak about what he remembers of not meeting the Defence investigator on the 22nd of July. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah, it's just 5 past 10, Mr. Prosecutor, and that's why I want to stop him.  
MR. MORLEY:
No, it's not.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you don't accept the statement was taken on the 22nd of July.  Now, in the statement, there's no mention of -- of Kayanga at all and, indeed, really nothing about your history, your personal and family history, of what happened to you in the genocide.  It's a statement that's almost entirely focused on Rwamakuba, MDR, and access to the area.  And there's no, I suggest, context there for Kayanga or discussion about it.
MR. HOOPER:
And I don't know whether Prosecution accept that as a fair summary or whether I should exhibit the statement.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we didn't talk about Kayanga during our discussion.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if the Prosecution will contend that my summary of that is a -- a statement where Kayanga, as a subject, is not discussed, nor other similar subjects discussed, or whether I should exhibit -- or whether you seek me to exhibit it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, this is spectacularly interesting.  My learned friend is hoping to exhibit the first two statements in order to show what he thinks are consistencies, although he hasn't once dealt with why there might be an inconsistency in respect of Kayanga health centre, absence of description of murders, other than to tell the witness that the context didn't allow for it and not invite the witness to give his own explanation.  And now that he realises there's a problem with the origin and history of the third statement, he wants to keep it well away from the Court. 
MR. HOOPER:
No, I'm asking to exhibit all these statements.  I'm asking to exhibit it.  But I -- you've been objecting to it, and I'm -- there's other ways to go about it.  I want to put in the three statements.  If you've no objection to that, the Prosecution have no objection to that, it's done in a very straightforward way. 
MR. MORLEY:
It's my respectful submission that none of the statements should be exhibited.  Your Honour has the point which is made earlier.  Insofar as any are exhibited, they should all be exhibited. 

MR. HOOPER:
So let me just formally, then, pass up the two statements to you, Mr. Witness, if I can pass up statement of the 4th of April first -- they'll come to you at the same time -- and the one that's dated the 22nd of July, which you don't accept is the correct date, and I want you just to formally look at those statements and to acknowledge, first of all, that they are yours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We -- we have decided that we will admit the statements -- 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- so permission to exhibit is granted. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  That's then -- then I -- that's it.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much -- oh, one other -- they needn't see them.  It's all right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, one -- one final question.  In the course of your Prosecution statement, you refer from time to time to André Rwamakuba.  How did André Rwamakuba's name crop up?  How did it come to be mentioned at all?  Was it because you mentioned it, or was it because the subject was raised by the investigators?  Can you remember? 
A.	In my statement of the 11th of August 1999, I said that I was answering questions that were put to me.  I was not asked to relate the facts.  Precise questions were put to me.  For example, you see where it is written that the MDR was represented at meetings by André Rwamakuba and Gasana, I was asked who was the authority representing the MDR -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	-- I was not asked to recount all the events.
Q.	(Microphone not activated)

So where André Rwamakuba's name appears, who first mentioned the name André Rwamakuba?  Can you remember? 
A.	This is the employee of the Tribunal.  No, actually he asked me who were the party leaders, the leaders of the MDR party.  But on page 4 where I say that I went to Gitarama and that I met Rwamakuba, he'd asked me when I had seen Rwamakuba for the last time.  So I told him that I met him in Gitarama.  So he was taking down the statement based on the answers that I gave him, so he never asked me to recount all the events as I experienced them from Kayanga to Gitarama and so on.  
Q.	Yes, thank -- thank -- thank you, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
And those are all my questions of you, sir.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you've come to the end of your testimony before our Tribunal.  We'd like to thank you for coming to give evidence before us.  Now you are free to leave, and we excuse you, and you may take your departure.  Thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER:
In respect of this witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated)

Thank you -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, sir. 
MR. HOOPER:
With respect to this witness, can he also have leave to visit André Rwamakuba in the detention centre?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Nodding head) 
MR. HOOPER:
Again, this is essentially a formality to ease the -- the position of WVS, who organised the visit.  And it's done, I hope, with concurrence of the Prosecution. 
MR. MORLEY:
No objection.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER:
And if we can move the two exhibits -- 
While Mr. Issa's taking the witness out, and before we come to exhibits, I -- I'd like to raise a matter briefly, but of considerable concern to the Defence.  

Over the last many years, from time to time, the Defence have made both informal requests, requests in court, and requests by motion for disclosure of statements.  And it has been our belief, to a degree, one must say and concede speculatively, but an act of judgement on our part, that the Prosecution have had, and have, statements that are exculpatory which have not been disclosed.  And this hasn't been a problem of a month or two, it's -- it's gone on for seven years.  And for most of that time, all that time, we received nothing.  Excuse me.  

Earlier this year, we listed, as Your Honours may recall, a list of about 70 names.  These were names that had been culled as names that had been referred to in statements by witnesses.  For example, the name of the last witness was included amongst those, and the Prosecution balked and said this was too long a list, would we cut it down.  And so we put a line through the list, and we submitted the stub of that.  And court management documents show, because we had no record of it for some reason, which we still don't quite understand, that this last witness's statement, as a result of those demands by the Defence specific -- to specific names, was disclosed as recently as the very end of July, by which time, of course, we were well in and through the first session.  

Now, we can't understand how, if there was a proper investigation of material available to the Prosecution, the statement that you now have from (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) -- from the witness -- redact (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), please -- if there was a proper investigation done of the -- the material available to the Prosecution, and I don't know quite how that will be done, but I assume they have proper and efficient systems in place, they must have, necessarily -- how would it be possible, first of all, for that statement not to have been thrown up again and again and again over the last seven years?  After all, here was a witness that we can conclude was, in part, a witness who was approached by and seen by investigators that led to a statement where he was being asked about Rwamakuba.  And it was a witness who was in place in the commune before and during the genocide and before the genocide held some significant position in the country, if I can put it like that, and who lives where you know he lives in respect of the Rwamakuba family and who could talk of events there, and does, and who was even at the Kayanga health centre, how is it possible that the words "Rwamakuba," "Kayanga" alone don't throw up that statement?

Imagine you're defending a case such as this.  Isn't it plainly exculpatory?  Imagine you're Prosecuting a case like this.  Wouldn't you be concerned when your eyes fall on a statement like that, in its entirety and its context, that this should be something that cries out to be handed over to the Defence for them to pick up and investigate?  We got to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) -- sorry, redaction, redaction.  We got to the last witness because I got a statement unlawfully, essentially, through the back door, handed to me -- I'll say no more.  

And that's the product, that witness.  We don't think the Prosecution have been doing their job in terms of this kind of material, and we're still low on faith in respect of that.  Something is going wrong, and I'm thinking back to all those names again.  We asked, for example, for witness statements that had been served in the case -- in the Butare case.  So moving from Gikomero now -- and goodness knows what lies in their files on Gikomero -- moving to Butare, in the Butare case, as it's known, Nyiramasuhuko and the others, Defence counsel in that case were served by the Prosecution with statements relating to, first of all, events at the préfecture building and, secondly, the hospital.  And the latter doesn't need me underscoring in the context of this case as to its significance.  And I've extracted but don't have to hand the product of that request.  

I think out of something like approximately 30 statements in respect of each of those two places, we've been served with -- I may be wrong here from memory -- I think six.  Maybe more than that.  I don't -- I don't want to do an injustice to the Prosecution in respect of that, but it is a fraction, anyway, of -- of the whole.  Had the others been looked at and -- and -- had regard to?  And even if they have been, how can we -- how can we, in fact, be -- feel satisfied on this side of the court that the job's being done properly when someone like the last witness, and his statement to the Prosecution was obtained with the history that it -- that it -- that it possesses?  It was levered out, crowbarred out, forced out of the Prosecution.  How -- how can we feel in any way that the Prosecution are discharging those responsibilities when they've told this Chamber and others again and again over the last seven years they're meeting their responsibilities when they plainly haven't?  If, that is, my example here with this gentleman's statement coincides with your own judgements about its relevance and its exculpatory nature.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I think we've got the point of your complaint. 
MR. HOOPER:
I've finished.  Yes.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you making an application of any sort? 

MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  We asked for, some years ago, that the Prosecution nominate a party to go through all their material, who is a responsible party, and who will certify that the job's being done.  And we feel that that at least focuses the Prosecution on their duty because we feel it's not been addressed properly.  And we've had evidence to the contrary.  

And it has been ordered already in -- in one case at the ICTY, whose name might trip off someone's tongue if I just turned to her for a moment. 

No, but I -- I think it's probably a well-known -- we probably know the judge -- judge -- the judge (microphone not activated).  

We have a reference and we can get it to you if you need to see it.  It's one of the Australian judge (sic), I think, who -- who ordered that.  But we need someone with a very good understanding of the case and its relevance to do it.  It shouldn't be delegated perhaps to someone who doesn't have that level of experience.  It should be done at a high level. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're asking for the Prosecutor or Mr. Morley to do it? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I wouldn't impose it on Mr. Morley, and I'm not asking that necessarily, even if you're minded to, that an order should be made here and now.  But the Prosecution have heard our -- our concerns and might, I think, fairly reflect, given the example or the exemplar that we've had, that it does -- does deserve review.  And it may be that they'd be in a position, for example, to come back and assist us tomorrow, having thought about this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Morley -- Mr. Hooper, sorry.  

Ms. Fall, Mr. Hooper has said that you can have until tomorrow morning to respond, unless you have a response at your fingertips already. 
MS. FALL:
No, Mr. President, precisely.  Counsel Hooper knows, and we know it too, that you give great importance to disclosure, which is why he emphasises it every time.  We are also highly conscious thereof, which is why we always do our maximum just to avoid problems of disclosure.  

Counsel Hooper came today to make a list, present a list of complaints against the Prosecution, in his judgement, as he said.  We consider also that we've done the -- our maximum and the best that we could do to meet all the requirements of disclosure.  And before faced with all these problems he has raised, we have taken note.  We have our response, and when he -- he said -- since he said at the outset that it was an application, you put a question to him, and he answered yes, we will, therefore, be answering Counsel Hooper in writing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, that's not necessary.  That's not necessary.  An oral response will be acceptable.  You don't have to do it right now.  
MS. FALL:
We will undertake all the necessary research to provide all the information on the matters he has raised -- the issues he has raised.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  

Moving to exhibits of Witness 6/10, the Defence seek to exhibit, and I think these numbers have been agreed, the witness identification form as D. 170, an extract from the genocide report as D. 171 -- just pausing there.  We will submit the -- 

I think there's one in English, and there's one in French.  

Well, Mr. Issa, can we come back to that very shortly and just leave the -- we definitely have that, so you can leave it -- oh, here he comes.  (Microphone not activated).  You've got English and French there.  Very well.  As -- this is an extract of the genocide report of 1996 relating to Gikomero, together with some pages of the introduction of the general report, D. 171A for the French and B for the English. 

The witness identification form, of course, is under seal.  D. 170 is under seal, I'm sorry.  And then we've got three statements of Witness 6/10, and they're in the order of -- first Defence witness statement of the 4th of April -- I think it's 2004, isn't it? 

Oh, I'm sorry.  Yup, 4th of April 2004, 22nd of July 2004, as dated, and the Prosecution statement in English and French of this witness, dated the 11th of August 1999, in English and French, being D. 174A for French and B for English.  

And those -- yes.  The CD of photographs has already been exhibited, and this witness merely referred to that.  The statements will need to be under seal, all three of them, for obvious reasons.  And those are the exhibits.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. MORLEY:
There is one on behalf of the Prosecution.  Your Honour will recall that, in relation to the preliminary report, a part of the introduction to it was referred to with the witness, and I mentioned the K-number as being K0059171.  What I would ask is that that becomes a Prosecution exhibit in tandem, effectively, with Defence Exhibit, I think, 171, which is their photocopying of the preliminary report.  

I'm assisted by my learned leader, who has identified a second page at K0059175, in which, towards the bottom of the page, there is further description of how the authors of the 1996, February, report say that their report is not yet complete and will no doubt be subject to various modifications in time.  

What I would ask is that those two pages, referable by their K-numbers, be exhibited as either an addendum to D. 171, which probably makes the most sense, because then all the pages are together, or, alternatively, as the next P number, which I don't know.  And I look to the helpful Mr. Hometowu. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I've no objection submitting that as a Defence document, if that's not objectionable, as D. 171C, being further -- further pages of the document.  
MR. MORLEY:
That is probably the most sensible way of putting the document in, if Your Honour's agreeable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll make the order.  Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. 170 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. 171A, D. 171B, and D. 171C admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. 174A and D. 174B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That concludes everything, then? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we'll take the morning recess.  

Mr. Hooper, I hope we can move a bit faster after recess with the next witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you know, Mr. O'Shea, he's greased lightning when it comes to -- to witnesses.  So he will be going through that, I think, quite quickly. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1040H)
(Pages 1 to 26 by Ann Burum)


































(Court resumed at 1103H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just before we get into the meat of things, in your closing remarks the name of the last witness was mentioned twice, so I'd just like to order a redaction.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
Before we start with this witness, may I just make an observation in respect of the last witness and the statements, and perhaps if this witness might take off her headphones, although she may understand English, I don't know.
MR. O'SHEA:
She does understand some English, yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  It may not matter, frankly.  

Your Honour will recall that the various statements of the last witness have gone into evidence as exhibits in order, insofar as they can, to show consistency on matters which may or may not be relevant.

There is a concern on the part of the Prosecution that in due course comment will be made during closing argument inviting Your Honours to look at those statements, and from those statements conclude that the evidence from the witness about the date on which he was at Kayanga health centre is unreliable.

To put it at its most direct, the statements suggest that he ended up with his family at Kayanga health centre on one date, but his evidence was that he was at the health centre specifically on the 15th, and it would be wrong for any comment to be invited later that the witness must be unreliable about what his evidence was.  I raise that simply because, as Your Honour observed, the contents of the statement are not the evidence in the proceedings, and it would not be right for there to be a later suggestion that the witness can be contradicted by the Defence from his statement.  Does Your Honour follow the point? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that's clear.

Good morning, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.

MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give testimony before the Tribunal.  The first thing that will happen is that the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth while you're giving your evidence.  Mr. Registrar.
(Declaration made by Witness 9/1 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Madam Witness, under the rules of our Tribunal, you'll be giving your evidence by answering the questions that are put to you by the lawyers who are appointed for that purpose.  You'll be questioned, first of all, by the Defence attorney, and you'll now have to answer his questions. 
WITNESS 9/1
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. O'SHEA:  
Q.	Madam Witness, may I ask that you put your handbag to the side of you so that it doesn't distract me while I'm talking to you?  Thank you.

Could I please -- I'm going to hand a document to you which contains some personal details.  I understand that you speak French fairly fluently and read French, and this document is in French.  So I'm going to ask you to just quickly read through the contents of the document and tell us if the contents are correct.  If you could just read that through quietly to yourself while the Prosecution's also reading through it.

Are you satisfied that the contents of that document are correct?  Is there anything that you would wish to change?
A.	I'd like to make one change to this document.
Q.	Sorry, I didn't get the translation -- it's my fault, no one else's.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said, "I'd like to change one thing in the document."
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, if the witness could be provided with a pen.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If I might just intervene while the witness is doing that, there was a matter I should have raised on our resumption.  

Madam Prosecutor, just for the record, it is our understanding that the Prosecutor is not opposing the Defence motion for video-link testimony.  

We have not had a formal response to the Defence motion for video-link testimony for a certain witness, and we understood that the Prosecutor was not opposing the motion.  Is that correct?
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, we're not opposing the motion.  The Prosecutor agrees that the Defence can either bring its witnesses here or have them heard by video conference.  We do not oppose the motion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, thank you.  And I noted the general nature of that response.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Would you kindly just write next to the two points where you have put a mark what you believe the correct statement would be -- should be?  

And could you just sign next to the two changes that you have made and sign at the bottom of the document, and date it, please?

Yes, thank you, Madam Witness.

MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, if that could be exhibited as D. 175, under seal, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit D. 175 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Madam Witness, could you please tell the Chamber where you were on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	On the 6th of April 1994 I was in Rwanda -- in Gisenyi, to be precise.
Q.	And do you remember when you left Gisenyi?
A.	I left Gisenyi on the 17th of July of the same year.
Q.	Do you know Dr. André Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, I know Dr. André Rwamakuba.
Q.	How long have you known him for?
A.	I do not know in what year I got to know him, but I've known him for a very long time, from when we were young.  I think I've known him for more than 20 years.  When I met him, he was still young and single.
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Do you remember when was the first time you saw him during the war in 1994?
A.	Yes, I remember; it was on the 20th of April 1994.
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of Dr. André Rwamakuba before the 6th of April 1994?
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  Would you please repeat it?
Q.	Do you know anything about the whereabouts of Dr. André Rwamakuba prior to the 6th of April 1994?
A.	I know nothing about it.  I had not seen him for a long time.  The last time I saw him was before he went to Europe to continue with his studies.  Quite frankly, I hadn't seen him for a long time.  He went for studies and he stayed there for some time.  I do not know on what date he returned to Rwanda.
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Coming back to the 20th of April 1994, which is the first time that you say you saw him during the war, in what circumstances did you see him on the 20th of April?
A.	On the 20th my husband told me that Rwamakuba and his family had just arrived at the Meridien Hotel.  Since this was a family of friends, I went with my husband to greet them and welcome them.  They were tired, and we took them ****************************** to show them where we lived and to chat a little with them.  We served them drinks and food, and in the evening we took them back to the hotel.
Q.	Just to help us with location, do you know how far the Meridien Hotel is from the border of Zaire, as it then was?
A.	The Meridien Hotel was not far from the border.  *********************************.  You would leave our home and, if you crossed the road, you would be **************.  To our right it was said that there was a white man who lived there who was called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  To our left --
Q.	Can I just stop you there --
A.	-- there was the house of a man called --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness gives a name.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q. Can I stop you there?  I think you've given sufficient detail.  There's a danger that if you give too much detail your identity might be compromised. So could I ask that those two names be redacted?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Order granted.
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So, on the 20th of April, you've explained the circumstances of your encounter with Dr. André Rwamakuba.  I see you want to speak to Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, when we come here to give testimony in your court, we are told not to reveal our identity and that we are protected witnesses.  In my answers, when I give testimony, it seems to me that the information that I will give is detailed information that might reveal my identity.  
If I'm asked where I live, I will say where I live.  So for the time being at least we are talking about my identity, and the rules of this Tribunal provide that the witness's identity is kept from the public.  It seems to me that the public is able to follow my answers and this might lead to my identification.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we have had all of the witnesses who come -- or the vast majority of witnesses are protected witnesses.  And we have had some experience in taking testimony and protecting the identity of the witnesses.

Now, if from our perspective there is information which cannot be given in open court without running a risk of revealing your identity, then that testimony will be taken in closed session.  So I think for the time being you should trust the lawyer who is examining you and the Bench to take care that your identity is not revealed.

You also can assist us.  If you think that a particular question may result in you giving an answer which might be sensitive, you can draw it to our attention and we'll take the necessary action.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness, if any question that I pose you believe may lead to your identity being revealed, you can say so.  But it's also important that you listen carefully to the question.  

On this occasion I asked about the Hotel Meridien, not about your home.  So listen to the questions carefully, and if I do ask a question that might reveal your identity, then please indicate.

When you saw Dr. André Rwamakuba on the 20th, could you just say who he was with?
A.	On the 20th, when I saw Dr. Rwamakuba, he was with his family; that is, his wife and three children.
Q.	And could you please provide us with the names of his family?
A.	Rwamakuba is, of course, called Rwamakuba -- that's the family name -- and his first name is André.  His wife's name is Agnes Banyangiliki.  The eldest daughter is called Marie Ange Nyisafari.  The second child is called Alice, but I do not know her Rwandan name.  The third child is a boy, and he's called Claude Muhunde.
Q.	Could you please spell "Muhunde"?
A.	I will spell it for you.  I will try and spell it for you in French.  I-H -- M-U-H -- sorry -- M-U-H-U-N-D-E -- M-U-H-U-N-D-E -- Muhunde.
Q.	So, on the 20th, after bringing them to your home, you took them to the Hotel Meridien.
MR. O.SHEA:
	My learned friend reminds me that I should spell the other names.  Agnes Banyangiliki is B-A-N-Y-A-N-G-I-L-I-K-I.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think that's a bit fast, Counsel, sorry.
MR. O'SHEA:
Sorry, it's a bit fast.  B-A-N-Y-A-N-G-I-L-I-K-I.  M-A-R-I-E, new word, A-N-G-E.  And then the other name is N-Y-I-S-A-F-A-R-I.  And Alice is A-L-I-C-E and Claude is C-L-A-U-D-E.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	So, on the 20th, you took them back to their hotel.  Do you remember what happened the following day?
A.	That evening we took them back to the hotel, escorted them back to the hotel.  The following day, before noon, they returned to our home, the entire Rwamakuba family.  Dr. Rwamakuba and his wife left their children with us.  They crossed to Zaire and told us they were going to make bookings for a flight to Kenya -- in order to fly to Kenya.
Q.	Did you see them again that day?
A.	Yes.  They returned from Goma in Zaire where they'd gone to make their aeroplane booking -- the aeroplane to Kenya.  And, as I told you, they'd left their children with us at our home.  On their return they told us that they hadn't been able to get -- obtain seats in the plane.
Q.	Do you know what happened the following day?
A.	The next day Dr. Rwamakuba told us that he was going to seek out his elder brother's son, a boy by the name of Patrick.  He was telling us in fact that he intended to return to Goma to try, once again, to make a booking for the planned trip, which is what he did.
Q.	So did you see them again that day?
A.	They brought the children in the morning to our house so that they could stay with us, and then Rwamakuba went to seek his elder brother's son.  And then he left with his wife to Goma to obtain the booking I have been speaking of.  When they returned from Goma, they came to our house, because that is where they had left the children.
Q.	Were they successful in what they were attempting to do?
A.	No.  They had crossed to get -- obtain the booking.  On their return, they said they hadn't gotten seats, but even if seats were available, they wouldn't have had the money to pay for five people's tickets -- tickets for five people.  So they were going to wait until they had enough money to buy air tickets for five people.
Q.	I think it would be correct to say that the following day Dr. André Rwamakuba was -- did not stay at your house; correct?
MS. FALL:
Objection, Mr. President.  Objection.  I should like to know whether this is examination-in-chief.  I have been most patient -- most patient, because I have many reasons to object, but I didn't do so.  However, I should like Counsel O'Shea to take due account of that.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, with respect to my learned friend, a leading question is impermissible if it is contentious.  My question was:  is it right to say that Dr. André Rwamakuba did not stay at your house the following day?  

Is it the Prosecution case that he did? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Mr. O'Shea.  It's too small a point to be contentious about -- if I might add, Mr. Lightning.
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Your Honour, we didn't catch what you said.  I don't know if you want it on the record -- excuse me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have sustained the objection and advised Mr. O'Shea to ask the question again.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you know in which préfecture Dr. André Rwamakuba was the following day?
A.	What day are you referring to?
Q.	Well, you've spoken about the 20th, and you've spoken about the following day, which would be the 21st.  You've spoken about the following day, which would be the 22nd.  So we're talking about the 23rd.  Do you know in which préfecture Dr. André Rwamakuba was on the 23rd?
A.	On the 23rd Rwamakuba and his wife told us that they were going to visit someone in Gisenyi, and that person lived therefore in Gisenyi, so they were in Gisenyi préfecture on that date.
Q.	What do you remember about the following day?
A.	On the 22nd they told me they were going to visit a person on the 23rd, so they went to visit that person, but did not return to the house.  They came back the following day, and we stayed together until evening.  On the 24th we spoke at length and went to bed.  The wives and the children went to bed first, but the men stayed in the lounge talking.  I don't know whether the doctor left or not, because we left him in the lounge.
And the following day, the 25th, I found them again in the lounge.  His family spent the night at home, but I don't know if the doctor spent the night at home.
Q.	And what happened on the 25th?
A.	In the morning I found them again in the lounge and he told me he was going to go to Gitarama and was leaving me his wife and children.  He said he had to go to Gitarama for a meeting and to see the other ministers there.  He left and came back in the evening to see his family, who he had left with me.
MR. O'SHEA:
Just one moment. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Thereafter, could you explain to the Chamber what the general pattern was in terms of Dr. André Rwamakuba's movements, if there was one?
A.	On the 25th he left in the morning and returned in the evening.  He would always come back to see his wife and children.  In the evening of the 25th he left the children at our house and they spent the night with us.  But he and his wife left, and on the following morning he brought his wife back and he returned to Gitarama, as he had on the 25th.

So he would go in the morning and only return in the evening.  I don't know what happened on the following day, but on the ensuing days, the 27th, the 28th, I don't remember very well where he went.  But I do remember that we went to someone's funeral.  I don't know what happened on the 29th in the morning, but I saw him again in the evening on his return.

I remember very well that he went to Gitarama on the 25th, the 26th.
Q.	Do you remember until when --
A.	I don't remember very well.
Q.	Do you remember at what point you stopped seeing Dr. André Rwamakuba?
A.	You mean by that that I did not see him often, or that I completely ceased to see him?  I do want to say that after his family left -- after his family's departure, I'd see him quite infrequently, but at one point I ceased to see him altogether.  I do not remember the date, but I was still in Gisenyi, and I asked why I don't see him any more, and I was told that he had left.

When his wife and children stayed with us, he would come every day, but after they departed he would come infrequently, until I didn't see him any more at all.  And I was told that he had left Rwanda.
Q.	Do you remember when his family departed?
A.	His family bade me goodbye on the 2nd, and we did accompany them as far as Goma.  His family took the plane and flew away -- flew off.
Q.	Do you remember to what extent you saw Dr. André Rwamakuba in the days preceding the departure of his family?
A.	Practically every day up until his family left.  From the 20th to the date of the family's departure I saw him every day, as long as his family was present.  His family was staying with me.  When he'd go anywhere, in particular Gitarama, he'd come back to check on the health of his child, who was ill.  He did not leave me alone with his family and, in any case, I could not have accepted that.
Q.	So was the daily routine that he would go and come back in the evening, or did that routine change?
A.	He didn't leave every day.  When he would go to Gitarama, he'd leave in the morning after having taken breakfast.  He'd leave between 8 and 9 a.m.  He brought his family and his child, and then when he returned some time between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., and we told him he should come back earlier, because of problems of public safety, security.
Q.	Do you remember what time he would come back?  Was there any pattern to that?
A.	You mean the problems he had on the road, or in Gisenyi?
Q.	I'm just asking on the days that he would go to work, do you remember what time he would come back?
A.	He would come back between 6 and 7 p.m.  That is when he would return, but he never said anything about -- he never said anything about major problem -- security problems, problems of security -- safety.
Q.	You've said that he didn't go to work every day.  Do you remember on which days he did not go to work?
A.	He came on the 20th.  The following day, the 21st, he did not go to work, because he was busy trying to get bookings.  The following day he didn't go to work.  He told me that he was going to look for his -- for Patrick, his elder brother's son, and then he went for the bookings.

And, on the following day, we did not spend the day together, but he didn't go to work.  He told me, rather, that he was going to visit a friend of his named Fidele.  The 25th he did go to work.  The 26th he went to work.  The 27th, the 28th, I don't recall exactly.  On one of those two days we attended all together Mathieu's funeral.  On the 29th he didn't tell me that he was going to work, but I saw him again in the evening and I thought that he'd gone to work.

After the 30th of April, the 1st of May, it was a holiday, and he stayed home to bid his family farewell.  And on the 2nd of May we accompanied his family to Goma, so he did not go to work on that day -- on those days and especially it was a holiday.
Q.	During all the time that he spent at your home, did he receive any visitors, or not?
A.	He did not receive any visitors, because the place where we were was secure -- in a secure area.  One would need a special permission -- a special permit.  I only remember one person having visited him, and I don't know whether I should mention that name.

Now, if he received visits -- visitors at the Hotel Meridien, but at my house, as far as I know, he only had one visitor.
Q.	You say he had one visitor.  And, Madam Witness, I think you can mention that name safely.
A.	That visitor's name was Donnat Murego.
Q.	Could you explain the circumstances of that visit?  Do you have any knowledge of the circumstances of that visit?
A.	I could not forget that Murego came to visit him, because he came into the lounge.  We were in the rooms, but at one point voices were raised and we were curious and went to see what they were saying -- what the subject of their discussion was.
Q.	What did you notice, if anything?
A.	We noted that they were quarrelling and Murego was saying to Rwamakuba he was not a minister like the others.  He was telling him the other ministers were in Gitarama.  Murego told him that the MDR had nominated him to represent that party in the government, and he was reproaching him for not going to the meetings, not attending meetings, as did the other ministers, but was too preoccupied with his family.  And the doctor replied they could take the ministry, he was highly concerned by the state of health of his child and his family.  They were evidently upset, angry, but then calmed down.

Murego was giving him to understand his place was not in Gisenyi but in Gitarama.  And the doctor gave him to understand that he was rather concerned by his family, that he had not asked for that ministerial portfolio and that his party could take it back at any time -- take back that ministerial portfolio at any time -- we laughed ourselves -- and said, "Well, take your ministerial portfolio," and the doctor would look after his family.
Q.	You mentioned the state of health of Dr. André Rwamakuba's daughter.  Which daughter are you referring to?
A.	His second child named Alice, who was quite ill.  She had an ear problem and her ear had been operated on.  She needed treatment; she needed to be taken care of.  And she was a very sickly child -- weak and sickly child.
Q.	Over what period of time did this sickness last?
A.	The child remained ill until she left the house, until she was taken away and transited via Zaire to Kenya.
Q.	When did you first notice that she was ill?
A.	As soon as the family arrived, the children were introduced to me.  I greeted them and, quite obviously, this child was not in good health, so I noticed it as soon as the family arrived.
Q.	Could you give a physical description of Dr. André Rwamakuba to this Chamber?
A.	It's been 11 years since I last saw André Rwamakuba, but at the time when I saw him he was of average height -- not stout; he had a thin face.  He was not stout and he had a thin face.  That is how -- the physical description I could give you.
Q.	What do you mean when you say he was "not stout"?
A.	By that I mean that he wasn't fat.  In any case, I can give an example.  Defence counsel is stouter than he.
Q.	Is that me, or the elder one?
A.	I'm speaking of the other white man, Caucasian -- Mzungu -- the one standing up.
Q.	All right.
A.	I'm sorry, they have about the same forename.  I said Rwamakuba was a slim man, and I was comparing him to Defence counsel.  I should like to make it clear that I'm talking of André Rwamakuba and not Andreas, but I'm comparing Andreas and Rwamakuba, and I would say Rwamakuba was slim; Andreas is stouter, is broader than André Rwamakuba.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I will quote you to my lead Counsel.

Did he have any other distinguishing features?
A.	Do you mean any distinctive physical characteristics, or do you mean his behaviour, his conduct?  I can say that he was a very calm person.  He did not speak much; he was reserved.  He appreciated the truth and he appreciated work.  He respected people.  He was modest, humble -- very reserved, did not speak much.  In any case, he measured his words before speaking.  He did not like quarrelling.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"He appreciated calm," said the witness in French.
THE WITNESS:
He did not like useless talk, and respected everyone.  He was reserved.  In general, he had a gentle character.  He was a good man.  He was good natured and loved his family very much and took good care of his wife and children.  His family was his dominating -- predominant concern.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Do you remember how he dressed during the period in question?
A.	He was someone who liked to be carefully dressed.  He'd wear a jacket, a white shirt and tie.  Sometimes -- most of the time he wore a dark suit, but he was well dressed.  You could see that he respected himself and he dressed ministerially, as he was a minister and he dressed to fit his minister's rank.
Q.	Do you remember whether or not he wore glasses?
A.	Never -- he never wore glasses.  He never wore glasses.  Since me myself, I wear glasses, I think I would have noticed it.
Q.	I'm going to pass you up a photograph and you can give us any reaction you like to the photograph.  

The Prosecution have seen it; I don't think the Judges have.

What's your reaction to that photograph?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness has a problem, indicates the Kinyarwanda interpreter.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Madam Witness, (inaudible).
MR. O'SHEA:
I think the witness has been caused some distress by the photograph, so perhaps she could have a glass of water.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Registrar, could you assist? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Perhaps you could --
THE WITNESS:
This photograph reminds me of many things, because **********************************************.  I apologise to the Trial Chamber for letting myself go.  I was a family friend; *********************************************.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Who was your initial friendship with?  Was it with Agnes, or was it with Dr. Rwamakuba?
A.	It was Agnes who was my friend.  Afterwards, she introduced me to her fiancé.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, if that could be exhibited as D. 176.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. 176 admitted)
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you.  Your Honours, I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you now have to be examined by the lawyer representing the Prosecution, and you'll have to answer their questions now.  Ms. Fall?	
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness wishes to put a question, says the Kinyarwanda interpreter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I ask to be allowed to go out for only a couple of minutes, Mr. President.  I would just like to take a very short break of a couple of minutes.
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, Mr. President, I'm in your hands, but given that we're going on this afternoon, we could take the lunch break now, if Your Honour wishes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we'll take the lunch recess.

Madam Witness, we will be resuming at 2 o'clock after lunch.  During this or any adjournment of the case, you remain a witness during the trial, and you are not permitted to speak to anybody about the case or about your testimony in the case.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, may I just add for the witness's benefit, so she knows, that it would not be proper for me to see her at all.  I'm not being impolite, but just so she knows I won't be seeing her again until the end of her testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you understand that, Madam Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I understood.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll take the adjournment now.
(Court recessed at 1221H)
(Pages 27 to 39 by Maureen Dunn)















(Court resumed at 1412H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Madam Witness, are you feeling well?  
THE WITNESS:
I am feeling better, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You are now being questioned by the Prosecutor, and now you have to answer the questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, can I just raise one brief matter by way of an oral motion.  It is in respect of two witnesses -- Defence witnesses, 1/13 and 1/5, who have previously given evidence in cases here, and it is my understanding they did so as protected witnesses.  In those circumstances, can I apply to this Chamber -- as though the Chambers before whom they gave evidence are no longer fully constituted -- and apply to this court for access to closed session material as well as the normal transcripts in that case.  That is in the case of Kamuhanda in relation to 1/5, and Niyiteka -- Niyitegeka, sorry, in respect of 1/13. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did they have the same pseudonym in those cases?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, they didn't, and you put me on the spot because -- well, I - I do know, I think, but I certainly don't have it to hand and I may not be able to find it by close of today's session.  But armed with our present pseudonym, we can backtrack with court management to the name and appropriate pseudonym in the pre-existing testimonies.  I hope that's sufficient. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have quick access to Rule 75(F)(ii)?  Is the Prosecution in a position -- I had originally thought that the Prosecutor may have had certain obligations, but it is a Defence witness so the disclosure objection is not (inaudible).  Is this a matter -- is this a matter in which the Prosecutor would be able to give assistance?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we don't have anything against that position.  We simply would like the statement to be given. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What we will do, we will consider it.  The Prosecutor said they don't have any objection, but we will have to consider exactly what order we should make, and we will have to get some assistance and make some enquiries to ensure we have the accurate identification of the witnesses involved. 
MR. HOOPER:
1/5 is ********. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I haven't found the other one yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you can communicate the information with our trial coordinator, and we will address it as soon as possible. 
MR. HOOPER:
We do need a quick order given our witness position.  We need one today ready, because at 5:30 the court management goes off, or some of it does anyway.  Archives goes off.  So in order to have access to archives, we need -- I'm sorry to put that kind of pressure on the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are checking it now.  We are now quite certain; we have to do some research in order to make certain of the form of the orders we should make. 
MR. HOOPER:
The reason it's late is we thought we had it.  If we had, we haven't now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Fall, you may proceed now. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, in order to avoid putting questions that may reveal the identity of the witness, I would apply that we go into closed session for some ten minutes or so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are going to go into closed session now as the Prosecutor has certain questions, the answers to which may reveal your identity.  We are going to go into closed session now.

THE WITNESS:
All right, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, have you talked with Defence -- you talked with Defence counsel, I believe, and you gave a statement on the 13th of August 2005? 
A.	That is true, Mr. President. 
Q.	And this statement was signed, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, I signed the statement, Mr. President. 
Q.	I presume that before you signed the statement, its contents -- its contents were read out to you and that you were aware of the contents of the statement? 
A.	I myself read the statement, and I agreed with the contents, then I signed it. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to take up the issue of your knowledge of André Rwamakuba once again and I am going to focus on a number of dates.  You said that you knew Mr. André Rwamakuba very well, and in answer to the questions that were put to you by the Defence counsel, you said that you saw him again during the war of 1994, on the 20th of April?
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us why you were so specific or precise insofar as the date of 20th April is concerned? 
A.	I am sure that that was the date on which I saw him because I was very happy to see my friend coming.  It was not in my -- it wasn't customary for me to receive ministers in my house, let alone a minister that was a friend, and a minister that had come with his family is therefore an occasion for joy for me, and that is the reason why I cannot forget that date. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you said that they came to you.  Probably that's a detail, but it would appear to me that in your testimony you stated that you were the one who went to them with your husband where they were at the Hôtel Meridien, and that they later came to your house? 
A.	I wish to say that they left Gitarama and other places they had to go by, and came to Gisenyi préfecture where we were.  I did not intend to insist, but to emphasise the fact that they came to my house. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us at what hour you went to the Hôtel Meridien, along with your husband, to pay André Rwamakuba and his family a visit? 
A.	I do not recall the exact time that we flew in there, but it was in the evening. 
Q.	When you say "in the evening", would that be after 7 p.m., after 8 p.m.?  Can you give us an approximate time frame? 
A.	It would be very difficult for me to give you an estimate 11 years later.  I know that it was in the evening, and I did not look at my watch at the time.  11 years later, well, it would be difficult for me to recall the time and to give you an estimate of the time.  All I remember is that we went there in the evening.  And for you, when does the evening begin?  At what time does the evening begin?  That would change depending on the country in which are in.  Certain countries, places are already dark at 6 p.m.  In other countries there is still daylight.  As far as I am concerned, however, when I say "in the evening", I mean from 4 p.m. 
Q.	Madam Witness, this means that on the 20th of April you saw André Rwamakuba in the evening, the evening beginning, according to you, from 4 p.m.  Would it be correct to say that what he did between the morning and 4 p.m. would not be known to you, and you therefore cannot be in a position to tell us today? 
A.	I don't know what he did.  I may express an opinion to the effect that he was on his way to Gisenyi. 
Q.	But that would only be an opinion that is not corroborated by any fact, any concrete fact or information? 
A.	I don't think I have understood your question well. 
Q.	I was saying that all you have volunteered is an opinion, but that you are in no way -- that you can in no way say precisely what André Rwamakuba did in the course of the morning of 20 April up until 4 p.m.? 
A.	That is correct.  I don't know what he did along the way.  I don't know what happened or what he might have done.  I can tell you what he did with the fact from the time that we met each other, but I cannot offer an opinion after his actions and gestures prior to my seeing him. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you tell us that on the 21st André Rwamakuba and his family came to your residence.  Can you tell us what time they came to your house? 
A.	They came in the morning; that's before noon.  Well, in French, I would say in the morning. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  After they came to your home, how much time did they spend there? 
A.	They left their children in our home and went to Goma to make bookings in a travel agency, and later they went back to Gisenyi.  They came back to Gisenyi.  They came to our home where they found their children and, in the evening, they went back to the hotel where they spent the night. 
Q.	Can you tell us at what time they came back after having gone to do the bookings for Kenya? 
A.	I cannot recall at what time they returned.  I do remember the date, of course, but not the exact time. 
Q.	Well, you do recall the dates, but not our (unintelligible), André Rwamakuba.  I'm talking about the period during which André Rwamakuba was at your place.  
A.	It is difficult for me to remember the hours. 
Q.	Now, let's move on to the 22nd.  You tell us that André Rwamakuba left on the 22nd.  Was it indeed on the 22nd that you went to meet his nephew? 
A.	It wasn't his nephew.  In Kinyarwanda, actually, your nephew is your sister's child.  But the child in question was a son of Rwamakuba's grandfather.  So in Kinyarwanda we say, "This child is your child," because it is your brother's child.  It is not your child.  But he is like your child, so he's not your nephew. 
Q.	So what time did he go to meet his son, or his child? 
A.	He took his family, that is his children, to our house in the morning, but I don't know at what time he went to look for his elder brother's child.  I cannot tell you at what time he left to go look for the child.  Subsequently, I learned that he found him. 
Q.	You cannot tell us at what time he left?  Can you tell us what time he came back? 
A.	I can't tell either the time.  (Unintelligible) the time he left or the time at which he returned.  It was possible for him to leave at the time that I was in the kitchen, or he might have returned while he was in the kitchen.  All I can tell you is that I know that on that day he went to look for that kid, and which kid he found. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether he came back in the evening after having left in the morning? 
A.	I know that when he went to Goma, he came back in the evening.  But actually, on the day on which he went to look for his child, he had to return to Goma for -- to do the booking.  He therefore went to look for his elder brother's son, came back, and then went away with his wife.  He went out again with his wife to Goma in order to do the booking we've mentioned earlier, and then they returned together to our home. 
Q.	So, according to the later accurate time frame that you gave us concerning Rwamakuba's programme, you may not be able to know what he did in the course of the day at one time or the other? 
A.	As far as the periods of the day are concerned, and which I remember, I can tell you about the morning.  For instance, in the morning I had to give them -- to serve them breakfast, and I might have given them breakfast at 8 a.m., but they might have left later, but I wouldn't be able to tell you at exactly what time they left.  And in the evening when I was home, I would see them return to my home, but I am in no position to tell you whether they came at this hour or the other.  I was at home going about my daily chores, and I was not there to keep track of the time. 
Q.	We'll now move on to the day of the 23rd.  Madam Witness, you tell us that on the 23rd André Rwamakuba didn't stay at your home since he went to visit one of his friends.  Can you tell us at what time he left your home on this occasion as well? 
A.	I cannot recall the time at which he left.  He had talked to me about that -- he talked to me about his visit the previous day in the evening, and I didn't pay much attention to the hour at which he went in the morning.  I had to prepare breakfast for the children and for the family in general, but I didn't pay any attention as to what time he left on the 22nd.  In the evening he had told us about their programme for the next day, and I am not in a position to tell you whether they went directly from the hotel to their friends' house or if they passed by my house before going there. 
Q.	Madam Witness, on that day of the 23rd, did André Rwamakuba come back to your house or not? 
A.	He did not come back to my house.  He, his wife and children, spent the night at their friends' home, the friends they had gone to visit. 
Q.	If I understand you well, Madam Witness, from your answers, upon leaving your house in the morning to go to this friend's house, along with his wife and children, up until the next day, since they didn't spend the night -- they didn't spend the night in your home, you can be in no position today to tell us what was his programme of that day -- what André Rwamakuba's programme was like on that day? 
A.	As far as the 23rd is concerned, the André Rwamakuba family had to go and pay Fidel, their friend, a visit, and he lived in Gisenyi.  Rwamakuba left with his wife and children, and they were pleased since they were going to see their friend again.  I am not aware of whatever programme they might have had on that day since I didn't spend the day with them.  He had told me that they were going to visit their friend, and I suppose that is what they did. 
Q.	We will now move on to the 24th.  You say that it is from that time that André Rwamakuba's family -- more precisely, his children or his family spent the night in your home.  You also said that you can't tell whether Dr. Rwamakuba spent the night at your home or not, but that you found him at your home in the morning.  Can you tell us when the family came to your home on that day of the 24th? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I heard 25th.  I think counsel meant 24th, but I heard 25th, but I don't know -- 
MS. FALL:
No, I am talking about the 24th.  If you have been following the sequence in which I have been calling the dates, I think we are on the 24th now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The English translation did have the 25th. 
MS. FALL:
No, I was talking about the 24th. 
THE WITNESS:
I believe that your question was meant to find out if André Rwamakuba's family came back to my home on the 24th.  Well, that is true.  The entire Rwamakuba family came back to my house on the 24th, and they all spent the night in my home.  But I also did make it clear that I wasn't quite aware, or I didn't quite know, whether the doctor, that is Dr. Rwamakuba, spent the night in my home.  We conversed up until late in the evening, and we, the children and women, went to bed while the men remained in the living room conversing.  So I can't tell whether André Rwamakuba spent the night in our home or whether he had gone to spend the night in the hotel.  This is because I went to sleep and I left him with my husband in the living room, and the next morning I found him again in the living room.  But on that next day, he was already ready and he said that they were going to -- he said he was going to Gitarama, so it is possible that he might have spent the night in our home, or it is also possible that he might have gone and slept in the hotel and come back to our house in the morning, since he didn't tell us goodnight on that 24th evening, because it was very late in the evening when we broke up.  You know, our house was small.  There wasn't enough room that could accommodate everybody.  It is quite possible that they might have spent the night in the living room. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I have understood what you said very well.  I repeated this, but that wasn't the question I had put to you.  What I asked you was, to tell us again at what time -- at what specific time the André Rwamakuba family -- André Rwamakuba came to your house on the 24th day of April.
A.	I cannot recall the hour at which they came back, but they came back during the day.  They didn't come back at night.  They didn't come back in the morning either.  They came at about midday. 
Q.	For you, what hour is the middle of the day? 
A.	Well, there is broad daylight from about 10 a.m. until about 4 p.m., and depending on the season, places start getting dark at 4 p.m. or not, and this depends on how the sun is shining.  In any case, there is less sunshine at 4 o'clock onwards.  As far as we in Kinyarwanda are concerned, we have the morning, we have the daytime, and we have the evening. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I think with a little effort you will be able to answer the question.  You cannot tell us the exact time.  You tell us it was in the middle of the day.  You situate that time of the day at between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  Now, was the time closer to 10 a.m. or to 4 p.m.? 
A.	You're asking me to make an effort.  I understand you.  I have taken the oath to say the truth before I began giving testimony.  I have told you, or I'm telling you what I can remember.  If you ask me to make an effort, I may run the risk of lying to you.  You didn't call me here to lie.  I have given you a testimony relying on what I remember.  If I make an effort in order to give you details, I am likely to tell you some untruths, and that is not why I am here.  

I remember that they were in my house during the day, and they remained there late into the night on that night of the 24th, but I can't tell you what hours.  I'm not here to tell lies.  Now, if I start giving approximations, or if I make an effort to give you the details that you are asking for, there is the possibility that I may tell you something that is not exactly the truth, and that wouldn't be correct. 
Q.	I understand you, Madam Witness.  Unfortunately, however, because you can't remember certain hours, I think that is where the problem is because it doesn't help us.  

	Now, we are going to move on to the 25th.  On the 25th, you saw him in your living room.  You have told us that he had left and gone to Gitarama where the government was; that is between 8 and 9 o'clock a.m., and that he came back in the evening.  And you place that period -- and we are lucky because you remember the time -- you put the time at between 6 and 7 p.m. 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	If I get you well, Madam Witness, between 8 and 9 a.m. up to 6 and 7 p.m., André Rwamakuba wasn't with you? 
A.	Between 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, and 6 or 7 p.m., he was not with me on the 24th -- on the 25th. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, would it be possible for you to tell us or not what André Rwamakuba would have done during that period? 
A.	What period are you referring to?  I would like you to tell me exactly what period you're referring to. 
(Pages 49 to 53 by Jennifer Spring)







1530H 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	You said that between 8 and 9 o'clock, André Rwamakuba left your house to go to work in Gitarama, and that he only returned in the evening between 6 and 7 p.m.  So, I am referring to the period that goes from between 8 and 9 to 6 and 7.  
A.	He told me that he was going to Gitarama to meet the other ministers.  He (sic) did not know what he did, as I did not spend the day with him.  I can only tell you what I saw when we were together.  I wasn't with him during that time.   
Q.	So, since you were not with him, are you not able to say what he might have done? 
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	Now, we shall move on to the 26th -- 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I believe it is half past three.  I do not know if this is an appropriate time to take a break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
(Court recessed from 1537H to 1555H)   
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, we are going to proceed, and before we took the break we were talking about the 26th.  You said that on the 26th, just as for the 25th, André Rwamakuba left between 8 and 9 in the morning and that he went to work; and then he returned between 6 and 7 p.m. 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	I shall put the question to you again.  So during that time, that is between 8 to 9 o'clock and 6 to 7 p.m., you are not able to tell us what André Rwamakuba might have done, are you? 
A.	I cannot tell you what André Rwamakuba was doing because I was not with him.  He had gone to Gitarama to join other ministers; and he said that he was going to work.  So I cannot say what       André Rwamakuba did on the 25th and the 26th, from 8 -- from between 8 and 9 to between 6 and 7. 
Q.	For the dates of the 27th, 28th and 29th, you tell us that you do not know what happened and that you only remember that at one point you went to a burial; you are a lot less precise? 
A.	On those dates, that is the 27th, 28th and 29th, I do not remember on which of those dates we went for the burial.  What I do know is that we went for the burial and we returned only in the evening.  As usual, on the 29th we chatted.  They went to the hotel and I stayed with the children.  I do not know whether, on the 29th, he took back his wife.  What I am sure of -- what I know for sure is that on the evening of the 29th I saw him; so he returned.  Sometimes he would come before 6 p.m.
At no point did he ever return beyond 7 p.m. because he had been told that it was unsafe to travel after 7 p.m. because the country was at war.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether on the 27th, the 28th and the 29th, André Rwamakuba went to Gitarama as usual? 
A.	But I have just told you that I don't know.  I told you that on one of those dates we went to this burial.  Between the 27th and the 28th, I know that we spent -- we spent the day with a family who had just lost one of theirs.  And I remember that on the 29th, he returned.  And he said to me that he was coming back from work.  I know that we spent one day together, and we were at the burial.  

On the 29th, in the evening, he came back home.  And he said he was coming from work.  And each morning he would take his wife, and since -- even though I couldn't see him as -- even though I couldn't see him as I was often in the kitchen, he would bring his wife in the morning.  If I didn't see him in the morning, I would see him in the evening.  But I cannot give any details as to the events of the 27th, 28th and 29th, in respect of what he did in terms of work. 
Q.	So, if I understand you correctly, Witness, in spite of the lack of detail, you went to this burial on the 27th or the 28th.  You cannot say what André Rwamakuba's schedule was -- that on the 29th he returned to your home; is that correct? 
A.	On the 27th or the 28th, I really cannot know exactly which date it was.  But what I'm sure about is that we went for a burial.  And for the 29th, I say that he came back to my home, I saw him in the evening.  Perhaps on one of those dates he came and left his wife and went away again.  I must say that I did not see him leave in the morning of the 29th.  I think he had come to drop off his wife, as he used to.  I was in the kitchen, I didn't see him come. 
Q.	Madam Witness, once more, do we agree that on the 27th, the 28th and the 29th, apart from the time when you say that you went to a burial together, you cannot -- and this is what you have stated, be able to tell us what the exact schedule of André Rwamakuba was? 
A.	I -- what I am sure of is that I could not have slept without seeing him.  I saw him every day.  There was no day on which I did not see him. 
Q.	Once more, apart from the evening where you couldn't have slept, if you had not seen him, can you tell us whether you know exactly what André Rwamakuba used to do during the day until the evening when you did see him? 
A.	Apart from the day that we spent together, and the 29th when we met in the evening, I must say that I was not with him at all -- all of the times.  And I was not supposed to be his keeper.  All I know is that he would bring his wife and then he would go away again. So I cannot give you any detail as to what he was up to.  I was not his guard; I was not his keeper.  
Q.	Witness, to return to this visit that you made together to offer your condolences, if this will not reveal identity, could you tell us the -- about the family where somebody had died or where there was a burial? 
A.	This person was called Mathieu Ngigira (phonetic); and he was buried at his home in Gisenyi préfecture.  He was called Mathieu Ngiriga (phonetic).  
Q.	You have not been able to tell us the exact date when this burial took place, but can you tell us at what time or at what hour this burial did take place? 
A.	I do not remember the hour.  What I am sure of is that the burial took place during the day.  It was not in the morning; it was in the course of the day.  I was not concerned with the time of burial.  I was not a member of the committee that was in charge of organising his burial.  
Q.	You say that it was in the daytime.  If I understood you clearly, you did say that it was not during the morning.  Would you then say it was in the afternoon or in the evening? 
A.	I said that it was not in the after -- in the morning and it was not at night; it was during the day. 
Q.	Would I be more precise than you are being if I said that if it was not in the morning and it was not in the evening, it was during the daytime and, therefore, in the afternoon? 
A.	It was during the day, and there are many hours in the day, that part of the day.  And I am telling you what I understand by "daytime".  A burial takes a lot of time.  It doesn't take just one hour, see.  It takes many hours.  Perhaps you would like me to tell you the time when the mortal remains were placed in the grave.  In any case, I was not part -- a member of the committee responsible for the burial.  I was sitting there, just like everyone else who had gathered there for this burial but I remember that it was during the daytime.  I didn't check my watch. 
Q.	Madam Witness, seeing as you have brought it up, perhaps you might tell us when the ceremony began and when it ended and how long -- how many hours it took?
A.	I didn't pay attention to it.  All I know is that I went to the burial.  I do not know how long it lasted.  
Q.	I realise, Madam Witness, that you are not helping us a lot with your answers.  Madam Witness, can you tell us how André Rwamakuba used to go to Gitarama? 
A.	He went on board a vehicle. 
Q.	Was it a personal vehicle? 
A.	He did not have a car of his own, it was a service car. 
Q.	When he went to work with this service car, was he escorted or not? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	You see him leaving practically every day between 8 and 9 and he returns between 6 and 7 p.m. on board a service car, a significant figure of authority whose visits you were glad to receive, and you do not know whether this person was escorted or not? 
A.	I want to clarify one point, I do not know whether it might reveal my identity.  May I speak?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you see we don't know what you are going to say.  If it is a matter that might reveal your identity, we should go into closed session for the moment.  We like to compress all of the closed session issues for one particular moment.  

Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think it is the witness who is requesting a closed session.  I do not know what she is going to say and how I will react to it, but I shall try to limit it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are examining her.  It is your examination. 
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, I put questions to her, I was putting questions to her and at one point she said she wanted to say something.  So, I am like you, I am completely unaware of what it is she wishes to say.  Perhaps since this might reveal her identity, it may be a good idea to go into closed session.  I don't know how I will react to what she might say.  I don't know how long it will take. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Perhaps we can just be sure, Mr. President, that the witness is going to answer the Prosecutor's question.  If she is, then we should go into closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor, obviously, would like to hear what the witness is going to say; that is the impression that I got. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think we all heard the same thing.  The witness, in response to an answer said -- in response to a question said that she wanted to provide details but she felt that this might reveal her identity.  And you said, "If that is the case, perhaps we might go into closed session." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, about how long do you think your statement is going to last, the confidential statement?  
THE WITNESS:
This answer would take about 30 seconds.  It is an answer to the question put by the Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, we are obligated to take steps to protect the witness from revealing her identity.  We will go into closed session.  We think it will last for a very short time, probably just about one minute.  Closed session.

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, is it possible for you to describe the car that the doctor moved about in? 
A.	I really don't remember very well.  I do not remember the features of the vehicle nor do I remember its brand, its make.  But I vaguely remember that it was blue in colour. 
Q.	You say that it was a blue vehicle; can you tell us the make? 
A.	It was not a dark blue; I don't remember the make.  I have never traveled on board of this vehicle which might have enabled me to remember all of its features.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that you did not see him leave and return every day.  Is it then possible that there were times when he might have traveled on board another vehicle? 
A.	Sometimes he would tell me goodbye when I was in the living room and the car was parked outside.  But, generally, he had only one vehicle and he had a driver. 
Q.	Without seeing him leave every day, can you be clear -- can you be categorical and say that he always took the same vehicle? 
A.	I did not see him start the car every day, but could I see the car parked outside.  I told you that sometimes I would be in the kitchen.  I wasn't paying attention to the sort of vehicle that he would use on a daily basis.  Sometimes, I would see him come -- arrive and get into the living room immediately.  I didn't pay attention to all of the details and to the car that he took -- that he used every day.  I had work to do in the kitchen.  I had to look after his sick child.

1623H 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	To summarise your answer, you were not always present when André Rwamakuba left.  You saw the vehicle parked.  You were often in your kitchen.  So it is entirely possible that he used another car and you were not aware of it.  
A.	When the car was parked outside, it meant that he was present.  No one else used that car.  Even if I did not see Dr. Rwamakuba and I saw the car parked outside, it would mean that he was in my home.  He never walked.  He didn't have another driver.  So this vehicle was reserved for his sole use.  
Q.	Well, Witness, can you tell us, do you know the distance between Gisenyi and Gitarama? 
A.	Since I've used that road, I know the distance.  But I would not be able to give it to you in terms of kilometres.  However, I have used the road.  But it's not far.  
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	Gitarama is not as close to Gisenyi as Ruhengeri, but the trip is relatively long.  It's not the sort of trip you can make in half an hour.  It would take longer.  When he returned home, it could be seen that he was tired.  When I was in Rwanda, I could tell you the distances, but I really couldn't give you the figure in terms of kilometres now.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you may not be able to give us the distance in kilometres.  Since you have covered this distance, can you tell us how much time it might take to cover that road by car? 
A.	You could cover that distance in some hours, but it's a long time that -- since I went to Rwanda last, since I was in Rwanda last.  And in the meantime, I have lived -- I have experienced difficult times, so I might say that, between Gisenyi and Gitarama, there is a long distance.  One cannot cover this distance in 30 minutes, not even in an hour.  Besides, Gitarama and Gisenyi do not share a border.  There is a préfecture between the two préfectures. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that -- after all those dates we have just talked about, you told us, therefore, that André Rwamakuba's family left on the 2nd of May and that after that you no longer regularly saw André Rwamakuba.  Would you be in a position to tell us how many times you saw him after his family left? 
A.	I cannot tell the number of times I saw him after his family left.  When his family was in my home, I took care of them.  I -- I was in charge of his family and his children, which means that I was more interested in his family than before.  But when his family left, I felt -- well, my work was more reduced, and I didn't pay much attention to his movements after his family left my home.  

The truth of the matter is that I did not -- I no longer saw him frequently.  Sometimes I would be in the Christian (sic), and I would be told later that he stopped by for a brief moment.  
Q.	You're saying that he would stop briefly at your place and that you no longer saw him regularly.  And this means that during that period you can't tell what exactly André Rwamakuba was doing during that period.  
A.	No, I can't tell you what his timetable was, since he was no longer as regular at our place as before. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have stated that from a certain time you no -- never saw him again but that you asked for information and were told that he had left.  Can you tell us who is the person who gave you the information, if, of course, this wouldn't reveal your identity.  
A.	My husband is the person who informed me.  I asked him why I was no longer seeing André Rwamakuba, and he told me that he had gone away.  
Q.	Can you tell us the date on which you had that information? 
A.	I cannot remember it. 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	The only thing I know is that Rwamakuba left before my departure.  As to the date, I wouldn't be in a position to give you a specific -- a precise date.  He left before the influx of refugees towards Gisenyi.  He had already left before there was the massive migration of refugees to Gisenyi.  That is when he left Rwanda.  
Q.	Madam Witness, it -- it is rather interesting that for certain periods you don't recall dates.  Even if you were requested -- even when you are requested to make an effort, you can't remember.  But for some, like 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, even if there are some loopholes vis-à-vis André Rwamakuba's timetables, you tend to describe the dates very precisely.  And I think you are not without knowing that there are certain charges that are brought before -- against Rwamakuba in respect of events of those dates.  
A.	I don't want to conceal anything.  The fact that there are dates that marked me in my life, given the relationship that I had with this family, I can't forget, for instance, the date of their arrival, and I cannot forget the date of their departure either.  Because we had problems in respect of flight bookings, and we were wondering if finally that family was going to have seats in the planes -- or, in flights.  

And then I could remember some dates because I knew when I had to prepare food for them, for their family, and when I didn't have to.  For instance, on the 23rd I knew that I didn't have to prepare food for them.  So the dates on which I don't have precise information are the 21st and the 22nd, for instance.  Take the 20th, for instance.  I cannot forget that date because we met again, and we conversed for a long time, to the extent that some of us even slept in the living room.  There is a date on which he left his wife and children in my care.  That is the date of the 25th and the 26th.  He left his entire family under my care, and there was nobody who could attend to or consult (sic) his child.  I can't forget all of that.  All that I remember is that after two days, probably on the 27th or the 28th, there was a burial of the person I mentioned to you.  

And on the 29th, in the evening, I told you that he came back at nightfall.  After the 29th he had to say goodbye, or farewell, to his family.  It's as if he had taken leave since he came back to our home because he had to say bye to his family.  So there are dates that I do remember very well, and there are others that don't ring a bell.  So there are dates that have been etched into my memory and others that I don't remember.  

I remember that on the 23rd I didn't prepare food for them.  I also remember that when he returned to Fidele's house, they came back to our house, they had to tell us farewell, and he had to say farewell to his family. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  As I was telling you, for certain dates you seem to have a gigantic memory, whereas for others you tend to lose your memory, whereas you did say that those events occurred some 11 years ago and that you are not in a position to remember what happened.  Now we're going to take on a different line of questioning.  

Madam Witness, later you gave a description of André Rwamakuba, and I'm going to put questions to you in respect of what you knew of André Rwamakuba.  You told us, indeed, that you have known André Rwamakuba for more than 20 years.  
A.	Yes, that was my testimony.  I have known him for more than 20 years.  I knew him while he was still single and unmarried.  I think he's -- his elder son must be more than 20 years old.  So you can see that I have known him for more than 20 years, or for a very long time. 
Q.	When you talk about his oldest child who is more than 20 years of age, are you talking about Marie Ange? 
A.	Yes, I'm referring to Marie Ange because she is his oldest child.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you gave a description of André Rwamakuba, that is, his -- you have described his character, and I was given the impression that he was a saint, that he was somebody who was a very calm person, he was reserved, introverted, he did his work, respected people, and who weighed his words before talking, did not like quarrelling, respected everyone, loved his family very well, and took good care of them.  So this is a person who never got angry, never raised his voice, so this is a person who was almost perfect.  
A.	Well, nobody's perfect.  There is no saint.  Saints are not of this world.  I have said good things about him, and I've said what I know of him, since this was a person who was rather reserved and he didn't talk much.  You -- one may not know certain things about him.  Probably the negative thing that we criticised him of was that he worked too much.  He was always in the office, and sometimes he was very stressed up because he worked too much.  

As to the fact that he was a perfect person or a saint, I would say that he was a person of good demeanor, of good character.  But it would be exaggerating -- or, you would be saying too much to say that he was a saint, because saints are not of this world.  I have never heard him fighting with anyone.  I've never heard whether he had mistresses, and I never heard that he was fired from his job because he was incompetent.  And I never heard anybody complain that he was discourteous towards him or her.  So the only negative thing I can say that he had was that, when he was grieving, it was very difficult to comfort him.  
Q.	Madam Witness, you have given a lengthy answer.  It is possible that I may consider him a saint or a perfect person.  Well, I merely stated that the description that you gave of him gave me the impression that he was close to a -- perfection.  

Madam Witness, you said that he shunned quarrels, that he never raised his voice, and yet you did give account of the fact that, at a certain time in your home, when the person called Donago (sic) came, they had a problem, he raised his voice, and that you even had to go closer to see what was -- what had happened and to listen to what was being said and that there were times, which means that there were times when André Rwamakuba could lose his cool.  
A.	If I take stock of all the years that we have spent together, I would say that I noted -- noticed that he was a good person who did not like quarrels, even when they were together.  Well, they probably raised their voices, but since we knew that our man was generally very calm, we moved closer to see exactly what they were talking about.  Dr. Rwamakuba could not insult that person.  He needed to respect him because Murego was someone who was older than the doctor.  

In any case, they did not quarrel to the extent that people outside got to know the fact that they had quarrelled.  This is a person who never started any quarrel with anybody.  They merely raised their voices.  
Q.	You haven't answered the precise question that I asked you.  My question is, was it possible, yes or no, that Dr. Rwamakuba may, from time to time, lose his cool? 
A.	This was a person who knew how to control himself.  Even when people started quarrels, he would tell them to stay calm.  At least that is what we knew of him, that is, that he knew how to control himself.  
Q.	On that specific day in your home, did he lose his cool or not?
A.	Well, he still maintained his cool.  The person who was raising his voice was that man who was older than him.  

And, by the way, nobody outside the house heard their conversation.  We, who were in the house, in the room, were the only ones to have heard their conversation.  Well, you couldn't talk of -- of a conflict, as such.  It was rather a heated debate.  We came out of our rooms to see what was happening, but I wouldn't say that they were quarrelling.  He liked the cool, the calm life.  He did not like quarrels.  
Q.	I will retain the words "a heated debate."  

Madam Witness, you later described André Rwamakuba as a person who was slim, who was very elegant, and always dressed to kill.  And when the question was put to you as to whether he used to wear glasses, you were rather angry, and you said "never."  Now, when you say "never," which period are you referring to? 
A.	Since I knew him, I never saw Rwamakuba wearing glasses.  Probably he had reading glasses, glasses he would use in the office.  There are people who have glasses in their offices and which they use in their office.  I've never been to his office.  But for as long as I knew him, for as long as I've known him, and since the last time that I saw him in 1994, I am very sure, or certain, that Rwamakuba didn't wear glasses except probably he wore glasses when he was in exile.  Probably he wears glasses today.  I haven't seen him.  But up until when I saw -- last saw him in 1994, I never saw him wearing glasses, except probably he started wearing them when he went in exile. 
Q.	Madam Witness, a short while ago in your answer, you gave evidence to the effect that probably people in -- people -- there may be people who wear glasses in their offices.  Can you be more specific?  You even said that you never saw him in his office.  "I didn't know whether he wore the glasses in his office or not."  Now, can you be very formal and say that this kind of glasses, André Rwamakuba never wore them? 
A.	He never wore glasses.  I never saw him wearing glasses while he was in my house.  I never saw him wearing glasses while he writes something.  He never put on glasses in order to read.  I know there are a number of things that are forgotten, but since I, myself, I wear glasses, I cannot lose sight of that detail, since I, myself, I wear glasses.  And I can tell you all those -- I can point out to you all the persons who are wearing glasses in this courtroom.  Well, I never saw him wearing glasses.  
Q.	Who are the persons who are wearing glasses in this courtroom now?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I just state for the record, my learned friend made reference to anger from the witness in response to my question about glasses.  For my part, I did not notice any anger from the witness, although I accept that that came through in the translation.  
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MS. FALL:
I did not quite understand his question that was asked by the counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...a comment was made.  I don't think it necessarily requires a response.  Counsel did not agree with a word that you used.  

Have you completed your examination now?  
MS. FALL:
I'm not done yet, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MS. FALL:
I have virtually completed it.  I probably may need about ten minutes more, six to ten minutes more.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you are saying, therefore, that you knew or that you can tell all those who are wearing glasses.  You can tell who is wearing glasses here.  Now, you can see me.  Am I wearing glasses? 
A.	You are not wearing glasses.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	Madam, you're not wearing glasses.  
Q.	Is this something that you can say is something I do consistently, or can you tell whether under other circumstances I might wear glasses? 
A.	As far as you are concerned, I can say that, from what I see of you today, you don't wear glasses.  But I cannot tell whether you have once worn glasses or not in the past or whether you wear glasses under other circumstances.  

Madam Prosecutor, as far as Rwamakuba is concerned, this is somebody that I knew very well, and I have never seen him wearing glasses.  And I have never seen him take out glasses from his pocket to put on.  So I knew him very well, and I think I can make that assertion, so far as he's concerned.  But as far as you are concerned, I cannot answer in affirmative.  
Q.	Witness, does this mean that 24 hours out of 24, during the period in which you used to see André Rwamakuba, were you with him?  
A.	I did not see him 24 out of 24 hours, but this is somebody I saw when he was young and whom I saw when he got married and when he became minister.  On all these various occasions, I never saw him wearing glasses or take out reading glasses from his pocket, put them on, read a document, and put them back in his pocket.  A person you meet regularly cannot have glasses, so you don't know.  He never wore glasses up until when I last saw him, and it's been 11 years since I last saw him.  Probably during that 11-year period he has had to wear glasses, or that he wears glasses today, but that I cannot tell. 
Q.	Thank you for answering to the effect that you were never always with André Rwamakuba, which could mean that he probably wore glasses at one moment or another.  

Madam Witness, I'm going to go back to the two photographs, and I'm sorry to do this, but I have -- I would like to show them to you.  
MS. FALL:
I wonder if the registry can show the pictures to the witness.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I -- can I just note, I mean, my learned friend's perfectly at liberty to do as she wishes with the photographs, but can I note that I have only put one photograph in front of the witness, in case she feels that I've put two?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I wish to know if those two photographs will be admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)...has been admitted.  It's a photograph with a picture of two persons in it.  That's what you mean "two photographs"?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, two photographs were disclosed to us, so there are two photographs that were disclosed to us this morning. 
MR. O'SHEA:
If I could just clarify the matter, I did disclose two different photographs to my learned friends for the Prosecution this morning, indicating that I may use one or the other or both.  And -- and I have only used the one, which is the photograph with the two people in it.  Just so that's clear.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think it's possible for me to show the two photographs to the witness, since those photographs were disclosed to us.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm very happy with that.  I was just clarifying the position.  
MS. FALL:
I will, therefore, request that the registry clerk hand over the two photographs to the witness.  
(Pages 60 to 66 by Ann Burum)

















1700H
MR. O'SHEA:
The coloured copy is D. 176.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you have seen the two photographs.  You gave a description of Dr. André Rwamakuba.  The description that you gave us, does it reflect more the description of the photograph that he had on the day of his wedding, or the photograph in which he is with his wife and children?
A.	I think that my description captures what you see on the two photographs.  Generally speaking, I cannot say that my description does describe him more as he appears in one picture or the other.
Q.	With respect to the second photograph, which was taken years after the wedding of André Rwamakuba, do you think that André Rwamakuba was also as slender as he looked on the day of his wedding?
A.	Rwamakuba is a person who has never changed.  He never put on weight and never lost any.  He maintained his size.  He probably changed.  He has probably lost a bit of weight or -- but he was more or less the same size at all times.  You know, when you're growing up, as you're ageing, your face may broaden and you may look bigger, but I think the characters or traits of his face remain the same.  So as far as his physiology or his physical looks are concerned, he has not changed much.
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that since you knew that he had left, you have not had an opportunity of seeing him again.  Now, can you be very specific and tell us whether, in a period of about 11 years, Rwamakuba has stayed the same -- has remained the same person, physically?
A.	Well, I wouldn't know.  I cannot know whether he has been ill or not, if he hasn't put on weight or not -- if he has put on weight or not, if he has had an accident, lost an eye or not, or if something else has happened to him.  It's been 11 years since I last saw him, and nobody has described him to me.  Nobody has shown him to me, and I'm not seeing him here in the courtroom.  I don't know where you have kept him.  I'm not seeing him here.  If I were to see him, I would be able to tell you whether he's changed or not.
Q.	So what you were saying a while ago, that this is someone who doesn't change and whose countenance is still the same doesn't mean anything.  He may have changed, because you haven't seen him in 11 years, have you?
A.	I am not saying that this is someone who does not change.  I'm just saying that in the time I knew him he hadn't changed.  It is possible that people can change physically within five or ten years, but in his case, when I knew him and when I used to see him, he hadn't changed.  And I cannot say anything about the 11-year period that has gone past since I saw him for the last time.
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us this morning that you've known André Rwamakuba for more than 20 years and that ********************************************** and that this is a very strong friendship that links you to his wife and children along with himself.
A.	Are you talking about this situation now?  I, as far as I'm concerned, have no family, in a manner of speaking, and we no longer see each other.  I cannot say that we're -- it cannot be said that we're close friends.  Our children have grown up.  Since they do not meet, it is difficult for them to remember the children of the other family.  It might be said that we were close friends, but the same is not true now, because we have not met for a long time.  You cannot be close friends unless you meet regularly.  We don't visit each other; we're not neighbours; we have no contact.  We roam the world, but we no longer have any contact.
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm not referring to current contact.  I'm saying that this friendship of 20 years -- of more than 20 years, meant that you were very close, which means that there was a relationship of trust between you, which is illustrated by the fact that Rwamakuba left his family in your home for several days.  This relationship of trust made you say that he was concerned -- that you felt concerned about what was going on in Rwamakuba's family.  I think that this was a very strong friendship that connected you to André Rwamakuba.
A.	We were friends.  I would say that I was closer to Rwamakuba's family than my husband.  Because my husband did not know them, it is I who introduced the Rwamakuba family to him.  I was close to Rwamakuba's wife.  Out of respect for me, as husbands generally do, my husband felt close to that family, and he did become close to them.  Apart from that, I was closer to Rwamakuba's family than my husband was.
Q.	Madam Witness, this friendship that bound you, I am persuaded that it was a great friendship.  It was such a strong friendship that this morning, when you were shown the photographs of André Rwamakuba, his wife and family, your feelings were so strong that you shed tears.  That is understandable when we are linked by very strong ties to people.  I quite understand, and it also explains that in this Trial Chamber you cannot say anything against André Rwamakuba.  It may also explain the fact that you are not perhaps entirely impartial in this matter.
A.	I have told you what I know.  I did not say anything about what I did not know.  If he had done something bad -- something very bad, and I was aware of it, I would have told you about it.  I cannot try to cover him.  I cannot try to protect him.

I have told you what I know, and that is all.  If a friend of yours commits a serious crime, you cannot protect him by avoiding talking about it.  If he had done something serious, I would have said it so that you will compare what is good and what is bad to arrive at a judgement.  That, perhaps, might enable people to be able to judge what good he has done.  I cannot make up anything.  Just as I cannot make up what he did that is good, I cannot invent what he did that is bad.  I cannot lie about him.

Besides, you did not tell me that you accuse him of committing such-and-such a crime so I would say something about it.  When I was giving testimony, you did not ask me to plead for him or speak on his behalf.  You have put questions to me, which I have answered, about his schedule.  But you have not put specific questions to me about the charges that have been brought against him, or the crimes that you are accusing him of.
Q.	Madam Witness, I think that the Defence counsel had ample time to tell you what he was accused of, and when.  That is largely responsible for your presence before this Trial Chamber here.
A.	All the Defence team asked me was they put questions to me about when I had seen him, at what time, and when we had been friends.  But they did not tell me about the charges that were being brought against him.  They just told me that he was accused of murder, or having taken part in massacres, without being specific.  So they did not give me the counts in the indictment in a detailed manner against Rwamakuba.

They asked me questions about when I had seen him, and I told them that I saw them -- I saw him on such-and-such an occasion.  They asked him -- they asked me whether I had seen him during the war and whether I was prepared to come and say so before the Trial Chamber, and I agreed.
They did not give me the details about the counts in the indictment.  

And you, madam, neither have you raised this matter when you were putting questions to me.  And, for my part, I have told you all I know.  I have given testimony.  I did not say what I did not know.
Q.	Madam Witness, I told you when I said that on the date when you mentioned André Rwamakuba's presence at your home, that date was the date when he was accused of committing acts of genocide.  I think that Defence Counsel did say this, because you have said that they did say, without going into detail, that he had been accused of committing certain massacres, and these massacres were purportedly committed on the dates when André Rwamakuba was in your home, without, however, giving you more information.

You have also said that there are many gaps in his programme that you would not be able to fill.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your six or ten minutes have stretched to nearly half an hour.  We have to take the adjournment early.  If you are not -- you are finished now, or you want to complete tomorrow morning?
MS. FALL:
No, no, Mr. President, just one last question and I'll be finished.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, I was saying that I did as they did, which is that I talked about the massacres, and you have answered the questions in a manner that the Chamber will judge for itself.  

One last question:  since I was putting questions to you about Mr. Rwamakuba's traits, you said that I didn't know everything about André Rwamakuba.  I'll return the question to you.  Do you know everything about André Rwamakuba?
A.	I do not know him completely, but I know him very well.  You asked me whether I knew his timetable 24 hours a day, and I said, "No, I'm not his wife.  I'm just a family friend."  And I know what I ought to have known as a family friend.  It was a friend whom we valued, who was likeable and respectable in the way he conducted himself.

But, you know, a human being is complex.  He might have had a scar on his buttocks, for instance.  How would I know?  A person is a complex human being.  It is difficult for me to say I know somebody completely.  It is completely incorrect to say that you know somebody completely, because, you know, even your husband, you cannot know him entirely.  If I told you I know him completely, then I would be lying.  I know him very well, but I do not know him completely.

You might be mistaken when you say that you think you know your husband very well.  But it's not true.  You can never know anyone completely.  A person might have ulcers.  How are you going to know?  It's very difficult, and it is difficult to say that you know somebody completely.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I will recall, for your benefit, that you say that you know André Rwamakuba very well, but that you do not know everything about André Rwamakuba.  Thank you for answering my questions.
A.	Thank you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
MR. O'SHEA:
I understand you want to finish, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to be long? 
MR. O'SHEA:
I can use the time to 5:30, but if Your Honours wish to finish early -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  In fact, we thought we were going to finish at 5 o'clock.  I just allowed Ms. Fall to complete.  How much time do you need? 
MR. O'SHEA:
About 10 or 15 minutes, I think.  But we can break -- we can break.  We've got plenty to do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can complete in two minutes, you can start.
MR. O'SHEA:
No, can't promise that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Greased lightning, we were promised.  
Yes, Madam Witness.  Although your testimony is almost completed, our rules require that the lawyer who questioned you first has a chance to ask you some other questions.  I'm afraid you're going to have to come back tomorrow morning for the completion of your testimony.  

As I told you at lunchtime today, while you are a witness here, during any adjournment you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.

We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1720H)
