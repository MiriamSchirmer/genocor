P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 17th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances are the same.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  I would like to introduce you to Mr. Jean Paul Simbizi, who is our new investigator.  So, I would just like to indicate to you that we have a new member in our team.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, and we welcome him to the proceedings. 

Before the proceedings start, we wanted to give our decision on what transpired at the applications made at the end of the proceedings yesterday afternoon. 

Yesterday, the Chamber considered that Witness HH could be asked about information provided to Rwandan judicial authorities with the proviso that the witness should be at liberty to indicate that such communication could jeopardise his security or security and safety of his family.  The Defence for Nzirorera then asked the witness to provide in writing a list of the instances in which HH was interviewed by Rwandan judicial authorities, including the approximate date and the name of the person in whose dossier or file he was being questioned.  The witness refused to provide this information, referring to what the Chamber indicated earlier. 

The presiding Judge then explained again to the witness that the Chamber allowed questions concerning information the witness gave to Rwandan judicial authorities, except if the witness indicates that giving any of that information would jeopardise his security or the security of his family. 
Responding to the questions of the presiding Judge, the witness indicated that he met with the authorities of the Kigali prosecution department regarding his own conduct on more than one occasion.  The Defence for Nzirorera then asked, again, the witness to indicate when he met Rwandan judicial authorities about the case other than your own.  The witness acknowledged that he met with Rwandan authorities but reiterated his refusal to give the details on the contents of those discussions.  We, however, agreed to answer questions regarding his own trial in Rwanda and in relation to the Accused in the trial -- in this trial but said that, and I quote, "Regarding testimonies in other trials, I have told you that I cannot answer them." 

The Chamber found that this answer conformed to the advice the Chamber had given to the witness, that he should not be compelled to make those disclosures in the interests of his security and the security of his family.  The Chamber was satisfied that such exceptional measure was not inconsistent with the rights of the Accused and therefore exercised its power under Rule 90(F) of the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence with regard to these questions. 

The Chamber wants now to clarify two things in relation to what was said yesterday by Defence counsel.  First, the Defence for Nzirorera stated that the Chamber was, and I quote, "Sanctioning this witness, deciding who he wants to give the information to and who he doesn't."  The Chamber never allowed the witness to refuse to respond to the Defence for Nzirorera because of the personality of the Accused's lead counsel.  The witness was allowed to indicate that the disclosure of certain information may jeopardise his security and the security of his family and therefore refused to answer a question.  This ruling was made without regard to the person who asks the question. 

Secondly, the Defence for Nzirorera stated the Chamber, and I quote, "was not willing" to order the Rwandan judicial authorities to search their records for any statements made by the witness to them and other dossiers and that, and I quote again, "The Chamber, instead of providing all the facilities necessary for the ascertainment of the truth and the assistance of the Defence, which is required by the statute, set up a complete roadblock to obtaining the information." 

Now, apart from being discourteous, this representation made by the Defence for Nzirorera is inaccurate, since the Chamber has taken several steps in order to assist the Accused to prepare their defence.  There is no need at this stage to detail those steps.  

The Defence has received many disclosures concerning this witness.  There is reason to believe that the Defence has had adequate time, facilities, and information to cross-examine the witness, including challenging his credibility. 

These clarifications being made, the Chamber is of the view that nothing prevents that the cross-examination of the witness should continue.  We will rule on the application made by Mr. Robinson for alternative measures when the Chamber will receive the necessary information from the Prosecution on Monday, as promised.  

Now, this is our decision, and we consider that Mr. Robinson should immediately proceed to continue his cross-examination, bearing in mind the order we have made.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I have a few other issues, somewhat unrelated to this, that I need to raise with the 
Trial Chamber at this time.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And, if you don't mind, if I could just interject for one second.  

Your Honours, I did agree to provide that information by Monday, but I was able to assemble it last night and this morning.  It was filed by -- with CMS this morning, and I have a courtesy copy for the Court if it would be helpful.  But all of the parties in the court should have that information as soon as CMS is able to distribute it.  And this is a courtesy -- I only have one copy, but this can be made available to the Court or to the Defence if they would like to peruse it at this time.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson, we will hear you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If the witness could take off his headphones, because some of these items don't pertain to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you remove your headphones, please.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
First, Mr. President, you ordered the Prosecutor to file his response to our motion to prohibit witness proofing by the close of business yesterday, and I, as of this moment, never received any response, and I'm wondering if it can be enquired whether such a response was filed as ordered by the Trial Chamber.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, it was, Your Honour.  It was filed yesterday before 5:00.  I think it was filed during our mid-afternoon break, so definitely it was filed around 4:00 yesterday.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Unfortunately, the Prosecutor didn't adhere to the previously agreed practice of emailing copies of their pleadings. 

Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our coordinator was anticipating what your application might be, but I think we should wait to hear what it is.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Obviously having -- the Prosecutor violated your practice direction in failing to transmit that to me by email, which is unfortunate, given the short deadline that I had to reply.  

So, actually, I have two applications.  First, I would need an extension of time to file my reply.  I'm happy to do that by 8:30 Monday morning, assuming that I receive the document today.  

And my second application is, given in light of the fact that we are prevented from making a timely reply, I would ask that an interim measure be made over the weekend that the Prosecution not proof any of its witnesses, given that they violated the practice direction and placed you in the position where you can't rule on anything at this time. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, if the -- if the filing was not transmitted by email, that was an oversight, and we apologise, but I can do that as soon as I sit down now.  But as -- in terms of an interim measure, it would not be appropriate to enjoin the Prosecution from speaking with the next witness.  That would certainly slow down the proceedings.  And as I suggested to the Court the last time this issue came up, you know, a motion of that nature or an order to that effect is, in effect, a request to enjoin the proceedings or to interrupt or suspend the proceedings.  Speaking to witnesses before they testify is an integral part of how we conduct our business in the Office of the Prosecutor and has been so over the last ten years. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I didn't -- the last thing that was said I didn't comment on it, but this is exactly the application before us, and so we're going to rule on that.  You can't assume what our ruling is going to be.  There might be other reasons why it might not be appropriate to grant an interim order, but they have nothing to do with what -- with the point that you just made.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I'm suggesting, Your Honour, is that we have our own procedures that are articulated -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand that, but that's exactly what we've been invited to rule on.  Now, you've made your submissions, and we are going to hear the response from counsel for the Defence, and we will rule on it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we grant the extension of time you requested.  We do not make an interim order.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, the second matter I'd like to bring to your attention is, as you know, the parties made filings concerning the admission of exhibits when the witness comes next week.  I'm trying to decide whether it's necessary for me to spend the time with that witness concerning the UNAMIR documents which were -- which now have the status of having been marked for identification, and I think it's necessary that the Trial Chamber make a decision on that issue of admission -- of admission of exhibits before the next witness testifies.  I would like to bring that to your attention.  Otherwise, we will be spending a few hours with that witness going through the UNAMIR documents trying to lay a foundation for their admissibility.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are sorry that you've had to remind us about that decision.  It's under active consideration, and we expect we should be able to give a ruling on Monday.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, next I would like to correct something that I said a few days ago in questioning this witness concerning Mr. Nzirorera's documentation, showing that he was in Europe at the time of the Ruhengeri meeting.  At that time, I referred to his passport and to a rental car receipt and to a hotel bill.  In fact, I was in error.  Those rental car receipt and hotel bill apply to a trip that he took at a time of a different meeting, and the documentation that I have for this particular meeting is, in fact, his passport and a medical receipt showing that he received medical tests on the 16th of November in Paris.  So since the witness acknowledged that he was in error in claiming Mr. Nzirorera was at that meeting, I don't propose to go into it with him, but I wanted to correct the record and apologise for my error. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, the next item is that we have still not received the letter of HH concerning his security and the transcript of the Radio Rwanda broadcast.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar apparently erred in not doing it, and it will be corrected this morning.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, this brings me to the issue that you addressed when you began this session concerning HH statements and my motion for alternative measures, which you've indicated will be ruled on later.  And I had overnight something I wanted to add to that -- an idea that I had that might make -- be a solution to the problem.  

And what I am asking that you do is that you have the witness provide a list of the material -- the statements that he's made that we're seeking and dossiers of other people and that he provide that list to the Trial Chamber in camera and that the Trial Chamber transmit that list to the government of Rwanda in a confidential basis without disclosing it to the parties and that the Trial Chamber receive the material from the Rwandan government in camera and that at that time it make a determination as to whether or not the material contained in those statements are relevant to the scope of the witness's testimony, including his activities as*****************************************, military training, things like that.  

And if you determine that those materials are relevant, then they, of course, should be disclosed.  And I'm asking that you enquire of this witness before his testimony is concluded -- that you order the witness to make such a list.  And I think that that's a very fair solution to balancing his rights to security versus the Accused's rights, especially in light of the fact that you've precluded me from asking him further questions to demonstrate the relevance of those -- the contents of those statements.  So I would like you to consider that when you're ruling on my motion for alternative measures. 

Finally, Mr. President, my last request is, I'm making a motion that you reconsider the disclosure of the letter that was ruled on yesterday, because what has happened is that when you ruled on that, that the letter cannot be disclosed to the parties, it appears that the letter contains allegations by the witness concerning me or my way I conduct my investigations in Rwanda.  

You then, after making that ruling, credited those allegations by ruling that the witness need not provide the information that I was asking him concerning his cases, and so you made a ruling based upon the security concerns contained in that letter.  And you have not given us an opportunity to respond to those allegations since they're kept from us, and I believe that that is fundamentally unfair for the Trial Chamber to make a ruling based on facts presented by one party or -- or one participant to the process without giving the other participant a chance to respond to those factual allegations.  

And I think the Trial Chamber has itself, on many occasions, espoused that principle that decisions that it should make should be among the parties and not take decisions where a party doesn't have a chance to respond.  And I think that by ruling against Mr. Nzirorera, without giving us an opportunity to respond to the allegations that were made, has violated his rights to a fair trial, and I would ask that, since you took the additional step of relying on that letter and its contents in making a ruling against us, that you now disclose the letter to us.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, there's a point of correction.  You see, as you have correctly stated, the principle of law, to which it was one that we have espoused from time to time, but the problem is that we did not rely on the contents of that letter in our decision-making.  We made certain that it's not part of the evidence in this trial, it's not admitted in evidence.  So it wasn't admitted in evidence and not disclosed.  We decided to order it to be archived to preserve it in case someone wanted to challenge our decision at a later stage.  So we had it archived for the purpose of its preservation and in the interests of the appellate rights of the -- of the Accused.  But it is not a factor in which we considered in our decision-making. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, then if I could -- maybe I misunderstood, because I thought that the witness said that he wanted to communicate the reasons why he did not want to answer the question and that that communication contained those reasons, and you decided he didn't have to make that list, so I'm at a loss to understand the lack of a link between the letter and your decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, well, you see, we're not going to -- we decided that the contents of the letter should not be disclosed, and so we're not going to discuss it, the contents of -- you have made certain assumptions, and we don't think we should either -- we should comment on your assumptions one way or the other.  For us to do so, (unintelligible) give an indication of what the letter contained and did not contain.  

But the document is preserved so its contents would be available in the future if it's necessary for it to be looked at, but in the meantime, you have our statement of assurance that we have not relied on the contents of the document in our decision-making on this issue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
What other -- what other information was before you concerning the witness's security?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can't -- no, no, you can't ask us that question.  Now you're getting -- you can't ask us that.  We have made a ruling.  The record is there, and our ruling is either justified or not justified in accordance with the record and what we have said.  In due course it can be evaluated by an appropriate body.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

So, Mr. President, at this time, I'm ready to continue my cross-examination, given the rulings that the Trial Chamber has made this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be signalled to put his headset back on.
WITNESS HH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  How are you?  
A.	Okay, as usual. 
Q.	Witness HH, have you ever been interviewed by authorities from the -- from the country of Belgium? 
A.	I think I had answered that question yesterday. 
Q.	Well, can you answer it again, please?  
A.	I told you that I had been questioned by the state prosecutor's office, the royal prosecutor's office.  I don't know whether you're right in saying that they were Belgian civil servants.  Where do you get that information from?  
Q.	Approximately when was it that you were questioned by people from Belgium?  
A.	You're emphasising this questioning by Belgian civil servants -- servants of the Belgian government, but if you're really curious about this, I know you've been to Kigali and that you met people who could give you information.  If you want me to provide information, you should do the same thing and go to the prison director, the chief warden, and ask to meet him.  

You're asking me questions on other trials, and as I see things, that is unfair.  In fact, when you put such questions to me, I suspect you want to get information to -- from me to go and use in other trials or you wanted to make me unsafe or members of my family also unsafe.  Please, do ask me questions regarding the trial for which I am here.  When the Prosecutor told me to come here, he told me I was coming here for a specific trial.  So ask me questions on this trial.  

As regards other case files, come to Kigali, ask the prison director if you can meet me, and then you can put questions to me on those other dossiers, those other case files.  
Q.	Witness HH, I remind you that I requested to meet with you before this trial and you refused.  That's one of the reasons why I'm asking you these questions in court now instead of putting those to you privately.  Given that that's the situation, I'm going to ask you to tell us approximately when it was that you were interviewed by people from Belgium.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, that is a question that you can answer -- that you should answer.  

THE WITNESS:
I put the date somewhere, when I met them, but I did not bring that document with me, because I didn't think such a question would be put to me.  Otherwise, I have noted somewhere the date on which I met them. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was it before or after you made your confession on the*****************************?  
A.	It is quite possible that it was before, but as you seem to be interested by this information, I will check in my document and I will inform you what I see.  
Q.	Do you have that document with you here in Arusha?  
A.	No, I don't have it here with me, because when I came to Arusha, I did not think that that document would be of any use to me.  I couldn't imagine that I would be put any questions as to the contents of that document, and I don't have it, therefore, with me here.  But if you're really interested in that information as to the date I met them, when you come to see me, I will be able to provide that date to you as I will check it in my files.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness HH.  Now, when you were questioned by those people from Belgium, did they ask you about the Interahamwe? 
A.	Well, I think that the questioning was not on that topic.  That was not the subject of our discussion -- of our -- of the questioning.  
Q.	And what was the topic of their questioning? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, this last question put to the witness by Mr. Robinson causes me some concern.  I recall that there's a decision -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, if you're going to go into details, we're going to have to go into closed session.  I'm not sure if it has reached that stage yet.  We have been considering this issue as well, and what I suspect your submission will be is something which should be made in closed session, but that time hasn't reached yet.  We don't think the question has -- the questioning has reached that stage as yet.  

But, Mr. Robinson, you know what the issue is.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness HH, can you tell us what was the topic of your interview with the Belgian people?  
A.	Counsel, with regard to this question that you are emphasising, allow me to say the following:  Each time we stop the proceedings, the debate, every time the -- we adjourn, the President tells me not to discuss my testimony with anyone.  Well, those people asked me not to reveal, divulge, the subject of our discussion, so in the same line of reasoning, I cannot speak of what we spoke. 
Q.	Did you sign a statement at the end of your discussion? 
A.	In any case, I did everything they asked me to do, and I think I promised you that I would answer you as to regards the information you've sought, and as to the rest of it, I will comply and respect the promise I made and not reveal the tenor of my talk with those people. 
Q.	Witness, I'm not asking you to reveal the substance of your talk with those people.  I just asked you if you signed a statement with those people.  That can be answered yes or no. 
A.	We have not yet finished.  They are due to come and see me again and have further talks, so we have not yet concluded our talks.  
Q.	Have you yet signed a statement to the Belgians of any kind?  
A.	What I can tell you is there are many statements.  As to signatures on one or the other, I don't remember, but I do know that I have already made several statements to those representatives of the Belgian government.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I have a motion I'd like to make concerning those statements.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I don't know exactly what your motion is, but it seems to me that it's a matter which might need to be dealt with in closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think it might be a good idea.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We go into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 11 to 12] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 10 by Sherri Knox)












BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, I'm now going to ask you some questions about the distribution of weapons, which you testified took place sometime in 1993, and I want to try to establish with you the sequence of events in which weapons were distributed, collected, and stored.  

So, first of all, you've told us that you assisted in the distribution of weapons, along with Jean-Pierre Turatsinze and Silas Kubwimana -- number 54 on the spelling list -- and that that took place sometime between the arrival of UNAMIR in Rwanda and the arrival of the RPF battalion.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that happened before the arrival of the RPF battalion. 
Q.	And it was after UNAMIR had arrived, correct? 
A.	As regards UNAMIR, I do not believe that I said that that event allegedly occurred after their arrival.  I do not remember having said that.  
Q.	Well, didn't you indicate that there was some duplicate key or some other means that were made -- that were used to get the weapons out of a place that they were being stored under the custody of UNAMIR? 
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.  
Q.	So can we agree, then, that at the time the weapons were distributed, UNAMIR was already in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I believe that UNAMIR was already in Rwanda. 
Q.	Now, the first step was the distribution of firearms without magazines; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And did you ask Turatsinze why the firearms were being distributed without magazines?  
A.	Yes, we did talk about that, with Silas, notably.  There were three of us.  And he explained that the magazines were to be distributed separately, subsequently.  And I know that he did have magazines.  He was doing it on purpose, because I followed that question closely, and I noted that he did have magazines and that he had a hidden plan all to himself. 
Q.	Did he give you a reason why it would be necessary to make two distributions, one of the firearms and the other of the magazines?  Was there an explanation given to you of that? 
A.	He never gave me a reason for that fact.  He merely told us that firearms were to be distributed separately from magazines.  He gave me no reason. 
Q.	Now, these firearms, were they old or new?  
A.	No new firearm was included.  They were all used firearms. 
Q.	And was it your understanding that these were firearms that the Rwandan army had confiscated from -- or had obtained from RPF soldiers at the front? 
A.	I do not know.  I do not know where those firearms came from. 
Q.	Now, you've told us about the trips that you made to distribute these firearms to the leaders of the secteurs -- the Interahamwe in each secteur in Kigali and its environs.  Can you tell us approximately how long after that it was that Turatsinze asked for the firearms to be given back? 
A.	I might be able to provide you with an approximation.  I don't believe I can give you a date, but I believe that those arms -- or firearms were recuperated three weeks or probably a month later, that is, after the distribution. 
Q.	And before these firearms were recuperated, had magazines been distributed for any of them? 
A.	That is the pretext that he had advanced with a view to recuperating those firearms.  He said that he had obtained other firearms that did have magazines, and that was the pretext that he used in order to recuperate the firearms from the people who had them in their possession. 
Q.	Now, when Turatsinze recuperated all of these firearms, do you know where he stored them? 
A.	I do not know where he stored those firearms.  What is more, we suspected that Turatsinze had sold those firearms.  As regards the storing, well, I never played a role in that, and I have no idea where he stored them. 
Q.	Now, as of the time the RPF battalion arrived in Rwanda on the 31st of December 1993, it's true, then, that the secteur leaders of the Interahamwe did not have those firearms in their possession, correct? 
A.	The firearms had been distributed, but I know that the recuperation of the firearms did not take place on the same day as the distribution.  I know, however, that the distribution had occurred.  I could give you an example.  If you travel to Kigali, Counsel, then maybe you should conduct investigations on the subject.  The firearms were found at Gasata at one moment where the secteur president of Gasata had buried them below ground.  And I know that those firearms were discovered at one moment in time.  Those were one of the batches of firearms that had been distributed.  
Q.	And who discovered those firearms? 
A.	Are you asking me who benefitted from the possession of said firearms, or are you asking me who discovered them?  
Q.	I'm asking you who discovered them.  
A.	I remember that at that time it was broadcast over Radio Rwanda that those firearms had been discovered.  I do not know whether it was the Rwandan armed forces or whether it was UNAMIR who announced that. 
Q.	And approximately when was it that those firearms were discovered?  
A.	I do not recall very well, but I'm sure that the firearms that were discovered in Gasata were part of the batch of firearms that had been distributed, and when the workmen were constructing a house for one of the presidents of the Interahamwe, they discovered the firearms that had been buried below ground.  I do not remember the month, however. 
(Pages 13 to 14 by Sherri Knox)


1013H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And were those firearms that had been distributed by Turatsinze which he had not yet recuperated? 
A.	Yes, it is possible.  But that was before the firearms were recuperated.  There was a conseiller from Gasata, who is currently in custody at the Kigali central prison, and were you to approach him, he would be able to provide you with further information because he was heading up the secteur at that time. 
Q.	And what's the name of that conseiller? 
A.	His name is François Gahigi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness HH.  Now, Witness HH, as of the date of the swearing in of President Habyarimana on the 5th of January 1994, did the secteur presidents of the Interahamwe have weapons in their possession that had been distributed by Turatsinze, or had they already been recuperated at that time? 
A.	I know that I still had those firearms.  It was only subsequently that we talked about those arms being recuperated by Turatsinze.  So we still had those firearms before the swearing-in ceremony. 
Q.	And there were no magazines other than the five that you had, correct? 
A.	I believe that Silas also had some, because all the firearms were to be found at Silas's residence.  If I obtained firearms, it was because I came to an agreement with Silas, with a view to having some firearms. 
Q.	Do you know how many firearms Silas had with magazines? 
A.	I believe I've already broached that question.  I believe I said that magazines were hid at his residence.  I told you that Turatsinze -- well, I was well aware that Turatsinze had magazines that he did not want to distribute, and he had a hidden plan.  He wanted to have those magazines disappear when the time came.  
Q.	What happened to the magazines that were at Silas's house? 
A.	I did not follow the rest of what happened.  I was not interested in following.  I do not know what Silas and Turatsinze did with those magazines. 
Q.	Now, we have evidence in this case that on the 11th of January Turatsinze provided information to UNAMIR.  And it's true, is it not, that as of that time the Interahamwe secteur leaders did not have firearms with -- which were operable that were distributed by Turatsinze, because they had firearms with no magazines, correct? 
A.	What information would he have given to UNAMIR, then, if you say that the firearms had not been distributed?  Now, in view of the fact that the firearms were distributed before the arrival of the RPF battalion and in view of the fact that he had given a certain amount of information to UNAMIR, well, that is how it came about, and there is no contradiction.  
Q.	No, you're correct, there is no contradiction.  Because we agree, don't we, that at the time of, for example, the 11th of January 1994, the Interahamwe, at the secteur president level, did not have operable firearms which had been distributed by Turatsinze?  Correct? 
A.	But remember the example I gave you.  I said that between three weeks to a month later the firearms were recuperated, and those in possession of firearms were told that they were going to be given new firearms.  I think that's what I told you. 
Q.	Okay.  I understand.  So can we agree that in January of 1994 either one of two things was in place:  Either the Interahamwe secteur presidents had firearms that didn't work, or they had no firearms because they had returned them to Turatsinze?  Is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I would like you to understand correctly.  I told you that we received the firearms towards the end of 1993.  I told you that I had five rifles with magazines.  Séraphin Twahirwa, for example, refused to hand over his firearms, as Aloys Ngirabatware did too.  Those are the examples that I gave you.  I told you that some still had firearms in their possession.  So you should note that some people did receive firearms and refused to hand them over, whereas there are others who did hand them over.  As regards myself, I gave back five firearms, but I retained five. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we clarify the two names for the record, please, because I'm not sure if they came through accurately in the translation.  My recollection was that the witness said Séraphin Twahirwa and 
Aloys Ngirabatware. 
THE WITNESS:
I think there was a third person whose name I do not recall. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
But I do know that the two people that I just mentioned refused to hand over the weapons to Turatsinze.  We talked about it.  What is more, Séraphin had received -- as had Ngirabatware -- had received a large amount of firearms, and they were the first to send their men to weapon training. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And the firearms that they received were without magazines, correct? 
A.	I have provided you with an explanation.  I told you that, when Turatsinze went to recuperate said firearms, they refused to hand them over.  As regards the way in which they got hold of magazines, well, do not put that question to me.  Do not ask me where they got those magazines from because I know that subsequently those Interahamwe did use those firearms.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us approximately when it was that you believe Turatsinze sold the weapons to FRODEBU? 
A.	I believe that people began to talk of that sale around the time when the president of the republic was sworn in.  I think around that time.  That is when people started to say that he had allegedly sold those firearms. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that, after Turatsinze had recuperated the weapons from the Interahamwe secteur leaders, you don't know where he stored them? 
A.	No, I do not know where he stored them.  I've already told you that.  I heard people say that he was selling those arms to FRODEBU.  And, what is more, the number of arms that he had at his disposal did not tally with the number of firearms to be found at Silas's residence. 
Q.	And once he had recuperated those firearms, Turatsinze was free to move them about or store them at any location where he desired without your help; is that correct? 
A.	He had a Suzuki Samurai vehicle, and he would drive around to different presidents with a view to recuperating the firearms.  I did not follow his movements closely when he was moving around to recuperate the firearms. 
Q.	Now, did you ever speak with Turatsinze about any contacts he had with UNAMIR? 
A.	We did not have a conversation on that subject.  However, he did say something to me.  I thought he was joking.  He said that the Inkotanyi were going to take the country over.  That's what he said, but I did not pay much attention to what he said because I thought he was joking. 
Q.	And did you ever hear that he had later joined the Inkotanyi after he fled in February of 1994? 
A.	According to what he said when we were at his residence, he said that he had personal property that he had bought that could be found in Mwanza and that he had the intention of going to recuperate that property.  We were at his home when he said that, and that was on the occasion of the swearing-in ceremony.  He was going to give a name to the twins that had just been born into his family. 
Q.	But did you ever hear later from other people, in trying to understand what had become of Turatsinze, that he had, in fact, joined the RPF? 
A.	As far as joining the Inkotanyi is concerned, well, I heard that information when we were in exile.  But before that moment in time, I had not heard people say that he was an Inkotanyi.  I believe that he had gone to Mwanza with a view to recuperating his personal possessions. 
Q.	And to the best of your information, what happened to Turatsinze?  Is he alive today? 
A.	I have no idea. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our midmorning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1057H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you can continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness HH, did there come a time when Turatsinze was no longer driving the Suzuki Samurai that was owned by the MRND? 
A.	Yes, there did come a time.  Yes.  At that time he moved around in his own vehicle. 
Q.	And about how many months was it before he left in February 1994 that he stopped driving the Suzuki Samurai?
A.	People said that he had been sanctioned, and after that he had been reestablished in office.  But I no longer remember the month or the date of that.  All that I do know is that he was punished and that he was then reinstated subsequently before he disappeared.  
Q.	And the person that sacked him, or sanctioned him, was Mr. Nzirorera, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And there came a time where he was no longer working with Mr. Nzirorera, correct? 
A.	I told you that initially he was sanctioned and then he was reinstated and then he subsequently disappeared.  That is what I told you. 
Q.	And when he was reinstated, was it your understanding that he was still working with Mr. Nzirorera or that he was working with Mr. Ngirumpatse after he was reinstated? 
A.	He was working with Nzirorera. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about lists that you say were compiled by members of the Interahamwe.  Can you tell me when, in approximately what year, you were first instructed to make lists of people? 
A.	As regards the list, if my memory serves me correctly, that practice began towards the end of 1992.  To be more specific, it was after the signature of the agreement between the RPF and the parties that had entered negotiations with the RPF. 
Q.	Who was it who instructed you to make lists? 
A.	The instructions were given during the meetings that we held at the party headquarters, and it was during such meetings that instructions were given.  Those instructions were also broached at meetings held in Ruhengeri.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse took the floor and said that there were people who sent their -- who were sending their children to the RPF and others who paid fees for Rwandans to be killed, he said.  And, "Those people needed to be identified," were his very words. 
Q.	At the meetings in which you were instructed to compile lists, which you say was at the end of 1992, was -- was those meetings of the presidents of the secteur -- the secteur level in Kigali and its environs? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	And at those meetings who was the person who gave you those instructions? 
A.	I told you that the instructions were given during the meetings, and especially those that were chaired by Turatsinze.  But that was a sort of reminder because Mathieu Ngirumpatse had talked about that during the meeting that I mentioned earlier.  So I do not believe that you should dwell on this point.  I would encourage you to go and consult the speech that he made during that meeting, and you will be able to understand everything. 
Q.	So at the meetings that you attended at the secteur level in Kigali, it was Turatsinze who told you to make lists; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, lists were drawn up, and I think they were handed up -- out every day.  So that is to tell you that we did not need to make -- wait for a meeting to be convened in order for a list to be drafted.  And if something new had to be pointed out, then we did so.  When I talk about an incident that needed to be indicated, or pointed out, then there were meetings held by Tutsis and also other people who were against the MRND party.  And we had to draft a report on that subject and hand it over to the relevant person.  We did not meet -- we did not need to wait for a meeting to be held in order to hand over those lists. 
Q.	Now, according to the instructions that you received, who were supposed to be named on these lists? 
A.	The people whose names had to be included on those lists were some of the members of the Tutsi ethnic group who held meetings at night, as well as those people who had sent their children to join the RPF.  We also had to identify those people who gave fees, or sums of money.  And that's what we did on a daily basis.  When we went to the headquarters, one could have imagined that a meeting was held every day because there was comings and goings of people who were there to hand in those lists. 
Q.	Now, do you understand the difference between a list and a report? 
A.	When we talk of reports, I understand that one is required to note what one is aware of and what the authorities might not be happy to -- to note themselves.  That is what I understand by a report. 
Q.	The written information that you provided on Turatsinze's instructions, did it contain merely the names of people, one after the other, or did it contain some other information about the activities of people besides just their names? 
A.	We had to put that person's name on the list and then indicate why that person's name had been put on said list.  
Q.	Now, what did you do, exactly, in your area to compile this list?  Did you give instructions to others, or did you, yourself, collect information for the list? 
A.	Counsel, you are putting that question to me, and I find it highly amusing.  ************************** *********************I could not undertake to compile a list without having sought to obtain sufficient information.  Sometimes I would ask ********************************or possibly a member of the population, to supply me with an -- me with information.  And it is only then that I was able to draft a report. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And was that also the practice of*****************************************, as far as you understood it? 
A.	Counsel, I am only talking about that which concerns me.  I cannot say what ***********************did, but I could say that they followed the same procedure, notably, that they drafted reports after having obtained the requisite information. 
Q.	And those reports were turned in to Turatsinze; is that correct? 
A.	We would hand those reports over to Turatsinze, and when he was not present, when he was on mission, for example, if there was an urgent case, then we had to refer it to the secretary-general of the party, who at the time was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And did you ever see a master list with all the names of those people about whom reports had been made? 
A.	As somebody who often remained at the party headquarters, I know that Turatsinze did, indeed, draft such a list that he then handed over to the secretary-general of the party.  Sometimes I was even in his office, and I was an eyewitness to that. 
Q.	And the people who are on the list, were they only Tutsis or were there Hutus also? 
A.	Counsel, when I say to you that there were Tutsis but that there were also Hutus who were against the MRND party, I think that's easy to understand, that there were Hutus on those lists, as well as Tutsis, of course.  I could state -- or, give the example of Kavaruganda who was a -- who was a Hutu. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me. 
THE WITNESS:
He was killed despite the fact that he was a Hutu.  And I believe that that is a convincing example in itself.  I would give you another example:  Ngirabaciyo (phonetic). 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, were there Tutsis who were not on the list, or was this a list of all Tutsis in Kigali? 
A.	With reference to the procedure that I adopted, not all Tutsis figured on the lists that I drafted.  
Q.	Were you ever ordered to register all Tutsis in your area? 
A.	No, nobody asked me to draft a list of all the Tutsis in my area,**********************************. 
Q.	And so the people who were on this list, were they people who were suspected of collaborating with the RPF in some way? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And these lists were not used to -- these lists were not distributed to Interahamwe after the 6th of April 1994, were they? 
A.	Well, Counsel, once again, I find your question highly amusing.  How would it have been possible to hand those lists over to the Interahamwe in view of the fact that they are the ones who drafted them?  There were no new people amongst their ranks. 
Q.	Well, was any kind of master list distributed by MRND or by the Interahamwe leadership to all of its secteur presidents, for example? 
A.	What I'm sure of and -- are the events that occurred in my secteur only.  Now, with regards to a master list that might have been distributed, well, I do not know.  All that I do know is that every time we drafted a list we needed to retain a copy. 
Q.	And did you use the copy of that list to decide who to kill after the 6th of April? 
A.	Counsel, we did everything.  What is unfortunate is that people were killed, whereas their names did not figure on that list. 
Q.	Now, were you ever present when those lists were presented to or discussed with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Once again, I shall repeat:  Every time a list was handed over to Turatsinze, he would make sure that he handed over those lists to the secretary-general of the party.  I was an eyewitness to that, but it was not part of my duties to make sure that those lists had been handed over to the secretary-general of the party.  But I do know that that was something that was programmed and that was due to occur. 
Q.	Did you ever see Turatsinze hand a list to Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Counsel, when you put the question to me as to whether, yes or no, I was an eyewitness to that event, well, the response that I would give you is that I saw him hand over a list of that description to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And when the situation changed and Ngirumpatse was no longer in post, then I deduced -- or, I deduce that that list needed to be handed over to his replacement. 
Q.	But apart from that deduction on your part, did you ever see a list handed to Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Counsel, I told you that, every time Turatsinze was given a list, then he had to hand it over to his superior.  So it was not necessary to verify that that list was handed over to his superior, yes or no, because I know that that was the practice during that period, and I know that from what was said in the meetings. 
Q.	From what was said by Turatsinze? 
A.	No.  It was a decision that we had made during our meetings, whether those were meetings that Turatsinze took part in or chaired or whether those were meetings that he did not take part in.  People had to go to the secretary-general, and we had decided that those reports were to be handed over to Turatsinze, who would then hand them over to the secretary-general of the party. 
Q.	And did you ever hand any lists or reports to Mr. Nzirorera yourself? 
A.	Personally, no, I never handed either a report or a list to him.  However, that does not mean that I did not draft reports or compile lists when he was secretary-general for the party.  However, I never personally gave him a list or a report. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about the events after the assassination of President Habyarimana.  When you heard about the death of President Habyarimana, who did you believe was responsible for his assassination? 
A.	When I heard the news, in view of the fact of what we were told even before his assassination, because there was a plan to assassinate him, I thought that he had been assassinated by the RPF and the Tutsi accomplices that were to be found inside the country. 
Q.	And what did you think of President Habyarimana?  Did you like him? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know quite how I can express to you just to what degree I liked him.  I liked him greatly. 
Q.	And how did you feel when you heard he had been assassinated and you believed that the RPF and their accomplices were responsible?  How did you feel towards the RPF and their accomplices at that time? 
A.	Counsel, I can see that you are a fully grown man.  And when you lose a relative, a close relative, a child or a husband or a wife, this has a great effect on you when you lose somebody that is very dear to you.  
Q.	Were you angry? 
A.	Counsel, it exceeds anything one can understand.  I was very angry and sad.  
Q.	And what did you do after hearing the news on that day, 7th of April? 
A.	When I heard the communiqué giving the news, I tried to restrain myself because we were told not to leave our homes.  But as *****************Interahamwe and somebody who needed to have further information on the subject of the assassination, I left my home and I went towards the road.  I needed to know how the Interahamwe were supposed to behave in such circumstances.  I did not manage to stay at home.  I could not resist the temptation.  
Q.	And did you seek to contact anyone within the Interahamwe organisation to find out how Interahamwe should act? 
A.	I tried to use a telephone to contact somebody.  I called Séraphin first, who did not reply.  I called Nzabanterura, who did not reply either.  A few moments later, I received a message from Kabugoza -- that's somebody who lived in Kimisagara and who was a proprietor of a garage.  Briefly, I had already come across a number of gendarmes, who had talked to me about the situation, had given me a brief overview. 
Q.	Can you tell us what was the overview that you had been given by the gendarmes? 
A.	They said that the situation was critical and that the Tutsis had committed the unspeakable. 
Q.	And did they discuss with you whether Tutsis should be killed in retaliation? 
A.	Whatever the case may be, I believe that it was not up to me to put questions to them on that subject.  I was waiting for instructions on the part of superior -- or, from superior authorities.  I thought that that would happen, but I preferred to wait to receive instructions.  
Q.	And what other efforts did you take to try to receive instructions on the 7th of April? 
A.	As I have said, when I answered Kabugosa's call, who is staying in Kimisagara, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover), whom we've already spoken of, had his own view of things, and he wanted to attack some of the people on the list.  But as of the moment that I left that place, he started killing people.  And he had already killed four of them on Mount Kigali by the time I got back.  
Q.	And had anyone given (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) instructions to kill, or was that something that he did on his own? 
A.	As for (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover), he followed preceding orders because we knew we couldn't let such a thing pass, even before it had been determined how to react.  And that is how he came about to act the way he did, according to preceding decisions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have to redact the name that was mentioned, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover). 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And also redacted from my comment. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness HH, where did you go on the 7th of April after receiving the telephone call from Kabugoza? 
A.	Yes, I went to see him.  When I arrived there, before even -- before I even got to his place, to his residence, I met him.  And he was being pursued by other people.  And, finally, they killed him in front of Karushara, Rose's, house.  His wife was killed, his children also.  His residence, in -- in brief, had been destroyed because his wife was Tutsi and they said that she collaborated -- cooperated with certain members of UNAMIR.  And that very morning, a UNAMIR vehicle, attempting to evacuate them, had been stopped.  So I could not intervene, and that man was killed in front of conseiller Rose Karushara's residence. 
Q.	Did you have any contact with Conseiller Karushara at that time? 
A.	Yes, quite.  Before I went to see Kabugoza, I first met Rose Karushara.  In point of fact, we were talking when we saw Kabugoza coming -- pursued by his aggressors. 
Q.	And was it Interahamwe who were pursuing him and who killed him and his family? 
A.	Yeah, it was the Interahamwe from Kimisagara -- the Kimisagara Interahamwe.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you have any discussion with Rose Karushara about any instructions that she had received to begin killing? 
A.	It was at a completely different level.  Were I to make an error and arrive at Kabugoza's house before, I would not have -- I would not have been spared.  But as we were still speaking, we see Kabugoza come down, pursued by his aggressors.  And Karushara, as far as she was concerned, she was fully aware.  She was aware of the plans that had been laid. 
Q.	Did she tell you of any contact that she had had since the death of the president with any authorities or any members of the Interahamwe structure? 
A.	Kabugoza came running, trying -- begging for our assistance and saying to his pursuers, his aggressors, that they could refer to me, that I could certify, attest, that he wasn't an Inkotanyi accomplice.  And when he was killed, in view of the circumstances under which he had been killed -- in fact, he was killed because of his wife -- but all in all, we said that he was one of us, but he was killed because of his wife.  After that I left that place and went back home.  
Q.	And when you went back home, was there any other killing that was taking place on the 7th of April in your area? 
A.	Once back home, that's when I noted that that person, whose name we must not reveal, had begun killing people.  And the fourth person to be killed was killed before -- in front of my own -- own eyes.  I came back just as the fourth person was killed.  
Q.	And what was your attitude towards the killing that had taken place?  Did you support it or were you against it? 
A.	Regarding the killings just perpetrated, I was against the fact that some of the people killed were not on the list, the lists we'd prepared in preceding reports.  Moreover, I felt that, as of the moment we hadn't received orders, we shouldn't act in that fashion.  But I did not do anything.  I could not do anything to intervene and stop the killings. 
Q.	Well, since you were******************************************************, why was it that you couldn't stop the killing? 
A.	I couldn't because of what I'd just observed.  I couldn't even dare to articulate it, to say anything, to request it, especially in the presence of that person, whose name we must not mention in open court, because I felt he'd changed.  
Q.	Were you afraid that people, even who had been*********************, might kill you if you tried to stop killings? 
A.	Quite frankly, I did not have the courage to have recourse to ****************to stop that.  This is one point, moreover, on which I have confessed and begged forgiveness.  In view of the situation, I did not have the courage to use ****************and try and intervene.  
Q.	Did you leave your area at any other time on the 7th of April? 
A.	On the 8th, after having met the members of the national committee, I could move around a bit.  If I was to list the places of -- I visited, it might be problematic.  So I did leave the neighbourhood and go around a bit.  
(Pages 15 to 24 by Ann Burum)











1145H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But I was asking you specifically about the 7th of April when you came back from Kimisagara; did you go anywhere else that day or that evening of the 7th of April? 
A.	No, no, I went nowhere. 
Q.	Are you sure? 
A.	No, I went nowhere else. 
Q.	Now, on the 9th of November 2005 you were interviewed by the representatives of the                   Office of the Prosecutor.  And it is reported that you told them that on the evening of the                      7th of April you saw François Karera at the préfecture office, Kigali prefecture, that there were many political and administrative leaders meeting there and that you had gone there to look for Robert Kajuga who was supposed to be at the meeting, but was not.  Did you make that statement? 
A.	I did not quite grasp the date.  Could you repeat the dates? 
Q.	Yes, it was on the 9th of November 2005.  And that was the date of your interview with the                       Office of the Prosecutor.  And the interview took place in prison in Kigali.  And there were two investigators, Lancine Magassouba and  Djibo Moumouni.  Lancine is spelt L-A-N-C-I-N-E; Magassouba, M-A-G-A-S-S-O-U-B-A; Djibo, D-G -- excuse me, D-J-I-B-O, M-O-U-M-O-U-N-I.  And they came to interview you about François Karera.  So I am asking you whether or not you told them, and I'm reading from the top of page 5 of your signed statements, in the English version, the very first paragraph:  "On 7 April 1994, in the evening, I saw Karera for the first time at Kigali-ville préfecture after President Habyarimana's death.  He was still sous-préfet of Kigali rural.  On that occasion there were many political and administrative leaders.  I did not talk to him and did not know why he was there.  I had gone there to look for the chairman of the Interahamwe, Robert Kajuga, who was supposed to be present at the meeting, but was not."  Did you make that statement?  
A.	Thank you, because you have just said that it was Karera.  Well, please, I would beg of you stick to the information regarding this present trial.  And the time will come when we will speak of Karera, and then I will explain to you how it occurred.  We should stick to those parts of my statement regarding the present trial.  If you start speaking of that other dossier, it will make the task more difficult for you.  But we will speak of Karera at the -- later. 
Q.	Witness, is your discomfort in answering that question due to the fact that you have not committed to memory, or studied the statement you made about Mr. Karera as you have committed to memory and studied the statements you have made to the Prosecutor concerning these three Accused? 
A.	I am testifying in a specific trial, I think we should concern ourselves with this specific trial.  And once we have finished that, then I can speak on the other matter.  I have given testimony regarding the present matter, and when you speak of things regarding another matter I think that you are trying to scramble my brains, heat up my head and lead me into error. 
Q.	Yes, that is because, Witness, isn't it, that you have learned by route the story, the false stories that you have told the Prosecutors about the three Accused, but you didn't think that you would have to recite the lesson that you had told them about Karera.  Isn't that why you are unable to answer questions other than that which you have come prepared for at this trial? 
A.	That is not the reason.  You are saying that it is a story that I have memorised.  Well, no, that is not the reason.  It is a question of being specific.  I'm not going to speak of Karera in the present case.  There are people, including your client, against whom I am testifying here.  Let's finish with this and then we will go on to the other matter, because in my understanding when I am asked to explain something on a completely different trial the purpose is merely to destabilise me. 
Q.	Witness HH, a person who is telling the truth, when they are asked what they did on a particular day they can recall those events because they lived them, because what they are recalling is what really happened.  And they have no reason to select whose file they are discussing when they are remembering events which really occurred.  On the other hand, people who have fabricated their story and who have told a version which is not true need to learn that version in order to repeat it.  They need to study that version.  They need to stick to that version in order to convince somebody that their lies are the truth.  

And so we are trying to figure out which of those categories you fall into, somebody who is telling the truth from memory, or somebody who is lying and can't keep their stories straight.  So you are being asked what you did on the 7th of April.  It is not necessary to refer to anybody's dossier.  

Now, I'm asking you, did you tell the Prosecutor that you saw Karera at the préfecture office on the evening of the 7th of April? 
A.	According to you, perhaps, but I have told you that as I see things I should complete my testimony in the present matter and then, subsequently, if you want, we can go on to matters concerning the other matter.  To be absolutely logical, you should say when we have discussed everything concerning this trial, we can go on to the other trial that you want to delve into.  That is way to proceed I feel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the enquiry counsel is making of you is relevant to this trial.  In -- when we are trying to determine what weight to attach to your testimony, it will be of interest to us to know whether you have made inconsistent statements before.  That will assist us in determining the truth. 

So if you made a statement to the Prosecutor, it is a fair question for the counsel to ask if the notes that he has put to you reflect what you said or not.  And I think you should answer the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I accept your explanation as it came across to me.  And I didn't say anyhow that I didn't want to answer the question.  What I said was that I can explain why I expressed myself in that way regarding that matter.  I am speaking of what I said regarding Karera on the 7th.  It is a long story and I was inviting counsel to put that question last.  But as you say that procedure is such, well, I haven't figured out -- I will go along with it.  I haven't forgotten what I said about Karera. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, so the first step of this, and I am going to give you a chance to tell your long story, but, first, I want you to confirm, did you, in fact, tell the Prosecutor when they interviewed you about Karera in 2005, that you had seen him in the evening of the 7th of April at the préfecture office?
A.	No, not quite.  As I asked the President, I can explain to you the ins and outs of that business.  I know that it is a lengthy story, and there are lots of details to provide.  And if you would allow, then I shall forge ahead. 
Q.	Go ahead.  
A.	I said that that did, indeed, occur on the 7th, when I was interviewed by the investigators on the subject of Karera, well, that was not true what I said.  It was **************************who asked me to do so, and he was a former conseiller.  Whilst accepting to do so, I thought to myself that given the moment in time I would explain the truth because I did not believe that it was correct to follow instructions or directives provided by somebody else. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I believe that the name he mentioned******************************************************* *********************. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us who that person is? 
A.	I said that it was ******************who sent a message to me via**************.  And *************at that moment in time he lived in Rushashi, and he lived in a house belonging to Karera. 
Q.	And ************I believe is spelled******************.  And who is he? 

Excuse me, maybe my question was not received.  Who was this************? 
A.	************was a trader, and he sold beer. 
Q.	And when he gave you this message, was he also a prisoner? 
A.	No, he was a free man, but in one way or another he was implicated in the Karera case. 
Q.	Was he****************? 
A.	Yes, he was.  And that is where he resided and that is where he traded. 
Q.	And how was it that you received the message from him? 
A.	*************came to see me in prison, that was on the Tuesday, because it was on the Tuesday that one was allowed a visit longer than 20 minutes, and on that occasion he explained his problem to me; that is ****************************and Karera, it involved all three of them.  After that, he told me that investigators from the Tribunal had come to put questions to him on that subject. 
Q.	And what was he asking you to do? 
A.	He asked me to confirm what he had said on the subject of Karera when questions were put to him about that person. 
Q.	And did you agree to do that? 
A.	I told him that I would do so once my movements or travel to Rushashi had been explained.  But at the same time, I thought I had already provided an explanation for the circumstances under which I had travelled. 
Q.	I really don't understand that last answer, since we are speaking of Karera being visited by you at the -- or being seen by you at the préfecture in Kigali.  So what did your travels to Rushashi have to do with that? 
A.	The fact is he came to speak to me about Karera, and he reminded me of the occasions on which I had been seen with Karera in Rushashi.  That is what he said to me when he came to see me in prison.  And he said that I could still base myself on my presence in Rushashi in the company of Karera with reference to what he had said.  Now, I said to him that when I went to Rushashi I met Karera, but that as far as the date was concerned, that is the 7th, it is not exact what I said with reference to the date of the 7th.  But that was what *************asked me to do. 
Q.	Did *************ask to you tell the Prosecutors that you had seen Karera at the Kigali-ville préfecture office on the evening of the 7th of April? 
A.	That is correct.  That is what he said because he also was in Kigali at that moment in time.  And he wanted me to answer that.  But I knew that the truth would transpire because I had, in fact, given a truthful testimony beforehand. 
Q.	And am I understanding correctly that ***************himself had told the investigators that he had seen Karera at the préfecture office in Kigali on the night of the 7th of April, and he wanted you to confirm that you also had seen Karera; is that correct? 
A.	That is what he wanted, but I told him that that was not precise, but he insisted asking me to do so.  But he knew that with reference to a previous testimony that I had given that the truth would ultimately come out because with reference to those dates, I had made many statements on the subject.  And I said that even if I did bend to his request, it would come out in the end. 
Q.	And did he give you any money to do this? 
A.	Apart from the fact that he was a friend, that he was somebody who provided me with supplies, food, I did make him understand, however, that I had provided statements on the subject of individuals.  And I said to him that what I was going to say would serve no purpose.  But he said that it was a pure formality, and that he wanted me to make that statement.  That is what happened. 
Q.	I'm trying to understand what was your interest in making that statement.  Did you receive money or expect to receive money from him?  
A.	He asked me; he was a friend; he was a free man.  And I acquiesced, even though I knew that there was a contradiction somewhere and I knew that I had given statements with reference to those dates, but he said that nobody would check up on all of that.  And when he came to visit me on that day, it is all in the register, the register is held by those people who were in charge of the prison, and he came to visit me on two occasions, on two successive weeks in order to ask me to do that.  And if you check with the prison registry you will see that he came to visit me on two occasions.  

Now, to backstep somewhat, I had not forgotten that I had given statements.  And those were, in fact, statements that were given subsequently to those that I had given with reference to this case.  So, I thought that this statement would be of no use because I knew that I had given other elements of information in previous statements. 
Q.	But I'm wondering whether or not you expected, or did receive some benefit for giving this false story?  Was there some money that you were expecting, some supplies, some needs of you or your family that would be met?  What was your interests of doing this for Mr. ***********************************? 
A.	He said that he has a problem.  He said that he had rented a building belonging to Karera and that he had a bar, but that even in exile in Kayendu (phonetic), he was still coming up against money problems with reference to a house that he had brought that belonged to Karera.

1215H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And how does that relate to you?  Was he going to give you some money or some benefit if you helped him?
A.	I shall explain it to you.  There was a problem with reference to Bourgmestre Munyandamutsa who was the former bourgmestre of Rushashi --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Spelling required.
THE WITNESS:
-- and during the war, that bourgmestre had differences with Karera because Karera wanted for him to be killed in view of the fact that he was an opponent to the MRND party.  Now, as he was following the case, he was the one who gave my name to the investigators, even before the investigators came to find me.  So he came to talk to me about that, before the investigators came to see me and he was the one who gave my name to the investigators.
MR. ROBINSON:
And the spelling of Munyandamutsa is M-U-N-Y-A-N-D-A-M-U-T-S-A.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, I understand -- Witness HH, I think you have said this several times, that you lied to the investigators at the request of Mr.**********, but I'm going back to my question, which has not yet been answered as to what did you personally expect to receive, or what did you receive, for doing this.
A.	I did not receive anything in concrete terms; I did not receive any material gift.  He merely told me what his problem was with Karera with reference to the price of the house, because he had not paid the totality of that sum of money.  And I said that I would acquiesce, that I would do what he wanted me to do, but I said that it would not be useful in any way.  We had a long conversation on that subject, but he asked me in the end to go through with it, whatever the case may be and whatever would happen subsequently.  And I am ready to testify against him with reference to that.
Q.	But why did you agree to do that?  Did you expect some benefit for yourself?
A.	I thought that it would not be useful, in view of the previous statements that I had given.  I did not believe it would be accepted.  What is more, I did not believe that I could sacrifice everything that I had said in favour of what he had wanted me to say, so, to my mind, it was just useless.
Q.	Okay, Witness HH, you know, I run marathons; I can last a long time, and I will put the question to you again: what did you expect to receive in order to accede to the request of************?
A.	I accepted what he was asking me because he was a friend, but I knew that it was just a formality, and that's what I said to him.  We talked about it lengthily, that is, that on the 7th I did as I told you.  But, in view of the fact that he had given that date, I said that I did not agree with him, but he insisted and asked me to do what he wanted to, but I thought it would all be useless in view of what he had said previously, but because he was a friend I acceded to his request in the circumstances that I have described.
Q.	And are you telling us then that you simply did this as a favour to a friend without expecting any benefit to yourself or anything in return for doing this favour?  Is that your testimony here under oath?
A.	To be quite honest, yes, it was a request on the part of a friend, and I explained to him in what circumstances I would accede to his request.  And were you to conduct an investigation, you would be able to put the question to him yourself, and he will tell you that he came to see me on two occasions in order to discuss that.  Of course, I do not know how he shall react, but I do know that he will deny the fact he came to see me on two occasions with reference to that fact.  And further proof is that I talked about this to a person from Rushashi by the name of Semakura and I told him that what *************is saying, I said, is useless.  And I asked him what the purpose was of providing such statements, and he said to me that he did not want to have to pay the money that he owed to Mr. Karera and that, as a result, he wanted to have him put behind bars.
Q.	And you agreed to help by supporting the lie of************; correct?
A.	Yes, but I knew very well that it would not stand up.
Q.	And I'm asking you to answer this question under oath: did you receive, or did you expect to receive, any benefit to you or any other member of your family by lying to the Prosecutor at the request of ************?
A.	Yes, I believed that he might be able to give me something in way of a recompense, but I knew only too well that what I was going to state would not stand up; moreover, that is what I told him there.
Q.	How much did you think that a lie to the Office of the Prosecutor would (sic) going to get you in terms of recompense?
A.	I knew only too well that it would serve no purpose and that it would not be advantageous in any respect for*************.
Q.	How much did you expect to receive for your part in this conspiracy to lie?
A.	I acceded to his request, but I knew only too well that it would serve no purpose, so I was not going to ask him to give me anything at all, in view of the fact that I knew that it would not be to his advantage in any respect whatsoever, and I did not want to sacrifice the previous statements that I had given.  So, to put it in a nutshell, he came to visit me and I saw that he wanted something.  I acceded to his request, even though I knew that it would be discovered rapidly.
Q.	And did you think, in your mind, that if Karera got a life sentence and the money for the house never had to be paid that you would get some profit from that?
A.	Counsel, whatever the case may be and whatever the result was going be, I knew very well that it would not hold water and that what he wanted to obtain he would not obtain.
Q.	To your knowledge, did **************testify in the case of Karera here in Arusha?
A.	Since that moment in time when I told him that was not possible, I did not see him again.  I told him that it would not hold water and I said that I had talked to Semakura, and what is more, once I realised that Semakura no longer came back to see me, I thought that somebody might have talked to him about what I said.
Q.	And were you aware that you were listed as a witness for the Prosecution in the Karera case here in Arusha?
A.	Yes, I was asked to come and testify in this trial, but I talked to Semakura, reminding him of what I had said and I said that there would be consequences.  That is what I said to him on the second occasion.
Q.	But you agreed to come and testify against Karera, didn't you?
A.	No.
Q.	You mean the Prosecutor put you on their witness list without asking if you were willing to be a witness?
A.	I did not come and testify, because there was a problem between myself and*********.  I do not know whether **********realised, but I knew that it would be discovered.
Q.	And prior to today, have you ever told anybody from the Office of the Prosecutor that you lied about Karera?
A.	No, I have told nobody.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would this be a good time to take our recess?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.

Mr. Robinson, before we close, about how much time do you envisage taking on Monday?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think I will take the whole day.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you anticipate finishing on Monday?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think there is a better than 50 per cent chance, but I can't guarantee it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We take the adjournment.

Now.  Mr. Witness, we resume on Monday morning.  I remind you, as I have done on previous occasions, not to discuss the case or your testimony with anyone during this or any other adjournment. (Court adjourned at 1230H)
