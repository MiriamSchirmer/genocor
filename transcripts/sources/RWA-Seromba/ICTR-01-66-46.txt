MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

I see that the witness is not here.  It appears the Prosecution had some remarks before we begin.  You have the floor, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
Good afternoon, and thank you, Your Honours.  Something which I just raised briefly with my learned friend before Your Honours came into court this afternoon, the next witness that the Defence are calling is FE36.  We are expecting some documents from Rwanda relating to this particular witness to be arriving this afternoon on the Beechcraft from Rwanda.  It may or may not be that there are questions which I will want to put to this witness in cross-examination arising from those documents.  

My proposal, and I'm obviously -- this is subject to anything that the Defence or Your Honours may say -- is that once my learned friend has concluded his evidence-in-chief, I commence my cross-examination, and I will go through the majority of it.  And then I would be asking Your Honours that we either hear the evidence-in-chief of the next witness, or adjourn until tomorrow afternoon, whatever is most convenient to the Tribunal, for me to advise the Tribunal if there are further questions or whether that will be the end of the cross-examination.  

And so I just simply wish to alert both my learned friend and Your Honours to that particular issue.  We will be doing our best to avoid there being any delays, but, as I say, these documents are only arriving today.  There may be nothing.  There may simply be no questions arising from those documents, but it is important that we look at them and decide whether or not there are issues which arise out of them.  Thank you.  That was the only matter that I wished to raise with the Tribunal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

I now turn to the Defence.  Do you have anything to say with regard to the Prosecution's application?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor had the courtesy to inform us of the difficulties he was having.  And with regard to the Defence, we have no objection whatsoever for him to have the necessary and sufficient means to conduct his cross-examination.  I obviously want this Tribunal to be as fair as possible so that the truth is manifested.  As such, I will not make any objection.  I'm not opposed at all to that application.  I want that to be very clear.  I want the trial to be fair for each and every party.  Thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé. 

Very well, we are going to bring in the witness.  Is it, indeed, FE36?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
That's correct, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the registry kindly bring in Witness FE36.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness FE36. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected Defence witness.  On behalf of the Defence, Mr. Monthé will conduct the examination-in-chief of you.  You will be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  It may also be possible that the Judges ask you for some clarification.  It is also possible that the Defence conduct a re-examination of you, Witness.  Before you begin to answer the questions that are going to be put to you, we would kindly ask you to take a solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness FE36 in Kinyarwanda) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  Now, we are going to ask you to listen attentively to the questions that are put to you, and attempt to answer them briefly and specifically.  Avoid giving any information that may reveal your identity. 

Very well.  Mr. Monthé, you may proceed with your examination-in-chief of Witness FE36. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, before I begin my examination-in-chief of Witness FE36, I request your leave to allow the registry to take some documents from the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, kindly assist counsel. 

Yes, Counsel, you may proceed. 

MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I would like to respectfully indicate to your Chamber that the examination of this witness for the most part deals with issues that may reveal his identity.  He is, in fact, going to testify about testimony that was already given.  To make our exercise more credible, it will be necessary for us to name the persons of individuals (sic).  I believe that the Prosecutor won't have any objection to this because we are obligated to do it.  I do apologise for this, but before I begin, I must indicate to the Chamber that I don't see how to do it -- how to do it otherwise.  And I would kindly request a closed session right off the bat to avoid any issues. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any objection to a closed session?  
MR. MOSES:
No, I don't, Your Honour.  I expected that certainly a large proportion of this witness's testimony relates to matters which could lead to both his and the Prosecution witnesses' identification, and for those reasons I would not be opposing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber grants, therefore, Mr. Monthé's request.  As such, we are going to move into a closed session for the protection of this witness and in the interests of justice.  We apologise to (sic) any inconvenience caused to the public. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 38] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
