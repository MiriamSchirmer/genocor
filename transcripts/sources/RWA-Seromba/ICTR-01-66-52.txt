MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  These proceedings are resumed.  Is the witness not here?  He's here.  

Mr. Nekuie, it appears the Defence may have a motion for the Chamber before we bring the witness in.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, the Defence filed a motion yesterday.  I'm not sure if the Chamber received it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before the adjournment of the session?  
MR. NEKUIE:
No, Madam President.  We requested an adjournment and we proposed a date for resumption of the proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, of course.  We will rule on that motion, but there are no other motions?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. Monthé has left the courtroom for a short time.  No doubt he'll have observations for the Chamber once he returns from the restroom.  Perhaps he can explain those to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Is Mr. Monthé going to question the next witness?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, at any rate, therefore, we are obligated to wait for him.  

Good morning, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Good morning, Madam President, and pardon me for my tardiness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's okay, Mr. Monthé.  It appears you have a motion this morning for the Chamber.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  I wish to present an oral motion to the Chamber, but in closed session, before the witness is heard. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any objections to Mr. Monthé's request to pass -- to go, rather, into a closed session before we hear the witness?  And if so, what's the objection?  

MR. MOSES:
I don't know why it needs to be in closed session.  If my friend can tell us, then I'll be able to comment as to whether or not we object or not, but simply to say, without giving either Your Honours or ourselves any further indication as what kinds of matters they want to raise, I'm not really able to assist the Trial Chamber.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, without going into too much detail, can you explain why you request a closed session?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, this is a difficult exercise.  There are people in the gallery, and I simply want a closed session before we hear NA1, and I think that I should have the right to have an opportunity to present my arguments, and I'm surprised by this obstruction every time I wish to -- before I'm even able to present my arguments, I'm presented with an objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We'll go into a closed session to hear Mr. Monthé's reasons.  Apparently, he is not in a position to tell us, even briefly, why he needs a closed session.  We apologise for any inconvenience caused to the public, but we are now obliged to go into a closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 71] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
