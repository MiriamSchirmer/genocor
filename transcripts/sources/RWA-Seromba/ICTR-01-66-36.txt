MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  We are going to proceed with the examination in-chief of the current witness.  It appears that the other witness is still not feeling well.  

Yes, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Yesterday evening, after the hearing, I spoke with the witness protection section with regard to the health of BZ2.  I had to send members of my team to see and assess the situation.  BZ2 will still not be here today.  As such, I asked the session to prepare BZ15 to substitute for BZ2 who is still ill.  I simply wanted to provide this clarification for the Chamber, Madam President.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Any observations from the Prosecution on this?  
MR. MOSES:
Just to clarify, did my learned friend say BZ15 or BZ5 would be the next witness, because the translation came through BZ15, and the next on the list, according to what has been disclosed to us, would be BZ5. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé did say BZ5, not 15.  That was an interpreter's error.  

Good morning, Witness BZ4. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to proceed this morning with your examination in-chief to be conducted by Mr. Monthé.  We should like to remind you that you are still under oath, Witness. 

Mr. Monthé, you have the floor. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, before I begin, or rather, resume, with my examination in-chief, I have asked the Registry to distribute to the different parties two additional documents.  You have one document with two new names on it which is a supplement to the first sheet that was distributed to the parties yesterday.  It is numbered -- also, in respect of the Chamber's wishes, you have a list of the names and places that will come up during this witness's testimony.  I kindly ask the Chamber if the Judges have received these various documents. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It appears the Registry only had two copies.  I have a set of one.  Perhaps you need to distribute others. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Perhaps the registrar had to go for more copies.  He said that he was also going to give some copies to the interpreters.  Perhaps that is the reason the Judges don't have sufficient copies. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You can begin.  We have two copies here for the Bench.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I can give you my copy if that can be of any assistance.  Madam President, may I begin?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you. 
WITNESS BZ4,
EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good morning, BZ4.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	This morning I want to continue the examination that we began yesterday.  Once again, I will ask you to answer my questions precisely and completely.  When we left one another yesterday, I had asked you about the day of the 15th of April, and what happened at Nyange parish on that day.  I asked you to recount the events.  You told us there was a series of killings and violent acts, and that the refugees had barricaded themselves inside the church, and that the assailants had surrounded the church with the refugees inside.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  I also asked you if, among the attackers who had surrounded the church, if you saw any of those assailants in the company of Father Seromba.  You answered "no".  Can you confirm that with us? 
A.	Yeah.  Yes, that's correct.  I confirm. 
Q.	Let me get back to a question that seems important for me and for these hearings.  I have an impression that there was a contradiction, so I am seeking clarification.  Please specify for the Chamber.  You said that Father Straton was in charge of the church, is that -- he was the priest in charge of the church, was that correct? 
A.	Yes, the priest of Nyange church was Father Straton, but at that time he had left the area.  He was no longer there.  Only Father Seromba was there.  But he was not the priest there, he was the vicar.  We knew the priest there was Father Straton, but he was not present at the time. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I want to get back to our discussion about the events on the day of the 15th.  The day of the 15th came to an end.  You went home.  Now, let's deal with the 16th.  In the morning on the 16th, were you able to go to the parish? 
A.	Yes, I went very close to the parish. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  You say you were able to go close to the parish.  What does this mean?  Explain this to the Chamber.  Where exactly were you? 
A.	There was a market in Nyange, a commercial centre. 
Q.	If I were to ask you, Witness, to tell us the distance between where you were and the parish, could you tell us approximately how far you were from the parish, using this room, for example, as a benchmark? 
A.	No.  The size of this room is too small to be able to draw a comparison between the distance from where I was and the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  You were at a distance.  It was much larger than the length of this room, therefore.  Nevertheless, what happened?  What did you see? 
A.	It was the next day, the assailants attempted to destroy the church to get their hands on the refugees who were inside the church. 
Q.	So they tried to destroy it.  From where you were, you could see the scene unfolding.  They were trying to destroy the church.  What happened? 
MR. MOSES:
With respect, Your Honours, that's a leading question.  That's making an assumption.  He can ask the witness if he could see what was happening, rather than, "You could see what was happening from there."  If my friend could rephrase that question, please. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
You should not ask me to do something.  You ask the Chamber to tell me to reformulate my question.  We should respect the rules of common law.  If counsel has an objection, he has an objection, and he accepts it or rejects it.  But counsel should not ask me how to phrase my question.  We have to respect the fundamentals. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  There was an objection, indeed.  Counsel, kindly rephrase your question. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Absolutely.  With pleasure, because, in fact, that's how things should be done. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	So, Witness, you arrived on that morning on the 16th.  You said that people were preparing themselves to destroy the church.  Can you explain to us what you saw? 
A.	Before, you said that they attempted to destroy the church using grenades and stones, but they were unsuccessful in their attempt.  Later on, they used a bulldozer, the same bulldozer that was used to bury the dead on the 15th.  So they used the bulldozer behind the church.  They knocked down the wall first and the refugees were attacked.  Others fled into the bush.  I could see this going on.  I could see one wall had been destroyed and I could see the refugees running into the church tower to take refuge.  I saw what was going on.  I became afraid and I fled the area. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, you said "they".  Who are you referring to when you say "they"?  You say, "They used a bulldozer."  Who are "they"?
A.	The person who used the bulldozer was a driver who worked for Astaldi.  They were building the Kibuye-to-Gitarama road.  They had a garage in Vungu.  That is where the employees were based. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ4.  According to you, a driver used the Astaldi bulldozer to destroy the church.  Do you think that he received instructions or orders from anyone to do what he did? 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm objecting to that question.  How can this witness answer it on the basis of the information that's been led to date?  He simply cannot.  He has not indicated whether he has spoken to the driver.  How can he give evidence on this matter, Your Honours?  I object. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, do you wish to respond to that objection or do you want to rephrase your question?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I will respond to the objection.  I never said, Madam President, that the witness spoke to the driver.  I asked the witness that (sic) they were destroying the church.  I'm asking him whether or not he knew if the driver received any instructions from anyone.  I don't see how an objection can be made to that.  I'm asking him if that driver received any instructions from anyone to destroy the church.  I don't know if the Chamber believes that that objection is well founded, but I don't see at all how this question falls outside the ambit of the witness's testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you wish to say something?
THE WITNESS:
No.  I wanted to answer the question that the Defence Counsel asked me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  Proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
	As I said before, I was close to Nyange church at that time.  With regard to the demolition of the church, I heard people say that the bulldozer could be used to destroy the church.  They discussed that.  They mentioned the name Fulgence Kayishema.  They said that he had asked that driver, Deziyayo (phonetic), to use the bulldozer to destroy the church so they could get to the refugees inside.  

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell the Chamber how many bulldozers there were on the 16th when you were there near the parish? 
A.	I only saw one bulldozer. 
Q.	Thank you.  On that morning, were there still many attackers surrounding the church as it was being destroyed? 
A.	Yes.  There were many, many people. 
Q.	Were you able to see Father Seromba, or any of the clergy members, at that place at that time during which the church was being destroyed? 
A.	I did not see Father Seromba on site.  In fact, I didn't see any clergy members at the church at the time it was being destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you for your answers, Witness.  To be more clear, and for the benefit of the Chamber, you were in an area where you could see and hear what was going on.  
MR. MOSES:
I object to that question, Your Honours.  It's a leading question. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we are going to end up pulling our hair out over these matters.  I will rephrase my question. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, did you hear anyone say that Father Seromba ordered -- could have ordered the destruction of the church? 
A.	No.  I heard no such thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When did you leave the area; immediately after the church was destroyed, or later? 
A.	It was a very serious situation.  This was the first time I ever saw a church being destroyed.  I returned home. 
Q.	Thank you.  With regard to what you witnessed, do you believe that anyone could have stopped that tragic event from occurring? 
A.	No one on site was in a position to stop the events.  Those people were mad, those who were destroying the church.  When they met someone who didn't share their same ideas, they would kill them on spot, whether that person was an authority, an official or a priest, I don't believe that anyone could have stopped them.  That person would have been killed on the spot.  They did whatever they wanted to do. 
Q.	According to you, could Father Seromba have stopped what happened at Nyange parish?  Could he have stopped the destruction of the church? 
A.	No, he could not.  He had no power to stop the church from being destroyed. 
Q.	If you are in a position to do so, please tell the Chamber.  There is an idea in Rwanda according to which people say that priests are so very well respected in that country that people will do whatever they say.  Can you respond to that? 
A.	In Rwanda, priests are respected by Christians and by the people, but this is at the church in times of peace, during mass.  But people are really under the authority of the bourgmestre at that time.  There was practically no more authority.  The bourgmestre had no power over the people.  There were so many thugs at that time.  They are not normal people in a society.  So if the bourgmestre couldn't do anything, certainly the priest could not have done anything in such a situation. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would now ask you to refer to a list that you should have before you.  That list includes names, and there are numbers next to the names.  When referring to a person who has a number next to their name, please refer to the number and not the name.  In the case where there is no number, I will simply mention the name.  I should like to begin by asking you, did you know Fulgence Kayishema, and did you see him during the events that occurred at Nyange? 
A.	Yes, I know Fulgence Kayishema and I saw him. 
Q.	Can you kindly tell the Chamber what you saw him doing, if you are in a position to do so? 
A.	I saw him there.  He was with other people.  He was active.  He played an active role in what happened.  I could see him in the countryside.  He had a vehicle he moved around in, and I saw him on site.  He was very active. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  To finish the discussion about him, did you ever see Fulgence Kayishema with Father Seromba during the events that occurred? 
A.	No, I never saw them together. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now let us talk about Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  Tell the Chamber if you knew him and if you saw him during the events that concern us here today.  
A.	Yes, I know Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  He lived in Kigali.  He was a businessman.  He, however, is a native of the same secteur as I am.  During the events, he was at home.  He left Kigali and he came to our area. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters did not hear the last question.  Counsel is kindly going to repeat it. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
"Witness, did you know Gaspard Kanyarukiga?"  He answered, "Yes," that he knew him.  

Second question:   "Did you see him during the event?  Did he participate in the events?"  Witness answered that he did not see him during the events.  He indicated that he lived in Kigali, and that during the events he returned in his -- to his native area.  

I believe that's the summary of the situation, Madam President.  That is correct, thank you.  

Pardon me, to the interpreters.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, do you know number 1 on the list which appears before you? 
A.	I know that person. 
Q.	Did you see that person during the events at Nyange? 
A.	No, I never saw him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know Télesphore Ndungutse, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I know Télesphore Ndungutse. 
Q.	Did you see him during the events which occurred at Nyange? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	What did you see him do during the events? 
A.	I also saw him -- he played an active role in trying to access the persons who had taken refuge inside the church in order to kill them. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, did you know Grégoire Ndahimana? 
A.	Yes, I know Grégoire Ndahimana.  At the time he was bourgmestre of the commune. 
Q.	Did you see him during the events which occurred at Nyange? 
A.	No, I did not see him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, let us move on to number 2.  Do you know number 2? 
A.	Yes, I know this person well. 
Q.	Did you see this person during the events we're referring to? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	Did this person take part in the events? 
A.	Yes, he did. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know Aloys Rwamasirabo? 
A.	Yes, I know Aloys Rwamasirabo. 
Q.	Did you see him during the events? 
A.	I did not see him.  He was a Tutsi.  He was one of the people who was being hunted, so at that time he was in hiding and we couldn't see him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ4.  Do you know number 3? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Please do not refer to the names.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I shall request that this name be deleted from the records to comply with witness protection requirements, if you will.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We order that the name that has just been referred to by the witness be deleted from the Court records. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's use the numbers.  So please tell me, did you know number 3? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.  He lived in the parish and he worked there. 
Q.	Did you see him during the events? 
A.	I did not. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, number 4; did you know number 4? 
A.	No.  I don't know number 4. 
Q.	Do you know number 5? 
A.	I don't know him either. 
Q.	Witness, you should have another list of two names.  Do you know number 6? 
A.	No, I do not know the person appearing at number 6. 
Q.	Do you know number 7? 
A.	No.  I do not know number 7 either. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your precise answers.  Now, since you went to the parish -- to Nyange parish often, did you know Father Seromba well? 
A.	Yes.  I knew Father Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How long is it since you last saw Father Seromba? 
A.	It's been about eight years since I saw Father Seromba. 
Q.	Would you recognise him if you saw him? 
A.	Yes, I would. 
Q.	If I were to ask you to look around this courtroom and show me exactly where Father Seromba were -- if he's in this courtroom, where Father Seromba is if he's in this courtroom, would you be able to do so? 
A.	Yes, I can. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
With the leave of the Bench, I shall ask the witness to look carefully around this courtroom and kindly point out to the Trial Chamber where Father Seromba is. 
THE WITNESS:
	Father Seromba is present.  He is sitting between you and a lady.  It must be another Defence Counsel. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ4.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would like it to be indicated in the records that Witness BZ4 has recognised Father Seromba, who is present here, sitting between his two lawyers.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the record show that the witness has recognised Father Seromba in the courtroom.  

Have you concluded, Counsel?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Just one more question and I will be through. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, did you tell the truth here in this courtroom? 
A.	Yes, I told the truth. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have concluded my examination in-chief.  I thank the witness for allowing me to put questions to him.  I now leave the witness in the hands of the Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with your leave, just a minute.  I was just going to ask the Trial Chamber to enter into evidence the two documents listing the names of people that were mentioned, and also the document indicating the place names used in the examination in-chief.  These documents should be Exhibits D. 46 and D. 47 -- I beg your pardon, D. 47 and D. 48. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps they could be entered on the one number, if you will.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, do you want to object?  
MR. MOSES:
No objection to the first document being the list of names that the witness has been shown and has referred to.  The other document, which has simply a list of places which the witness has never, as I understand, been shown or referred to; it simply seems to be superfluous to enter that as an exhibit.  That's simply a list of place names that he's referred -- or a list of words that he has referred to, but he hasn't actually been shown that document.  I don't see why it needs to go in as an exhibit.  I'm happy for the first document to go in, because he has been shown that and he has commented on it.  The other one would just seem to me to be an aid for Your Honours and for the interpreters.  It's not a document which has -- which has any evidential value. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I understood you correctly, Mr. Monthé, you did not ask for this document to be entered into evidence, but you asked for the document bearing names and numbers to be included.  This document, however, has two pages. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would just like to clarify matters.  We agreed at the beginning of this trial that it would be well to give numbers to the names that would be used.  This was a suggestion by the Trial Chamber which I adopted.  I would like -- I am tendering this document as an exhibit, but there is the problem of place names which will be used all through these proceedings, and which are connected with what was said here.  I do not see how there could possibly be any objection to including this as an exhibit, whereas the witness has provided explanations thereon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber will enter the document showing the names of persons as D. 47.  This document has two pages and it shall be placed under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 47 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Apparently the next witness is not around.  We shall take a 15 to 20 minute break which will perhaps allow WVSS to prepare the next witness.  In the meantime, if the parties wish to make motions or submissions, we are prepared to listen to them.  For the time being, the other witness should be asked to leave.  

Thank you, Witness.  You will return for the cross-examination and re-examination, if necessary.  We would like to remind you that you are still under solemn declaration, and you may not discuss with anyone what has transpired in this courtroom.  Thank you, so we will see you later.  Goodbye.  
THE WITNESS:
Goodbye, Madam President.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, we're listening. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  One very brief matter.  Your Honours, we are still not in receipt of any names or statements.  We have spoken to the -- of the other remaining Defence witnesses who have been asked to be provided.  We spoke to Mr. Hometowu this morning.  He confirmed that he had received from the Prosecutor last night the documents that Your Honour has ordered us to provide to the Defence.  We have filed those in compliance with the order.  He indicated that he had not received, or had not seen, any documents filed by the Defence.  It may have been that that matter has now been undertaken.  I don't know.  But perhaps Your Honours can make enquiries as I don't want to be seen to be addressing my friend directly.  Perhaps Your Honours can ask him whether those documents have been now filed with registry because we certainly don't have them.  And the longer it is before we receive those documents and names, the less likely it is, to be blunt, Your Honours, that we are going to be in a position to proceed with cross-examination next week. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, the Trial Chamber has contacted Registry.  From the information we got early this morning, it had not been done yesterday evening, and we did intend to put the question to Mr. Monthé. 

Mr. Monthé, what's the situation regarding the disclosure of your witness statements to the Trial Chamber and the Prosecutor?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, here is my answer:   Defence worked long yesterday evening.  There are many typos on some of the witness statements.  Disclosure is being made at this time.  The Prosecutor is referring to what is at the Registry.  I have not received that yet.  Please wait for the end of the day.  The statements will be disclosed, Madam President.  I have promised to do so -- as I promised -- as I have always done as I promised.  

Regarding disclosure, we send these disclosures to the Registry and we don't send them directly to you, so my obligation is to send these statements to the Registry.   So it is not up to me to send this to the Prosecutor.  Wait for the Registry to do its job.  

Madam President, you can't always ask me the same questions.  An order has been made and I will comply with your order.  Please wait until the end of the day.  If you can't start -- you can't wave this in our faces every morning.  Madam President, I'm going to do my work.  I am doing it in the difficult conditions that we have here.  I should be allowed to do my work to the best of my ability.  That is what I'm trying to do.  I have asked you, since April you were supposed to send me documents.  You didn't do it.  You had to have a new order.  So we've got to work.  We've got to work.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor?
MR. MOSES:
I simply want to raise and put on the record, Your Honours, firstly, that's a completely unrelated matter as Your Honours have indicated in your orders yesterday.  Secondly, and more importantly, if my friend doesn't file it until this evening, it is unlikely that we are going to receive it until Monday, as Your Honours are well aware that the Tribunal is on -- has a holiday the next two days and then it's the weekend.  It completely undermines Your Honours' orders and the purpose of Your Honours' orders for the last two orders, not to mention the last five orders, for the Defence to comply and file these documents.  Your Honour ordered last Thursday in a written decision for them to do it immediately.  Your Honours issued a very stern warning indicating that there would be sanctions if they did not do so yesterday.  If they don't do it until this evening, there is a grave danger, Your Honours, that we simply are not going to be in a position to proceed with cross-examination on Monday, which I am sure is something that, from our point of view, and Your Honours' point of view at least, is something which Your Honours would be wanting to avoid.  Thank you. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with your leave, I want to say this, and I want to say this as a final statement:   It is not the Prosecutor who is going to sanction me.  He should be -- he should bear this in mind.  I'm not a student.  He's not my teacher.  I will respect the Trial Chamber.  I will keep my commitment.  

Madam President, all of this arises from the fact that the Prosecution, according to common practice, wishes to exert pressure on our witnesses, as they have done before, to the detriment of Mr. Pognon.  I am going to comply with the order as I have promised, so I have already provided enough answer to such allegations. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we should like to remind you that the Trial Chamber has made orders, and these orders must be complied with.  We said that everything was to be disclosed yesterday, yesterday at the very latest.  You told us that you'd experienced difficulties, but today all the statements of the witnesses should be disclosed, and we have added, even on redacted statements, so that the Prosecutor can also prepare his case, because we are not functioning normally because of the absence or the failure to disclose statements in time. 

The Trial Chamber has said that, if the parties do not comply with these orders, the Trial Chamber will adopt sanctions.  The Prosecutor indicates that he has complied with these orders, and we are asking you to do so, the same, today.  Because tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will probably be holidays, and we would like the parties to take advantage of these holidays to prepare. 

In order to prepare, the parties -- you need to disclose these witness statements to the Prosecution, so this should be done today without fail. 

If there are no other matters, we shall take the break now and we shall take the next witness as soon as the witness is ready.  Thank you.  Court's adjourned for a few minutes.
(Court recessed from 0950H to 1015H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is resumed.  We are going to hear a new witness.  

Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are Witness BZ5.  You are a Defence witness.  You will first be questioned in examination-in-chief by the Defence.  You will be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  It is also possible that the Judges put some questions to you, and it is also possible that there may be a re-examination conducted by the Defence.  Before you begin to answer the questions, you must take a solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness BZ5 in French)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  You have the floor for the examination in-chief of this witness. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, it is my pleasure to take up where Mr. Monthé left off and to introduce myself for this examination in-chief of Witness BZ5.  According to tradition, legal traditions, I should like to begin with the normal introductions.  

I should like to introduce myself before this Honourable Chamber.  My name is Barnabé Nekuie.  That is spelt N-E-K-U-I-E, and my first name is Barnabé.  I am from the Cameroon bar.  I am co-counsel for Mr. Monthé in these proceedings.  

Before I begin my examination, I have a duty to greet this Honourable Chamber, to greet the Office of the Prosecutor, and to express my gratitude to all of those people who assist us with the interpretation. 

After those introductions, Madam President, and with your leave, I should now like to get to the heart of the matter.  Before that, I should like to thank Witness BZ5 for having taken the time to come before this Honourable Chamber to testify on behalf of the Defence.  With your leave, Madam President, I should like to thank the witness for that. 

I should kindly ask Registry now to assist me to distribute this list which is a sheet which bears the signature of the witness and contains information with regard to his identity.  I would ask the witness to confirm whether or not it is, indeed, his signature on the document, and if the information contained therein is correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Barnabé Nekuie.  Generally these types of sheets are signed here in Court.  In this instance, the witness shall simply confirm whether or not it is his signature, and make sure there are no modifications to the document, and then we can begin your examination in-chief. 

Witness, have you had an opportunity to look at the document and, if so, can you confirm your signature on it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President.  Everything on the document is correct. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 

Yes, Mr. Nekuie, you have the floor.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, since the document has been confirmed by BZ5, I would kindly request the Chamber to admit the document as a Defence exhibit, and I ask that it be marked D. 48 and be placed under seal, with your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Prosecution?  
MS. ALEXIS:
No objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The identification sheet for Witness BZ5 is tendered, admitted, and marked as a Defence exhibit and shall be marked D. 48.  It shall be placed under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 48 admitted, under seal) 

Counsel, you may proceed.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS BZ5,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, BZ5.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Once again, let me thank you for having taken the time to testify here, and thank you for taking the time to come and shed light on matters for this Honourable Chamber, shed light on matters that you are a witness of, and let me remind you that you are a protected witness.  We will now begin a session of questions and answers, and since you are a protected witness, if I ever put a question to you that may run the risk of revealing your identity, please point that out to me so that I can rephrase my question and not reveal your identity.  Do you understand this, Witness? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness BZ5, where were you in April 1994? 
A.	I was in Rugobagoba in Gitarama province. 
Q.	Can you kindly spell the name of that location so that the interpreters and the Chamber knows exactly what you're talking about? 
A.	Yes.  Let me spell Rugobagoba:   R-U-G-O-B-A-G-O-B-A. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Is Rugobagoba in the republic of Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  Rugobagoba is one of the secteurs located in the communes which make up Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  What were you doing in 1994 in the month of April? 
A.	I was a farmer. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you tell the Chamber if you experienced any particular events during that period in Rugobagoba? 
A.	What I remember is that, on the 6th of April, the aeroplane transporting President Habyarimana, which was on its way back from Tanzania, went down.  Habyarimana died in the crash.  I learned of this the next day.  I learned about it from other people. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You say that the plane in which President Habyarimana was, crashed.  What do you mean? 
A.	What I mean is that, according to the information that I had on the morning of the 7th of April 1994, the plane carrying President Habyarimana and the president of Burundi was shot down.  The president and his entourage died in the accident. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  According to the information you received at that time, do you know who shot down the president's plane? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, before this witness answers, (microphones overlapping)... an objection.  Firstly, Madam President, this bit of information has not been included on the statements.  Secondly, it is not relevant to these proceedings.  This witness has said merely in his statements that the president died.  We do not see why it is necessary to lead details as to rumours that this witness heard, particularly when none of these details have been included in the statements provided by the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, do you wish to respond to that objection, or do you wish to simply rephrase your question?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, with respect, I will respond to that objection.  Madam President, in the line of Defence conducted by Mr. Monthé, which I am also respecting, I should like to remind the Prosecution that it should not tell us what types of questions we have to put to the witnesses.  Here, these are matters for the examiner, to ask the witness what he saw, what he heard or what he did.  This is what we are doing in the main.  We should not be limited in any way, and certainly not limited by the party on the other side.  I simply am seeking information from the witness with regard to the 6th of April or the 7th of April; asking him whether or not he had information according to which the president's plane was shot down.  I don't see how or why I should not be able to ask him that question; ask him if he heard about how that happened and who may have done it.  I believe this falls squarely in the ambit of what this witness may know.  As such, the question is relevant, contrary to the Prosecution's claim. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I think it is time perhaps for the Prosecution to put something on the record.  When we make objections, we are in no ways attempting to tell the Defence what to do.  We -- these are adversarial proceedings and it is our right to make objections.  We are sorry that the Defence has always taken the view that we are attempting to obstruct their defence.  If that was the point that counsel took from my objection, it was not at all what I meant to say, and counsel, in so thinking, missed the entire point of my objection.  My objection was not that I am telling counsel what to say or how to lead his evidence; my objection is that statements are provided for a reason.  Statements are provided so that the other side may be placed on notice what case it has to meet and what is to be expected.  That was the nucleus of my objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is of the view that this issue has not yet been resolved.  As such, the witness cannot respond to that question.  In the statements, the matter of the presidential plane is dealt with, but the conditions or circumstances surrounding the plane crash are not dealt with.  So, Counsel, the Chamber requests that you kindly rephrase your question.
MR. NEKUIE:
With pleasure, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness BZ5, you say that you received information according to which the presidential plane was shot down.  Did you have any particular reaction to the incident?  How did you react?  How did it make you behave on that day, the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	After hearing the news, the next day on the 7th of April, I did not witness any changes amongst the people.  People did not seem to be afraid.  I went about my normal activities.  However, three, or rather, two days later, this must have been on the 8th of April, people began to ask others for their identity cards.  I began to notice a change.  However, before that date, people went about their daily activities as usual.  But on the 8th, changes began to occur.  People had to prepare themselves to leave their villages.  Things changed on the 8th.  People asked who you were, where you lived, where you were from.  Those were the types of changes that occurred, and I'm not sure whether or not I have adequately answered your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes, you have, and I thank you.  
A.	We're welcome. 
Q.	Witness, you said that, on the 8th, things began to change.  Where did things begin to change exactly?  Can you be more specific with regard to that? 
A.	Where I was, things began to change. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	You're welcome. 
Q.	Can you remind this Chamber the name of the place you were, just so that matters are clear? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps it would be a good idea to avoid naming the exact area where the witness was located at the time.  We already have the name on the record, and revealing such information may reveal the identity of this witness.
MR. NEKUIE:
You're right, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	Sir, you were in your area and you noticed there were some changes.  Did those changes affect you personally, and if so, how? 
A.	I could see that things were beginning to change.  I immediately decided to leave the area where I had gone to work.  I was going to go back to my native area.  The president of the republic had been killed.  I could notice that it was an extraordinary event, and that the situation could become dangerous.  So I opted to go home to my native area where I was well known by the people.  I could feel that the coming days were going to be difficult and turn for the worst.  I'm not sure if I've answered your question, Counsel. 
Q.	You have, and I thank you.  You said that you decided to go back to your native area.  What is the name of your native area?  Where is your native area located?  In which cellule? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if I may, I don't wish to be obstructionist, but if counsel were to ask the witness which préfecture and which commune, but which cellule really is very particular, and perhaps it may reveal his identity.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, with your leave, I don't wish to get into a sparring match with the Office of the Prosecutor, I simply will rephrase my question and proceed with the witness, with your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel, you may proceed.
BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	Sir, you said that you decided to go back to your native area.  Did you decide to do that on the 8th or before?  Can you confirm for us? 
A.	I decided this on the 8th when I saw that things were changing.  First I went to my employer's home to ask for my salary.  It was not the end of the month, but I needed my money before I could leave.  My employer was supposed to come and see the work that I had done before he would give me my salary which would enable me to leave.  But I did not leave Rugobagoba on the 8th. 
Q.	Thank you.  Please tell the Court on what date you did leave the place where you were.  
A.	Between the place where I was working and my native village, there was about two hour's walk.  Seeing as there was no vehicle, I had to walk along pathways to get to my home.  This means that it took me a great deal of time to get to my native village.  I had to use detours in order to ride there. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you said that it took you a long while to get to your village, do you remember how long it took you? 
A.	I left Rugobagoba, if I remember correctly, on the 10th very early in the morning, at about 6 a.m., and I got to my native village at about 6:07 p.m.

1045H
BY MR. NEKUIE:  
Q.	Thank you.  On the way from your place of work to your native village, did you see any particular -- or witness any particular events that you would like to tell this Trial Chamber about? 
A.	I would like to remind you that I was in Gitarama préfecture, and I had to go to Kibuye prefecture.  Along the way I met people who were going back to their native villages, as I was.  Sometimes along the way you would be told that, "The roadblock's ahead of you, so you mustn't go that way.  You must make a detour."  So we had to make detours so as to avoid the roadblocks.  People would tell us, "Ahead of you there are difficult people or roadblocks.  Do not go past those roadblocks."  So we had to avoid the town of Gitarama, because they said that people at the roadblocks were very difficult.  Sometimes we would go to get to a place where we were forbidden to pass, and so we would have to make a detour, and so on, which is why we walked a long time before we got to our native village. 
Q.	When you say that people told you to avoid roadblocks and showed you how to go round them, whom are you referring to? 
A.	You understand that I was in Gitarama prefecture and I was a native of Kibuye prefecture.  At that time, there were many people who were not in their homes.  These events came unexpectedly.  People who had had problems at these roadblocks advised us not to go through these roadblocks.  I, for my part, did not see any roadblocks.  The people who had experienced problems at these roadblocks advised us not to go through them, so I avoided the roadblocks.  I didn't personally see any roadblock, because people had advised me not to go through there, so I avoided them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, would you please face the Bench directly so that we can see you.  Please try to answer your questions as briefly and as concisely as possible.  It would make things easier for us.  Please answer exactly, or answer the questions that are put to you exactly.  Mr. Nekuie, please proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I think that I am answering the questions as they are put to me.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What I mean is that you tend to provide a lot of detail, and a while ago you repeated exactly what you had said previously.  So, please try and answer questions without making really long sentences and that sort of thing.  Perhaps we might make some progress.  Thank you.

Counsel, please proceed.  I'm sorry that I interrupt you, but I believe this will help us to have more precise answers to your questions.
MR. NEKUIE:
Much obliged, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Sir, you have just said that people told you or asked you to avoid roadblocks.  Did these people tell you who was manning these roadblocks and why they had roadblocks? 
A.	No, they did not tell me who had set up or put up these roadblocks and why they had done so.  What I did was avoid the roadblocks. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  So, having succeeded in avoiding the roadblocks, where did you end up, and on what date did you arrive? 
A.	Let me recall for your benefit that, before I arrived at my village -- I should say that there is a river between Gitarama and Kibuye, so one has to find a boat in order to cross the river.  Before I got to the river I met two people, who told me that their relatives had been killed, we have to avenge or carry out our revenge on this person.  Luckily, somebody, a policeman, came and helped me to cross the river, and that is how I got to my native village. 
Q.	Thank you.  So this policeman, if I understand correctly, he was protecting citizens, since he is the one who helped you; am I right? 
A.	Yes, he helped me to cross the river without any difficulties, so, of course, he was in charge of protecting the public. 
Q.	Thank you.  So when you got to your village -- your village of origin -- whom did you find there? 
A.	After crossing the river, I got to a small centre where I found a group of people who had set up roadblocks.  I had a bag in my hand, and they tried to take my bag away from me.  I found an assistant bourgmestre, who knew me, and it was he who told them to give me back my bag.  

There was also a lady who was near that centre who told me to keep my bag -- who told me she would keep my bag.  So I left my bag with her, and I went on my way, and I got to my village in the evening -- between 6 and 7 p.m. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, between 6 and 7 p.m., when you arrived, what did you do? 
A.	When I got home, since it was nightfall, I had to talk with my family.  I had to eat and rest. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, was it then the 10th of April when you finally arrived in your native village? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, having been welcomed into the bosom of your family and having rested, did you, on that day, or in the days that followed, observe any incident in that area? 
A.	The following day I saw bodies on the hill.  I saw people coming from Gisenyi prefecture, who were covered with banana leaves and carrying weapons, and who were killing the livestock of the people.  Our cow was killed -- our cow was seized, and we had to appeal to the citizens to have our cow given back.  So people got together to bury the innocent victims whose homes had been destroyed.  So that is how it was.  I do not know whether my answer to your question is clear. 
Q.	More or less, sir.  But please tell the Trial Chamber whether this situation prevailed or obtained around you in your neighbourhood, or in the entire area, and please say, also, whether it was the next day, the 11th, that you saw these bodies.  So was it in your neighbourhood, or was it in the entire area? 
A.	I got to my home at night and I would like to recall that I had Tutsi neighbours who had been my fellow pupils and with whom I had been playing football.  There had been intermarriage between us and the Tutsis, and most of my neighbours were Tutsis.  So, you will understand that, apart from my immediate neighbourhood, the same thing happened.  I was shocked in the morning when I woke up and I saw that houses had been destroyed and people killed.  I was surprised to see people come in a crowd to seize cows, especially our own cow. 
Q.	So these people who came to loot, who were they? 
A.	These were people who came from communes in Gisenyi prefecture; they were not people I knew.  They were covered with mud and banana leaves, and it was very difficult to identify them. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  So, when you discovered this disastrous state of affairs in the morning, what did you do?  This is the morning of 11th of April 1994, I think.
A.	The following morning I and other members of the public, who were my neighbours, took the decision to bury the innocent victims who had been killed.  
Q.	Thank you.  And where did you bury them? 
A.	We buried them on their land.  We could bury them in their fields, in their own property. 
Q.	Thank you.  Could you tell the Court, if you recall, the approximate number of these victims, who you discovered on the morning of the 11th? 
A.	We did not have the time to count the victims.  We had lost our neighbours, and the situation was fraught.  It didn't cross anyone's mind to count victims.  It was horrible; it was unimaginable to be counting victims. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you were busy burying the victims after that.  So what did you do on the day that followed, on the 12th, or perhaps still on the 11th, having finished burying these victims? 
A.	I have just told you that we buried people.  It doesn't only take five minutes.  You make sure -- you have to do things so that you bury people in dignity.  You don't bury people like you bury animals.  I must say that I am a Christian.  There are burial rights that are required.  I had to go -- since I was near it, I had to go to Nyange church to pray.  When you lose a friend or a neighbour, you are obliged to go and pray to God so that he will help you handle your grief.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you.  

With the Trial Chamber's leave, I shall indicate to the witness that he should not become upset because of some of the questions I am putting to him.  The main purpose of these questions is to edify the Trial Chamber.  So, would the witness please answer these questions as simply as possible.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to limit yourself to recounting only those facts that you yourself experienced.  Am I clear?  Do you feel better about it?  
A.	There is no problem. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, if I understand you, Witness, you took some time off to pay homage to these victims who had died so needlessly.  Did you know these victims? 
A.	Yes.  Thank you, sir.  I have just told you that this was a family that had ties with our own family.  They were like brothers, and we had exchanged cows as presents. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you referred to a parish where you went to pray, and you gave the name of that parish.  Can you say what distance there was between the place where you lived and this parish? 
A.	From our house to the parish there were about 10 or 15 kilometres.  It was a distance that could be covered in an hour's walk. 
Q.	Did you go there often before the events that we're discussing here? 
A.	I first went to Nyange parish from the age of 5.  I used to follow my uncles and aunts to go and pray.  My uncles and aunts were all Catholics. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  So did you know the clergy that worked in this parish? 
A.	It's been some years since and I cannot remember all the priests who worked there.  However, I can remember some names.  I can even remember some faces. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Do you know who was the priest there in April 1994? 
A.	What I know is that in 1994 Father Seromba was there.  I don't know whether it was Stratton, or something like that. 
Q.	(No interpretation)  
A.	I knew them, because they were priests of my parish.  
Q.	For the benefit of the interpreters, I shall repeat the question.  I asked him -- he was wondering whether this person whose name he couldn't quite remember was indeed Straton.  I asked him whether he knew this person, and he has given me the answer.  Is that clear? 

So, while you were there, Witness, you see the tragedy of people you knew who had been killed.  Did you notice -- did you think that the people who did these killings had any link whatsoever with any member of the clergy?  
A.	No.  I remind you that, during the Mass that I attended on the 12th of April, Father Seromba asked Christians to come together to help the refugees who were at the parish, and to do everything to help the refugees in terms of food and drink.  He said that people should get together to help the refugees, and he added that he didn't have the wherewithal to provide assistance to the refugees.  And he said that it was up to the Christians to help the refugees, so he asked the Christians to display solidarity. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you talked about the refugees who were at the parish, whom are you referring to? 
A.	I'm referring to the Tutsis who had sought refuge there.  From what I gathered from my relatives, when there was insecurity, both Tutsis and Hutus sought refuge in the church and prayed together to find succour.  So, at the church, people came together to pray, and the church was respected; generally, churches were not attacked.  So people would find refuge in the churches, to be protected by God, and to pray. 
Q.	Do you know how these refugees went to the church? 
A.	I've told you that between from my home to the church there is a distance that can be covered in about an hour and a half.  This distance is about 10 to 15 kilometres, so I really cannot tell you how the refugees got to the church.  There is quite a distance between my home and the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  Could you tell the Court, if you recall, about how many refugees could be in the parish -- at the parish when you went there for Mass? 
A.	I told you that, in view of the prevailing situation at the time, you couldn't go around counting the people who were present.  No one thought to count people.  The only idea that one had was to help people.  There were children and we wondered whether we could find some bananas and sweet potatoes to come to the assistance of these people with.  I, for my part, didn't think of counting people.  My first instinct was to help, to the best of my ability. 
Q.	In terms of providing assistance, do you know of any other person who tried to do this? 
A.	Oh, yes.  I was not alone to attend Mass.  There were other people, who raised awareness about the problem, and who reported what the priest had said; that is, that we should help our Christian brethren.  They said that we should come together to assist these refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  So, after you brought as much food as you could to these refugees, do you know whether they were protected where they sought refuge?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I stand corrected, and in this matter I place myself entirely in the hands of the Court, but as far as I recall -- and I really could be wrong -- as far as I recall, I don't recall this witness going as far as to say that he brought food.  I stand corrected, but I don't believe so.  And if, in fact, I am correct, then this would not be a formulation that the Defence should place in a question.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, with your leave.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. NEKUIE:
I wanted to tell the Chamber perhaps I used the word "supplies" without really realising I had.  I simply meant "assistance".  I don't know if the Prosecutor would be satisfied with that and, if so, may I be able to proceed?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we did hear "assistance" earlier and, on the basis of that, you may proceed, Counsel.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	So, Witness, let me repeat my question for you.  You tried to assist, as you could, the refugees.  Do you know whether or not the refugees inside the church were protected?  That was the essence of my question.
A.	I had told you that from my house to the church there's a distance of 10 to 15 kilometres.  I'm not in a position, therefore, to tell you what happened at the church.  I can't tell you who greeted them, who brought them there.  I can't tell you.  I'm not in a position to do so.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I simply want you to indicate to this Honourable Chamber -- if you know, of course, Witness -- if you had any news from those people who you tried to assist at the church?  Did you have any news of them after the Mass that you went to?  That is the question.
A.	I remember there were police officers and gendarmes.  That's what I remember.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you return to that parish after the Mass you went to, and the Mass where you heard Father Seromba speak?  Did you return and, if so, what did you do upon your return, if indeed you returned? 
A.	After father asked us to help our Christian brethren, I returned home and I transmitted the information to those who were at home.  I tried to find a way to help the refugees.  My parents helped me -- they gave me some supplies that I brought for the refugees.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  After you brought the supplies to the refugees, did you remain at the parish and, if so, on which date, if you recall? 
A.	I believe that I went to Mass on the morning of the 12th.  I came back on the 13th.
Q.	What did you see on that day of the 13th?
A.	I could see that, compared to the morning of the 12th, there were more people.  There were many people at the church.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	You're welcome.
Q.	What about those people who were at the church; did you know whether they were exclusively refugees, or were there others among them?
A.	I told you that there were refugees in addition to police officers and gendarmes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about after the 13th, did you ever go back to that location?
A.	If I remember correctly, I went back on the 16th at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  We heard some news.  It said that the Inyenzis had destroyed the church, and people were wondering how the church had been destroyed.  Everyone was surprised that the church had been destroyed.  I was curious; I wanted to know how the church had been destroyed.  I tried to find out how the church had been destroyed -- by which means it had been destroyed.  So, I decided to go there, so that I could see what was going on.
Q.	Thank you.  So, in the end, were you able to find out how the church was indeed destroyed?
A.	I wasn't able to make it to the church.  I made it to an area 15 metres in front of the church where there was a statue.  Many people who were coming from church and returning home were there.  There were many of them.  And so I spoke with some of those groups who were leading the people.  They were telling the people where to go, which way to go.  I became afraid.  I was wondering why the people were telling us where to go.  I was wondering whether or not the Inyenzis wanted to kill us.  I was overcome with panic, and we were forced to go in certain directions.  I didn't obey the orders; I went to the church.  I could see that the beams of the church and the roof of the church had fallen down.  It was just a pile of bricks.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You said that you were forced to go in certain directions, or you were forced to do things you didn't want to do.  Who are you talking about; who forced you to do these things?
A.	I wasn't able to identify anyone.  Moreover, we didn't have an idea of who anyone was.  All we could think of was to get back to our families.  People just wanted to get back to their families.  They prayed to God that they could get out of that situation.  When we arrived, we didn't know what had happened to the church.  Then we found out.  Our only concern was to go home; we were afraid.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, you were there; you were under duress.  Were you able to get home?
A.	Right when we arrived, we were led to the church ruins.  We were compelled to pick up the bodies near the bulldozers that were there.  What was important was to pick up the bodies.  We attempted to do that.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You were compelled to do that work.  Among the people who compelled you to do so, did you see who was among them, or were there any clergy members or priests?
A.	On site, in front of the church, I didn't see any priests.  I left that place where we were being forced to pick up the dead bodies.  I went back to the presbytery.  From there, the priest found us.  He was overwhelmed by the events, and saddened.  From what we could understand, he felt a great deal of sorrow, because the church had been destroyed.  He was full of sorrow, because his believers had been killed.  He was overwhelmed and saddened by the destruction of the church and by the fact that people had been killed and murdered.  He said, "How is it possible that God's house can be destroyed and people killed?"  It was horrible.  "How can somebody come to your place and kill your children?"  So, you'll understand his state of mind at the time.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Remaining calm, can you tell us the name of the priest you are referring to, and tell us exactly where you saw him -- the same priest who was saddened, as you mentioned earlier?
A.	Yes, I'm talking about Father Seromba.  He had given Mass.  He had called upon us and urged us to help the people.  He told us to stay together, and he was sorry for the fact that people had not understood his appeal and that people had killed others.  I'm talking about Father Seromba.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You saw that priest, therefore.  Where exactly did you see him?  You have to be more specific to shed light on the situation for this Honourable Chamber.  
A.	I told you, at the end of that activity -- and we had not finished -- in fact, all we wanted to do was to leave, at all costs.  For my part, I went to the presbytery.  There was a tap, a water tap.  The area is fenced off.  We went through a gate to get to the presbytery.  We went to wash our hands, since there was a tap there.  This is where I saw him, in the back courtyard of the presbytery.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  If I understand you correctly, you are saying that that is where Father Seromba was and where he was deploring what had happened; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct; it was at the presbytery.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you remain at that location for a long time, where you saw the priest express sorrow for what had happened to his followers?
A.	I told you that he came to us.  He was saying that this was the first time that a church had been destroyed under such circumstances.  I also told you that I wanted badly to get out of that place, given the events that took place and given the fact that we were forced to do what we did.  I wanted to leave that place badly.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  So you left.  Where did you go after you left the location?
A.	I went home immediately.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	You're welcome.
Q.	Witness, can you tell this Honourable Chamber, since you were on site, whether or not there were any people who were killed after the church was destroyed during the time you were there.  
A.	Are you referring to the same day when I was there, or a different day, because you said "afterwards".  When you say "after", I'm not sure which day you mean.
Q.	Let me be more specific.  I'm talking about the very same day when you were on site, when you were near the ruins of the church.  I want you to specify, kindly, if you were able to see the victims of that destruction on that site.  
A.	That's what I was saying earlier.  When we were led to the ruins, there were piles of bricks.  It was an enormous church which had come down.  The roof and the beams fell on to the persons who were inside, so you will understand there were people who died.
Q.	To your knowledge, who could have been the victims of such destruction -- who were the people; who were the victims?  Do you have any idea?
A.	At the very beginning I told you that the church was located at about 15 kilometres from my house, and so I'm not in a position to tell you who those people were, given the distance between my house and the church.
Q.	Let me help you, Witness.  Were you able to know whether or not the victims of that destruction were refugees or other people?  That's what I'm getting at.  I would like you to tell us, for the benefit of the Chamber.  
A.	Of course, the people who were killed in that church were refugees.  Those are the same refugees who needed assistance -- the refugees we were called upon and urged to assist.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  So they were Tutsi refugees; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to know whether or not those victims were of any particular social class, or were they simply victims from all walks of life, with no distinction with regard to their social status?
A.	They were from all walks of life.  I don't know whether or not I should point out that there were Christians amongst them.  There were some who weren't Christians; they'd simply come for refuge.  There were children, there were women.  They were from all walks of life.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Witness, you have a list in front of you.  I have also distributed the same list to the Bench and to the Office of the Prosecutor.  The list contains numbers on it.  Those numbers are there to protect the identity of the persons whose names appear next to them.  I would ask you to indicate, in the case where there is no number next to the name, to say the name and whether or not you know the person.  That's with regard to the names that have no numbers next to them.  

After that, we will get to the names that have numbers next to them.  In those cases, I'll simply indicate which number and you will respond "Yes" or "No" by using that number.  Let me begin by mentioning the name of Fulgence Kayishema.  Do you know that person?
A.	Yes, I know him.  He was my teacher.  Later on he became a criminal investigations officer for the commune.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know whether or not he played any role whatsoever in the events which occurred at Nyange parish?
A.	I don't know.  I told you that between the parish and my house there was a distance of 15 kilometres, and so I'm not in a position to tell you whether or not he played any role in the events.  What I do know is that he was a teacher in the primary school.  He was my teacher and, later on, he became a criminal investigations officer for the commune.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me move on to the second name.  It does not have a number next to it.  That name is Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  Do you know that person?
A.	Yes, I knew him.  He was an influential businessman.  He owned a pharmacy.  He was one of my neighbours.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know Grégoire Ndahimana?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know Télesphore Ndungutse?
A.	Yes, I know him; he was a teacher.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  I'm not sure if I've already asked you this question; if so, I'll move on to a different name, but did you know Aloys Rwamasirabo?
A.	Yes, he was a businessman.  He had a shop in Nyange.  He also had a vehicle.  He was a friend of one of my aunts on my mother's side.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I want to move on to the names that have numbers next to them.  Please indicate whether or not you know these people and what you know about them, simply by referring to the number next to their name.  What about number 1, do you know that person?
A.	Yes, I knew that person.  He was assistant bourgmestre.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about number 2?
A.	I don't know that person.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about number 3?
A.	I know number 3; he was a primary school inspector.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you ever see that person during the events which occurred in April 1994 in that area?
A.	No, I didn't see him.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And number 4?
A.	I don't know number 4, either.
Q.	And number 5?
A.	I don't know this person, either.
Q.	Thank you.  Could you tell the Court when you left your area after the events of 1994?
A.	I left my area of origin, if I remember correctly, in July.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Before you left your native area, did you hear that Father Seromba had been in any way responsible for the destruction of the Nyange church?
A.	No, never.  I was surprised when I heard on the radio that he had been arrested.  I was very surprised.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Since you parted ways, you and Father Seromba, would you still be able to recognise him if you were introduced to him?
A.	Well, he's a priest who celebrated Masses that I attended.  If it is allowed, then I will ask to meet him and greet him -- if that is allowed, of course.
Q.	Could you indicate to this Court, looking around you inside this Court, if Father Seromba is here and, if you think he is here, please indicate exactly where he is.  
A.	I would like to ask the Court to approach him, and I want to greet him, and if the person whom I greet is not Father Seromba, then you will include it in the record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps we might let you tell the witness what is done as a matter of custom here, or do you wish us to address his request ourselves?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  I didn't want to take the initiative, because I understood that this wish of a faithful to meet his parish priest was stronger than the mere need to identify the priest for the purposes of this Trial Chamber.  So I will leave it to the Bench to respond to the witness's request.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you may put your request to meet the priest later on, because it could be done under certain circumstances.  But, for reasons of security, unfortunately, we cannot ask you to stand up and approach anyone whatsoever.  You are a protected witness, and we intend to have you stay where you are, to avoid exposing you to the public view.  So, we're going to ask you to look around you and tell us whether you are able to recognise Father Seromba in this Trial Chamber. 
THE WITNESS:
   There he is.  Look at him.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Is the Bench satisfied?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would the witness be more explicit.  "There he is.  Look at him," is a bit more vague.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, could you be more explicit?  Please say exactly where he is and in what position.
A.	This is someone who is working on a computer.
Q.	Where is he?  There are several people who are using computers in this Trial Chamber.  
A.	I'm asking you to let me approach him so that you will see for yourselves.  He's wearing a dark jacket.
Q.	Witness, please just say exactly where he is.  
A.	He is wearing a black jacket.  He is typing at the computer.  That is what I said.
Q.	Are you referring to the person who is wearing a black jacket and is sitting to my left?
A.	Yes, exactly.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, Prosecutor, I do not know why -- although the description is somewhat unusual, I do not know whether you find it satisfactory.
MS. ALEXIS:
Well, Madam President, aside from the fact that Counsel had to assist the witness and ask if he is the one at the left, I have no difficulties.  I am convinced that this witness has pointed out Father Seromba.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the record show that Witness BZ5 recognised Father Seromba in the Trial Chamber.  Counsel.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you.  A couple of more questions to the witness, if I may. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Sir, do you really think that anyone could have prevented the destruction of the Nyange church, as you said it was destroyed?  
MS. ALEXIS:
I find this question very peculiar, since, from the evidence of this witness, the witness was not there at all.  He was never present when, or during the time the church was being destroyed, and he did not arrive until afterwards when, according to him, to quote his evidence, the church was a pile of bricks.  So this question invites speculation.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I shall put the question to the witness based on what he experienced.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q. When you discovered the ruins of the church, did you hear -- did anyone tell you that this destruction could have been avoided? 

MS. ALEXIS:
That question is a leading question, Madam President.  It suggests to the witness the exact words that someone may or may not have spoken to him, and it comes back to my original proposition that this witness was not there.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I think the Prosecutor is determined to make inappropriate objections, because the witness has given clear testimony that he was present at the ruins of the destroyed church.  So, it is normal for me to ask whether the witness heard something about the conditions under which the church was destroyed.  It does not seem to me that this is a leading question.  I'm just asking the witness to say what he heard when he saw the ruins, because he said he went there after the destruction of the church.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, answer the last question -- the question that was just put to you by Counsel Nekuie. 
THE WITNESS:
The way I see it, the priest was attacked and his house was destroyed, his Christians killed.  If he had had the power to protect his house and his Christians, the church would not have been destroyed.  If the church was destroyed and the Christians killed, this means that he did not have the power to prevent these acts from being committed.  I don't know how he managed to survive.

You know that bishops were killed -- an archbishop and bishops -- and we have a priest who was alive when all these Christians were killed.  He should thank God that he is still alive today.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  One last question:  you indicated that you're a Christian; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	As a Christian, do you think that -- can you say that you have told the truth to this Court?
A.	Yes, I have.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  
A.	You're welcome.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, this is my last question, and this concludes my examination-in-chief of witness BZ5.  I would like to ask the Court to enter into evidence as defence exhibit number D. 49 the list of names that I gave to the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Prosecution? 
MS. ALEXIS:
(Microphone not activated) 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  This document will be entered as D. 49, and shall be placed under seal.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.
(Exhibit No. D. 49 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have further questions for this witness? 
MR. NEKUIE:
No.  Madam President, Your Honours, I was just going to express my pleasure at having examined witness BZ5.  I would like to thank the witness and the Trial Chamber.  I would like to thank my learned friends of the Prosecution and all who contributed to this exercise.  And I would like to indicate that I have finished with the witness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, also, Counsel, for the examination-in-chief of witness BZ5.  At this time, we would like to know whether we have another witness for today.  Perhaps it would be well to take a break before we take the next witness.  Do you have any details regarding witnesses, Mr. Monthé or Mr. Nekuie, perhaps?  
MR MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I have no details or no information regarding the next witness.  I shall approach WVSS and report back when I have any information. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  Very well.  I think the witness should be allowed to leave the courtroom now.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For this afternoon, since BZ2 is still indisposed on account, I believe, of her baby's health, we're going to be dealing with BZ1.  Mr. Monthé?  
MR MONTHÉ:
Madam President, if WVSS so says, I have no objection; I shall have the witnesses come. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we're asking WVSS to bring BZ1 for this afternoon.  Mr. Monthé, will that take a long time?  Will your examination take a long time?  
MR MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I couldn't possibly answer that.  I'll use the time I need, because we need to do what we have to do in the interests of justice.  I really can't say.  I did, I think, indicate a time frame, but I don't remember. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
	Microphone, please, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So I was saying that we are all very serious people here, so we want to know how long you will take, because we need to know whether we should bring another witness, even though you have indicated in a document how long the examination-in-chief would last.  We have to inform WVSS if one or two witnesses need to be brought for this afternoon. 
MR MONTHÉ:
We only have BZ1 and BZ2, so since BZ2 is indisposed, we really cannot bring BZ2.  So, in view of the state of health of BZ2's child, we can only use BZ1. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any information regarding your other witnesses; that is, from the 7th witness, I believe?  
MR MONTHÉ:
I think WVSS is on it -- I think they have met.  Perhaps something may come of it this weekend.  I know that they are in contact, but I really don't know what is going on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So we shall have witness BZ1 for this afternoon, and we shall take witness BZ2 when this witness is available.  

Thank you.  We're going to take the lunch break now, and we shall resume at 2 o'clock, as planned.  Thank you to everyone.
(Court recessed at 1205H)
(Pages 19 to 32 by Maureen Dunn)
	














(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

It appears Mr. Monthé had something to say to the Chamber. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours.  Mr. Monthé wishes to tell the Chamber by repeating what he said earlier, that he is tendering the statements as promised.  The Prosecution disclosed some materials to Mr. Monthé during the hearing.  This does not enable the Defence to use them.  We don't know the identity of the persons who are mentioned in those statements.  That doesn't seem, to me, to be the spirit of the order that your Chamber made.  I'm saying this with insistence.  If we want the truth to be manifested, as we all do, each of the parties must respect what you said.  Sanctions have been brandished before me.  I'm just like all of those Jewish pilgrims who know sanctions are part of life.  But I would like the Prosecution to respect their orders -- your orders as well and disclose the identity of the persons in question.  

Madam President, if the Prosecution continues to play this game, the Defence will also have to dance.  That's what I wanted to indicate to you, the Chamber.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, Madam President, since counsel is so fond of making quotations, perhaps I shall say that he who is without sin should not (sic) cast the first stone.  Madam President, we have complied with the spirit and the subject and the ruling of this Honourable Court.  We filed with the registry yesterday all the documents as ordered.  They were filed yesterday afternoon, and so that is perhaps why counsel received the documents today.  Counsel, in all good conscience, having not acceded to Your Lordships' ruling, cannot in all good conscience come and cast stones at the Prosecutor.  

So that, in closing, I just wished to reiterate that we have obeyed the ruling of this Court, and in any event, as has been pointed out to counsel by the Prosecution and indeed by the Court itself, there is no link between our disclosure obligations and the disclosure obligations of the Defence.  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Yes, I would like to make a comment.  We received information at 8:40 this morning from one of the legal officers from the Tribunal, saying, "I wish to inform you that the Prosecution disclosed the statements requested by the Defence mentioned on page 8-9 of the 11 March 2005 motion.  "And then follow the pseudonyms CAM, CNY, CBW, CNU, CBX, CNP, CNE -- CNI, XBL, CNO.  "All of the statements are in French except for that of CAN."  
Now, I would like to know if the Defence is contesting having received these declarations because we made in our decision a reference to pages 8 and 9, referring to your earlier request.  I don't think that is the case.  If that is not the case, I would like to reiterate what the presiding Judge has already said.  I see no connection between this communication and the one that we on several occasions have asked the Defence to submit so that we can go on in good order with this case.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Your Honour Hökborg.  Those disclosures were made.  

If you need additional information, you can write down which additional information you need or request.  We would like to know if you have disclosed all of the statements of your witnesses, Mr. Monthé.  The Bench has yet to have received that.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am in the process of writing to the Bench.  You will receive that communication during this afternoon with regard to that issue and with regard to the statements. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So this afternoon, we will have everything before we leave the Tribunal.  As you know, tomorrow will be a public holiday.  There's a long weekend.  And we need everything before we leave the Tribunal this evening.  Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I am not in the habit of telling you something that I'm not going to do.  I have always respected my engagements.  You will have, before leaving the Tribunal, everything I've promised to disclose. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Can we now bring in BZ1, your fifth witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I should like to distribute some documents that you will need before we bring in the witness.  I spoke with Mr. Fry when Your Honour intervened. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected Defence witness.  Your pseudonym is BZ1. You will first be questioned by the Defence, then cross-examined by counsel for the Prosecution.  It may be possible that the Judges have questions for you, as well, after which there may be a re-examination conducted by the Defence.  Before you answer any of the questions that are put to you, you must take a solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness BZ1 in Kinyarwanda)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Mr. Monthé, will you be examining this witness?  If so, please proceed.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
With your leave, Madam President, yes.  I am your servant.  Madam President, Your Honours, with leave of your Chamber, I should like to begin my examination-in-chief of Witness BZ1.  
WITNESS BZ1,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ1, you are called that because you are being protected by this Tribunal.  The Defence should like to put a few questions to you.  Those will require responses from you which should be clear and specific.  In the case that those questions are not clear for you, please interrupt me and tell me that you have not understood the question so that I can rephrase it for you.  If you've understood and if you're ready, please tell me so that we may begin with your examination-in-chief.  

Furthermore, I wish you a good afternoon before this Honourable Chamber.  
A.	Thank you.  I have understood what you said and I am ready to begin. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, fist I would like to ask you where you were in April 1994.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Pardon me, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, I got into the examination-in-chief too quickly.  Madam President has brought me to order.  In fact, I've put a sheet containing some information before you.  I would like you to tentatively look at that sheet -- or now you have it, at least.  Please look at it and tell the Chamber whether or not the information contained in that document is correct, in which case you should sign the document.  That will enable us to begin with your examination-in-chief.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Once again, Madam President, thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are welcome, Counsel.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this is the information about me.  

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Could you kindly sign the document and hand it to the registry, who will then transmit it to the Chamber?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may proceed.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, now that you have identified yourself with the document -- one moment, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have to give the document an exhibit number.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes.  Madam President, I believe this will be D. 50, five-zero.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Prosecution?  
MS. ALEXIS:
None, please, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The identification sheet for Witness BZ1 tendered and admitted and marked as a Defence exhibit.  It shall be marked D. 50 and placed under seal.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are welcome, Counsel.
(Exhibit No. D. 50 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ1, I want to ask you where were you in April 1994.  Were you staying in Rwanda and, if so, where exactly?  Do not be too specific with regard to your location when you answer that question. 
A.	In April 1994 I lived in Nyange. 
Q.	Thank you.  At that time in the month of April, did any events of a national scale occur in Rwanda?  
A.	There was an extraordinary event which occurred in my country in April 1994.  In fact, Juvénal Habyarimana, the president of the republic, died.  
Q.	Thank you.  You say that he died.  What do you mean?  How did you learn of that? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, I believe I learned of the news on the 6th of April in the evening, -- at night, rather.  He died on the 6th, in the evening.  I heard about the death on the 7th, the next morning.  I heard that his plane had been shot down. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you learned about that event the next day.  Where were you when you learned of it? 
A.	When I learned of the news, I was living at my older brother's house.  He stayed at Nyange.  During that time my older brother went to Kigali to receive training.  Since his wife was pregnant at the time, he let me stay at his house so that I could assist his pregnant wife. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you learned of the news.  What was your personal reaction to it, and what was the reaction of those around you? 
A.	After I learned the news -- it was in the morning -- I informed my older brother's wife.  After that, I went outside, and outside I could see people forming small groups.  It was as if I was the last one in on the news.  You could see that people were mourning.  They were filled with sorrow.  Some couldn't believe their ears.  That was the prevailing situation, if I can say it that way. 
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications, Witness.  You saw all of those people sorrowed by the president's disappearance -- or, death.  What happened after all of those discussions?  What did you see in your commune or in your area?  
A.	In fact, I was at my older brother's house.  Between his house and my parents' house, there was a large distance.  I decided to move to see what was happening at my house.  On the way, everywhere I went, I could see that everybody was in sorrow.  They don't know what to do.  People generally didn't know what to do.  

After a while, perhaps four or five days later, other extraordinary events took place.  Some people started to say that the head of state had been killed by the RPF.  There was a war in the country at the time.  And as time went on, the people began to kill one another.  They began to kill their neighbours, sometimes with bladed weapons.  And those who were being targeted started to hide and leave their homes.  Sometimes the homes were not guarded and some people took advantage of that opportunity to loot and steal the property of those people who had fled or had gone into hiding in the bush.  This was the general situation in the region where I was. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please be more specific for the Chamber.  You said that the people believed that the RPF had shot down the president's plane and after that they began to attack Tutsis.  Does that mean that the population established a direct link between the plane crash and the Tutsis who lived in your area? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, first of all -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
First of all, I have been taking notes.  The witness did not -- at least what I heard in English, did not say that the people started to kill Tutsis.  He said they started to kill their neighbours.  And in any event, the question of counsel is very leading.  The entirety of the question in itself suggests to the witness the direction of the answer.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to respond, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't want to create a controversy.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, who was killed in your area? 
A.	When people spoke of the RPF, people drew a link between the RPF and the Tutsis because they said that the RPF had attacked the country.  When people spoke about the RPF which had attacked the country, that was another way to say that it was the Tutsis who did it, the Tutsis in general had attacked the country.  Since the Tutsis began to feel threatened, they started to leave their homes.  At any rate, people said that if Habyarimana was dead, it means he was killed by the Tutsis.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you confirm for the Chamber that if the Tutsis were attacked at home, it was in some way linked to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes.  If you look at the situation which prevailed in April, people loved the head of state.  Of course, he had opponents of his regime, but people said that the opponents who didn't like the president were Tutsis.  So when you hear that someone you love is dead and that the person who killed him is somehow related to the Tutsis, people wanted vengeance and took it out on the Tutsis.  There were other people who died with the president on the plane; they died alongside him.  For example, the chief of general staff, he was loved by the people.  So if you know that the person who killed your loved one is somehow related to the Tutsis, people wanted to take revenge out on the Tutsis.  They said, "If the president has been killed by the Inkotanyi and the Inkotanyi are collaborating the Tutsis, we have to take revenge and we will attack the Tutsis."  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you be more specific for the Chamber, what you mean when you say "Inkotanyi"? 
A.	In fact, the Inkotanyi were people who had attacked Rwanda in 1990.  That's what you could hear on the radio.  It is clear that the Tutsis supported the RPF a hundred per cent.  I had Tutsi neighbours.  I talked with them.  And beginning in 1990 and on through '91 and '92, I was still in school, but I had discussions with Tutsis.  Some of them said they were Inkotanyi and they said it openly.  They said it without hesitation.  

There was another word; that word was "Inyenzi."  Whenever you called them "Inyenzis," they became angry, but when you called them "Inkotanyi z'amarere," they were very proud.  I had many Tutsi friends and Tutsi neighbours.  When we had our discussions, they told me everything.  They never hid anything.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I still don't know, even after your long explanation, what the word "Inkotanyi" meant for you at the time.  Can you tell us and tell the Chamber what "Inkotanyi" means?  You said that on the radio they mentioned that word, but what did it mean to you and to others? 
A.	Generally speaking and depending on the situation and time in which we were, it meant the Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Now, let's come back to where you were.  People begin to move about, and what can you see?  You learnt on the 7th that there were people gathering in groups in your area and people are astounded.  What can you share about this time with the Chamber? 
A.	I believe I've already told you that after two or three days, people began to attack others and they began to kill and loot property.  But around the 10th of April, or as of the 10th of April, that's when people began to flee.  Some sought refuge in churches; others sought refuge in the commune office; and others still went into the houses of their Hutu friends.  Others, again, went into the bushes to seek refuge.  That was the situation. 
Q.	Witness, when you say that people sought refuge at the church, which church are you referring to?  Can you tell us exactly which church you're referring to? 
A.	When I refer to the church, I mean the church in Nyange where I was. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you were in Nyange church.  Can you tell us whether you were a regular goer to this church? 
A.	Let me say that I'm a Christian, I'm a practising Christian; therefore, I would attend morning Mass every morning. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When you say you're a practising Christian, do you mean that you are Catholic?  Because one can be Christian without being Catholic.  
A.	Yes, I was Catholic. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  So you were Catholic, and you are Catholic, so every morning you would go to Nyange parish; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, as you went to that church, could you tell the Chamber who was a priest at that church?  Who was responsible for that church, if you know? 
A.	At the time the priest was known as Straton. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you have any links or relationships with this priest, Father Straton -- you personally, I mean? 
A.	I knew Father Straton very well, but I do not know whether he knew me.  I never had the opportunity to speak at length with him.  I would meet him from time to time.  I would greet him, and then I would go home.  I don't know whether he knew me. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that clarification.  Beside Father Straton, during the period which is of interest to us, were there any other clergymen or women at the Nyange church that you were able to meet? 
A.	Another clergyman from the Nyange church was known as Athanase Seromba.  I think he was the vicar at the time. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When did you see Father Athanase Seromba, who was the vicar of that Nyange parish at the time, for the first time?  When did you first see him? 
A.	If my memory serves me right, I believe I saw him at the end of 1993.  It must be around the month of October.  I think it was the third quarter of the year 1993.  That's when he came to the Nyange parish. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Were you able to have contact with Father Athanase Seromba at the time? 
A.	I don't know what you mean by the term "contact," but since I was one of the faithful of his church and since each sheep needs to know his shepherd, he was like my shepherd.  It is possible that the shepherd does not know all the sheep, but I knew him, although I don't know whether he knew me.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, did you attend any Mass services said by Father Athanase Seromba? 
A.	Yes, I attended Masses which were celebrated by him, and I remember even that during difficult times he was the one who would read the Mass.  When I'm saying "difficult times," I'm referring to the time after the death of President Habyarimana.  Even if he said Mass, he did say goodbye to us because he had been transferred to the parish of Crête Zaire Nil.  He told us that he was ready to leave, but during those difficult times, every morning, he was the one who would celebrate Mass.  I believe I attended those Mass services until about the 11th of April.  I cannot be very specific about the date, but I believe it was around the 11th of April. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we shall go to the times which were difficult.  Let's deal for the time being with the times that were not difficult.  Now, you say you attended Masses celebrated by Father Seromba.  Can you tell the Chamber -- if you know, obviously-- what was the opinion of the faithful regarding their vicar? 
A.	From what I recall about Father Seromba is that he was liked by all the faithful, be they Hutu or Tutsi, to such an extent that even when he said goodbye to us, all the faithful asked him to remain and not leave them behind.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I now want to move on together with you.  Let's look at your neighbours who were fleeing their homes.  They were moving, some to their friend's houses, others to the bushes, others to the church, and you said this was the Nyange parish.  Could you specify for us exactly on what date this movement was occurring? 
A.	Actually, we experienced a lot of events.  Had we known that someone was going to ask us about these dates, maybe we could have written down all those dates.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	I believe that people began to flee toward the parish and the 10th. 
Q.	Did you get to know or did you know why those who were fleeing made for the parish? 
A.	According to what I learnt in my history lessons, when there were periods of difficulty, the first place about which people thought in order to seek refuge was the church because, before these events, in fact, Rwandans had the fear of God in them.  When you were in a church, you were convinced that you were in the presence of God or in the hands of God.  This is how people took refuge in churches, so that God could be ensuring their safety. 
Q.	Thank you very much for those clarifications, Witness.  Now, you were saying that those who were fleeing went to the Nyange church and you have mentioned respect for God.  Did information according to which they went there -- or let me put it another way:  Did they go to the church of their own free volition, or did someone order them to go there?
A.	Personally, what I saw is that people went there of their own accord.  No one told the people to go to the church.  It was, in fact, somewhat like a habit the Rwandans had adopted, that at all times of difficulty, they would seek refuge in churches, and it's the same case in this situation.  When people felt threatened, they immediately thought about the church.  This came to their minds almost like an instinct.  If you feel threatened and you want to leave your house, you would go immediately to the door.  That's the instinct that one has of survival, and this is how people fled immediately to the church.  
Q.	Were you able to see these people going to the church yourself, I mean these refugees? 
A.	Yes, I saw them with my own eyes.  I saw some of them myself as they went to seek refuge in the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  Since you saw them, Witness, can you tell the Chamber how these refugees were going to the church? 
A.	When they were going to the church, those who had vehicles would go there in their own vehicles, but most of the refugees went to the church on foot.  They had no other means of transport. 
Q.	Do you remember the number of days that the refugees took in order to go from their homes to the parish, if you recall? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Counsel Monthé please repeat that question?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have an objection?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please.  The question that I heard in English was, can he say how long it took the refugees to get from their homes to the church.  It is my view, Madam President, that this witness cannot answer as to how long the refugees, as a whole, took to get to the church.  Perhaps it is how I heard it, but it appears to me that, as phrased, that question is not proper.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I will refrain from saying anything, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, for how many days did you see the refugees going towards the parish? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you how many days it took them to get to the church.  All I can say is that I saw these refugees as from the 10th.  So I don't know exactly when they left their respective homes.  So I wouldn't be able to tell you how much time it took them.  These are events which we don't know -- we didn't know that we would be asked about in detail later on.  I'm sorry, I wouldn't be able to answer your question.  Furthermore, I wouldn't want to lie.
Q.	I think I can say that you do not need to justify yourself to me.  I can say this under the guidance of the Chamber.  If you have no answer to a question, please just say so and we'll move on.  Don't feel that you have to give me an answer as of course.  

Now, let's go back to what we were dealing with.  According to you, you say that the refugees started going to the church as from the 10th, as far as you know.  And what happened when they got there?  Were they welcomed, and if they were, in what way were they welcomed and by who?  
A.	What I remember is that when they arrived, the refugees were welcomed, and I remember that Father Seromba said that there was rice, but he had a problem and he was wondering how he was going to meet the needs of the refugees if they needed to -- if they continued to flock in, and this is why he asked the Christians, the faithful, to come to their assistance, because their needs were great.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Can you be more specific and tell us, if you know, at what time did Father Seromba ask the faithful to come to the assistance of the refugees who were at the parish? 
A.	Every time he celebrated Mass he would say that, and I believe the last Mass he said, which was on the 11th, I believe that was the last mass which he celebrated, there were many refugees in the church and he could no longer say Mass.  And it was on that occasion that he said that the situation was overwhelming him, and that there was no longer any more rice, and he was asking the faithful to come to the assistance of the refugees.  Each one needed to contribute, depending on his or her ability, in order to help the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell the Chamber, if you are able to know, whether the faithful responded favourably or not to the request made by Father Seromba in order for them to help the refugees? 
A.	What I can say is that I saw an old lady who gave her own kitenge cloth. 
Q.	Thank you.  I want to ask you now the following.  Here you have the refugees in the church and they're living under the conditions you reminded us of just now.  What happens to the refugees once they're in the church?  And if you know, on what date would you place the events that took place subsequently? 
A.	What I remember is that the number of refugees increased tremendously and the killings spread throughout our commune.  In the rural areas people were being killed, except those who had sought refuge in the church.  There were assailants who wanted to kill the refugees who were in the church.  And I remember there was one day people came to the church and they said that Seromba himself was also an Inkotanyi who didn't want to release the Tutsis to them so they could kill them.  I was there at the church.  I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly on what date it happened, but I believe it was either the 13th or the 14th.  These attackers were armed with machetes and spears and clubs, and what I know is that he said to these attackers that the refugees were our brothers.  

Those people left, and the following day, they returned and a large-scale attack took place, and there were people who had come from Kibilira.  They launched a large-scale attack, and the refugees defended themselves by throwing stones at the attackers.  And our church was on a hill, and the church was situated in a place where the refugees were higher up than their assailants were, so the refugees threw stones and the attackers fled.  However, at one time, someone threw a grenade in the crowd of refugees and they were discouraged.  Many people died and others went back into the church.  
Q.	Very well.  But I want to come back to a point which you haven't mentioned and which I want to ask you about.  Dealing still with the welcome that the refugees received at the parish, can you tell the Chamber, Witness, if you did get to know or whether you saw whether the refugees who were arriving at the church were mistreated, and, if so, were they mistreated by Father Seromba? 
A.	Personally, I cannot say that the refugees were mistreated, particularly because Father Seromba was telling us that there was very little food, and he was asking for help for these refugees.  If these refugees were mistreated, this would have been due to a lack of resources and a shortage of food.  What I can confirm is that Father Seromba warmly welcomed the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that clarification.  I now wish to ask you to tell us about the events.  And you said that a grenade was thrown during one of the attacks.  What day was that, if you recall.  The date -- not the day, the date.  That's if you recall.  
A.	It's very difficult to remember dates.  More so because I say that we did not expect that we would have to recount these events one day, but I believe it was around the 14th or the 15th.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that effort you've made in giving explanations.  You have stated that on that date you indicated the attackers attacked refugees and that grenades were thrown and that there were deaths, and I interrupted you at that time, but I apologised, however.  Can you then continue with that specific issue so that you can tell us what happened at the end of that day on which that attack occurred? 
A.	I remember that after the grenade was thrown, the refugees were discouraged and the assailants attacked the latter and killed them.  The confrontations continued until 6 p.m., and as far as I'm concerned, I went back home.  I do not know what went on during the night.  At about 6 p.m. I went back home.  I do not know what happened after my departure.  So I'm referring to that day on which the grenade was thrown.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I want to ask you now whether you can kindly tell us, after the grenade was thrown, what did the refugees do?  Did they remain on the spot?  Did they defend themselves or did they go somewhere else? 
A.	After the grenade was thrown, the refugees went back into the church and they locked the doors.  The attackers tried to force down the doors so that they could enter the church, and the refugees resisted from inside the church where they were.  That was the situation. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, when you tell us about these events in which the refugees locked themselves inside, did they do that in following someone's orders? 
A.	To say that they did that upon someone's instructions, I wouldn't know about that. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, we're still talking about the refugees.  Were you able to find out -- or, did you see any meetings going on?  Did you find out about any meetings here or there, meetings whose objective was to get the refugees to the parish?  
A.	I'm not aware of any such meetings.  What I do know is that once they were at the church, I heard that there was supposed to be a meeting regarding development, but other meetings, I'm not aware of. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please tell us for our own information, if you know anything about this, about meetings regarding development.  What does that mean, what types of meetings are these? 
A.	There were some communiqués from the church, but I don't know what happened after that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let's talk about that first day of the 14th, when there was a grenade attack.  If you agree with the date, please say so.  You did say that you had some issues with dates, but please tell me if you agree with that date so that I may proceed.  
A.	You are talking about the 14th?  
Q.	Yes, the 14th.  If I followed correctly, that was the date when the grenade was thrown and the date when the refugees barricaded themselves into the church.  I just want to make sure, Witness, that we're talking about the same day and the same events.  
A.	Instead, you should ask me about the grenade that was thrown.  I said perhaps it happened on the 14th, but maybe the 15th.  Don't ask me to be too specific with regard to dates because I don't remember them. 
Q.	Exactly, Witness.  That's why I wanted to provide you clarification with regard to the date.  So, in fact, this event could have been on the 14th or 15th of April; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	Yes, that's possible.  
Q.	Thank you.  Let us talk now about the attackers.  You told the Chamber that you could see people going by with weapons such as clubs, spears and other weapons.  If you know, please tell the Chamber who were those people.  Where were they coming from? 
A.	The day the grenade was thrown, there were people I did not recognise.  People said they were coming from Kibilira, but for my part, I could not identify those attackers. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to know -- did you know if those people had a leader or chief who was giving them instructions? 
A.	It is possible that they had a leader.  Amongst those leaders I could mention, for example, the communal authorities or officials.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer.  Now let me ask you, when you say "communal officials," who do you have in mind?  Can you be more specific?  
A.	When I say communal officials, I'm referring to the bourgmestre, criminal investigations officers, IPJs.  Those are the types of people I'm referring to.  Those are communal officials.  I should add, however, that among those communal officials there were also the MRND leaders.  At the time they worked closely with those officials, so I rank them along with those officials who were leaders at the time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you tell the Chamber, if you know, if those attackers, to express it as you did, had any relationship whatsoever, any link whatsoever, to Father Athanase Seromba? 
A.	Personally, on the 14th and the 15th, I did not see Father Seromba.  I've just talked about who was involved, but to say that there was any link, I can't tell you.  I didn't see him on those dates.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you did not see Father Seromba at the parish on the dates which concern us.  Did you see any other clergy members? 
A.	I did not see any clergy members, but I remember people saying that there was a priest called Kayiranga, and another called Nturiye.  Personally, I did not see them, but people did say that they were there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  If you know the answer to this question, please answer it.  If you don't, you don't have to answer it.  Do you know if, prior to the events, Father Seromba was active politically? 
A.	I have no idea.  What I can tell you is, given the way the Catholic church is set up, Father Seromba, as the parish priest, could not do anything without the authorisation from the head priest.  I don't know anything about his political activities.  Personally, I did not see him or hear anything about him, for that matter. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us finish our discussion with regard to that particular day.  You told the Chamber that you were not certain of the dates, but I'm referring to the day when the grenade was thrown.  The refugees barricaded themselves inside the church.  Once they were inside the church, were there any more attacks launched against them? 
A.	I told you I left the area at about 6 p.m. Consequently, I don't know what happened that night.  I only returned the next day.  That was the day the attackers continued to gain -- to try, rather, to gain access to the people inside the church.  Those who were outside -- anyone who was outside were practically all killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You said you went home, and then, the next day, did you come back to the parish?  
A.	Yes.  I went back to the parish.  I came back.  I must have arrived at about ten o'clock in the morning, perhaps at -- well, it was between 9:30 and ten o'clock in the morning.  
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber what you saw upon your return? 
A.	When I returned that morning there were bodies of the dead lying about.  The communal officials began to have the bodies buried.  It was difficult to dig a hole with one's hands, so a bulldozer was requisitioned.  While I was there, I saw a bulldozer arrive.  It was used to dig a pit so that the bodies could be buried. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please provide more clarification so that we can move forward.  You said requisition was made for a bulldozer.  Who requisitioned it?  Who were the people?  Do you have any specific information with regard to who exactly did that?  Please provide this information for the Chamber, if you have it.  
A.	I think that I've already clearly identified them.  Grégoire Ndahimana, communal officials, a criminal investigations officer whose name was Fulgence.  There was also Ndungutse.  Those were the people I saw at the time.  They were vigorous in their approach and they seemed to be the leaders. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you saw the bulldozer moving the bodies.  Did the Caterpillar -- was the Caterpillar actually able to be used to bury the bodies? 
A.	Personally, I saw the Caterpillar arrive.  At that time there were still refugees inside the church.  They were speaking with the attackers.  Instead of burying the bodies with the bulldozer, the bulldozer was used instead to destroy the church.  From my understanding, it was those same people who had decided to use the Caterpillar to destroy the church.  From where I was, and I was near the market or commercial centre, the bulldozer started to destroy the church, but I was not able to identify exactly where they began, on which part of the church they began.  I could hear people say, "Let's destroy the church."  That I did hear.  But when the destruction itself began, I wasn't there.

1530H 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, exceptionally, the Defence has an application.  The Defence has to go to an area where it can only go alone.  If the Chamber could kindly grant this application, the Defence would be ready to come back in just a few moments.  I know this is not normal, but in this case, we need to make this application. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. We are going to have a short break for five to ten minutes. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	These proceedings are adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1530H to 1535H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 Session is called to order.  

Mr. Monthé, you have the floor to continue your examination-in-chief of the witness.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to ask you this, answer me if you know:  You described this day about which you are not sure whether it was the 14th or the 15th and it was the date during which a grenade was launched or thrown by the assailants. Now, I want to ask you if you can tell the Chamber approximately and in your opinion how many assailants did you see, approximately speaking? 
A.	I can't tell you the number of attackers. I was on the side of the Nyange shopping centre and the assailants were on that whole side of that place.  So, unfortunately, I cannot give you any figure in relation to the number of attackers that they were there. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Since we are not talking about the attackers in the same vein, would you be able to have an idea of how many refugees would have been at the parish? 
A.	There, again, unfortunately, I am unable to estimate the number of refugees and I do apologise for that. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. Let us now come back to where we left off. We are talking about the day after the attack, the day following the attack.  You said that a bulldozer was at the parish and was burying bodies; is that correct? 
A.	I think that when we left off, I was telling you that when I arrived there it was between 9:30 and 11:00 in the morning and when I reached there, I saw the bulldozer as it was destroying the church, but I wasn't present when the bulldozer began to destroy the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, let's get to the bulldozer as it was destroying the church.  When you got to the place, was the church already destroyed, had it been half destroyed or had people just begun to destroy it? 
A.	When I saw that bulldozer, it was at the part of church which is opposite Nyange shopping centre. 
Q.	So for those who know the way the Nyange parish is situated, this would mean the side where the bell tower is. Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  It is, in fact, on the side of the bell tower. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  So it means that at that point in time, all of the back of the church had been destroyed.  In other words, all that was left was the bell tower? 
MS. ALEXIS: 
Madam President, this is very important evidence.  And perhaps counsel should let it come from the mouth of the witness.
THE WITNESS: 
(Inaudible) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, please, Mr. Witness, please wait a minute.

Mr. Monthé, can you please reformulate your question? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Is the objection sustained? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  Please reformulate your question. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you arrived at the church at what point in time during which the church was in fact being destroyed? 
A.	When I saw the bulldozer demolishing the church, at that time, the bulldozer was destroying the 
	bell tower which is opposite the Nyange shopping centre which is where I was. 
Q.	Was the bell tower still standing? 
A.	Yes, at that time, the bell tower was still standing. 
Q.	Had the back part of the church fallen? 
A.	I spoke to you about what I saw at that point in time, and it's at that part of the church, the bell tower, that is where I saw the bulldozer.  As for the rest of the church, I would not be able to tell you much.
Q.	Witness, did you then see the destruction of the bell tower or not?  Please answer me with a yes or no so that I could put to you the next question. 
A.	Yes, the bell tower fell as I was there. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember how long it took for the bell tower to be destroyed? 
A.	I would estimate that time to be between three and five hours.  I think that was the time that it took to destroy the bell tower. 
Q.	Thank you. Mr. Witness.  When the bell tower fell, what time of day was it, approximately? 
A.	It was about 3 o'clock, about three in the afternoon. 
Q.	Thank you.  When the bell tower fell, in your opinion, were there any refugees therein? 
A.	Yes, there were refugees in the clock tower.  Even before it fell, we could see people in the tower and I can confirm that because I saw them and we heard them speak. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, these people that you saw in the bell tower, do you remember what they were doing? 
A.	I could see them tearing up notes that they had.  There were even those who were hurling insults from there and then there was someone who rang the bell among the people who were in the bell tower. 
Q.	Did the bell ring for a long time? 
A.	The bell rang until the bell tower fell. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  As you were watching the bell tower being destroyed, were the attackers many around the church and were the refugees still alive? 
A.	From the place where I was, there were many people.  In fact, there were people all around the church, but as for where I was myself, many people were there. 
Q.	Thank you.  At that point in time, Mr. Witness, did you see - - have a glimpse of or hear it said that 
	Father Seromba was on site during the destruction of the bell tower?
A.	As I had said earlier, from the time when the attacks were perpetrated in that location, I never 
	saw Father Seromba until the bell tower came down. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you see any other clergy person, clergyman or clergy woman? 
A.	No, I didn't see any members of the clergy during that period of time.  The last time I saw 
	Father Seromba was at the time when he said Mass; in other words, before these events, otherwise, subsequently, the situation became more and more critical and I never saw him again. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. I want to ask you now, since you were there:  Do you recall any names of Tutsi victims that you may have known who allegedly died at the parish and, if so, which would those names be? 
A.	There are names which I heard mentioned.  I personally did not see the bodies of those people, but I heard that Gatare died in that place, the head of the health centre was also mentioned.  There was also another lady whose name was Miriam.  Those are the persons whose names were mentioned.  People said that they had seen their bodies, but these are the things I heard said I personally did not see the bodies of those people. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I am sorry that I am dwelling on this especially with regard to Anicet Gatare.  From what you heard, were you told about the circumstances surrounding his death? 
A.	According to the information that I received, it's possible that he was the first person to be killed.  Apparently, he allegedly saw the attackers arrive and he asked one of the gendarmes so that he could avoid a painful death.  This was told to me by others.  I didn't hear the words spoken personally for me to be able to confirm them. 
Q.	Thank you. From what you learnt and what you heard, did you ever hear that Father Seromba participated in whatsoever manner in the death of Anicet Gatare? 
A.	People wouldn't be able to say this, because the attackers were saying that Seromba was an accomplice because he had hidden these people and he didn't want to release them to the attackers.  It was being said that Seromba was also an Inkotanyi accomplice and that he did not want to release the people who were in the parish to the assailants. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell me now, all these events that you have spoken of before the Chamber regarding this tragedy that befell Nyange, did you ever get the feeling, or did you ever hear it said, or did you see that Tutsis were being selected to be taken to the church, or was it all Tutsis in general who were being pursued? 
A.	I didn't get to know of any selection whatsoever.  What I know and what I saw was that people came to the parish in order to seek refuge there.
Q.	I want to ask you another question:  When you were at the parish and when you saw the refugees, you had said that they had barricaded themselves in the church. Can you please tell us whether the refugees were only inside the church or whether there some others who were in the area of the secretariat or the presbytery? 
A.	If there were refugees at the presbytery, I personally was not aware of it.  I didn't see them there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you told us that those Tutsis went on their own and that they were not chosen to go there or directed there; is that correct? 
A.	Nobody asked them to go there. They went there on their own initiative. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  To be specific, did you ever learn that Father Seromba asked the Tutsis in the hills to go to the parish?  Did you ever learn that? 
A.	No.  I can't confirm that unless he said that at night when I was at home.  Otherwise, during the day when I was at the parish, I never heard such things.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please tell us, you watched the tower go down. After a few hours the bell fell to the ground that is what you told the Chamber.  Did you see people overjoyed that the bell came down?  Was there a celebration?  Did people share a drink together?  Just -- was there some type of celebration as if something had been accomplished, Witness?  
A.	When the bell tower came down, I could see that the attackers wanted to get to the people who were inside, since the tower had just fallen.  There was no reason to be overjoyed; the objective had already been achieved.  I am talking about the assailants now. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During those days when there was the attack which made the refugees barricade themselves inside the church and then the second day when you watched the tower go down, during that time, did you ever see the gendarmes or communal policemen at the parish?  
A.	If my memory serves me well, there were four gendarmes stationed at the parish.  I believe they had arrived there on about the 13th of April before the situation worsened. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You saw the gendarmes.  Were they carrying weapons? 
A.	I saw four gendarmes.  They did have weapons.  They arrived on site to protect the refugees.  I believe they had arrived after Father Seromba made a request for them.  Seromba could see that he could no longer protect the people who sought refuge with him, and so he requested that gendarmes be stationed on the site to maintain and ensure the safety of those refugees.  Other gendarmes came by; they were in a bus.  That was on the day when the grenade was launched. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I need clarification from you, Witness, if you are able to provide it.  You said there were four gendarmes who were in the parish.  Did you see them?  Were they at the church were they at the presbytery? Where exactly were they? 
A.	When I saw them, they were near the presbytery next to the staircase which leads up to the presbytery. 
Q.	First, thank you for your answer.  At that moment in time, Witness, did you see any attackers at the presbytery and, if so, what were they doing there? 
A.	I really don't have an answer for that question.  I have no idea. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me; were you able to know, after the church was destroyed, if Father Seromba was at the presbytery? 
A.	I do not know where Father Seromba was.  What I can say is that I never saw him during that period.  I don't know if he went to hide because he was afraid.  I don't know where he was at that time.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When the bell tower fell, Witness, what became of the bulldozers that knocked the tower down - - knocked the church down? 
A.	Once the bell came down, I left the area immediately.  When I left, the bulldozer was still there.  So, I cannot say what the bulldozer did after I left. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you left, and this was after the tower had already come down, were there still any refugees in Nyange?  Did you see any refugees remaining? 
A.	When the tower fell, after the tower fell, I didn't see any more refugees.  Some of the refugees were in the tower when it came down; it fell on top of them.  After that, I didn't see any other refugees on the site. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  To continue with my examination-in-chief, let me now ask you to kindly refer to the list that you have in front of you, if indeed it has been given to you.  There should be some names on the list and if you don't have a list, I can give one to you.  Please tell me, next to some of the names, there are some numbers.  I see the registrar is handing the list to you.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:  
Q.	So, Witness, you have a list with some names on it; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I have the list right here. 
Q.	One moment, Witness, please wait.  Please wait.  We are in a protected environment here and these names have to be protected.  Let me describe the list for you first:  You see a list of names.  Next to some of the names, there are numbers; would you agree with me, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	With regard to the names that you do have numbers next to them, I will simply say those names and ask questions about those persons.  With regard to the names that have numbers next to them, I will simply refer to the number and not the name.  This is simply to allow the public to take part in these proceedings; otherwise we would have to hold this session in a closed session.   Do you agree with me, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Perhaps we should add that the witness should not himself say the names and he should also simply refer to the numbers, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Thank you, Madam President, for that clarification. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	Witness, you were in Nyange in April 1994, you witnessed the tragedy that occurred there.  Did you ever meet or did you know a certain person called Fulgence Kayishema? 
A.	Yes.  I knew Fulgence Kayishema. I believe that I have already mentioned his name as one of the persons who I considered to be one of the leaders of the attacks that was launched -- the attack, rather, that was launched on the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. Did you know Gaspard Kanyarukiga, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I know Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  He was a businessman.  He owned a pharmacy in Nyange. 
Q.	Did you ever see him during the events that we are discussing before this Chamber? 
A.	Yes, I could see him in his vehicle.  I remember seeing him moving around in his vehicle at the time the events occurred.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know or did you ever hear about Télephore Ndungutse? 
A.	Yes, I know Télephore Ndungutse.    He was in charge of the MRND political party.  I also believe that I have already mentioned his name during my testimony.  He was also one of the leaders of the killers.  He worked closely with Kayishema. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What can you tell us about Grégoire Ndahimana? 
A.	Grégoire Ndahimana was our bourgmestre during that period.  He also worked closely with Kayishema. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us now look at a person Number 2.  Did you know the person whose name appears next to Number 2?  
A.	I know Number 2.  He also worked at the communal office.  What I can tell you about that person is that at the critical times people wanted him to give them weapons and guns.  He was in charge of the weapons depot. In fact, he refused to give or to hand out the guns. 
Q.	Thank you for that information, Witness.  What do you know about Aloys Rwamasirabo? 
A.	With regard to Aloys Rwamasirabo, he was also a businessman in Nyange.  He owned a Toyota vehicle. 
Q.	Let's move to Number 3.  Did you know anything about person Number 3, or do you know a person Number 3? 
A.	Yes, I know Number 3.  He was in the same group as I was. 
Q.	What about Number 4? 
A.	That name does not ring a bell. I don't remember Number 4. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about Number 5? 
A.	I don't know Number 5. 
Q.	Thank you.  What about Number 6? 
A.	No.  That name does not ring a bell. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What about Number 7? 
A.	I don't remember that name, either. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know anything about Number 8? 
A.	No, that name does not ring a bell, but I did hear.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness has mentioned a name out aloud, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness mentioned a name.  That name should be struck from the trial record.  We are not sure if the name he mentioned was Number 8, but out of an abundance of caution, it should be taken off the record. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, did you ever hear about Father John Francois Kayiranga? 
A.	Yes, I know Kayiranga. 
Q.	Can you tell us where you met him? 
A.	Kayiranga often came to our parish to give Mass at the moment of the events in question.  People from my area said that he was also present at the parish. 
Q.	Did you see him during that period, or did you just hear that he was at the parish at that time? 
A.	I heard people say that he was at the parish.  Personally, I never saw him. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  What about Father Nturiye, does that name ring a bell? 
A.	Yes, I also know Edward Nturiye.  He was a priest who was in charge of the minor seminary in Ndondo. People said that he was also present during the events, but I did not personally see him. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Did you ever hear about Father Balthazar Habimana and whether or not he was in that location during the events? 
A.	No.  The only people I heard about are those I have already mentioned. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, earlier you told the Chamber, and I meticulously wrote this down and I want you to repeat what you said, and if you think I am mistaken please stop me, I think I wrote down the following:  You said that Rwandans were god-fearing people.  Did you say that Witness? 
A.	That's what I said. 
Q.	Thank you.  Given that, can you tell the Chamber, since Rwandans were god-fearing people, how was it possible that refugees inside the church could be attacked? 
A.	Personally, I believe that some people had gone crazy.  People who pray like I do think that people like this were overcome with demons.  They were used by the demons to commit those atrocities.
Q.	Thank you.  If the Rwandans were god-fearing, does that mean that they would respect their clergy members or priests, according to you, Witness? 
A.	Yes, Rwandans did have respect for their priests.  Those who had problems would go to see their priests for advice.  Priests were approached by everyone for advice. 
Q.	Witness, according to your knowledge, did Rwandans consider priests as authorities? 
A.	And in the area of morals, I would say Rwandans considered priests, as a spiritual authority. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, but for you as a Rwandan, in the context of 1994, would the priest, a spiritual authority, and, for instance a bourgmestre, would they both have the same kind of authority in your view at that point in time? 
A.	When I am making reference to a spiritual authority, you cannot compare the part of the priest to those of a bourgmestre.  A bourgmestre (sic) is responsible for souls in a spiritual context whereas the bourgmestre has a different kind of authority.  So, if I can say that way there are two kinds of authorities which have nothing to do with one another.  I may also add that when you see the authority of a bourgmestre, he has as a bourgmestre over the priest, but the contrary is not possible. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know or you were able to know at the time of the events in Rwanda in 1994, if priests would give orders to gendarmes? 
MS. ALEXIS:   
Madam President, this is a very vague question.  In Rwanda, generally if priests would give directions to gendarmes, I find the question to be somewhat vague. If counsel wishes to ask a particular question, it is my view that he ought to do so.  This is the sort of open-end question that elicits five-minute answers from the witness, who is not sure what is required of him.  So I am commenting that perhaps counsel may wish to make the question more specific. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, by your leave.  I believe you, Madam Prosecutor, are under-estimating the witness. I believe he is able to answer the question.  But I would like to be nice to you, because I am not a bad person.  So I will put the question in a different way. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Were priests able to give orders to gendarmes, Witness?
A.	All I know is that we were in a period of war and you all know what happened at war.  The person with the weapon is the one with the authority.  If someone has a weapon, that person can order you to sit in the mud and you will have to do so. But I do not see how a civilian priest can give orders to an armed gendarme; I think that would be impossible.  The gendarmes can order a priest to sit down and he will have to obey the orders of the gendarmes, just like any civilian who meets a gendarme, that person will have to obey immediately the orders of the armed gendarmes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, I would like you to tell us exactly whether you were --said, or you got to know whether Father Seromba, who was at the parish at the time, could have given orders to gendarmes that you have referred to. 
A.	I am not aware of that, but personally, in my view, I believe that would be impossible.  Even if the gendarmes were there, they had someone who must have sent them there, someone who would have deployed them to that location, for they would follow the instructions of that person who had sent them to that location.  There were communal authorities which maybe asked them to ask or other authorities which commanded them to come. Otherwise, the priests had no authority whatsoever over the gendarmes. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for that answer.  A moment ago you described events that occurred in Nyange, the events that you experienced over the two days that you referred to. Now, let me put to you this question: Do you think that someone could have stopped that tragedy from occurring? 
A.	My understanding, at the beginning, if the communal authorities had wanted to stop people from killing one another, I think that could have been possible.  They were the only people who would have been able to stop such tragedy.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you ever get to know why the authorities, the communal authorities did not do that? 
A.	I do not know anything about that; quite sincerely, I do not know.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, my next question following those two is this: Do you think that Father Seromba could have stopped that tragedy which occurred in Nyange? 
A.	Given the circumstances of the time, Father Seromba was nothing.  Father Seromba had spiritual authority over reasonable individuals, but these ones had turned into demons.  So, if I were to consider how people respected him, normal people would have obeyed him, but he could not teach any lessons to demons.  These people had become demons.  They were no longer ordinary people. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You stated that you were very familiar with the Nyange parish; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Clearly.  What period of time did you see Father Seromba there? 
A.	First of all, I want you to give me clarification.  Do you want me to refer to the period of April?  Or you are referring to some other period of time?  
Q.	I am referring to the period which is of concern to us. During this period of time or a little before, did you see Father Seromba at Nyange parish?  If so, please tell me.  If the question is not clear to you, please tell me and that's what I had said at the beginning of our session here. 
A.	I am going to give the following answer, given the way I understand your question.  I cannot be specific as regards the date, but the last time I saw Seromba at the parish was around the 12th or the 13th when he celebrated the last Mass.  At that time, speaking more complicated, he no longer said Mass.  In fact, people had begun to say that he was also an Inkotanyi and that he must release the Inkotanyi that he was hiding.  That was the last time that I saw Father Seromba.

BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, regarding Father Seromba, what perception did the parishioners of Nyange have of him?  What did they think of him? 
A.	If my memory serves me right, I believed the faithful of Nyange parish considered Father Seromba to be someone who was without reproach. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, you have said, and I am still under the control of the Chamber, and, of course, yourself because you are the one who I am trying to quote, according to you, Father Seromba came to the parish at the third quarter of the year 1993; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I had said.  
Q.	Thank you.  Between his arrival at the Nyange parish and the events of April 1994, can you please tell this august Chamber whether you heard anyone, parishioners or people from your commune, mention any possible political activities in which Father Seromba was involved? 
A.	I didn't hear any such thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And now I want to ask you for how long you hadn't seen Father Seromba? 
A.	Between nine and ten years.  I think the last time I saw him was at the Bukavu refugee centre, which was known as Nyirurangwa (phonetic), that was when I last saw him; and the next time I am seeing him is today. 
Q.	Should I, therefore, deduce that you are able to tell this Chamber where Father Athanase Seromba is in this courtroom? 
A.	Maybe I would ask for authority or permission to go and greet him and shake his hand, because I am one of his shepards, he was my parish -- he was my priest. 
Q.	I do not think that would be possible for you to do that today for the obvious reasons of your protection.  You cannot move, but could you kindly indicate for our purposes where exactly you are seeing     Father Seromba so that the Honourable Judges can understand that we are, indeed, referring to the same Father Seromba, you and I? 
A.	He is seated next to a lady; and in front of him he has a portable computer.  He is wearing spectacles.  He is now smiling.  He has a mustache.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Mr. President, I believe that specific and unchallengeable description can be accepted.  Can the Chamber agree that the record should reflect that the witness has recognised Father Seromba, who is here present?  And I would thank you in advance for that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the record so reflect that the witness has recognised Father Seromba, who is seat in the courtroom.  

And you may proceed. 

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	I would like to ask you one last question.  Why did you come to Arusha today, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I came to Arusha in order to speak about the events that I witnessed and experienced.  I also wanted to affirm that when they placed Father Seromba under detention and accused him of crimes, I am saying that I do not believe that that is true.  The fact that he is here in prison, is due to the fact that he was a Hutu priest, and that when the church was destroyed he was present and the authorities in Kigali -- 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, and this, of course, is no indictment against the Defence counsel who asked one question. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we cannot hear the speaker because the relay button had not been released by the booth; I'm sorry.  Can you request that she begin again. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecution, could you kindly repeat what you said because we have not had the interpretation of what you have been saying. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, Madam President, I did hear what the interpretator said about the relay button, so I will repeat what I am saying.  I am saying that counsel asked a particular question, and the question elicited another answer all together.  I am objecting to the answer being put on record because it is not the place of this witness to say why Father Athanase Seromba is before this Court.  That is the essence of what this Chamber has come to do.  It is for the Trial Chamber to make a finding.  And it is my view that it is not a finding that the witness may make.  And in that regard, I am objecting to the answer of the witness, since it abrogates the power of the Trial Chamber to make a finding as to why Mr. Seromba is here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I can reassure you, Madam Prosecutor, that we are professional Judges.  We do know exactly what the Chamber is responsible.  But now that the chamber (sic) is extending himself and extending his feelings with us, we do realise that these are only his feelings and nothing further. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I simply wish to ask you to kindly receive as exhibits and admit them, because I need to continue to defend my client, the list that you have which bears the names of persons who were mentioned.  And we would have this as D. 52 -- D. 51. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the part of the Prosecution?  

MS. ALEXIS:
None please, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, may this document then be admitted as exhibit -- as a Defence exhibit under reference D. 51, and will be placed under seal?
 (Exhibit No. D. 51 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, for what I have heard from the witness makes me come to the end of my examination-in-chief.  I thank your Chamber.  And I also wish now to thank the witness for having come to Arusha to help the Defence.  And we wish him a safe return.  

I am down with the witness, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Monthé.  Thank you, Mr. Witness, for having come to testify.  For the time being, you have been only questioned by the Defence.  And as I have said at the beginning of your testimony, you will also be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  And we may also, as Judges, ask you for some clarification.  We remind you that you are still under oath, and that you may not speak with anyone about what has been said here in court.  

We shall now ask that the witness be ushered out of the courtroom. 
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, it has been said that Witness BZ2 is here.  Are you the one to do the examination-in-chief of this witness so that the witness can be brought in?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
No problem, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you have the witness brought into the courtroom please?  

Can you kindly collect the documents from Mr. Monthé because he wants to have them distributed to the Bench?

Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We hope that your baby is feeling better now. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, quite so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We wish the baby a swift recovery.  

Before you answer questions which will be put to you by Mr. Monthé, who will lead you in your examination-in-chief, and you know that after that you will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and the Judges may also have questions for you and there may be re-examination from the Defence as well.  But now, before you answer questions from the Defence, can you kindly take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by the Witness BZ2 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Mr. Monthé, you have the floor.  I think the witness has before her the identification sheet. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President.  Witness BZ2 has, indeed, signed the identification sheet.  And I can have it given back to the chamber because she has signed it.  So could it be admitted as an exhibit under seal as D. 52?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have this identification sheet before you.  Have you checked that all of the information on that sheet is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, everything is correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, what is your -- are you in opposition to the admission of this document as an exhibit?  
MS. ALEXIS:
No, please, Madam President.  I was just waiting to hear the translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Very well.  This document with the identification information of BZ2 is admitted as a Defence exhibit as document D. 52, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 52 admitted, under seal)
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes please, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have the floor, Counsel, for your examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, with your leave I should like to begin with my examination-in-chief of Witness BZ2.
WITNESS BZ2,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, as a witness before this Chamber you are a protected witness.  And under no circumstances may your identity be revealed.  As such, the questions that I put to you, you must avoid specifying the names of places or people which may lead to your identity being disclosed.  I should also ask you to answer my questions precisely.  If my questions do not seem clear to you, please interrupt me and I should kindly rephrase the question.  

Before I begin, I thank you for being here, for accepting to give testimony.  And now I would like to begin and ask you the first question.  Are you ready Witness BZ2? 
A.	I am ready. 
Q.	Thank you.  Please feel at ease; there is no problem with this.  Tell me, what were you doing in the month of April 1994?  Where were you?  Were you staying in Rwanda; please tell us? 
A.	In April 1994 I was a student at the Nyange secondary school.  Yes, I was in Rwanda. 
Q.	At that time in April 1994, were you aware of any extraordinary events that occurred in Rwanda; and if so, which event or events? 
A.	There was an extraordinary event which occurred during that month.  In fact, at that time the president of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, died. 
Q.	How did you learn about President Habyarimana's death? 
A.	I learned about it by listening to Radio France International, at 5 o'clock in the morning they broadcasted the news. 
Q.	According to you, on which day did he die? 
A.	It was in the evening of the 6th. 
Q.	So, you are telling the Chamber that you only learned of the event the next morning, at 5 o'clock in the morning on the 7th; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, very early in the morning. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you learned of the sad news, what was your reaction and that of those around you? 
A.	It was sad news.  We remained quiet, and we waited for what was going to happen next. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness? 
A.	You were waiting for what was going to happen next.  What -- during that time, what happened?  What happened around you following the 7th of April therefore?  
A.	After the 7th, some people began to take Tutsi property and went to harm the Tutsi. 
Q.	When you say "some people" can you be more specific?  Who are you thinking about?  Who do you have in mind? 
A.	I can't tell you their names.  I could hear that in one area, Tutsi homes were burned down.  I also heard about Tutsi's cows that had been killed.  The perpetrators worked at night, so it was very difficult to know exactly who they were. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, can you tell the Chamber, in your opinion, why those people began to kill the cows belonging to Tutsi, and why they began to burn down Tutsi's houses? 
A.	I don't know why they did it.  Those who were involved in such acts were considered bandits? 
Q.	Thank you, do you remember, between the time you learned of the president's death over the radio and the time when the first cow was killed, or you heard about that, how much time went by between those two events? 
A.	The cows were slaughtered about three or four days after the president died. 
Q.	So according to you, that must have been on the 11th of April, correct? 
A.	They began to burn the homes and slaughter Tutsi's cows -- cows belonging to Tutsi, around the 10th. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, all of those attacks against the Tutsis with regard to them, how long did they last, if you can remember? 
A.	It depends on which area you are talking about.  Some people became afraid.  They went to hide their property with their Hutu neighbours.  Those same people also sometimes hid with their neighbours.  You could hear that in various areas members of a family would leave their home to go into hiding.  In a different location you would hear that people did the same thing.  
Q.	When they began to go into hiding, where exactly were you in your region? 
A.	I was in Cyambogo, Nyamuragabiza (phonetic) hill, which is just below the dispensary located there. 
Q.	From that place, could you see any refugee movements? 
A.	From where I was, I saw an old woman; people were leading her to the Catholic Church.  However, the other refugees moved at night, in the dark.  I believe that that person who was moving during the daytime was doing so simply because she was an old woman. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You say that the people went to the church.  Which church are you referring to, be more specific if you can? 
A.	Those people were going towards the Catholic Church located in Nyange. 
Q.	Thank you.  From the hill where you were, were you close to the church or far from it? 
A.	It wasn't far, but between the church and my house there was a valley and a few hills.  It was relatively far, but as the crow flies, it was quite close. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you could see the people moving towards the church; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I only saw, in fact, one refugee.  In fact, that was the old woman I referred to.  Other refugees moved about before daybreak. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, did you go to that church on the regular basis? 
A.	Yes, I went to that church.  In fact, that is where I would go every Sunday to pray. 
Q.	Did you go there on a regular basis in 1994? 
A.	Yes, in 1994 I went to the church on a regular basis. 
Q.	Thank you.  During the time you used to go to that church can you tell the Chamber who the head priest of the church was? 
A.	The priest was called Straton Karenganwa; that was in 1994. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know Karanganwa, the priest?
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Thank you.  During that period, was there any other clergy member or priest at the parish besides Straton? 
A.	Yes, at the time, at that church you also had Father Seromba. 
Q.	Is the Chamber to understand that Father Seromba worked under Father Straton? 
A.	Yes, the head priest was Straton Karanganwa.  Father Seromba had just arrived; he was under Straton's responsibility. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Let's move on now, Witness.  As a believer from that parish, did you have any particular relationship with Father Seromba?  Did you ever see him or visit him at the parish?  
A.	I could see Father Seromba at the school because he was the person who taught me, in fact. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you ever go to any of the masses that Father Seromba gave at church? 
A.	Yes, I did go to some of the masses that he would celebrate. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, Witness, what did the parishioners at Nyange think of                 Athanase Seromba, if you are in a position to tell us? 
A.	He had just arrived, he was new; all the same he was very welcoming.  A poor person could go to see him, and Father Seromba would give a positive reply to the person's request.  He was a man of God who was devoted.  He was a compassionate man. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  During that time, did you ever hear that Father Seromba ever mistreated anyone? 
A.	I never heard such a thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, let me ask you the following:  You learned about the crash of the presidential airplane.  At your house you could see, in front of it, an old woman going towards the parish.  Did you ever leave your house to go near, anywhere near the church?  
A.	One time I went to buy medicine from a pharmacy that was located near the parish. 
Q.	Do you remember the date when you did that? 
A.	I don't recall.  It must have been around the 16th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you tell the Chamber when you went to that pharmacy -- well, first of all, where exactly was that pharmacy?  Where was it located? 
A.	The pharmacy was close to the church at the place that was called Kuishusho. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You went to that pharmacy to buy medicine.  What did you find there when you arrived? 
A.	In fact, I didn't make it to the pharmacy.  As soon as I arrived I could hear people shouting.  They were saying that people were in the process of destroying the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  Before you heard the shouting, were you able to see the area around the pharmacy, or what was going on there, or were you not able to see anything since you were not able to make it all of the way? 
A.	I didn't see anything else. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So you arrived to an area close to the pharmacy, and you said you heard shouting or did you hear some noise?  What was it?  
A.	There was a lot of noise; there were many people.  I turned around and went home. 
Q.	Thank you.  So there were many people, according to you.  Did that crowd seem normal to you, the gathering of people?  Is that something that occurred on a regular basis in your area? 
A.	The gathering was unusual. 
Q.	Did you wonder why the people had gathered into a crowd? 
A.	I asked some of the people on the fringe what was going on.  They said that there was some fighting going on.  Since I had a child back home I turned around and went home. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to know where those people came from, those who had gathered in a crowd? 
A.	There were many people.  Since there was some fighting, I didn't start wondering where they had come from.  I preferred to turn around and go home. 
Q.	Thank you for that information, Witness.  On the way back home -- or once you got home, did you see or did you hear about those people, whether or not they were led by anyone? 
A.	I don't know if anyone was in charge of that group of people.  
Q.	When you saw the crowd before you turned around and went home, what were the people doing? 
A.	Among those people, there were onlookers, and they were a little to the side of the site where the confrontation was taken place.  But those who were closest to me, were just looking on. 
Q.	Thank you.  Apart from the onlookers that you saw, did you see any people carrying weapons in the crowd? 
A.	I told you that the people whom I approached were onlookers, but I didn't see the others. 
Q.	Were you able to know, maybe even if you didn't see, but were you able to tell whether in the area where the crowd was gathered there were some members of the gendarmerie? 
A.	I heard mention made of them afterwards. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you heard mention made of them, were you ever told about what they were doing there? 
A.	People were saying that the gendarmes had come there in order to provide safety and security. 
Q.	Witness BZ2, did you ever get to know whether these gendarme did, indeed, provide safety and security in that location? 
A.	We were told that they were overwhelmed by the situation.  And the gendarmes tried to keep law and order, but given the number of people who had flocked to the area, they were overwhelmed by the situation. 
Q.	Thank you.  Before you went back home, were you able to know whether at the parish there were any members of the clergy present? 
A.	I didn't try to find out whether there were any clergy at the parish; I immediately went back home. 
Q.	Thank you for that answer.  At that point in time, did you wonder whether -- or did you wonder where Father Seromba was? 
A.	No, I didn't wonder about where he was, I didn't ask where he was -- ask myself. 
Q.	Now, you see a crowd gathered, and you hear noises and shouts.  Can you please tell the Chamber what was the noise that you heard? 
A.	I heard people banging on doors and I heard people shouting, so I'm talking about the time when I was in that location. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, let's remain in that place, if you will.  You heard people knocking on doors.  What doors were they knocking on, Witness? 
A.	I wasn't able to tell what doors they were knocking on. 
Q.	Thank you.  Still in that same spot, did you ever get to know or was it ever mentioned what situation the refugees at the church were in at the time? 
A.	I asked that question, and I was told about the fate of the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please share with us what you were told regarding the fate of the refugees? 
A.	I was told that the refugees who were there had been attacked by many people who had come from everywhere, that those refugees had tried to defend themselves in vain, and that they had gone back into the church.  And once they got back into the church, the assailants pursued them, beat up some of the refugees and wounded others. 
Q.	Thank you Witness BZ2.  Do you know a place called Codekoki in this neighbourhood? 
A.	I know that place. 
Q.	Can you kindly tell the Chamber what Codekoki is? 
A.	Codekoki was a cooperative of people from Kivumu.  That cooperative would sell food stuff, clothes and other articles. 
Q.	Thank you for that information.  So, when you saw this crowd on that day, were the -- was the crowd around Codekoki? 
A.	When I came from my home, I took the road that goes towards the convent.  And the nuns whom I found there were near Codekoki. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you were near Codekoki, and there you see onlookers and you see a crowd.  What about the people who were there, were they excited; were they agitated, were they armed? 
A.	Those people who were near Codekoki were unarmed onlookers. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me now, these refugees who were in the church, that you didn't see because they were in the church, did you ever get to know whether the attackers were preparing to launch an attack on the church? 
A.	Since I lived near by the road, from time to time we would see groups of attackers go by; but I do not know whether they were organised near that area, because some of the assailants came from far off hills. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you mention in relation to the assailants that some of them came from far off hills, do you have any names for us regarding from whence they came? 
A.	Yes, I heard mention made of this in particular.  There were assailants from Kibirira commune; others came from Gaseke; this is a region of high mountains.  And it was frequent that we saw groups come from a given area and launch an attack on a different place. 
Q.	Thank you.  From what you heard, and given the people that you saw passing by, were you ever told that these people, who came from the far off hills you have mentioned, had any relationship with   Father Seromba? 
A.	On the basis of the information that I have received, these people had no relationship with            Father Seromba.  In fact, these people from Kibirira came to this place so that they could loot property, in particular, cows and other kinds of property. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to counsel, please. 
(Pages 57 to 66 by Donna M. Lewis)
















1745H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, your microphone is on.
MS. ALEXIS:
My apologies.  I forgot to take it off.  I was getting up to object and I thought better of it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ2, I want you to tell this Chamber, please, under what circumstances you got to know about the destruction of Nyange church, which was your church?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, perhaps I have missed this bit of evidence, but I don't remember this witness explicitly saying before this Trial Chamber here this afternoon that she got to know about the destruction of the church.  She spoke about attacks. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I can answer.  The witness in his statement -- in her statement of 3rd December 2004 mentions on page 3, at paragraph -- 
MS. ALEXIS:
Might I object strongly.  If Counsel -- there are certain ways counsel may bring -- Madam President, allow me to confuse myself.  I am so moved by what Counsel has just done.  Madam President, Counsel cannot read from a statement and say what the witness is meant to say.  That is, in fact, prompting the witness.  What I have said is that the witness did not speak about the destruction of the church here this afternoon before this Chamber.  I object to Counsel reading from the statement and prompting the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, by your leave, we normally have the habit of allowing the other person to complete his or her sentence or idea.  I was interrupted, therefore, I was unable to tell you what you wanted to hear.  What I'm trying to do is to go about an examination in-chief and I am doing this under the control of the Chamber on the basis of documents which have been disclosed and I have been reproached for several days for having failed to disclose the same. 

Now, I'm asking Witness BZ2 -- and the question is very simple.  I'm asking, "Under what circumstances did you hear of the destruction of the church?"  There is an objection saying that the witness has not said that this afternoon.  I didn't say that this afternoon the witness had made reference to this, but in her statement of the 3rd December which you have, she mentioned this incident, and, therefore, I have covered grounds to mention this because this is on the table, and this statement goes along with what the Defence is asking or trying to ask the witness, and I cannot be stopped from asking that question.  No way.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, would you want to add anything to what you've already said?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Very briefly, Madam President.  I will (sic) not believe that the Court was repeating anything I said.  I merely wish to say that the question, as asked by the Defence, assumes that the witness was -- that the witness had spoken about the events at the church, that the church had been destroyed.  The question, as posed to the witness, Madam President, said that, if I remember correctly, to the effect of, "When did you know," or, "How did you get to know of the destruction of the church?"  Whereas this witness never mentioned the destruction of the church at all.  So in this proceedings this afternoon, the first time we hear anything about the destruction of the church is in the question of counsel.  Counsel did not ask this witness, "When you got to the church what, if anything, did you see happening to the church?"  He merely launched into this issue of the destruction of the church and then uses what may or may not be in the statement as a basis.  He may not use what is in the statement as a basis, but he has to use what has been given in evidence thus far as a basis, and that is why I maintain my objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, the objection is sustained.  Can you move on to another question, or can you approach the question in a different manner, from a different angle. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ2, did you get to know that your church in Nyange was going to be destroyed? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber under what circumstances you got to hear of this? 
A.	I told you that, at a point in time, I went to look for medicine for my child, and I was standing near the Codekoki building and I heard people knock on doors to a building.  Later on, when I asked what that noise was all about, I was told that the church had been destroyed, and that a bulldozer had been used to destroy that church. 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Now that you know that the church was destroyed, and that a bulldozer was used to destroy it, did you ever get to know under what circumstances the church was destroyed? 
A.	Yes.  I heard people say that the bulldozer started off with one side and, once that wall had fallen, the next wall was continued with until the whole church was destroyed. 
Q.	From what people were saying, did you get to know how long the demolition of the church took? 
A.	No.  I didn't get to know how long it took for the whole church to be destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  From what you heard concerning the destruction of the church, were you told whether Father Seromba was there while the church was being destroyed? 
A.	From the information I received on that issue, they did not say that Father Seromba was there. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, was there only one bulldozer when the church was being destroyed? 
A.	From what I heard, only one bulldozer was used. 
Q.	Did you get to know, when the bulldozer was destroying the church, which parts of the church were destroyed first? 
A.	I do not know which were the first parts to be destroyed.  What I know is that people said that the last part of that building which was demolished was the bell tower, because it's the bell tower that last fell. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  From what you heard, were you told whether the destruction of the church was ordered by anyone? 
A.	No.  I never heard it said that someone had ordered that the church be destroyed. 
Q.	I want to ask you whether you were told that Father Seromba had ordered the destruction of that church.  
A.	No, I was never told any such thing. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Were you told whether, when the church was being destroyed, Father Seromba was in the premises? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She has already answered that question, Counsel. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Madam Witness, if you've already answered that question, let's proceed.  I now want to ask you the following:   When the church was destroyed, you went back home.  Did you have the opportunity to find out what was happening in the neighbourhood?  What was the reaction of the local inhabitants? 
A.	I didn't remain in the location until the whole church was destroyed.  When I left the area, the church was still being destroyed.  Now, as for the local inhabitants, you know, there were mixed reactions.  There were some people who were saying that this was a terrible act because there were people who had been killed in the church.  Others had said that destroying a religious building, in this instance a church, was tantamount to sacrilege. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  Did you ever get to know whether, at the parish, during these events, apart from Father Seromba, other clergymen or members of the clergy were also present? 
A.	Later on I got to know that during that period of time there was also seminaries from the major seminary who was known as Apolinaire. 
Q.	Apart from that, seminaries from the major seminary, were there any other members of the clergy present? 
A.	Yes, I also got to know that Father Nturiye and Father Kayiranga were also present on the spot. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know Father Nturiye? 
A.	Yes, I knew Father Nturiye. 
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber under what circumstances you met him? 
A.	Father Nturiye was a native of Kivumu.  Often when he came to visit the parents or when he came to visit the parish, I got to know him.  Those were the circumstances under which I got to know him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ2.  What about Father Jean François Emmanuel Kayiranga.  Did you know him? 
A.	Yes, I also knew Father Kayiranga.  He, too, at a given point in time, lived at that parish and he would say the mass at that parish. 
Q.	So you think you knew him? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you ever get to know whether these clergymen were ever in any relationship whatsoever with the people who attacked the church? 
A.	No.  I never heard any such thing. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I can see that the time -- the clock is calling us to order.  I would like to request you to interrupt my examination in-chief here to resume at your convenience when the Tribunal will resume its activities.  Madam President, here and now, I wish to thank you for your patience, as well as your colleagues.  I also wish to thank Witness BZ2, wishing her and whomever it may concern a speedy recovery.  Madam President, when the witness will have left the courtroom, I would like to say one thing on a procedural matter affecting this trial. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  We thank you, Madam Witness.  You have not completed with the examination in-chief.  Consequently, you will be returning on Monday for that examination in-chief to be concluded.  We wish you a good evening and can the witness be ushered out of the courtroom please.  Thank you.  
(Pages 67 to 70 by Jennifer Spring)












1800H
THE WITNESS:  
Madam President, I would like to ask whether I am authorised to greet the holy father.  This is someone with whom I lived.  He is from my parish.  I don't know if I can be allowed to greet him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, sincerely we apologise.  In fact, other witnesses have asked the same thing.  We had to tell them that this is not the forum for such things.  You cannot do that in the courtroom.  Perhaps later on counsel will file a motion to the appropriate authority granting you permission to greet       Father Seromba.  That is what I have to tell you with regard to your request, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, I hope that you're going to be brief.  We are going to have to release the interpreters at some point. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, I will be brief and I am fully aware of the patience the interpreters have shown.  I simply wanted to indicate to your Chamber -- no one has said this yet -- that the Defence has met its obligations completely and so Monday I don't want to be told otherwise.  I simply want to be very brief and indicate that to the Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber notes what you've said.  We have received the documents.  Perhaps the Prosecution will have to confirm whether or not they have received the documents.  At any rate, we confirm and take note that you have met your obligations fully.  That is an excellent thing. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I've been told that the names of the witnesses do not figure on the statements. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I had a problem with my headset and I could not hear what you said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I was saying, according to the information I've been given, and I haven't been able to verify this quite yet, it seems that they are redacted statements. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, not to my knowledge, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
They are unredacted statements, those statements with which you disclosed the identity of the witnesses?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, they are not redacted, to my knowledge, Madam President.  That means that there are some portions of the text that is covered.  That is not the case, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are also talking about the names, the names of the witnesses -- the names and identities of the witnesses.  Of course, the Prosecution must respect the confidentiality of that information.  There's no problem. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
What I've seen is that earlier during this hearing I received 10 documents, and I only have pseudonyms, CNO, et cetera, et cetera.  I am permanently having difficulty with this.  As for my part, I did exactly what the Chamber ordered me to do.  You told me to be brief.  I think that I was brief, and I thank you for that, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we don't hold the interpreters for too long, perhaps we can discuss this matter later.  We shall meet here for five or so minutes.  Thank you.

Yes, according to the information we have, we shall resume Monday at 2 p.m.  I'm being told that it will not be 2 p.m. but, rather, 2:30 p.m. on Monday.  These proceedings are adjourned, and we shall meet the parties here for five minutes.  Have a good evening and a nice break. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, may we take off our robes when we meet you, because we won't be at trial any more.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, you can do as you wish, but we, the Bench, will not remove our robes, as we don't have the facilities to do so here, but we will meet immediately after this hearing.  Good evening to all.
