MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe it's Mr. Monthé who is still going to continue with his examination-in-chief because he did not complete that process yesterday.  We wish to remind you that you are still under oath. 

Mr. Monthé, your witness for the continuation of his cross-examination, and we are dealing with Witness BZ8. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, I wish first to apologise to the Office of the Prosecutor and inform the Bench that the next witness will not be FE36 as I had announced earlier, but CF14.  As I have said, he is having some problems in terms of his recovery.  Thank you.  
WITNESS BZ8,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good afternoon, BZ8.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, we believe that the witness is on the French channel.  Can that be verified with the witness, please?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you please make that verification, please. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I also wish to request you to have the registry come to me for some documents which I wish to use during my examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ8, are you ready for my cross-examination -- my examination-in-chief of you this afternoon? 
A.	Yes, I am.  I'm quite ready. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, as far as I recall, when we adjourned yesterday we had together gone through the destruction of the church and you had told me that you were very saddened by that incident; do you recall? 
A.	Yes, I remember very well. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, I wish to go back with you briefly on some issues that we covered yesterday, but I want you to be more precise than you were yesterday in your answers.  I want us to go back to the chronology of events as recounted by you.  You testified that, as far as you were concerned, the events that you witnessed took place around the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th.  Do you stand by those dates? 
A.	I testified that I had given you those dates, but that I was not very sure of those dates.  Consequently, I wouldn't say that those dates are exact necessarily.  This was an estimate I was giving you. 
Q.	Yes, thank you very much, Witness BZ8.  Witness, I also want you to clarify a point for me dealing with the destruction of the church.  Some people have claimed that the church was destroyed during one day, and you say that the destruction took place over two days, first involving the walls and the second part involving the bell tower.  Can you confirm that for me? 
A.	You see, it's a long time since those incidents took place, and when those events actually took place, no one believed that they would have to recount that story at any point in time.  If somewhere in my testimony I have made a mistake, it would be because of those circumstances I have just mentioned. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, I see you're on your feet. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Certainly, Madam President.  Madam President, I have been listening with deep interest at these last two questions of my learned friend.  It appears to me that these questions are the sort of questions that perhaps would best have been asked in cross-examination.  They are not proper questions in examination-in-chief.  The witness has given evidence.  The witness has said -- and I'm not disputing the witness's evidence at all.  The witness has said that the destruction of the church took place over the course of two days.  That was his evidence.  That was his evidence in his statements. That was his evidence that he gave before this Trial Chamber yesterday.  For counsel now to come and ask, well, to come and state to the witness that, "Some have said that the church was destroyed over one day, but you say it was destroyed over two days, is this so," is, in effect, giving the witness an opportunity to retract both what he said yesterday and what he said in his statements to the Defence investigators in examination-in-chief, and, if that is the course of the conduct that counsel proposes to take, I must place on record my objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé.  What do you say to that?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I think it will soon be Christmas and I think that I will be inviting the Prosecution to take over my cloak during cross-examination.  But, Madam President, Your Honours, I believe I can ask questions of this witness regarding what has not been clear in his testimony, and this doesn't mean that we are going back on statements which we already have on this file, or anything to do with the testimony he's providing.  It is quite appropriate for me to ask him if he is certain of the dates, because he seemed to be hesitant, and I think that is quite in order.  I can come to re-examination, so if I have any points to come back to, maybe I can do that then.  That would be my observation, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Monthé. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ8, I believe you testified that ******************************** in the neighbourhood of the parish, is that correct? 
A.	The shop was not in the neighbourhood of the parish.  It was about one kilometre away from the parish.  That's where the shop was located. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Since you were a kilometre away from the parish, were you able to determine whether, at that parish, there were any Tutsi employees in service? 
A.	I was not in the habit of interfering in the affairs of the priests or the operations of that institution.  I would merely go to Mass at the parish and that was all.  I didn't acquaint myself with any other activities that went on there. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness BZ8.  Were you able to get to know, during your visits to the parish, whether per chance some parishioners confided in you to say that Father Seromba was anti-Tutsi, or did you get to hear anybody say anything to that effect? 
A.	I didn't hear anything of the sort. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, according to you, what is the authority that an ordinary Rwandan citizen that could be you or myself, if I were Rwandan, what kind of authority would one attribute to a clergyman in your country? 
A.	Within the commune, a priest has no authority.  At commune level, it's rather the bourgmestre, and people like the criminal investigation officers who constitute a form of authority in the commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Witness BZ8, do you remember who was the bourgmestre in your commune in 1994? 
A.	His name was Grégoire. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness BZ8, can you tell me from what you know, what was Father Seromba's reputation among the parishioners who attended Nyange church? 
A.	Father Seromba had a good reputation amongst the parishioners of Nyange parish. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, I want to know whether, in your comings and goings to and from the parish, you ever got to know whether there was, or there had been, any refugees at the presbytery.  Did you hear any mention made of that? 
A.	I did hear mention being made of that, but I personally did not enter the presbytery. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  Witness, I now want to ask you to kindly look at the sheet of paper before you.  You will see that there are names of persons on that list.  Some of the names have numbers against them, and the numbers run from 1 to 5.  For those names, I will merely refer to the number when I'm going to ask you questions that correspond to that name.  For those names without a number, I shall mention those names out, asking you whether you ever got to meet these people.  So let me begin, Witness BZ8, with the first name which is that of Fulgence Kayishema.  Do you know that individual? 
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Did you meet that person often during the events? 
A.	He was always there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let me move on to the second name, Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  Does that name ring a bell? 
A.	Yes, I know this person. 
Q.	Was he present in Nyange at the time of the events that you have recounted?
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I didn't hear the answer from the witness, and the interpretation came through as "no". 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Did you get to know of Thélesphore Ndungutse? 
A.	I did not know that person very well. 
Q.	Witness BZ8.  I am now going to refer to number 1.  Did you know this person under number 1, or did you ever hear mention made of him? 
A.	I know that person. 
Q.	Can you please tell us whether you saw him during the events that you have recounted, and that took place at Nyange parish?  
A.	No, that person wasn't there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let's move on to number 2, BZ8.  Does that name ring any bell to you? 
A.	I do not know this person. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  What about Number 3, does that name ring any bell? 
A.	I do not know this individual. 
Q.	Number 4, does that name remind you of anyone? 
A.	I do not know this person. 
Q.	Number 5, Witness BZ8; does that name ring a bell? 
A.	I do not know this person. 
Q.	Witness BZ8, I'm going to come to an end of my close -- examination-in-chief by asking you this question:   Did you ever hear mention made of the fact that Father Seromba was ever with the assailants, the attackers, or was ever with them? 
A.	No.  I did not see him, and I didn't hear anyone mention him. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ8.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, given those questions, I want to come to the close of my examination-in-chief of Witness BZ8, and I would wish that you accept as a Defence Exhibit P. 56 -- D. 56 this document which we have been dealing with.  Madam President, Your Honours, these are the questions that I wanted to put to this witness, and I thank him sincerely for having taken the trouble for having come up to Arusha for that purpose.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Monthé.

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objections to the admission of this document as a Defence Exhibit?  
MS. ALEXIS:
No, please, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Therefore, this document is admitted as Defence Exhibit -- as a Defence Exhibit under reference D, as in delta, 56, and it shall be placed under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 56 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the floor's yours now for the cross-examination of this witness. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	You spoke to the Defence investigators in December 2004 about this matter, didn't you? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, Witness, isn't it true that you gave two statements; one in December 2004, and the other in March 2005? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And you would agree with me, Witness, that you gave these two statements voluntarily? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And you would agree with me, Witness, that you did not give those statements under stressful circumstances; for instance, you were not in a court; you were just giving a statement, isn't that so? 
A.	That's right.  I was not in court when I gave those statements. 
Q.	You would agree with me, Witness, that in December 2004, your memory was a little better about the events at Nyange than the way your memory is now, which is almost 11 months later.  
A.	No, nothing has changed regarding the quality of my memory regarding what happened. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Therefore, am I to understand you that, whatever you remembered -- well, before I ask you that question, would you agree with me that, in March 2005 this year, that your memory of the events at Nyange was better than your memory is at this moment on the events of Nyange? 
A.	I remember the same facts.  Whether it was in March or now, I still have the same memory. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you said you saw refugees go into the communal office on April 10th.  Do you recall giving that evidence? 
A.	Yes, I did say so, but I added that I was not sure of the date.  I was not sure of the exact date.  The same applies to the other dates which I mentioned. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping).  Witness, where were you, if you recall, when you first saw these refugees on or around the 10th of April 1994? 
A.	By then I was ****************shop. 
Q.	Is ***********shop close to the communal office, or can you see the communal office from ********* shop? 
A.	Since the insecurity was mounting, and I used to close ********from time to time and move about.  But as far as the location of the shop is concerned, it was by the side of the road.  Some refugees used to pass by there, beside **************************. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, but can you answer my question please.  Can you see -- were you able, in April 1994, to see the communal office if you *******************************
A.	No, I had -- I could not see the communal office from********.  But I added that, because of insecurity that was mounting, I would close ********************shop from time to time. 
Q.	I suppose, Witness, that, because of the mounting insecurity, when you ************shop around this time, that is, the 10th of April 1994, that you would have gone to your home; is this so? 
A.	No, that's not correct.  That's not what I stated. 
Q.	Witness, can you see -- well, sorry.  In April 1994, were you then able to see the communal office from the place where you lived? 
A.	No.  I said that I used to move about. 
Q.	Approximately -- and Witness, when I ask you for a number or a date, I am not asking you to give me a specific number.  I am asking you to assist us with an approximate number.  My question is this:   Around the 10th of April 1994, approximately how many refugees did you see? 
A.	I never -- really, I never counted them. 
Q.	Can you assist us with if you saw, let's see, five, ten, did you see more than 20?  Assist us.  I'm not asking for an exact figure. 
A.	No.  I never took -- made any efforts to count.  I was interested in doing my work.  I would not count the number of people who were passing by. 
Q.	But Witness, wasn't it just your evidence that, because of the insecurity at this time, that you had closed ****************************
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor.  I said so.  But I said that ******shop was located just by the roadside.  When I say that I -- at one point in time *************** shop, it was because I used to go around to see what was happening.  That's how I saw the people who were passing by. 
Q.	You did say, Witness, didn't you, a little while ago, that you saw the refugees when you were at your place of work, didn't you? 
A.	I said that I saw some of the refugees who passed by ***********shop.  And I added that, because of the insecurity -- because of insecurity, ************************* from time to time and move around with some of the people. 
Q.	When you had***********************, I take it, therefore, that no one would come to purchase anything at this shop, is that so? 
A.	Yes.  Nobody would come to the shop when it was closed. 
Q.	Is it therefore your evidence, Witness, that you are unable to remember or to assist this court as to approximately how many refugees you saw? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I'm sorry, I do not have any figures to give you. 
Q.	Since you said, Witness, that you saw these refugees when you were at your place of work, would you agree with me that you did not see these refugees actually leaving their homes? 
A.	When those refugees were leaving their homes, I did not see them. 
Q.	When these refugees were leaving their homes, the insecurity in your commune, it had already started, isn't that so? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	So these refugees you saw, they must have been leaving at night to avoid the insecurity; would you agree with that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness, your microphone, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
A.	Madam Prosecutor, those refugees were moving during the day. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	What time of the day did you see those refugees, Witness, if you can assist us? 
A.	I do not remember what time it was, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Was it before lunch time, or was it after lunch time? 
A.	Well, some of them were moving in the afternoon, others moved during the mornings.  However, I cannot specify the exact hour or time. 
Q.	Am I correct in understanding, Witness, that around the 10th of April 1994, when you saw the refugees, you did not at that time go to the communal office yourself, am I correct? 
A.	I said that, because of insecurity, ***************** from time to time, and I went to -- to see what was happening. 
Q.	However, Witness, if you may, answer my question:   Around the 10th of April 1994, did you go to the communal office? 
A.	No.  I never went to the communal office before the 10th. 
Q.	After the 10th of April 1994, and still in the month, so the 11th of April 1994 to the end of April 1994, did you ever go to the communal office yourself? 
A.	I said that on the 13th, or around the 13th and 14th, because I'm not very sure of the exact dates because of the time that has lapsed, I went to the parish. 
Q.	On the 11th of April to the end of April 1994, did you, Witness, go to the communal office?  I am not speaking about the parish.  
A.	No.  I never went to the communal office during the month of April.  However, I would like to specify that I went there before the 13th. 
Q.	Witness, I'm not sure I understand your evidence.  I meant to go on, but I'm not sure I understand your evidence.  You said, Witness, that before the 10th you never went -- in April, you did not go to the communal office.  Was that your evidence? 
A.	I never went to the communal office before the 10th. 
Q.	And after the 10th to the end of April, you never went to the communal office, is that your evidence?  Am I understanding you? 
A.	I said that, between the 10th and the 13th, I used to go to the communal office, but I never went back there after the 13th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, too. 
Q.	However, Witness, when you first went to the church on the first day of the attack, there were hundreds of refugees present, isn't that so? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I don't know the number of refugees that were there. 
Q.	But you would agree with me that there were many -- very many refugees present then? 
A.	Yes.  There were refugees at the parish, but I cannot tell the number. 
Q.	On that day, Witness, the day when you said there was the first attack, can you tell us approximately what time you arrived at Nyange? 
A.	I arrived at the parish in the morning. 
Q.	And did you spend all day there at the parish looking at the events? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, approximately what time you left the parish on that first day of the attack? 
A.	I'm not sure of the time. 
Q.	When you left on the first day of the attack, was it already dark, or was it still daylight? 
A.	It was beginning to get dark. 
Q.	I would therefore imagine, Witness, that since this was a time of insecurity and it was beginning to get dark, that you would have gone to your home, is that so? 
A.	Yes, I went home. 
Q.	Did you go to the refugee -- sorry, did you go to the communal office on the first day of the attack? 
A.	No. 
Q.	On the day before the first attack, did you go to the communal office? 
A.	No, I didn't. 
Q.	When you said, Witness, in your evidence, that you saw the refugees go into the communal office on the 10th of April, or around the 10th of April 1994, someone told you that the refugees were going to the communal office.  You, yourself, didn't see the refugees walk into the communal office, isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	No, nobody told me about it. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that around this same time, that is, the 10th of April 1994, that some Tutsis, who were influential in the commune, were transported by car to the commune; would you agree with me? 
A.	They went there on their own.  Nobody took them to the communal office.  Those who owned vehicles went in their vehicles. 
Q.	Do you agree with me, Witness, that, to be more specific, some Tutsis who were influential were transported by car to the commune, and this was done to protect them from nuisances in the village.  Would you agree with me that that happened? 
A.	Those who had vehicles left on their own, on their own initiative. 
Q.	I'm not sure what is your response, Witness.  Do you agree with me or not?  Is it your evidence that no Tutsis were transported? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, no one brought those Tutsis to the communal office.  They left on their own. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might the interpreters assist me in reading a portion of the witness's statement?  It is the statement of the 3rd of December 2004.  I'm looking at the French version, and it is page 3 of the French version, and it is the first two paragraphs on that page, and it begins with -- the first paragraph begins with "Vers" and the second paragraph ends with "Colline".  
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, since, according to you now, no Tutsi was transported, is it your evidence that you never said to the Defence investigators that some influential Tutsis were transported? 
A.	I said that Tutsis who had vehicles got into their vehicles.  Nobody forced them to do it.  They left on their own. 
Q.	So, do you agree with me, Witness, that you never told the Defence investigators that some influential Tutsis were transported to the commune? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I believe there is a problem here with regard to the -- the sending of the text, and obviously language as well.  The witness says the following:   "On around the 10th of April 1994 the Tutsis, who were influential in the commune, were transported by car."  That does not mean at all that there is a difference between what he says today and what he said in the statement.  There is no difference with regard to their willingness to go.  We are not going to have a syntax lesson here, Madam President. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I must take the novel approach of objecting to my friend's objection.  It is not my friend's place, with the greatest of respect to my learned friend, to interpret the statement of the witness, in the presence of the witness, and to tell the Court what the witness meant or what he did not mean.  I am not inventing evidence, and I am not inventing the words of the statement.  It is my responsibility to put to the witness the bear facts of the statement.  If counsel disagrees, it is open to him to do so.  It is open to him to take a contrary view.  It is not open to him, Madam President, in my view, before I complete the matter, to attempt to interpret the statement of the witness in open Court. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, earlier you asked that the two first paragraphs be read.  Mr. Monthé started to read part of the first paragraph.  Do you have a question for the witness with regard to these two paragraphs, and do you still want the two paragraphs to be read out?  
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President.  I merely had wished to be completely fair to the witness.  I wanted -- before I went to the statement; I wanted to suggest the contents thereof to him in order to give him a fair opportunity to respond.  Now that he has, I would now ask that the interpreters read the two paragraphs that I have indicated to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Interpreters, could you kindly read the two paragraphs?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
 "On around the 10th," and it says "14th".  In fact, it's the 4th -- "10 April 1994".  "On around the 10th of April 1994, influential Tutsis in the commune were brought by car towards the commune office, and then later they went to the parish.  The less fortunate went at night on foot.  Let me point out that these people went there freely.  Those who were brought by car, it was a way to protect them so that they could avoid problems in the hills."

End of paragraph.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Interpreters. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, have you heard -- now, listen carefully.  I'm not asking you yet to comment.  Did you hear what was read by the interpreters from your statement, "yes" or "no"? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I did hear the interpreters read the paragraphs. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you hear that, from your statement, that you said to the Defence investigators that some influential Tutsis were transported by vehicle to the commune, and you went on to add that this was done for their own protection?  Did you hear that? 
A.	I heard it, but I don't believe the investigators understood clearly, otherwise the Tutsis left on their own, in their own vehicles. 
Q.	So, is it your evidence, Witness, that you said one thing to the investigators, and that the investigators wrote something else on the statement.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	They took down what I said; however, here, I don't know why they wrote it this way. 
Q.	Did you sign those two statements that you gave to the Defence investigators, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  We will move on from that topic, Witness.  Witness, when the refugees first arrived at church, that is, at Nyange parish church, were you amongst the welcoming committee that welcomed them to Nyange parish church? 
A.	No. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, Witness, isn't it true that you were not at Nyange parish church when the refugees first arrived there? 
A.	I was not there. 
Q.	So wouldn't you agree with me, Witness, that you, yourself, did not witness how the refugees were welcomed, or if they were welcomed at all, at Nyange parish when they first arrived? 
A.	Personally, I did not see that with my own eyes.  
Q.	Witness, we have spoken already -- we have started to speak already about the first day of the attack.  On that day, do I understand your evidence to have been that you were some distance away from the attackers?  Was that your evidence? 
A.	I was not among the attackers.  I should point out, however, that I was not far from them. 
Q.	But you were around the area of the Nyange commercial district, weren't you? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I was there. 
Q.	Did you answer my question, Witness?  Were you -- you said you were there?  Were you at the Nyange commercial centre? 
A.	I didn't remain in one place.  I moved around to see how events were unfolding. 
Q.	On that day, Witness, the first day of the attack, when you arrived there, were the attackers already there? 
A.	Yes.  I found them on site. 
Q.	Did you see Kayishema, the criminal investigations official, at the church on that day; that is, the first day of the attack? 
A.	I didn't see him during the first attack. 
Q.	You said you knew -- just a minute.  Witness, Thélesphore Ndungutse; you had said that you did not know him very well, if I understood your evidence.  Did you know him at all?  I wasn't very sure.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I did not know Thélesphore Ndungutse. 
Q.	Did you know of him?  Did you ever hear his name before April 1994? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Aside from Kayishema, you do not know whether any other authorities were present at the church on the first day of the attack, do you? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I only saw Kayishema during the second attack. 
Q.	You said, Witness, that when you arrived on that first day of the attack, that the attackers were already there.  My question, now, is this:   Had the attackers already started attacking the refugees when you arrived on the first day? 
A.	They went up to the church where the people had taken refuge.  Upon their arrival, the refugees resisted and pushed the assailants back.  The assailants, in fact, were defeated.  After that defeat, the assailants stopped their attack on the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, but my question is this:   That attack that you just gave us information about, that you just told us about, when you arrived at the church on that first day, did you see the beginning of that attack, or is it that when you arrived, the attack had already started? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I was there when the attack began. 
Q.	When the attack began, Witness BZ8, that is, when the attackers first started to throw stones at the refugees, if you recall, can you tell us exactly where you were, if you recall? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please.  Madam Prosecutor, we're a bit lost.  You started talking about the first attack, and then the second.  Which one are you talking about now, the first or second?  You need to be a bit more specific so that we're able to follow. 
MS. ALEXIS:
My apologies, Madam President, and to the Court.  I am speaking of the first attack.  To be fair to the witness, perhaps I shall repeat the question. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	On the first day of the attack, when the attackers, you said, began to attack the refugees, if you recall, can you tell us exactly where you were? 
A.	I told you that I didn't stay in one place.  I moved around, here to there. 
Q.	But in any event, Witness, you would agree with me that you were not -- well, since you were not a part of the attack -- but you were not in the midst of the attackers whilst the attacks were going on, isn't that so? 
A.	I was not among them. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going now to the second day.  I'm going now to the second day, that is, on the day, according to you, when there was the second attack.  On this day, Witness, you returned to see what was going on at the church, isn't that so? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, approximately, approximately, what time did you arrive on that second day of the attack? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I don't remember the times. 
Q.	Did you arrive before lunch or after lunch? 
A.	I arrived in the morning. 
Q.	On this day, Witness, the second day of the attack, were there more attackers than on the first day? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were you present when the machine arrived? 
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor, I was there. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, approximately, I only want an estimate, around what time did this machine arrive? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I don't remember the times.  I didn't have a watch on me. 
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that you did not then know who the driver of that machine was, isn't that true? 
A.	I didn't know the person.  I didn't stay at one place.  I moved around. 
Q.	As well, Witness, since you were moving around, isn't it true that you do not know specifically who decided to have that machine brought to the parish, isn't that so? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I did not know the person in question. 
Q.	You were around 19 or 20 years old in April 1994, weren't you? 
A.	I was 20. 
Q.	So is it fair to say, Witness, that you were not at that age amongst the decision-makers or authorities of the commune? 
A.	I was not a member of the decision committee. 
Q.	Is it your evidence, Witness, that it was on this day, that is, the day of the second attack, that you saw Kayishema? 
A.	Yes, that was the day I saw Kayishema. 
Q.	And, according to your evidence, Witness, the bell tower was destroyed last, isn't that so, according to your evidence? 
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor, that was my statement. 
Q.	It was also your evidence, Witness, that on the -- whilst the bell tower was still standing, that some attackers remained at the church during that night, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes.  That was my evidence, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	And it was also your evidence, wasn't it, Witness, that the bell tower was destroyed on the next day.  Isn't that what you said? 
A.	Such was my statement, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, later on in your evidence you went on to say that the incidents had taken place -- well, let me rephrase, please.  Later on in your evidence, when counsel for Athanase Seromba told you that some persons had said the church was destroyed in one day, and that you said it was destroyed in two days, you said that the incidents had taken place a long time (sic).  Is that what you said, Witness? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, at the very beginning I said that those events took place a long time ago, and so I might make a mistake, not meaning to, of course.  What I do know is that the events took place while I was there. 
Q.	Of course, Witness.  I am not saying to you that you have purposefully misled us; however, Witness, my next question is this:   When you said that the church was destroyed over the course of two days, was that a mistake? 
A.	It wasn't a mistake.  I was not mistaken. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, on the day, according to you, when the bell tower was destroyed, did you see Kayishema on that day? 
A.	Kayishema was there. 
Q.	On that day, Witness, which, according to you, is the last day of the destruction of the church, did you see Grégoire Ndahimana? 
A.	No. 
Q.	As the bourgmestre, Ndahimana was the highest communal official, wasn't he? 
A.	Yes, Grégoire was the bourgmestre. 
Q.	Witness, you have said on several occasions that your recollection of dates in this matter, that it is not perfect.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	I do.  I said that every time I mentioned a date, it's an estimate.  I can't be too specific. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, would you agree with me that you can also be mistaken about the sequence of events, or about the order of the events? 
A.	No.  I did not forget the order or sequence of events. 
Q.	When you went -- well, before I move on, Witness, is it your evidence, since you're sure that you remember the order of the events, is it your evidence that you went to the church on three days, three consecutive days, to see the attacks and the destruction of the church; is that your evidence? 
A.	You mentioned three days?  No.  I was there on the 13th and the 14th.  Of course, that's an estimate with regard to those specific dates, and then I returned on the 15th, later. 
Q.	Okay, Witness.  I take it, therefore, that you are agreeing with me that for those three days, that you have pointed out to be approximately the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th, that you went to the church? 
A.	Yes, I went there. 
Q.	And on all three days, Witness, that is, according to you, approximately the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th, on all three days, you went to the church only as a spectator, do you agree with me? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  I went there as an onlooker. 
Q.	And on all three days whilst you were an onlooker, the attacks were taking place, isn't that true? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, Witness, it would have been a dangerous time whilst you were at that church on the 13th, 14th, and 15th, wouldn't you agree with me? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  Can you please repeat it for me?
Q.	Okay.  I will.  On all three days, and I am speaking of the three days that you mentioned, which you said could be around the 13th, 14th, and 15th, my question is this:   On all those three days whilst you were there at the church as an onlooker, it was a very dangerous situation; would you agree with me?  There were attacks, the church was being destroyed; it was a dangerous situation, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is true, apart from the fact that the confrontation was only between the refugees and the attackers. 
Q.	By the last day, and that is, when I say "the last day", I am talking from your evidence on the day on which the bell tower was destroyed.  On the last day of the destruction of the church, were there many attackers? 
A.	Yes, they were still there. 
Q.	On that day, Witness, did you see refugees die; that is, on the day when the bell tower fell, according to you? 
A.	Yes, they were being killed.  The refugees were being killed. 
Q.	On this last day, Witness, can you assist us approximately what time the bell tower fell? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I do not recall the time. 
Q.	Witness, on this last day, that is, the day when the bell tower fell, can you tell us approximately how long did you spend at Nyange on that day, approximately? 
A.	I don't remember very well. 
Q.	Can you give us any assistance?  When you left, was it still daylight, or was it already night-time? 
A.	When I left the place, it was still daylight. 
Q.	Witness, on that -- on those days when you went to Nyange, and I'm speaking of the three days you spoke of, approximately the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th, you did not go there at this time to look for authorities, would you agree with that? 
A.	Yes, that's true.  I didn't go there for that purpose. 
Q.	And, as a matter of fact, Witness, you -- well, you had said that Athanase Seromba, he was the only priest present in April 1994, even if you did not see him at the destruction of the church.  Do you recall saying that? 
A.	I testified that, when the church was being destroyed, he was the only priest present at the parish. 
Q.	On those three days of the events at Nyange, approximately, according to you, the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th, you did not go to Nyange to look for Athanase Seromba or looking to see if you saw him there, isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	No, I didn't go to check on whether he was present or not.  But, when I arrived there, I didn't stay in one spot.  I was moving about in all the areas there. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, these are all my questions for this witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you. 

Does the Defence have any intent to re-examine this witness?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No, Madam President.  The Defence will not move into a re-examination of the witness, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Chamber.  We thank you for having come to testify, and for having answered the questions that were put to you.  We wish you a safe journey back home. 
THE WITNESS:
I had something to say to the Chamber.  I am requesting for permission to be able to meet with Father Seromba. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is a request which has been made by almost all those witnesses which came before you here.  I believe Mr. Monthé can explain to you the procedure to be followed in this instance. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President.  The request made by the previous witnesses have been -- have been met with satisfaction, and BZ8 will also have his answer satisfactorily. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You have heard what you have been told. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, quite so.  I understand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, and goodbye. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, your next witness is, indeed, CF14?  

Yes, Mr. Nekuie?
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, quite so, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please have ushered in Witness CF14?  
(Witness CF14 entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness CF14. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected Defence witness; therefore, we shall refer to you here using the pseudonym CF14.  Please avoid giving any information which may reveal your identity.  You will be examined in-chief by the Defence, and then cross-examined by the Prosecution, and there may be questions from the Judges, or re-examination by the Defence.  Before you answer any questions, we request you to kindly take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness CF14 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness. 

Mr. Nekuie, are you the one to examine this witness in-chief?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes.  Absolutely, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, I have the honour to follow Mr. Patrice Monthé for the examination-in-chief of Witness CF14.  I will, therefore, immediately launch into that examination by putting questions to Witness CF14.
WITNESS CF14,
first having duly been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness CF14.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness CF14, on behalf of the Defence, in other words, on behalf of Father Athanase Seromba whose co-counsel I am, together with Patrice Monthé, who is lead counsel, I am going to ask you questions relative to the counts or the allegations made against him by this Chamber, do you understand me? 
A.	Yes, I have understood you. 
Q.	Did you understand me, Witness CF14? 
A.	Yes, yes, I'm with you, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you ready and willing to answer questions that I will be putting to you?  Are you ready? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Very well.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, the first questions which I need to put to this witness will probably expose him to the risk of revealing his identity.  Therefore, I would request this august Chamber to kindly allow a closed session so that I can put these questions to the witness, and these will surely lead us to the break.  There are not many, but they are necessary for me to continue with my examination of the witness according to our strategy as a Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you not wish to identify the witness first in a public session?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Can the registry please come to my assistance so that we can give the original to the witness?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I was saying that the witness must have already checked on the identification sheet that has been given to him.  Can you please verify that everything is correct?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Let me apologise to the Chamber. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the personal information concerning me on this document is correct. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Very well, Madam President.  I think the witness has checked the document, and I would like to request your Chamber to kindly admit this as a Defence Exhibit, and it will be D. 57, and we request that it be placed under seal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Prosecution?  I see none.  Very well.  The document is admitted for the record as Defence Exhibit D. 57 and it shall be placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 57 admitted, under seal)
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you wish to begin with the closed session?  Any objection from the Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do apologise for the public, but we have to move into a closed session in order to protect the identity of the witness, and also in the interests of justice. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 20 to 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
