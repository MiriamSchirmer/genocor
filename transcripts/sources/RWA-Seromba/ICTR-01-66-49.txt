MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Here we have Witness BOR, is that correct?  I beg your pardon, BO1, and we will have BR1 afterwards.  According to the information that we have just received, it would seem that the two witnesses have to go back home this weekend. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, the two witnesses must return tomorrow evening, not this weekend, but tomorrow evening, and I have informed the WVSS of this, and this is why I had to call the Prosecutor so that we can discuss other modus operandi with him regarding FE36, and so that we can take these two witnesses, so that they can go back tomorrow, because they cannot change their plans for their return home. 

Madam President, Your Honours, these are the explanations that I can provide you at this moment.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am now going to turn to the Prosecutor.  You agreed with the Defence for the change in the order of appearance of witnesses, did you?  
MR. MOSES:
Subject to Your Honours' rulings, we have no difficulty in dealing with these witnesses now.  The only thing I would say, Your Honours, is that we cannot guarantee that the witnesses will be completed today.  We can certainly give no undertaking to Your Honours that one, let alone both, will have concluded their testimony today.  We will certainly not -- we will certainly do our utmost to deal with the cross-examination of the witness efficiently, but as we have observed, sometimes it depends on the way in which a witness answers questions which can affect the length of a cross-examination as well.  And so there are things which are out of our control, but we have no difficulty with -- if Your Honours don't, with these witnesses being called now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And after the examination-in-chief of this witness, will you proceed to the cross-examination of the same witness?  
MR. MOSES:
(Microphones overlapping) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We take due note of the agreement between the parties, but, we need, however, to underscore that it is unfortunate that we are being informed of this information at the last minute, given that these witnesses have to return home tomorrow.  Otherwise, we could have been able to hear these witnesses first-hand and then take the other witnesses later.  But because of this, we have had to ask the Presiding Judge Byron to give you tomorrow morning so that we can conclude with these two witnesses.  We do sincerely regret the fact that we are informed at the very last minute, at the eleventh hour, because we have a schedule which we have to respect, and we're not the only ones.  So in future we should be informed well in advance that witnesses can -- so that witnesses can be heard appropriately, and in a well-organised manner, and not in haste.  Without further ado, we shall move into the testimony of Witness BO1. 

Madam Witness, good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected Defence witness.  The Defence will therefore examine you in-chief, and then you will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  And possibly the Defence may wish to re-examine you after that, and it is possible as well that the Judges ask you for clarifications here and there.  We request you to now kindly take your solemn declaration before you begin your examination-in-chief which will be done by the Defence.
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
(Declaration made by Witness BO1 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Witness BO1.  I now give the floor to the Defence, and I wonder, is it Mr. Monthé who is going to examine this witness in-chief?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel, you have the floor.  You may proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, respectfully, I wish to remind the Chamber that yesterday we had agreed that the witness be heard in closed session.  I therefore would wish immediately to obtain the Chamber's permission so that we can move into a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we did indeed mention this yesterday.  The two parties agreed, and so did the Chamber, so we shall now move into a closed session.  

Mr. Registry, please, can you ensure that the preparations for that are made?
