MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The Court is called to order.  

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Registry, could you read out what is listed this morning.  
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 27th of June 2006, for the closing arguments in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Athanase Seromba, Case Number ICTR-2001-66-T.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, registry.  

We now ask the parties to enter an appearance.  We start with the Prosecutor.  
MS. ARBIA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I'm the Prosecutor -- or, on the Prosecutor's side I have Jonathan Moses, Greg Townsend, Althea Alexis (sic), with the assistance of Tolulope Olowoye, and also present, the interns, Stephanie Manda and Marie-Louise Romero. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

We now turn to the Defence.  Could you be kind enough to introduce yourselves.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence team, led by myself, is made up of your humble servant, myself, Patrice Monthé, former president of the bar association of Cameroon.  Next to me, Nekuie, also of the Cameroon bar, residing in Douala.  Our legal assistant is Counsel Ngo Bihegue, Sarah, Cameroon bar, resident in Yaounde.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

We have received a motion filed by the Prosecutor, an extremely urgent one, on the corrigendum that was submitted by the Defence.  We would like, if possible, for the parties to make their submissions with respect to that matter, which needs to be resolved before the closing arguments are made. 

Prosecutor, do you have anything to add with respect to that motion on your stand by your written arguments?  In that case, we will ask the Defence to speak.  
MS. ARBIA: 
Madam President, the Prosecutor has already submitted in writing its reaction to the motion.  Actually, it's a disguised corrigendum.  It's a new document, actually, filed by the Defence at the last minute, specifically yesterday, in breach of perhaps Rule 86, which has fixed an unavoidable deadline, namely, five days prior to the commencement of trial, in the course of which closing arguments will be made by the parties.  

Now, in view of that breach, and in view of the fact that the document was filed yesterday, and it is a new one, it is not really a corrigendum, but a new, fresh document. 

The Prosecutor has filed a motion, which we've just referred to, and reserves her right to respond to the arguments raised by the Defence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Counsel Monthé, you may wish to address the Court to raise your own arguments.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I thank you.  

Madam President, Your Honours, yesterday, at the end of the day, at my home, I received, from my assistant, a motion filed by the Office of the Prosecutor you just alluded to.  I must confess that I did not fail to be surprised.  The Prosecutor didn't say so this morning, but her motion relied on three rules of the rules of procedure:  54, 73, and 86 of the said Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

Now, in that motion the Prosecutor argues that the order issued by your Chamber on the 8th of June 2006 directed or instructed the Defence to file its pre-defence brief no later than the 28th of June 2006.  And the fact that that brief had been submitted on that day, which was not a matter in dispute, that that final brief cannot be the object of a corrigendum filed on Monday, the 26th, because in that regard, therefore, the Defence will be violating or be in breach of Rule 86.  And, as a result, some prejudice might have been suffered by the Prosecution.  

Madam President, I would like to say to the Court -- or raise a number of matters of law.  But before I go there, let me also raise a certain number of factual matters.  

The Prosecutor submitted her final brief on the 26th of May.  It was in English.  It was submitted here in Arusha, whereas Defence counsel were not resident, or were not in Arusha.  I don't want to dwell on this matter, because that matter has been resolved through your order.  But let me point out, Madam President, that on the 19th of June, Defence received from the same Prosecutor, a corrigendum, based on that final brief of the 26th of May, to which it never makes any reference.  

And let me start by asking the -- for the inadmissibility of that corrigendum.  Reference is being made to a violation of Rules 54 and 73.  Let me point out that in the body of that motion, at no point in time does the Prosecutor rely on those two rules.  I'm therefore asking the Trial Chamber to exclude that from the proceedings.  

Regarding 86(B), now that rule says that the unavoidable deadline applies to both parties, namely, with respect to the submission of the final brief.  That's what the Defence did.  On the 22nd of June the Defence submitted its final brief.  It does happen that for technical problems there were typographical errors, there were errors -- huge portions did not appear in the said brief, and therefore there was a corrigendum, and a letter was submitted to the Chamber in support.  

Madam President, Your Honours, in doing so, none of the provisions were violated by the Defence.  None of the provisions of the rules of the -- this Tribunal talks of, say, the form or the manner in which such corrigendum need to be filed.  It doesn't even talk about a number of pages, or a number of pages that have to figure in the said corrigendum.  So the inadmissibility that is sought here is not based on any argument in law.  So, we cannot talk about an inadmissibility without referring to the law.  

And, finally, Prosecutor talks of some prejudice.  That is not proven.  I don't think it is just for the Prosecutor to say that she didn't have enough time to get acquainted with that document would amount to prejudice.  

Finally, if by some extraordinary development, the Chamber grants that motion, that would merely mean that Father Seromba will be tried without being unable (sic) to defend himself, because the entire issues of law raised by Father Seromba will be violated, and that would be in breach of Articles 19 and 20 of the statute.  

So, briefly summed up, those are my responses.  

Let me also say that I did respond in writing to that submission of the Prosecutor.  It is being prepared.  I would do so further to the Chamber if it has not been done.  I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

Yes, Prosecutor, briefly, please.  
MS. ARBIA: 
Very briefly, Madam President.  

Now, on the issues of fact, the Defence makes reference to the fact that it filed its motion seeking an extension of the time limit, and that that motion was granted, and it was -- Defence was able to obtain an extension of the time limit, namely, with respect to the submission of the final brief.  Apart from that -- or that didn't mean that it had to continue preparing that final brief until the 22nd of June 2006.  

Now, Defence is also talking about the corrigendum.  Allow me, Madam President, to use some expression.  It is a corrigendum that goes beyond the allowed time limit, or prescribed time limit.  

Now, because this document, which is titled "Corrigendum", does not point out the areas that are corrected, or which areas are rectified.  On the contrary, it does add on 40 pages to that report.  A document which by itself was complete, namely, the one that was dated 22nd of June.  It was signed by both Defence counsel.  

Madam President, Your Honours, there is no reason to admit a new document out of the time limit allowed.  It is a compulsory and mandatory deadline.  It's not being determined by the Trial Chamber.  It so says in the rules.  In other words, five days prior to session for the closing arguments.  

Once more, to bridge the gap, or the inconsistencies, to take a second bite at the cherry, if one might say so, they talk about the inability of the Accused to defend himself or that his rights are not fully guaranteed.  Well, Madam President, right from the very commencement of this trial, we've been hearing that litany of arguments, and in other words -- or, they use it as a basis for justifying the fact that the Defence is not complying with the rules.  In other words, it does not comply with the orders, or decisions, or rulings of the Chamber.  

So, at this juncture, at this phase of the proceedings, Madam President, the prejudice that the Prosecutor incurs, that is, in the event that document is admitted, that prejudice incurred by the Prosecutor is obvious.  The Prosecutor hasn't had the opportunity to even read this document or to identify the areas, mistakes, or whatever corrections are introduced therein, so as to be able to prepare herself to deal with those arguments, to respond to them.  

Now, clearly, it -- the burden of proof lies with the Prosecutor.  But, Madam President, I don't need to use any other words to justify or to illustrate the material prejudice that will be suffered by the Prosecutor in the event this document is admitted.  
Let me stress this point:  That motion is warranted.  It makes reference to the rules, specific rules in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, because it makes it necessary to identify the errors.  For instance, reference is made to Rule 86.  And in Rule 86, the word, which is a compulsory word, "shall" is used.  It is mandatory, if I may repeat.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Do you have anything to add, Counsel Monthé?  You are not bound to.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, I'm not bound to.  Well, the Defence always has to have the last word.  Clearly I'm not compelled or bound to.  I don't like what I call untruths to be told.  When we come before the Court, we have to say things that are in conformity with the truth.  The Prosecutor cannot tell you that she did not have time to read the document and to say to you, at the same time, that there were no corrections made in the document filed before you.  That's the first point.  

The second one, Defence doesn't accept from the Prosecutor that type of accusations that are being levelled against it.  We are here, we have a job to do, and it will lie with the Trial Chamber to determine.  

And to conclude, Madam President, let me say the following to conclude, that 86 talks of a five-day time limit for the submission of the final brief.  On the 22nd of June 2006, said final brief was submitted, and it was disclosed to the parties.  Subsequently, there was a corrigendum.  It will now lie for you to determine whether Father Seromba should be tried without his whole -- all his rights being guaranteed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

We will adjourn the hearing in order to deliberate on the issue just raised before the Trial Chamber, and we will return to render our decision in 15 minutes.  We stand down for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 0932H to 0948H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Court is in session.  

The Chamber, after deliberations:  Grants the Prosecutor's motion denying the admission of the corrigendum filed by the Defence and filed with the registry on the 26th of June 2006.  

Directs that the said corrigendum will be drawn, specifically materials that form part of the records, directs the registry to take every necessary step to ensure that this decision is enforced.  

A decision -- a written decision setting out the grounds for the denial, or withdrawal, of that corrigendum will be subsequently submitted to the registry of the Tribunal.  

The Chamber, having noticed reference made to that final brief of the Defence, references that are likely to disclose the identities of protected witnesses, now orders that the final brief of the Defence be redacted, relying on Rule 54 of the rules.  

This ruling from the Bench will be followed by a written decision setting out the grounds.  This order, being confidential, shall not be read out in open session, obviously to protect the identity of the protected witnesses.  The said order will be submitted or filed with the registry today.  

We would like to know whether the Accused would like to speak, because he may be allowed to do so, in the event he is so inclined, after the closing arguments.  Obviously, he won't be speaking as a witness in that case.  

Yes, Counsel Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, on behalf of the Defence, the Defence notices that the order you just issued does not allow it to continue to defend Father Seromba, because it deprives the Defence of all arguments in law at its disposal.  So, we can no longer continue with our submissions on this matter.  And as far as we are concerned, the Defence case ends here.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, the points that you raised in that corrigendum -- because that's not the case, really, because it is some other brief, actually.  Now, those developments can be made orally, in view of the fact that you will be speaking -- or making your submissions in defence of your client.  So, nothing is lost as far as the Defence of Father Seromba is concerned.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I'm defending someone who is a human being, has feelings, a perception of justice, and if he doesn't believe in what is happening anymore, I am at his orders and must listen to what he has said.  So I'm not -- I ask the Trial Chamber not to take what we're doing as an affront.  Father Seromba feels he cannot continue with his trial and asks not to plead.  That is what I must tell the Trial Chamber.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We will now adjourn for a few moments to allow for consultations.  The hearing stands down.  
(Court recessed from 0955 to 1036H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The Court is in session.  
We give the floor to Madam Prosecutor for their final arguments, after which we shall allow the Defence to speak.  
MS. ARBIA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

In its final Prosecution submissions, by virtue of para -- of Rule 86, paragraph (A), the Prosecutor, in view of the final trial brief, submitted on the 26th of May 2006, according to the Court's scheduling order, and in the light of the Defence's final brief, filed on the 22nd of June 2006 at 1739, 5:39 p.m., after having considered, exhaustively, the point of law at issue and the Prosecution evidence and the Defence evidence as submitted, the Prosecutor feels that it has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the Accused is guilty for having committed the crimes of genocide, or alternatively, complicity in genocide, or conspiracy to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity, extermination.  

In its final brief, the Prosecutor also covered the matter of sentencing in pages 159 to 175 of the French version, and in that part of our final brief, asked for imprisonment for the rest of his life for each charge proffered.  

An analysis of the Defence's final submissions shows, in the Prosecutor's opinion, that the Defence has not succeeded in bringing out any doubt, no reasonable doubt as to the Prosecution evidence.  And that is for the reasons that will be submitted today, while attempting to identify the essential points to avoid any repetition of what is laid down in the final brief and in attempting to focus on the points and the issues raised in the Defence's final brief.  

In order to render this Prosecution final submission as precise, as specific as possible, the Prosecutor has prepared an order of presentation of the submissions as follows:  

In the first introductory part, the Prosecutor will identify the issues raised in the Defence's final submissions, restricting ourselves to matters that are pertinent at this stage of the proceedings, while identifying all the issues, all the points, that are irrelevant and will not be covered by the Prosecution final submissions.  

Once the issues have been -- the relevant issues have been identified, the Prosecutor will submit final submissions on points of law that apply in the present matter in relation to the indictment.  Thereupon, we will hear a presentation, while focusing on the essential relevant points, on the Prosecution -- the presentation of the Prosecution theory of the case, developed by my colleague, Counsel Gregory Townsend.  

Subsequently, and still sticking to the method of identifying essential and relevant points, my colleague, Counsel Jonathan Moses, will be making final submissions as to the theory -- Prosecutor's theory of the case.  

And once the Defence has presented their submissions as to the sentence, the Prosecution will submit its own arguments on that issue.  We will particularly develop the problem of defects in the indictment, and after this general introduction, my colleague, Althea Alexis-Windsor, will develop those particular aspects.  

As to the first part, as to our programme of presentation, the identification of relevant points at issue, the Prosecution would like to state that it has noted that in the Defence's final submissions -- that the Defence, in their final submissions, to return to points that have been adjudicated and seem to put in question matters on which the Bench has already ruled and wishes to contradict or not acknowledge the -- in particular, the decision rendered on the 30th of May 2006 by the Chamber of first instance in relation to the request for a certificate to appeal on oral decisions rendered on the 26th and 27th of April 2006.  

In spite of that decision, and notwithstanding that on the 26th of April the Trial Chamber invited the Accused to testify the next day, having signified its -- that it was prepared to hear the Accused, the Defendant, even as regards final decisions and the matter of sentencing, on the 22nd of June 2006, in introducing -- in submitting its final submissions, it comments that:  "The Accused did not have -- in any way, renounced his right to testify -- the Accused had not renounced his right to testify."  This does not appear anywhere in the transcripts of the hearing, I note, but simply -- they simply state that he was deprived of his right by a unilateral decision of the Trial Chamber.  

The Prosecution, at this stage, might underscore the seriousness of those accusations by the Defence, and we will restrict ourselves to observing, just as we did at the outset of the trial, and in the course of the proceedings, that this Defence does not acknowledge the authority of the Trial Chamber and shows no willingness to respect the Chamber's decisions.  The Prosecution wishes to reiterate, on that point raised by the Accused, that the Accused not only did not wish to testify, was not willing to testify, but after having been invited to testify by the Bench, by the Trial Chamber, he and his counsel remained absent, which is an attitude that will have to be taken into account in its assessment of the matter as a whole at the appropriate time.  

Again, on the 22nd of June 2006, the Defence states that, on the basis of an oral decision by the Trial Chamber, was obliged to conclude the Defence case on the 24th of April without acknowledging -- without recognise (sic) the fact that it could not test -- the Accused could not testify before Witness PS2 had testified.  On the -- and Accused (unintelligible) the Bench.  

And on the 26th of April -- 26th of April when everything was ready to hear PS2 by video conference from South Africa, the Accused -- the Defence refused to be present.  I shan't come back to all that, but I wish to underscore that such conduct is of interest in assessing the matter at hand.  

Further, in identifying points that are not relevant and will be excluded in consideration of the Defence's final submissions, the Prosecution wishes to point out that the Defence has presented many arguments, has produced many pages arguing on Article 6.3 of the statutes in respect of the Accused's responsibility for acts considered -- committed by a subordinate.  It's clear, and the Defence, moreover, acknowledges that nowhere in the indictment does the Prosecution level any charge on the basis of Article 6.3 of the statute.  

Moreover, on several occasions in the Defence final submissions, they allege facts that were not adduced in evidence before the Trial Chamber.  As an example, I will refer -- I do not wish to delay further this presentation, because the Trial Chamber has read the Defence's final submissions.  But, for example, page 4 of the Defence final brief, paragraph 6, where the Defence -- I wish to be precise.  The Defence alleges, page 4, paragraph 6 of its document of the 22nd of June 2006:  "It has today been proven that the Rwandan patriotic front, RPF, attacked at that time because any progress in the field of democratisation, the rights of -- human rights, and the rights of the refugees, would have reduced the legitimacy of an attack asserted by a report of a Belgian parliamentary commission of inquiry concerning the events in Rwanda."  And then there's a footnote, 3, where the Defence reveals as its source a document of the Belgian senate.  

The Prosecution wishes to submit that this method of analysing evidence is not admissible, because the Defence proposes documents -- issues that were not heard in the course of the trial.  That's just an example.  But, in the Defence's final brief there are other times at which the Defence refers to information or matters that were not adduced as evidence in these proceedings.  

Moreover, as regards the use that the Defence has made in its final brief of facts established in other matters, they're -- clearly that is obvious, ie, that is not admissible.  The facts that can be considered as being established are only the facts adduced in the present trial.  

As an example of that last point, I invite the Trial Chamber to see what is written on page 53 of the Defence's final brief, last paragraph, where, after having quoted parts of the Akayesu judgment regarding a bourgmestre's authority in Rwanda, tries to use parts of that judgment to allege that the Accused was subordinate to the authority of the bourgmestre as any other ordinary citizen.  The Defence cannot use facts established in other cases to draw factual conclusions in the present case. 

Again, as regards the points that are not relevant to the matter in hand, the Prosecutor wishes to point out that the Defence's analysis and discussion of the forms of responsibility of omission, that discussion is not pertinent because the indictment proffered against Athanase Seromba -- and I shall specify -- wish to specify that the charges levelled against Seromba are -- concern positive acts and not omissions.  

However, in order to avoid any ambiguity in the legal argument submitted by the Defence, I should like to point out that contrary to what the Defence argues, that the sole omission admissible in the ICTR statutes are those provided for under 6.3 of the statutes.  That is not true on the basis of the case law of both international criminal tribunals.  There also exists omission as a form of responsibility under 6.1 of the statute, and, ipso facto, Article 7.1.  

As an example, in Tadic, the Appeals Chamber, on the matter of 7.1, in their statutes, which corresponds to 6.1 in our statutes, in the Tadic case, it was established unequivocably (sic) that 7.1 of the ICTY statutes also includes -- I will say it in English, because in the original it is defined in English -- culpable omission.  Hence, any allegation by the Defence seeking to show that the only omission as a form of responsibility is -- under 6.3 is not valid in view of that precedent, which was not the only case, because subsequently similar decisions were taken in other trials before ICTY and ICTR.  Hence, that submission is not relevant in the eyes of the Prosecution.  

And another one is the discussion as to the compatibility between complicity -- genocide and complicity in genocide.  Madam President, Your Honours, it is self-evident, on the basis of the indictment, and all subsequent submissions by the Prosecution, and the final submissions recently filed, it is evident that the charges of complicity in genocide is only an alternative to the charge of genocide.  So, all the Defence discussion and arguments on that point are of no value and are irrelevant.  

Based on the reasoning of the Defence, which is totally irrelevant, particularly Defence's submissions with respect to cumulative offences -- because ultimately the Defence itself does say that cumulative offences, or cumulative charging, is allowed.  It would, therefore, make it unnecessary for there to be any further submissions on this matter, that is, with respect to cumulative charging.  

And, by the way, case law in that regard has clearly stated that cumulative charging is allowed, and I am referring to the judgment rendered by the Appeals Chamber in Musema case, particularly in paragraph 369.  And that reasoning comes in the wake of the Celebici judgment, again rendered by the ICTY. 
Now, regarding multiple sentencing, now, relying on various provisions of the statute, now, if each of those provisions were to contain the constituent elements that are separate each from the other, now based on the case law, and here I'm quoting, again a judgment rendered by the Appeals Chamber in the Musema case, and based on that judgment, multiple sentencing, or cumulative sentencing, is allowed.  And in that judgment, the Appeals Chamber opines that the material element, or the actus reus, has to be separate or distinct one from the other, as long as there is proof of a fact that does not require the existence of the order.  That is based on the explanation provided by the Chamber in paragraph 365 of the Musema judgment that I had alluded to earlier.  

In the same thrust, there is a judgment in Semanza of 15 May 2003 -- I am merely citing the references because I don't think this is the time and place to go into further details.  I am talking about paragraph 408 and 409 of that judgment.  

However, I intend to quote an opinion by the Appeals Chamber in the case of the Prosecutor versus Goran Jelisic, delivered on the 5th of July 2001 on same matter.  It's in paragraph 82 and 83.  Now, paragraph 82 states, and I quote:  "The validity of cumulative convictions in relation to the same conduct, charged as a violation of the laws or customs of war under Article 3 and as a crime against humanity under Article 5 of the statute, is based on the notion that each crime is a special ingredient not possessed by the other.  Following the reasoning of the Appeals Chamber in Delalic appeal judgment, the Appeals Chamber notes that Article 3 requires a close link between the acts of the accused and the armed conflict; this element is not required by --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
(Microphones overlapping)... slowly, slowly, please.  
MS. ARBIA.  
"-- on the other hand..." (microphones overlapping)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think perhaps that paragraph should be started again, that last paragraph.  
MS. ARBIA: 
"On the other hand, Article 5 requires proof that the act occurred as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population; that element is not required by Article 3.  Thus each article has an element requiring proof of a fact not required by the other.  As a result, cumulative convictions under both Articles 3 and 5 are permissible.  In such a situation, it's not possible to hold, as submitted by cross-appellant, that either offence is a 'lesser included offence' of the other."  

And paragraph 83:  "The cross- -- the cross-appellant's first ground of appeal concerning cumulative convictions accordingly fails.  The Appeals Chamber affirms the cumulative convictions based on the same conduct for violations of the laws on customs of war charged under Article 3, and for crimes against humanity charged under Article 5 of the statute."  That is the end of the quotation.  

Now, based on that case law, Your Honours, it is the opinion of the Prosecutor that it is proven, particularly with respect to genocide and extermination, it is proven that there are elements.  Now, based on a factual comparison of both charges, some distinctions do exist.  I will not now dwell on this matter.  I could do so if, in the course of the closing arguments by the Defence, these matters are raised for further analysis.  

Now, let me get to the issues that are relevant in the final brief of the Defence.  Now, the Prosecutor has four (unintelligible) of presentation, and for the completeness of presentation, the Prosecutor has identified a number of points, essential points, on which this closing argument will dwell.  The first one is what the Defence refers to as the Defence case regarding the absence or the (unintelligible) of the means that would enable the Accused to prevent a crime being committed.  Now, those means, according to the Defence, would be represented in what is called an alibi defence.  

Now, after putting it, it would lie with the Prosecutor to prove beyond any reasonable doubt the fact that that alibi defence is not founded.  I have tried to understand what that defence is, but I found, Your Honours, that the Defence team didn't bring forward the evidence available with respect to that particular aspect of the Accused's defence.  Now, what is the evidence in support of that defence?  In the absence of such evidence, the Prosecutor is not able to rebut that argument of the Defence.  

Another relevant point is with respect to the perpetration of crimes that are being disputed by Seromba.  On pages 21 and 22 I do find some conclusions made by the Defence, basically.  It would appear Defence is blaming the Prosecution for not taking into account case law connected with the perpetration of crimes.  That is not true at all.  In fact, on the contrary -- or, contrary to what the Prosecutor has argued in his final brief.  

Now, in that final brief, particularly on page 7, on footnote 6, the Prosecutor did make reference to case law in the Kordic case, where the Appeals Chamber stated that it was not necessary to prove the existence of a -- of a link, superior-subordinate link between the perpetrator of the crime and the Accused, that is, the person who issues the orders and the person who executes those orders.  And that gives me the opportunity, Your Honours, to refer to other precedents that might not have been mentioned in the Prosecutor's final brief.  

In order to save time, and in view of the fact that the Bench is fully aware of those case laws, and it was with that in mind that some other precedents were not cited by the Prosecutor.  I will do so now, so that the reasoning of the Prosecutor is quite clear.  And in that connection, I would like to refer to a judgment that was rendered by the Trial Chamber in Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi on the 17th of June 2004.  Specifically, the ruling on paragraph 281, 282 of the said judgment.  I find it expedient to raise the issue now, because this matter is not only relevant, it is extremely important and relevant to this particular case.  

Now, in paragraph 281 of that judgment, the Trial Chamber said:  "The act of ordering lies in the fact that an individual uses his position of authority to compel someone else to commit an offence.  Both ad hoc tribunals, in their case laws, have adopted two positions in that respect.  One considers that an order implies that there is a superior-subordinate relationship, that is, between the person issuing the order and the person implementing the said orders.  And (sic) the concept of an order does not necessarily imply that there does exist such an -- such a formal relationship."  That's the end of that quote.  

But, that stated, the Trial Chamber did adopt its own opinion on the matter.  As stated in paragraph 282 -- and I quote:  "In the opinion of the Trial Chamber, this matter has to be settled in light of the circumstances of the case.  The authority of an influential person may lie with his social, economic, political, or administrative status in society, or maybe as a result of his moral status.  It could be de jure or de facto authority.  And finding themselves in an emergency or dangerous situation, individuals might turn to such an influential person, expecting from the said person a solution, some assistance, a desire that the person act in order to resolve the said crisis."  

I have made reference to that case law because the Prosecutor, in the course of her closing argument, will devote part of her analysis to that important matter.  And that is why I did map out the background, the context within which this matter will be addressed subsequently, in particular by my colleague, Gregory Townsend.  

On the matter of authority, the Defence also tried to discuss the position of the approving observer -- pages 25 and 26 of the Defence's closing brief.  The Defence alleges that only people invested with public authority can be in such a position of an approving observer -- onlooker.  That is erroneous in the eyes of the Prosecution.  

Case law refers to the position of the approving spectator -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says counsel in English, "approving spectator".  
MS. ARBIA: 
-- in the Nyitigeka case, where it was established -- I quote:  "An approving spectator, who is held in such respect by the other perpetrators that his presence encouraged them in their conduct, may be guilty of complicity in a crime against humanity."  And I will leave it at that.  I shall not dwell on that point.  The authority on the matter is clear, and I have quoted my source.  On the basis of that precedent, that case law, I think the discussion is much simpler, save other arguments that might be raised in the course of pleadings.  

Another matter raised -- issue raised by the Defence and which is relevant concerns the need, in the eyes of the Defence, to prove that a crime of genocide has been committed in order to prove the existence of a complicity -- of complicity in genocide.  The Prosecution wishes to point out -- only because in our opinion it is quite sufficient, we should not abuse the Bench's time -- it is sufficient to note that the existence of a genocide has been proved; a genocide was perpetrated beyond all reasonable doubt.  If there's concern on other aspects of the issue, I would say that according to established case law, according to precedent, it is not necessary that the principal perpetrator himself be prosecuted, or that he be identified, or that his guilt be proved.  That is in Akayesu, in the Akayesu judgment, paragraph 531.  

And, moreover, Your Honours, in respect thereof, I shall draw the Bench's attention to what is stated in -- on page 72 of the Defence's final brief, first paragraph.  And I quote:  "In the instance it was established by Defence witnesses, and even by Prosecution witnesses, that the authorities, that were the bourgmestre, police inspector, leader of extremist political parties, policemen, gendarme, were the perpetrators of the -- and the (unintelligible) judges, were those who led the killing perpetrated in Nyange."  So even if the people enumerated in that paragraph are considered to be the main perpetrators of the genocide, and that has been established both by the Prosecution and Defence lawyers -- witnesses -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, "witnesses".
MS. ARBIA:  
Another point which I feel is relevant is the question as to the identification of the need to identify the witnesses, the victims, particularly as regards the charge of extermination.  On the basis of the case law -- and I will take the most recent example which includes the previous discussion -- which covers the previous discussion, and I'm referring in -- to the Appeals Chamber decision in Naletilic and Martinovic of the 3rd of March (sic) 2006, where the Appeals Chamber, having recalled previous case law, more particularly in Kupreskic and Ntakirutimana, according to which I quote:  "To identify victims is reconcilable with the right of the Accused to know the material facts of the charge against him because, in such circumstances, the Accused's ability to prepare an effective defence to the charge does not depend on knowing the identity of every single alleged victim."  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Excuse me, Madam Prosecutor, could you tell us which paragraph that was?  You didn't do so for Martinovic, nor more Nkurenziza (sic). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Maybe that was Furundzija (sic), sorry.  
MS. ARBIA: 
I will begin with the last references, Naletilic, on the identification of victims.  
(Pages 1 to 15 by Kirstin McLean)
































1130H 
MS. ARBIA: 
It is footnote 153 in the decision of the 3rd of May 2006 in Naletilic, which refers to the Trial Chamber -- the Appeals Chambers decision in Kupreskic, paragraph 90, which I quote, and as to the preceding point -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, if that is going to take too much time we can go back to it later.  
MS. ARBIA: 
It was in Kurindiza (sic), yes -- I have to go back to Furundzija.  And thank you for that possibility of returning to it later.

So, as to this last point, I think that the precedents are sufficient, and have sufficiently established the principles and criteria.  But to return to that analysis that might be included under identification of witnesses, it might be dealt with under defect in the indictment.  But I should like now to make a few references on that matter of defect in the indictment in respect of the Defence's final submissions whilst awaiting my colleague, Counsel Windsor's submissions as to the defect in the indictment and how any possible defects could be remedied or cured, and any prejudice that might be associated -- prejudice to the Defence that might be attached to any possible defect in the indictment.  And that part will be dealt with later by my colleague.  

But I should like to note because I feel it is extremely serious, Your Honours, that the Defence in its final submissions produced pages and pages and pages challenging --  saying that the indictment,   Athanase Seromba's indictment is defective.  And with a minute analysis of defects that are not in the indictment, but in the paragraph which, out of context in respect of the indictment, but even after an analysis of the paragraph, the Defence shows in their final submissions that they have not read the indictment or are deliberately distorting matters.  They say that in some paragraphs the Prosecutor did not indicate the ethnic group of the staff sacked by Athanase Seromba.  Well, it is sufficient to read the indictment to see that they have been identified as being Tutsi.

But I should try and proceed in a more orderly fashion.  It is chapter 5 of the Defence's final submissions as to defects in the indictment.  As to paragraph 4 in the indictment, the Defence claims that the Prosecution lied in saying that Seromba was the priest in charge of Nyange parish.  I don't understand such an allegation, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Is that defect or is it a lie by the Prosecution or is it lack of evidence?  I have not understood that Defence allegation.

And from a logical, rational point of view it is not a defect but it is something else -- it must be something else.  But I wish to point out that if it is lack of evidence, as will be explained further by my colleagues who will follow me, the Prosecution has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that Seromba was the priest in charge of Nyange parish in April 1994.

Still on defect in the indictment in para 5:  The Defence claims that there is a lack of clarity in paragraph 5 of the indictment, since details on the plan are not set forth.  That is false, since the indictment, if you read it as a whole, consistently refers to a plan for eliminating the Tutsi in Nyange.  And that plan is set forth in detail, and the indicia abound.

Paragraph 6:  They say that the indictment is vague because the Prosecution did not identify the victims, which is false.  It is sufficient to read paragraph 6 in connection with other paragraphs, and you find, quite simply, that victims were identified by name, by ethnicity.

Similarly, in paragraph 8, they say that -- they are not the names of the Tutsi on the list; however, those names are given, and I invite the Defence team to read the indictment.  If they are not set forth in paragraph 8, they are set forth in the following paragraph.  Not only are the facts given explained in sufficient detail, they are explained in abundant detail, perhaps even more than necessary.  

And other submissions have been made under other paragraphs in the same terms, which lead one to believe that the Defence, to date, has still not read attentively the indictment.

I will not, Your Honours, go into Defence allegations point by point.  It is sufficient to say that till now what I have said as to the nature of their allegations as to the defects in the indictment, and subject to further development, it has not actually been made clear in the Defence submissions when they speak of a lack of information that would make it possible for them to prepare the defence, a lack of things that were adduced in Prosecution evidence.  So what they are speaking of being absent, I don't really know.  Unless, perhaps, it means that there are defects in the indictment itself, apart from the evidence adduced by the Prosecution of what the Defendant is accused of.  Suffice it to say, Your Honours, that to read the indictment as a whole satisfies all the Defendant's needs to be informed of the accusations leveled -- of the charges proffered against him.

Some of the important matter -- an important and essential matter is the authority exercised by the Accused and his statements in connection with the allegations that appear in the indictment, and in light of the evidence presented by both the Defence and the Prosecutor.  In that regard, my colleague Gregory Townsend will subsequently be elaborating on the type of evidence presented by the Prosecutor on this matter, which is crucial, no doubt.  But -- and I wish to correct some mistake, some error, so as to put paid to any ambiguity.  

In each final brief, the Defence says that the Prosecutor contradicted herself by saying that           Father Seromba was a parish priest.  And I think, after reading the original text in English and the final brief, that word does not exist.  The Prosecutor has always used the word or the words "priest in charge."  She has never referred to him as a parish priest.  So obviously it is an error of translation from English to French, and that mistake or error continues on page 9, and Defence made reference erroneously to page 16.  I think it should be paragraph 19.  I think these errors need to be corrected.  These errors of translation need to be corrected.  The Prosecutor never intended to talk of a curé or parish priest.

There are some other unfounded allegations made which I'm going to point out for proper understanding on the part of the Defence.  Page 48, that is in the arguments about the witness not called by the --  by the Defence.  And we notice that there is a witness, CBR, CBT also, which is contrary to what the Defence alleges, did testify on the 1st or 25th, and then the other one on the 6th of October 2004.

There was some other error that appears on page 49 where the Defence alleges that                  Witness Nkinamubanzi -- Nkinamubanzi is spelt N-K-I-N-A-M-U-B-A-N-Z-I -- that that witness had refused to appear as a Prosecution witness.  Well, that is not true.  It was in fact the Prosecutor who decided not to call that witness, for various reasons.  Similarly, some other witnesses alleged to have refused to appear.  Rather unfounded allegations.  I don't know on what basis the Defence says so.  That is on page 49, according to the Defence, those witnesses had refused to appear or to testify.

I will conclude with this part of the closing arguments with some remarks which in my view are important, even if they are not essential, as it were.  I'm referring to allegations that appear in the final brief of the Defence, which includes some admission of facts.  I have already alluded to the admissions of facts appearing on page 72, that is in connection with the officials who allegedly were the leaders of the killings in Nyange, the bourgmestre and other officials who have been mentioned.  But those individuals, those same people are referred to as persons who had developed a plan in conjunction or in collaboration with Seromba, a plan which aimed at the elimination of the Tutsi.  Now, in connection with meetings, there was an admission of facts, and not validity disputed or challenged.  And I'm referring to page 87 of the final brief of the Defence.  And, again, in the final brief of the Defence in connection with the status of the Accused Athanase Seromba, the Defence says -- I think that appears on page 2, third paragraph, as from the sixth line, as from the sixth line.  Well, let me quote.  After referring to ops, line 6, page 2, Defence, in reference to the status of Athanase Seromba says, "In light of his real and modest status as a young rural priest occupied the official position of vicar during the unfortunate events that occurred in Nyange parish in April 1994, events in which -- the parish in which he officiated."  
It seems to me, Your Honours, that those allegations are extremely crucial and in support of the position of the Prosecutor.

Madam President, Your Honours, those are the general points to, as it were, initiate the closing arguments of the Prosecutor.  And I will call on my colleague Gregory Townsend to address the Court, and sorry -- sorry, I'm sorry, that was an oversight on my part.  I will now call on my colleague, Althea Alexis-Windsor to pursue these closing arguments and focusing on defects in the indictment.  Thank you 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Madam Alexis-Windsor, you may wish to address the Court.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Since my learned colleague has dealt specifically paragraph by paragraph with issues concerning the defects or the alleged defects in the indictment, I propose to deal with them generally and with respect to the law.

Mr. President, Your Honours, it is well established in the case law of the ICTR, pursuant to Rule 47(C) of the rules that the indictment shall set forth the name and particulars of the suspect and a concise statement of the facts of the case and of the crime with which the suspect is charged.  We start from that basic proposition, Madam President, that our indictment, the indictment under which this Accused has been charged, has in fact and in law indeed set forth his name and particulars and a concise -- a concise statement of the facts of our case.

We would first submit, Madam President, Your Honours, that this allegation that the indictment is, one, defective, and, two, vague, is in itself an untimely one.  It is our submission that the allegation ought properly to have been raised either at the pre-trial stage, pursuant to Rule 72 of the rules or, if permission were so granted, at the interlocutory stage, pursuant to Rule 73 of the rules.               Madam President, Your Honours, the record would bear the truth of what I am saying, that there has been no motion ever lodged by the Accused in this matter, either pursuant to Rule 72 or Rule 73.

It is our submission that this failure to allege defect in the indictment, or vagueness in the form of the indictment, until this moment, places the Accused in the position envisioned by the Appeals Chamber decision in Niyitegeka, and I would read from that decision at paragraph 198.  And for the interpreters, I am reading from page 6 of my prepared document.  And I read:

"In considering whether a defect in the indictment has been cured by subsequent disclosure, the question arises as to which party has the burden of proof on the matter.  Although the judgement in Kupreskic did not address this issue expressly, the Appeals Chamber discussion indicates that the burden in that case rested with the Prosecution.  Kupreskic stated that in the circumstances of that case a breach of the substantial safeguards that an indictment is intended to furnish to the Accused raised the presumption that such a fundamental defect in the indictment did indeed cause injustice.  The defect could only have been deemed harmless through a demonstration that the Accused ability to prepare their defence was not materially impaired."  

Kupreskic clearly showed -- sorry; Kupreskic clearly imposed the duty to make that showing on the Prosecution, since the absence of such a showing led the Appeals Chamber to uphold the objections of the Accused.  In this case, Madam President, as -- and I'm now reading, for the interpreters, from page 7, paragraph 200, and I'm still reading from the Niyitegeka appeals judgement.

"In this case, Madam President, where there has been a failure to hitherto plead that the indictment is defective or vague, we continue to rely upon the appeals judgement in Niyitegeka."  And I'm reading, for the interpreters, on page 7, point 200, in the -- at the middle of that last paragraph:

"Where in such circumstances there is a resulting defect in the indictment, an accused person who fails to object at trial has the burden of proving, on appeal, that his ability to prepare his case was materially impaired. 

"Where, however, the Accused person objected at trial, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove, on appeal, that the Accused's ability to prepare his defence was not materially impaired."

Our submission, based on the decision or the judgement in Niyitegeka, is that the Trial Chamber must look askance at the failure of the Defence before this juncture to ever put before the Trial Chamber    the -- any alleged defect in the indictment or any vagueness in the indictment.

With respect to the alleged defect in the indictment, the Prosecution is of the determined view that had there been any defects in our indictment that they have, in fact, been cured.  In this respect, we would note the Appeals Chamber decision in Kupreskic.  In this regard, I would again rely upon the       Appeals Chamber decision in Niyitegeka, since it deals with and considers the decision in Kupreskic, and this is at paragraph 197 of the Chambers decision in Niyitegeka, which considers the judgement in Kupreskic.  And, for the interpreters, it is on page 6, paragraph 197.  

"Whether the Prosecution cured a defect in the indictment depends, of course, on the nature of the information that the Prosecution provides to the Defence, and on whether the information compensates for the indictment's failure to give notice of the charges asserted against the Accused." 

Kupreskic considered that adequate notice of material facts might be communicated to the Defence in the Prosecution's pre-trial brief during disclosure of evidence or through proceedings at trial.

In this regard, Madam President, we would like to place on record that we disclosed statements in this matter, redacted statements, in February 2002 and in March 2003; that we disclosed non-redacted statements on the 9th of August 2004.  Therefore, Madam President, in our view, the Defence had adequate notice because we, also, in our opening speech of the 20th of September 2004 listed what case the Accused had come to meet.  Further, Madam President, even before that, with respect to our pre-trial brief which was filed on the 27th of August 2004, it would have been clear to the Accused what, in fact, was the nature of the case he had come to meet.

One moment please, Madam President.

In fact, Madam President, in Prosecution Exhibit number 18, which is the interview of the Accused with la natione - La Nazione, I have been corrected.  The Accused said that between the 14th -- sorry, the Accused spoke of the destruction of the church as having taken place on the 16th of April, so that even then it was clear that the Accused knew what was the exact date the church was destroyed.  And so that when he was presented with non-redacted and redacted statements with our pre-trial brief, with the opening statement, it would have been clear to him what was the nature of the case he had been brought to answer in these proceedings.

The Accused noted in his final brief, filed on the 22nd of June, that he did not know or had no notice of the identity of the victims.  And I would be very brief on this point since it has been dealt with, but I merely wished to note before this Trial Chamber, paragraph --that in paragraph 90 of the Kupreskic decision, the Appeals Chamber noted that if there were so many victims, then the sheer scale of the massacre may, in some circumstances, make it impossible for the Prosecution to prove each and every victim.

Madam President, our case has always been that on the 16th of April 1994 around, 2000 persons were in Nyange church when it was destroyed.  My colleague, Mr. Townsend, would give the Trial Chamber further submissions on the authority of the Accused in this regard.  But merely for the purposes of these submissions on the defects of the indictment and the lack of specificity of the indictment, I would say, Madam President, I would submit that the exception provided in Kupreskic does in fact assist in our determination of how specific our indictment ought to have been.

Our indictment was very clear, Madam President, Your Honours.  Our indictment stated concisely the dates around which the incidents occurred so that in paragraph 15 of the indictment, very briefly, we stated that on or about the 13th of April 1994, the Interahamwe and the militia surrounding the parish launched an attack against the refugees in the church.  Again, at paragraph 29 of our indictment it stated, again on or about the 16th of April 1994, after the destruction of the church, the authorities held a meeting in the parish.  We would submit, and this has in fact been conceded by the Defence counsel in their final brief, that the dates "on or about the 13th" or "on or about the 16th" in the examples that I read do point, with sufficient precision, to the dates on which the events occurred; enough so that the Accused would have had sufficient notice.  

With respect to our count 3, conspiracy to commit genocide, the indictment clearly stated who were the persons who conspired with the Accused to commit the genocide; that is, Ndungutse, Kayishema, Ndahimana, and Kanyarukiga.  So, yet again, Madam President, the Prosecution has carefully placed before Accused all of the facts which he needed to prepare for his defence.  

The Prosecution, also, with respect to specificity, also put -- sorry, also placed before the Trial Chamber evidence which supported the counts of the indictment very carefully.  The Accused has been unable to see, for instance, Madam President, Your Honours, that we have charged him with points A, B and C, but in fact have led evidence on points X, Y and Z.  Everything that we have pleaded in our indictment, we have brought evidence upon.  We have not brought extraneous, extra evidence which was outside of the scope of this indictment.  And we were very careful in so doing, so that this case has remained consistent throughout the Prosecution's case.  There has been no time in which we have changed the case for the Prosecution, in which we have made up the case for the Prosecution as we went along.  So, this consistency, Madam President, we would rely on to show that at all material times the Accused would have known and did, in fact, know what was the case he had come to meet.

With respect to -- with respect to our modes of liability, the Defence has stated that we listed modes of liability willy-nilly.  We would submit, Madam President, that when one looks both at our indictment and pre-trial brief, that the modes of liability that we pleaded, we led evidence upon.  

Madam President, even if -- and, of course, we submit that this is not so -- even if the Trial Chamber were to make a finding that our indictment has been defective or has been vague, the essence of what is -- what the Trial Chamber would have to decide is whether any prejudice has accrued to the Defence.  

We will show, Madam President that no prejudice accrued to the Defence.  The Defence had adequate notice of every count, of every material fact.  Madam President, we are not obliged to plead evidence in our indictment, but to plead material facts, and we did so.  The Defence, on the basis of our disclosure, the witness statements, the pre-trial brief of the Prosecutor, was able to prepare his Defence, was able to adequately brief witnesses for the Defence, was able to cross-examine the witnesses for the Prosecution.  None of these indicies, Madam President, Your Honours point to a lack of ability to prepare their Defence.  So that we would submit that, having regard to all of the above, that our indictment, far from being imprecise or vague, was specific, and that the Accused did know what case he had come to meet.  

The Accused has alleged as well, Madam President, that we have been imprecise with respect to the place of the offence.  Madam President, we find this allegation to be passing strange.  This was not a matter in which there were many massacre sites.  The Prosecution alleged one thing, and one thing only in this respect, that the Tutsis were gathered at Nyange parish church, and that that church was destroyed with around, 2000 Tutsi therein.  So that the place of the massacres, the place where the killings took place has always been abundantly clear.  

With respect, as well, to the time period, we -- the statements would have shown that the Tutsis were attacked around the 13th, 14th and 15th, and that the church was finally destroyed on the 16th.

In the -- coming back to the law, Madam President, in the Kamuhanda appeal of the 22nd of January 2004, the issue of the vagueness of the indictment was also a live one.  I would not dwell on all of the allegations, but would merely note that in paragraph 59 of this judgement, the Trial Chamber found that the indictment was not vague, and that it sufficiently gave the Defence notice of the allegations.

This is also borne out, Madam President, Your Honours, in the appeals judgement of Semanza of the 20th of May 2005; and I would refer to paragraphs 85 to 88 of this decision.  In the latest judgement of the Appeals Chamber, that is Naletilic which was delivered on the 3rd of May 2006, the question of specificity of indictments was extensively addressed.  The Accused had submited that the indictment was vague, that it was too vague and that it did not plead several events for which he had been found responsible.  The Appeals Chamber in paragraphs 24, 26 and 27 of this judgement looked conclusively at the judgements in Nykitegeka and Kupreskic, and the decision follows the spirit of Kupreskic.

In conclusion, Madam President, of this part of our closing arguments, I would like to point out that there is a distinct difference between -- between the Prosecution not pleading material facts, and the Prosecution pleading material facts and supporting these material facts with evidence throughout the trial.  Madam President, our indictment, if we must say so ourselves, is a good one.  It underlies the trial.  It was meticulously pled; and it supported what was, in fact, an intricately woven case.  The indictment is not vague.  The Accused has not been prejudiced in any way.  And the Prosecution relies upon the indictment as the main accusatory instrument, and submits that it appropriately and precisely pinpoints the criminal conduct of the Accused, Athanase Seromba.

Madam President, I thank you.  And we would now have Mr. Townsend, who would continue our submissions on the authority of the Accused.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, there will be lunch break.  We will continue until 1 o'clock and then we take our break.  If the parties agree, if you allow us to -- for us to gain some bit of time, so we will break for just one hour and resume at 2, if the parties agree. 
MR. TOWNSEND: 
May it please the Trial Chamber, Gregory Townsend appearing for the Prosecutor.  We are in your hands for scheduling.  That is fine with us, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  

But I turn to the Defence, do you have any problem with the scheduling I have proposed?  
MR. NEKUIE:
(No interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think counsel said that they agreed, but, unfortunately, the microphone was not on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, counsel for the Defence.  

And turns to Counsel Townsend; pray continue, it is now your turn.  
MR. TOWNSEND: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  For this portion of the Prosecutor's closing argument, I prepared a       Power Point presentation with a few slides to briefly highlight and discuss a few aspects of the Prosecutor's case.  If I can call on the technical support room to please display what is -- what should be online for them.  Thank you.  

To give you an overview of my presentation, Your Honours, I intend to address five specific issues.  First one was that Seromba was the priest in charge.  The second topic would be that Seromba ordered the bulldozing of Nyange church on 16th April 1994.  Third point, Seromba's modes of participation in genocide, count 1, and in crimes against humanity, extermination, count 4.  Fourth point would be a display of the evidence depicting Nyange church.  Fifth and final point, Your Honours, we will be discussing the mens rea of Seromba and the consciousness of guilt displayed by some of the evidence which goes to prove his mens rea.  
The first topic illustrates that the Prosecutor has proved, that Seromba was the priest in charge of Nyange.  Twelve Prosecution witnesses and the Defence witnesses gave evidence that Seromba was the priest in charge of Nyange.  I have given the citation to our brief where that fact is proven, and to give you a few examples of that evidence I would cite CNJ first, who testified that Seromba was "A person of authority."  CBK testified that, "Seromba can give orders at the parish."  CBS testified, "Seromba could give instructions."  CBJ, testifying in regard to Seromba, said: "I considered him my God." 

Defence witness conceded that Seromba was the priest in charge.  One particular fact which also goes to prove this point was that Seromba was a member of the Nyange security council in April 1994.

Because Seromba was priest in charge he was able to give orders.  And the act of ordering is a mode of participation about which the Appeals Chamber in Kordic held, and I quote, "The actus reus of ordering means that a person in a position of authority instructs another person to commit an offence.  A formal superior-subordinate relationship between the Accused and the perpetrator is not required."

Applying that same test, Seromba was a priest, and occupied a position of authority; such position of authority need not be political or military.  All priests, even including a vicar, could hold a position of authority.  As was the test in Gacumbitsi, all priests would hold moral authority.  The evidence shows that because Seromba was a priest, perpetrators followed his order.  This, in fact, created an informal superior-subordinate relationship between the priest, Seromba, and those that followed his orders.

Defence witness BZ4 testified that Kivumu, the commune in which Nyange is located, is 85 percent Catholic.  The church in Nyange was the moral authority, and Seromba was the physical manifestation of that authority.  The distinction, whether Seromba was a vicar or an acting parish priest, is in fact legally irrelevant to analyse his participation in ordering.  Thus canon law, as cited by the Defence, is also irrelevant.  

Witness PA1, a Defence witness, testified that after the bulldozing of Nyange church, Seromba was assigned to remain at Nyange.  This evidence, that of PA1, is circumstantial evidence that Seromba was, in fact, in charge and in authority during the time period in question.

My second point is to illustrate that the Prosecutor has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Seromba ordered the bulldozing of Nyange church.  We rely on the evidence to show that, including the testimony of witnesses and the statements -- the written statements of the bulldozer driver himself.  And this goes to prove our count of an act of genocide.  And I have given you the references where this is fleshed out in our brief.
CDL testified that Seromba said, and I quote, "if you have no other means, bring the bulldozers and destroy the church."

CBK testified that the bulldozer driver asked Father Seromba thrice, "Should we destroy the church?"  And then Father Seromba answered, "Destroy the church.  We the Hutu are many in number, and furthermore in the house of God, demons have got in there.  And we are going to build another church." 

CBJ testified that, "The bulldozer driver -- spoke to him, Seromba, saying 'Really Father, do you accept that I should destroy this church?'  I saw Father Athanase Seromba nod.  The driver spoke to him again, to Father Seromba.  And then for a third time, 'Father do you accept that I should destroy this church?'  And Father Seromba answered in these words, 'Unless you yourselves are Inyenzi, destroy it.  All we want is to get rid of Inyenzi.  As for the rest of it, we are the Hutu and many.  If we get rid of the Inyenzi, we will build another church.'"

You will note in these three quotations the words are almost identical, "destroy the church; destroy the church; destroy it."  Seromba is questioned by the bulldozer driver three times.  The third time, "We, the Hutu are many.  We, the Hutu are many.  We will build another church."  And, again, "We will build another church."  This corroboration shows the truthfulness of those witnesses in testifying about the actual order given by Seromba.  

CBJ testified, and I quote, "I saw Father Seromba touch his pockets, and he dipped into his pocket, gave something, put something in the driver's hand.  The driver smiled.  He, Seromba, did it as if he was giving something to the driver."  This is offered to prove that Seromba not only ordered the bulldozing of Nyange church, but that he paid for it.  

CNJ testified: "He, the bulldozer driver, started to drive the caterpillar into the wall.  Seromba said, 'Watch out, make sure the wall doesn't fall on you.'"  CNJ also testified that as the bulldozer driver-- as the bulldozer was destroying the church wall, and as people were moving, the Caterpillar moved forward, so the authority too moved forward.  Seromba followed the movements of the bulldozer."  This proves that Seromba supervised the execution of his order.

CBK testified about facts after the bulldozing.  And he testified: "Father Seromba asked the person who had destroyed the church to remove the debris.  The driver refused.  Seromba proposed to give him 30,000 francs so that he could remove the rubbish.  And that is when he acquiesced."  This evidence of Seromba's actions after the bulldozing of the church shows him ordering the bulldozer driver in another context. 

CBK testified, again, about facts after the bulldozing.  And testified as follows, "Father Seromba was distributing beer saying, 'you have worked well.' There was some kind of party.  People were very happy.  I, therefore, understood that "worked well" meant that they had killed people in the church.  It seemed to me like Father Seromba was very happy."  Now these celebratory and congratulatory acts by Seromba about work, which meant kill, shows his authority in ordering that same killing.  

Now going away from the testimony and referring to the written statements.  Nkinamubanzi gave several statements, he was the bulldozer driver.  And in one such statement he gave in Rwanda that has been admitted by the Defence, it reads as follows:  "The priest asked me to destroy the church, and added that they were going to build another one.  I put the following question to him:  'Are we going to destroy the house of God?'  And he replied, 'Destroy it, we will build another one.'"  You see an amazing correlation between what the Prosecution witnesses testified and what the bulldozer driver himself said on a previous occasion.  In his statement to ICTR investigators, Nkinamubanzi, the bulldozer driver, stated the following:  "Seromba stated the following, Seromba said it has been decided, it, the church, indeed, has to be destroyed.  We shall build another one."  In the same statement later, Nkinamubanzi said, in regard to fact after the bulldozing a part of the church, Seromba approached Nkinamubanzi and said, "Destroy all of those walls, nothing must be left standing."  With that evidence we'd submit, Your Honours, that we have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Seromba, in fact, gave the order to bulldoze.  

To turn briefly to my third topic, we would offer to discuss here Seromba's mode of participation.  The Defence have contested that we have pled specifically the modes of participation for count 1, genocide, and count 4, crimes against humanity extermination.  

Article 6.1 of the ICTR statute provides five different modes of participation; in other words, types of acts for which an accused with be held criminally responsible; namely, planning, instigating, ordering, committing, aiding and abetting; those are the five modes.  Now, one mode of participation does not excludes another.  To give you an example, an Accused can plan, then later give an order, then commit the crime.  That is exactly what Seromba did, at least three different modes of participation with regard to one criminal act.

Now, I would submit that Judge Williams confirmed the indictment against Seromba in 2001, which included all five modes of participation against Seromba for counts 1 and 4.  After having analysed the evidence at trial, our brief specifies the particular modes for participation for each of 27 different acts that we have attributed to Seromba as proved.  For those counts, I have given the citation.  And I note in this regard that in none of our modes of participation charged in our brief, do we allege instigating.  So we have, in fact, limited ourselves.  We have been quite specific.
This brings us to my fourth point, which is to illustrate some of the facts proved regarding Nyange church itself.  This is a photograph, Exhibit P. 3-21, which depicts Nyange church as it was before it was bulldozed.  The following photograph is photo Exhibit P. 2-29, which was an invitation to the 50th jubilee at Nyange parish.  You will see in the Kinyarwanda on the top of what appears to be a postcard, what is Nyange parish in Kinyarwanda.  And you will note that it says 1993 on the bottom right corner, and that corresponds to the evidence before that this parish, and this church, in fact, would have been celebrating its 50th jubilee in that year.  It doesn't make sense that the Defence would contend that they would put a picture of a different church and send it around.  

And when you compare what is our Exhibit P. 3-21 postcard, you will see it is the same church.  You will see on the left-hand side there are two small windows, above the door five windows.  And the tower contains three rows of three windows each, and a cross above the door and a small cross on top of the tower.  The silhouettes are almost identical.  

Now, Nyange church could hold 2,000 people.  And it is our submission, Your Honours, that we have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that, in fact, 2,000 people were inside at the time of the bulldozing on the orders of Seromba.  I will be brief and just refer to the highlighted words here.  CBS testifies, "I think there was more than 2,000 of us; the church was full."  CBT also testified, "The church was full" giving the number 2,000.  CBN said, "The church was full." He estimated that Tutsi there as 2,000.  CBK testified that the church, in fact, could hold 3,000 and that it was, in fact, full.  YAU testified that, "The church was packed."  BZ14 used the same words, "The church was packed full," referring to the days just before its bulldozing.  Two other Defence witnesses, BZ2 and BZ5 testified that "Nyange church was enormous."  

Now, with regard to the number of seats, CBT testified that: "There must have been about 2,000."  CDL estimated the number between 1,500 and 2,000.  FE27, as 1,500.  And finally, CNJ estimated the seats number between 1,000, 1,400.  This is just evidence to give you an indication of how many people could have been in there standing, men women and children crammed in.  

Exhibit P. 4 is an Rwandan report which shows the size or dimensions of Nyange church.  And I will read from the blocked quote here, "Nyange church was completely demolished, with the exception of the foundation, measuring 55 metres by 19 metres.  The rubble mixed with the remains of bodies are heaped together behind the fence."  So, this Rwanda report stated the dimensions of the foundation that remained after the bulldozing as 55 by 19 metres, that would give you a surface area of more than 1,000 square metres.  

Prosecutor's Exhibit P. 2 was the ICTR investigator's report, and he measured off that same foundation.  You will see in the top left corner of this slide the measurement that he came up with, which were 55 metres by 18 metres.  Now, that if you multiply gives you a square metre, surface area of 1053.  So, between 1045 and 1053, you are only 8 metres difference.  So, that gives you two pieces of evidence entirely consistent to show that size which would, in fact, give you evidence as to how many people would have fit inside, and how many people were, in fact, bulldozed.  

Now photo Exhibit P. 2-30 is a photograph giving you a partial view of the interior of Nyange church.  Several witnesses testified that this was a photograph of the inside of Nyange church on a previous occasion with a priest who is not the Accused.  And you will get an idea from just this partial view of the size of Nyange church.

Lastly, on this topic, I would just like to situate Nyange church, as a reminder, that the church being here on the hill was located next to the presbytery compound, and the presbytery where Seromba slept.

My fifth and final topic, Your Honours, is to explain how the evidence of Seromba's consciousness of guilt helps prove his mens rea.  The term "consciousness of guilt" is defined as proof that after a crime was committed, the Accused did any number of acts calculated to avoid detection, arrest, prosecution or conviction, has been considered circumstantial evidence, probative of mental state called consciousness of guilt.  We pled this specifically in our brief.

Now, Seromba gave his true name at his initial appearance was on the 8th of August 2002 before Judge Pillay.  And he stated, "I am known as Father Seromba Athanase.  He said later in the same transcript, "My name is Seromba, Athanase."  He was asked specifically by the Judge, "And you don't have any other name?"  To which he responded, "No".  But, in fact, we've led evidence and introduced evidence here in Exhibit P. 6, which shows Seromba as using the false name, Sumba Bura, on an Italian residence permit application.  This is evidence of an act calculated to avoid detection and arrest.  

Seromba used a false passport, here Exhibit P. 7 bis, this Zairian passport has been admitted.  And you will note on that same false passport that Seromba has given a false name, a false nationality as being Zairian, a false date of birth and a false place of birth.  His use of this passport, well after his arrival in Italy, shows he was trying to avoid detection.  He is covering his tracks.  He is hiding from something, Your Honours.  Exhibit P. 8 is his use of the same false name on a letter written in his own hand.  You will see, in the top excerpt, he calls himself abbe Sumba Athanase, and the same letter, "Je appelle abbe Sumba Bura Athanase.  Even the same document, he is mixing up what is his false name.  Once it is Sumba, and  here it is Sumba Bura.

Now, in addition to those documents, he concocted a false alibi, which is other evidence of his       mens rea.  Earlier you heard about him being interview by La Nazione, that has been admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 18, and I quote, this is from Seromba being interviewed:  "That massacre occurred between the 14th and the 16th of April 1994, but I left the village on the 6th of April.  I wasn't there when the massacre was committed." 

They deny that he ever made that statement to the journalist.  But in the same article, later on he repeats it, so the journalist would have to get it wrong twice if you believe their version of the facts.  And I quote, "That is not possible.  I repeat that I left Rwanda on the 6th of April, it is all documented."  Now, in fact, the only documents we ever got from the Defence is D. 31, which is an admission that the Accused states that he was present at the parish of Nyange during the massacres of the Tutsis.  So he's given a false alibi, by their own admission.  

Now one witness, Farruggia, and Italian journalist came and testified.  And this is corroborating the press clipping itself.  Now, he said that Seromba said, "I'm not Mr. Seromba, my name is Sumba Bura.  And the last quote that he said he was not there.  So this confirms that he did, in fact, give a false alibi.  And going back to the same letter, you will see that Seromba himself gives his date of ordination in his own hand as the 18th of July 1993.  And now you go from his letter to the press clipping, you will see that the journalist, in fact, got the date of ordination exactly correct, 18th July 1993.  So we submit, that the handwritten letter gives the same ordination date as the interview that shows the journalist got it right, correctly recorded his false alibi.  

Now, in conclusions, Your Honours, Prosecutor has proved that Seromba was priest in charge, that he held a position of authority by which he ordered the bulldozing of Nyange church on 16th April 1994.  We have clearly specified the modes of participation, that is, acts by which he is criminally responsible.  Nyange church held 2,000 victims, and Seromba is responsible for the deaths of all of them, an historic act of genocide.  

In addition to the acts proven by the Prosecution, his mens rea has been proved, and consciousness of guilt is further evidence of that.  

I thank Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you Counsel Townsend.  I think that Counsel Moses could take over just after the break; just a moment please, I wish to consult. 

You wanted to say something. 

MR. MOSES:
Just to assist Your Honours, if I can indicate I will be approximately 20 to 25 minutes with my submission, which I think will take us to almost exactly two and a half hours from when we commenced our pleadings, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that information, so that we will cover the three hours requested by the Prosecution for the final arguments.  
MS. ARBIA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I should like to give you now the references I omitted with regard to Furundzija and the approving spectator, 10th of December 1998, paragraph 207 in the matter concerned, Furundzija, 10th of December 1998. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall now break and return at 2 p.m. to hear Counsel Moses, and                       thereafter -- subsequent to which we will hear the Defence.  Thank you very much. 
(Court recessed at 1255H)
(Pages 16 to 31 by Donna M. Lewis)






















(Court resumed at 1409H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session.  

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

Prosecutor, could you now continue with the closing arguments of the Prosecution.  
MR. MOSES:
Yes.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, I intend to cover two areas in my address to Your Honours.  The first area is in respect to the Defence case, and secondly, I'm briefly going to touch on the issue of sentencing, though, as we indicated earlier, that's a topic which we may return to after we've heard from the Defence.  

When I -- we look at the Defence case, Your Honours, I can advise you that I do not intend to canvass the witness testimony witness by witness.  The Prosecution has filed a detailed analysis of the witness testimony, both for the Prosecution and Defence witnesses, and have already referred in those closing brief to the relevant parts of the transcript.  And it's obviously a matter for Your Honours to determine issues of credibility of the witnesses who have testified before Your Honours.  

What I want to do briefly is look at and highlight for Your Honours what the Prosecution considers has been the evolving, ever-changing nature of the Accused's position in the face of what we say was a strong and compelling Prosecution case.  

The first indication of the attitude of this Accused was indicated by the evidence given by Mr. Farrugia, which my friend Mr. Townsend has referred to you a little bit earlier.  His initial defence, if I can put it that way, was, "I wasn't there.  I left on the 6th of April."  

Now, that was clearly a false alibi and one which is a matter for Your Honours, but you may consider that the Accused decided at some later point was a defence that clearly was not going to fly, that these accusations being made against him were not going to go away and he needed to come up with a different approach or a different strategy.  

So, in our submission, at the outset of this trial, it appeared that his attitude was, "Well, yes, I was there at Nyange, at Nyange parish, during the relevant period, but I'm being falsely charged, like my fellow priests, Nturiye and Kayiranga," who, nudge, nudge, Your Honours, they were acquitted on appeal in Rwanda.  This, of course, Your Honours, was a transparent attempt by the Accused, to use an English expression, to hold on to the coat-tails of someone else's case.  An attempt to align his case with the other priests' case, those other priests who clearly had a substantially different case in allegations against them.  

As I've indicated, the allegations regarding those other two priests were quite different to the allegations that have been leveled by the Prosecution against Father Seromba.  The allegation against this Accused is that he took part in meetings in the days leading up to the destruction of the church where he planned the killing of the refugees who were inside Nyange church.  And furthermore, on the day of the destruction of the church, he gave the order to the bulldozer driver to destroy the church.  

Your Honours have the benefit of a copy of the Rwandan file in relation to Father Nturiye and Father Kayiranga's case.  And there are three quick points that need to be made.  The first is one, really, which I've just covered, namely, that the allegations against those two other priests are quite different to the allegations being made against Father Seromba.  

The second point is that the appeals court in Rwanda made no adverse findings of credibility in respect of any of the Prosecution witnesses who were called in this case and in this trial.  

Your Honours may recall that the appellate court in Rwanda excluded some witness's testimony due to the Rwandan law, which did not permit people to be both plaintiffs in a civil case and witnesses in a criminal case in respect of the same issues.  

The third point, and third distinction, which I'd ask Your Honours to note in respect of the two cases, is that those two priests, who Your Honours will recall arrived at Nyange at around midday on the 15th of April, that is, they were at Nyange parish for less than 24 hours before the destruction of the church, they were able to call, in respect of their defence, survivor refugee witnesses who were prepared to testify on their behalf.  

In this Defence case, it will not have escaped Your Honours' notice that there was not a single refugee survivor from any period at which refugees took refuge in Nyange church who were prepared to come and testify on behalf of this Accused.  For a priest who would ordinarily command respect, he was unable to call upon a single person.  

Then if we look at the way in which the Defence case developed during the second part of the trial, namely, the Defence -- the Defence case, it appears, Your Honour, that for the first 16 witnesses that were called the Defence, so far as the events of 16th of April, ran something like this:  "I was inside the presbytery, and I was not seen by any of the Defence witnesses who I've called, who have indicated that they would have seen me if I was outside by the bulldozer and would have heard about it if I had been outside by the bulldozer."  

Many witnesses were called and led by the Defence to testify that they had been in the group of people surrounding Nyange church on the dates leading up to and on the 16th of April.  And Your Honours will recall that they were led and they said that they had not seen the Accused on the 16th, during the attacks, and that if he had been outside, they would have seen him, and they hadn't even heard of him being outside on the 16th.  

Now, of course, the Prosecution position to that proposition is a simple one, namely, so what?  As we have indicated in our submissions, there were several thousand people outside, and the fact that some witnesses saw certain people in authority and not others is irrelevant.  But what I want to illustrate is the way in which the Defence case changed midstream.  

You will recall that the seventeenth witness called was Mr. Nkinamubanzi, the bulldozer driver.  And he's been referred to in the Defence brief at page 70, though, I note that he had been referred to as possible Prosecution Witness CBQ, whereas, in effect, he was -- had been initially listed as Prosecution Witness CBO. 

It is sometimes said, Your Honours, that desperate times call for desperate measures.  And the Prosecution says that it indeed was a desperate measure of the Defence to call Mr. Nkinamubanzi.  It would have been very apparent by the end of his testimony why the Prosecution did not call him as a witness of truth.  

In this Court Mr. Nkinamubanzi had said that the Accused was outside by the bulldozer on the 16th of April and that Seromba had said to the assistant bourgmestre, Rushema, that he had forbidden him the previous day to kill.  And then we heard, didn't we, Your Honours, of a person by the name of Makuvu apparently pushing the Accused with the butt of a gun and dragging him across the floor.  And that was all after the church had begun to be demolished.  

It raises, Your Honours, some interesting questions.  Firstly, why did the Defence call people earlier to say that they had been there on the 16th and they hadn't seen the Accused and that they hadn't heard the Accused had been outside there, if, in fact, the Defence case was that he had not been outside on the 16th by the bulldozer?  

Secondly, Your Honour, was this version of events given by Mr. Nkinamubanzi ever put to a single Prosecution witness who had been present there on the 16th, as required by Rule 89(A)(2)?  Was this an issue that had ever been raised by the Accused before trial when he had been interviewed about the events at Nyange?  Was this version ever mentioned by the Defence at any stage, including the Defence opening prior to Nkinamubanzi's testimony?  We all know the answer to those questions is a resounding "no".  

If anyone, especially someone in the Accused's position had been accused of, amongst other things, ordering the destruction of their own church, then can I suggest to Your Honours it would have been the first -- the very first thing that would have been said in their defence.  

The Accused has had the benefit of very experienced counsel representing him, and you can be sure that you would have been hearing that version of events time after time after time if there had been a grain of truth in them.  

Yes, after Nkinamubanzi testified, the Defence did call Witness PA1, who testified that the Accused had run out of the presbytery towards the church.  That, you will recall, is something that Witness PA1 had never said on any earlier occasion in statements regarding the events.  You will recall that PA1 also said that he was present with Witness NA1.  NA1 testified before Mr. Nkinamubanzi gave this version of events, and you will recall that Witness NA1 said nothing of the kind.  

As I say, Your Honour, desperate times call for desperate measures, and calling Nkinamubanzi was a desperate measure.  Your Honour has been referred to by my friend, Mr. Townsend, to some of the statements made by Nkinamubanzi when he was interviewed about these events on various occasions from 1994 to 2001.  And I don't intend to go through them, other than to mention that he gave a statement on the 4th of March 1994, the 19th of April 1995, the 22nd of July '97, the 27th of July 2001, and the 7th of November 2001, in which he gave consistent evidence which corroborates the accounts given by the Prosecution witnesses.  

The Prosecution says that for a man who we say was paid only a few thousand francs to destroy a church full of people, it would not take much to persuade such a person to change their evidence and to lie on behalf of the Accused.  

Your Honours, an accused does not have to call or give evidence.  An accused does not have to prove anything.  An accused is entitled to say to the Prosecution, "You've charged me; you prove it."  Here the Accused has chosen to call evidence.  The Prosecution says that what they are trying to say about the ordering of the destruction of Nyange -- is unsure what they are trying to say regarding the ordering of the destruction of Nyange church.  Is it that they were saying, "I wasn't outside by the bulldozer, I was inside the presbytery all the relevant time"?  Or is it, "Yes, I was outside, but I had a gun pointed at me as I tried to prevent the destruction"?  Or is it both?  Are they trying to place a dollar bet on both possible defences and have Your Honours -- and their defence is, "Well, I was inside the presbytery the whole time, but if Your Honours don't buy that, then I -- if I was outside, I was there under duress."  

Your Honours, this Accused has been cornered and is wriggling to try and escape from the inevitable, which accounts from the changing nature of the defence that he has been running.  

As I have indicated, Your Honour, an accused does not have to prove anything, and here the Prosecution says they haven't.  They certainly haven't raised any reasonable doubt, and the Prosecutor submits that the case has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  

I want to now turn very briefly to the issue of sentencing.  It's in chapter six of our written submissions.  And Your Honours will note that we referred to six aggravating circumstances that we say should be taken into account in determining sentence of the Accused.  Those were Seromba's position as a priest in the church and his breach of trust so far as members of his congregation.  Seromba's -- secondly, that Seromba's crimes were premeditated.  Thirdly, that Seromba directly participated in the massacres.  Fourthly, Seromba's order to bulldoze the church caused some 2000 deaths.  The fifth aggravating feature was the violent and humiliating nature of Seromba's acts, and we've outlined those in our submissions.  And the sixth matter which was outlined was the duration of time during which the victims had suffered.  

In addition to those six, Your Honours, there is one additional aggravating feature that I want to ask Your Honours to take into account, and that is that Seromba attacked a church and safe haven.  In the case of Kayishema and Ruzindana -- the date of the decision was the 21st of May 1999, at paragraph 16 -- the Chamber there held that the fact that Kayishema attacked places traditionally regarded as safe havens, including the church, constituted an aggravating circumstance.  

Nyange church was considered a safe haven, and in respect of that, I refer you to paragraph 453 of our brief.  Here the overwhelming evidence proves that Seromba is responsible for the bulldozing of Nyange church on the 16th of April 1994, a place previously considered a safe haven and sanctuary for the victims and that this is an additional aggravating circumstance.  

And for all those reasons, Your Honour, the Prosecutor calls for the Accused to be convicted and to be sentenced to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.  

Subject to any additional submissions that we may make at the end of our -- of the Defence submissions, Your Honours, those are our submissions.  Thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Moses.  

I want to find out if there are any questions for the Prosecution before we now hear members of the Defence team.  Any questions from my colleagues?  No.  Fine.  

Counsel Monthé, you may now wish to start with your closing arguments.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, thank you.

Madam President, Your Honours, it is my responsibility to submit before you in the Defence of Father Seromba -- I would be lying to your Court if I were not to say to you that I was struck by emotion.  What a difficult trial.  What a demanding trial.  What a painful trial for the Defence.  

Madam President, I come from a family which believes in God, where we believe in the strength of their spirits.  And it is the first time in my life, after a rather lengthy career, that I have to defend a priest.  And, believe me, it looked like, might I say, the stations of the Cross.  The path of the Lord is uncontroversial.  Maybe we are all experiencing Christ's Passion, but then we have to face that challenge.  I, earlier on, had listened with keen interest to the four colleagues of mine of the Prosecution, but if you allow me, let me state with the Bible.  I had heard somebody talk about the path to Jericho, but the walls did not give way to the trumpets, because at no time, despite the use or the technique of untruths and false truths there was no possibility of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Father Seromba, present here, was guilty of the serious accusations being leveled against him by the Prosecution.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to solemnly draw the attention of your Court to this trial, which is an unusual trial.  You only need to look at the public gallery which, since this morning, has been filling up, whereas we've spent a number of years here just being amongst ourselves.  These are indications that are not misleading.  I would like to tell you, with the seriousness that I owe you, but with the respect that I owe you as a man of the law, that we Africans know how our republics are managed.  And, quite often, it is the case that in countries emerging from a tragedy, like Rwanda, the country we're talking about today, I mean the tragedy that occurred in 1994 -- in our countries we know that slander, gratuitous accusations, settling of cause, are matters that occur day in, day out.  It, therefore, lies with you as the Judges to be fully lucid, to be impartial.  You need courage.  That applies even to those leaders who might be remote controlling this trial, because we need to put one final end to this kind of slander or campaign and enable your Court to make that distinction between honest citizens who must be released from prisons and those who are really guilty and who need and ought to be punished.  
Madam President, it is merely a matter of honesty for me to say to you, now that this trial is coming to an end, that those who are accusing Father Seromba who were in the same position as himself in 1994, they might have not acted otherwise, and that is the reality.  However, I would like to say to you, as an introduction, that this trial, you know, has become the ultimate clash between truth and rumour, rumours that are orchestrated by a so-called human rights organisation, which goes by the name of African Rights.  It is actually a creation, a fabrication of the powers that be in Kigali, so-called, made up of survivors.  

The aim being sought by this trial, Your Honours, which we do know, by the way, because we were all in Rwanda when we went to inspect the sites.  You see, for them, the unfortunate Father Seromba is already a doomed person, already convicted.  And a lot of people with whom we were talking were asking me, "Well, why are you defending him?  You have no luck."  And unceasingly or tirelessly, I told them, "I am standing by him because I believe in the strength of the law."  And that's why I'm here today.  

Madam President, the most serious fact is that through Father Seromba, who was a rural priest in Nyange and whose official position was vicar and which unfortunately is referred to as the parish priest or the curate in the indictment -- now, I was saying, through Father Athanase Seromba, we are talking about attacking the Roman Catholic Church so as to prove, through the sentencing or conviction of this unfortunate priest, to prove that the Roman Catholic Church participated in the genocide in 1994 in Rwanda.  And in doing so, it is not a matter of dispute.  It cannot even be talked of because it seems to me that those who are in power in Kigali today blamed the Roman Catholic Church for having worked hand in glove with the regime of the late President Habyarimana.  So, Your Honours, that is why we are fighting against, not so much against the law, as against some diabolical rumour which has transformed this client, that I have to defend, into the planner, the main actor, the person -- the enforcer entirely of the massacres that occurred in Nyange in 1994.  

Madam President, on the 31st of October this last year -- sorry, 31st of October 2005, in this Tribunal, not in this same courtroom, I said to you that what was happening with respect to Father Seromba was unacceptable.  Here is someone who is assumed to be innocent, and the president of the republic at the time, I'm referring to Pasteur Bizimungu, this was the man who, during the anniversary of the genocide in Cyangugu, that president, without blinking said to the entire population of Rwanda, he said to them that Father Seromba had destroyed his church.  It was not substantiated.  It was not checked.  No verification was made.  It was a gratuitous assertion on his part.  So those are the circumstances under which Athanase Seromba finds himself in this storm that will chase him, right until his parish in Italy where he was officiating in a manner that satisfied both the clergy and members of his parish.  

Madam President, now to put an end to this unfounded rumour, and this attempt to surround him with a rumour, Father Seromba, an honest man, respectful of justice and seeking to ensure that justice is achieved on his own initiative, took the initiative to appear here in Arusha before you.  While making my presentation, I'll get back to the circumstances under which he opted to appear here.  But let me point out to your Court, and let it be recorded, that Father Seromba, prior to that, had sent at least two letters to the Office of the Prosecutor.  He got no answers to his letters.  He had to turn to the Italian authorities, who made a plane available to him, and he was then moved to Arusha and he appeared on his own.  You can check on the records of the Tribunal.  His good faith is not in dispute.  He wanted to be tried, and he came in order to be tried.  And as Jean-Paul Sartre would have said, he is willing, prepared and ready to be tried.  And so you are being told through various newspapers in Rwanda, through the media in Rwanda, you're told that Father Seromba is a perpetrator of genocide.  

Madam President, Your Honours, the prejudice suffered by Father Seromba is incurable.  Even if you were to acquit him, it will still remain in the minds of people that he was a perpetrator of genocide.  He had already been convicted by the powers in office in Rwanda, without even being tried.  And I was saying that that is in disregard of the principle of presumption of innocence.  The presumption of innocence -- maybe we should dwell on this slightly, and it is important for the purposes of this trial.  Now, this was a matter that was developed by philosophers like Pothier -- and for the record, Pothier is spelt P-O-T-H-I-E-R -- which was a concept developed in the 18th century, and it is the cornerstone, let's say the crucible of law in all developed countries.  It has been asserted and reaffirmed in the declaration of human rights and of the citizens, dated 26th of August 1789, in article 9, thereof, which provides, and I quote, "All men be presumed innocent until they are declared guilty.  If it is deemed inevitable to have him arrested, any stringency that would have been -- would not be necessary to guarantee that his person is arrested should be condemned or penalised by the law."   

The universal declaration of human rights was adopted by the United Nations in 1948, provides in article 1, and I quote, "Anyone, any person accused of an offence is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is lawfully proven or legally proven in the course of an open trial, wherein all the guarantees with respect to his defence are provided to him."   

The international covenant on civic and political rights, in article 14(2) states, and I quote, "Any individual accused of a criminal offence is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is legally proven."  (Unintelligible) in 7(2), and I quote again, "All individuals have right -- have -- are entitled to have their case heard.  And those rights include the right to the presumption of innocence until guilt is established by a competent court.  The European convention of the safeguarding of human rights and the rights of the citizen does say in article 6(2), and I quote, "Any person accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent until his or her guilt is lawfully proven."   
Finally, Madam President, Your Honours, the statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, under 22, states, "Any person against whom charges are brought is entitled that his or her case be heard fairly and openly."  As for 3, it states, "Any person accused is presumed to be innocent until his or her guilt is proven in accordance with the provisions of this statute."   

Unfortunately, what do we see?  The proceedings instituted or initiated today against Father Seromba feature mainly -- or, is based on the fact that it relies on testimonies that have been triggered by the Prosecutor himself.  

The preparatory examination of that trial -- or, the preparation of that trial -- or, at the very least, what could stand for it, is merely an attempt that is reinvented or renewed at the time of each testimony, so that what I term the presumption of guilt is pursued, which is laid as an initial hypothesis against this honourable clergyperson.  

Madam President, Your Honours, let me say, because it is of an exceptional seriousness of gravity, up until this very last week, the Prosecutor, in his biased approach, approached CF4 and CF5, whom we decided not to have appear here, and we did inform your Court accordingly, your Prosecutor -- or, the Prosecutor said -- managed to want to get them to appear before you.  This is a procedure that is unpardonable.  It cannot be confessed to.  But let each one deal with his or her conscious.  But then there has to be a manner of approaching this matter.  We have a manner in which we approach it.  The elderly would tell us if you don't get involved, if you don't face challenges, you can never succeed in a glorious manner.  

Nothing can be hidden, Prosecutor, you see, especially in Rwanda.  What shocks the Defence is that you have forgotten, throughout these proceedings, that there is, for the Prosecution, and there is equally for the Defence.  That is what leaves us shocked.  That is why, Madam President, you will not be surprised in reading the indictment brought before you that the charges against Father Seromba are extremely vaguely worded.  I wonder why, however, when this indictment -- excuse me, when this indictment was prepared, who we were dealing with and what exactly he was accused of.  

Madam President, you will note, carefully reading through this indictment, that there is a great lack of precision as to time and place, as to identity.  The roles ascribed to one or another, and in particular to Father Seromba and, finally, with respect to the victims, custom before criminal courts, Madam President, is that indeed after preparatory examination, the Prosecutor is supposed to put together indices and evidence in the indictment.  And, in the instance that was not done, otherwise how is it possible for the Prosecutor to accuse Father Seromba to be a coperpetrator or an accomplice in genocide, in complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity, extermination?  How can you accuse Father Seromba of being a coperpetrator of the murder of Anicet Gatare who -- who surrendered himself to the gendarmes who were there at the parish to ensure the security of the civilians to be killed instead of his parents and his family and Boniface Gatare and -- and another name the interpreter missed -- and who had sought refuge at Nyange and who is supposed to be protected by Father Seromba.  Can you protect yourself or anyone else against the law since the gendarmes there were -- were there for the purpose of protecting the refugees?  Otherwise, why is Father Seromba brought before you to be accused on that count?  Is it possible, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to accuse Father Seromba of having allegedly sacked Félicien, Gasore, Alexis and Patrice, who were, allegedly, Tutsi employed by the parish without anyone having established that and being declared as dead without anyone having proven their death?  Otherwise why did they send this clergyman to be accused on that account?  

Is it possible, ladies and gentlemen, to accuse Father Seromba at the conclusion of preparatory examination of having locked in the church refugees, deprived them of food, of water, of religious rights, whereas he'd received them with an open heart unconditionally at the parish a few days before, and housed them and fed them?  How can you accuse a clergyman of that?  Is it possible, I say, to accuse Father Seromba, a clergyman to order the destruction of his very own church?  Well, Athanase Nkinamubanzi, the perpetrator of that act came before you to tell you that Father Seromba had never given him that order, otherwise why did the Prosecutor call him before you to accuse him -- summon him here to accuse him of that crime?  

How, indeed, after the outbreak of events at Nyange to accuse Father Seromba of having been one of the planners because, in good faith, with the other clergymen in the parish he asked the bourgmestre to ensure the security of the refugees at the parish by the dispatch of the gendarmes and asked the latter for the mortal remains of the victims be properly laid to rest?  

Father Athanase Seromba, is he a planner of the genocide for having welcomed at his house children that were confided in him by parents who were frightened and took care of them and sheltered them until the arrival of the Rwandan Patriotic Front?  

And I think it would be appropriate, at this point, to wait a few minutes and tell the Prosecution that you can't really have accused him of forging an alibi of -- fled to Italy with a borrowed identity, but we'll come back to that.  I merely wish to underscore it at this point.  

Madam President, is it lawfully admissible to use gross lies, to invent charges, accusations and judge this Hutu clergyman mainly because he is a Hutu clergyman sitting here on the bench of the Accused because of lies?  Does the Prosecutor have the right to fabricate such serious accusations on the basis of tortuous logic to deform the testimony of Prosecution witnesses?  

Father Seromba's trial, which has made so much noise and so many conflicting passions, leads us to say yes, a father, a clergyman imply -- implicated in the genocide, a Catholic priest.  Really, the Rwandans will never have finished surprising the world.  In this matter -- this trial, which is patched together, shows a decisive desire to imply -- implicate someone for political reasons.  One of the main concerns of the adversaries of Father Seromba and the Catholic Church is to obtain that he be termed as a planner of genocide and be convicted of that which will be a God given -- which would be God given to the extent that he is a clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church.  

Now, a analysis of the exhibits in this trial show us abundantly that there is no proof of any word spoken by Father Seromba promoting hatred among the Rwandans or any conduct on his part to further discrimination either in Rwanda or in Italy.  The last chance for his opponents is to prove his participation in meetings which were allegedly held to plan or to implement plans of genocide.

1500H 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
One item of sophistry often repeated by his accusers in the Prosecution is that all the meetings held during the period of the genocide had a sole purpose to prepare the genocide, and that Father Seromba participated in it as a frontline actor.  Which, of course, has not been proven, and cannot ever be proven, because it is an amalgamation based on prejudice.  And one indeed could ask one's self at this point whether, at the time of a crisis as serious as one of that 1994, whether men of goodwill should merely sit back and cross their arms, all wondering how to find a solution is enough to constitute a crime.  

Mr. President (sic), the tragic events that unfolded in Rwanda took place throughout its territory, and occurred in all diocese in Rwanda, not only in Nyange parish.  It wasn't only in Nyange parish that Tutsi refugees were killed.  What we have to say to underscore is that the international community had abandoned Rwanda, and the Catholic -- the Roman Catholic church today accused, through one of its clergymen, and I am referring to Father Athanase Seromba, could do nothing about it.  Indeed, the Catholic church has no army, no gendarmerie to let loose on evildoers -- on blood-thirsty evildoers or parties to a conflict, so we don't see what our poor priest could have done in those dramatic, tragic circumstances.  

I told you that the Prosecution's case relied on testimony, and if you carefully study their case, and you have already seen throughout the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses that those witnesses were content, before the Trial Chamber, to make vague assertions such as the following:  "Father Seromba" -- I quote -- "is a genocidaire, because we saw him in contact with those authorities, such as Nizeyimana, Kayishema, (unintelligible), who took -- and he took part in meetings organised by them."  But nothing more than that.  

Madam President, common sense requires that one would have difficulty in understanding someone who's devoted his life to his vocation would attend meetings whose avowed purpose was the extermination of his fellow citizens.  That is not the role of a priest.  It's not the role of Father Seromba.  

I should like now, ladies and gentlemen, to go a bit further in my demonstration to say, in fact, the participation -- participation in any sort of meeting in which you -- there might be some administrative authorities, if the said meetings are proven, which the Prosecution has not done, cannot automatically be considered an error (sic), because it all depends on the purpose of the meeting, the nature of the discussions taken by the meeting, and the role one personally played in that meeting.  Until today, until I heard my learned friends this morning, no one has said what was Athanase Seromba's role in those meetings.  
Finally, Madam President, I should like to say that even if we admit that -- to a participation in the meeting, mere participation in the meeting does not prove approval of what was decided at that meeting, nor even what was said at that meeting -- nor even approval of what was said at that meeting.  And I think that's enough on that point.  

What strikes one before the Prosecution witnesses' testimony is that they seem to repeat what they heard from other people.  They are hearsay witnesses, because none of the Prosecution witnesses participated in those meetings alleged to have -- to part -- to plan, organise, and perpetrate the genocide.  

Madam President, in this introduction, I should also like to say something as to security, public safety at Nyange parish in respect of Father Seromba.  If, per chance, the Trial Chamber came to agree that the responsibility for safety at the parish was that of the priest on the 6th of April 1994, which has been -- it was shown in the course of (unintelligible) hearings that on the 6th of April he was at Nyundo at the annual diocesal (sic) conference, and was not in Nyange.  He never bothered to cook up any alibi.  You know, Madam President -- and you have seen the Defence exhibit assigning Father Seromba to the Congo-Nile divide parish by the bishop as of the 7th of April.  

Unfortunately, in the night of the 6th of April, President Juvénal Habyarimana's aeroplane was shot down.  And I should like to remind you, and it is also on the record, Madam President, that to replace Athanase, Balthazar Habyarimana was appointed -- Habimana was appointed to replace Athanase Seromba at Nyange.  So, it is surprising to see a plan as described by the Prosecution:  Who knows that he has to leave the next morning, who doesn't know that the president is going to be shot down, and he had the opportunity and the means to plan -- and the time to plan a genocide.  What an incongruity.  I see the Prosecution turning their back on the truth, and I am not surprised, because a Chinese proverb says:  When you don't want to see an elephant, you don't look at it.  And that is what is at hand.  

So, Athanase Seromba, could his role be to guarantee the safety of the public at Nyange parish?  Your Honours, this is a fundamental question.  When you go back to the secrecy of your deliberations in Chamber, you should remember what I am saying to you now.  I am putting the question to you, Madam President, to the magistrate you are, and whose role it is to render justice on behalf of the international community.  Can you for one second, one instant, imagine even in our tropical forests, that in a secular state such as Rwanda public safety, security -- of -- and the safety of property be a role incumbent upon clergymen?  I put the question to you, can you easily expect that in a secular state public safety be the responsibility of the priests, of the bishops, the archbishops, and the cardinals?  In all humility, I feel that the role of the clergy is merely to beg the -- to urge the public authorities to respect their duties.  And I think that you will have seen the enormity of the Prosecution's accusations in that respect, ladies and gentlemen.  

As regards the problem of public safety, Witness PA1, who came to testify here on the 7th of April -- and 8th of April last, told you, "I was there, we could do nothing.  Seromba could do nothing."  

I should merely like to recall to the ladies and gentlemen on the Prosecution benches that the task of a clergyman is to minister to his flock.  He has no army, he has no police, he has no authority over the administrative -- or, officials.  And what Seromba did was to scrupulously respect not only common sense, but also the provisions of the law.  When insecurity was increasing, he went to the bourgmestre of the commune and said, "I have an increasing number of refugees at the parish, I need security."  For the few policemen, he turned to the préfet of Kibuye who sent gendarme to Nyange parish, and Athanase Seromba, on the point of departing for the Zaire-Nile divide parish had no authority there according to the law -- the organic law establishing the gendarmerie in Rwanda.  

Now, Madam President, the Prosecution also tells you that the criminal -- presumed criminal participation of Athanase Seromba is on the basis of the series of meetings allegedly held, and all the meetings are enumerated.  And the Prosecutor gymnastically -- acrobatically maintains that the meetings established grounds -- the accusation of genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity, extermination.  

And I should like to make a detour here, Madam President, to say a word about the Prosecutor's embarrassment in the indictment and in the final brief; a gymnastic (sic) they indulge in to prove that Seromba was guilty of genocide and complicity in -- so if he's guilty of genocide, there's no complicity in genocide, and we then leave aside the whole legal argument as to the concurrence of charges, in spite of all the case law in that respect.  

Now, at no time was it established that Father Seromba was active in the alleged meetings.  We are not told what the agenda of the meetings was, who called them, who the participants were, what was said in those meetings, and what were the resolutions taken.  No one has yet produced the slightest agenda for the least meeting.  

It was alleged here, and in -- by the Prosecutor, that lists were prepared by Athanase Seromba to exterminate Tutsi that had to go and be fetched from the hills.  We never saw any list because they don't exist, they have never existed, and they will never exist.  The Prosecution hasn't shown us the slightest bit of evidence.  The few witnesses that spoke of that, such as YAT, could not say who were the people on those lists.  
Madam President, I say to you, Prosecution has never gone beyond making suppositions, some conclusions from what I call a vicious (unintelligible).  And let me quote from the indictment:  "On or about the 10th of April 1994, several important meetings were held at the Nyange parish and at the communal office.  Athanase Seromba, Fulgence Kayishema, Gaspard Kanyarukiga, and others attended that meeting."  Full stop, unquote.  And I therefore say, following such a vague allegation, such a specious allegation, what kind of legal conclusion can you draw, Madam President?  

Now, it was important for me introduce the matter in this manner, because the moment is a serious one.  It is a freedom of a man that is involved, and as I told you, this is a man who willingly chose to appear before you so that justice can be manifested.  Now, here amongst us in the Defence, we are just two in number.  It will just be two of us, not the four in the Prosecution.  Now, the methodology will follow -- will be as follows:  

You've heard the opening statement I have made.  I will quickly and briefly present the background, the -- what brought about what occurred in Rwanda generally, and in Nyange parish specifically.  

And I will ask (sic) my excellent colleague, Barnabé Nekuie, who will address the Court on considerations regarding, say, the applicable law, the various legal provisions as provided -- the legal provisions as stated in the ICTR statute.  

We will also talk about the indictment itself, and he will be talking about crimes against humanity, extermination.  

And then I will be the one to conclude with a few brief statements.  

Madam President, I told you, Athanase Seromba is appearing before you for some of the most hideous crimes existing in this world:  Genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, crime against humanity.  This is a brief reminder of what has happened before you, that is, the proceedings before you.  

Athanase Seromba was indicted, and the charges brought in the form of an indictment that was filed in 2001.  On the 3rd of July, same year, that indictment was confirmed by Judge Williams, and a warrant of arrest was issued against Father Athanase Seromba.  

On the 6th of April 2002 -- 6th of February 2002, Father Seromba came before your Court in the circumstances I had explained earlier.  Came before you for trial.  So, he was received here, locked up on the 6th of February 2002, he was informed of the indictment, the charges against him.  On the 8th of February that same year he appeared before Madam Navanethem Pillay, and he pleaded not guilty to the charges that were read out to him.  On the 20th of September 2004, the Prosecutor made his opening statement.  The 31st of October 2005, the Defence responded by making its own opening statement.  

So, Madam President, that's the background, the grounds on which we appear before you today, for you to hear the closing statements by the Prosecution and the Defence.  

One cannot understand what accusations are brought against Father Seromba if we don't take the trouble to look at the historical context, and the incidents that occurred prior to the events in Nyange.  I will be very brief on this.  But it is proper, for us to understand this trial, for us to have, might I say, a grasp of the historical background, we also have to know how Rwanda is set up geographically.  

That small country, Rwanda, is located in the great lakes region of Africa.  West of Lake Victoria, east of Lake Kivu, north of Lake Tanganyika, between central and southern Africa -- and East Africa, sorry.  It is 6,338 square kilometres.  It is occupied by 400 inhabitants per square kilometre.  Prior to the events of April 1994, Rwanda's population was estimated at say 80 to 90 per cent Hutu, 14 per cent Tutsi, 1-2 per cent of Twa.  So, that is when it comes to the geographical background, or context of this small country.  

I now wish -- because one would not understand what happened in 1994 if what one does not make reference to what occurred in October 1990.  That does not escape the attention of the Prosecutor, because at the very beginning of their closing statement they made reference to that.  It is absolutely correct -- and of course that's not a matter in contention, namely, that in October 1990, and to be specific the 1st of October, the Rwandan patriotic front, the RPF, launched an attack against Rwanda.  Obviously the attack, that are recurrent -- these attacks that are recurrent in the history of that country trigger consequences within the country.  

It did not escape your attention that in that country, with the advent of multiparty politics, the (unintelligible) speech, at which Africans were urged to set up democratic systems in their respective countries.  President Habyarimana, being pushed by the French government, brought in democracy.  And that effort was real, and RPF came to terms with the fact that if they had to achieve power through democracy, they would not be able to get there.  And that's why that attack was undertaken.  

That emerges, Madam President, from the investigation carried out by the Belgian senate in 1997, and the rapporteur were Mahoux, which is spelt M-A-H-O-U-X, Mahoux, and Verhosstatt is spelt V-E-R-H-O-S-S-T-A-T-T.  And as for curious persons, that is the current prime minister of Belgium.  
Now, those attacks, one must admit, created a climate of suspicion, of chaos.  Because Rwanda, unwillingly, found itself in a state of war between 1990 and 1994. 

Madam President, Your Honours, the attack that was carried out on the 1st of October 1990 was repulsed by the Rwandan armed forces, that is, by the Rwandan government forces, and thus compelled the rebels of the RPF to change their tactics.  They now started carrying out rapid incursions from their headquarters located in Ugandan territory.  And the attacks, of course, caused a lot of casualties on each occasion.  

Just as an example, on the 22nd of November 1990, the Rwandan patriotic front attacked the Rukomo centre in the Muvumba commune, and killed, using their bayonets, some 40 civilians in front of their neighbours, because they refused to show them the positions occupied by the Rwandan government forces.  On the 23rd and 24th of January 1991, the same Rwandan patriotic front carried out a new attack, and occupied the Ruhengeri city, and released hundreds of prisoners.  They attempted to infiltrate the Gisenyi town, and in -- on their way they killed hundreds of Hutu civilians.  The consequence of those attacks was that the Bagogwe, which is a Tutsi tribe located in the forest, that tribe, called the Bagogwe, were also attacked by the Rwandan government forces and the local citizens as reprisal.  

It was in those circumstances that, on the 6th of April 1994, that President Habyarimana's plane was brought down, as I stated.  

Madam President, Your Honours, the events that occurred in Nyange did not occur in isolation.  On the 6th of April 1994, after the president's plane was brought down, attacks started almost systematically throughout Rwandan territory.  And, of course, in the Kibuye préfecture, where Nyange and Kivumu were located.  And, the Prosecution says in the indictment -- I quote:  "Following the death of the Rwandan president on the 6th of April 1994, attacks started occurring against Tutsis in the Kivumu commune, and it caused the death of a number of Tutsi civilians, including Gregoire Ndakubana, Martin Karakezi, and Thomas Mwendezi."  End of quote.  And that's in the indictment, para 6, page 112.  

But, what is strange in that statement of the Prosecutor is the fact that he, at no time, tried to establish the link between the downing of the president's plane and the commencement of massacres.  Because one would not understand why there should be a link between the downing of the president -- president's plane, and then they would start killing people in Nyange, which is quite far from that -- from Kigali, they start killing people; because if that link had been established, the Bench would have started understanding why the downing of the plane also triggered the killings that occurred.  
Madam President, let me dwell slightly on the human dimension of this trial.  It's not every day that a priest is on trial.  It is in fact very rare, and it is exceptional, to say the least.  And here some anecdote comes to mind that was told us by a learned brother of the Paris bar who was being accused of only defending thieves.  And he said, "Well, if (unintelligible), cardinals, and priests appear in court, that would be something exceptional."  Today, we have a priest before us, and I am aware of the kind of task that I have to face. 

Madam President, I was unpleasantly surprised by the contempt shown by the Prosecution towards Father Seromba.  Not one word was mentioned about his character.  This is the one who is going to be tried, and you are not told who he is.  If we weren't here, Madam President, if we were in Dakar, in Ouagadougou, or in Stockholm, experts would have been asked to carry out an analysis of Father Seromba.  How -- his upbringing, how he lived, who were his parents, why he chose the vocation -- priestly vocation.  And then the Prosecutor comes here and says he should be sentenced to life without telling him (sic) who this man is.  Well, I'm going to tell you, because that is my duty.  If I don't do so I will be failing in my duty.  

If you read the final brief of the Prosecutor -- if you have the opportunity to read.  But I am aware of your wisdom.  I know that you are committed to the task.  You will try to find what kind of a person he is.  It is only under the chapter regarding sentencing that the Prosecutor is going to tell you that we know nothing about Seromba.  And the fact that we don't know anything about him shouldn't mean that he should be sentenced to life.  

Well, I'm going to tell you what Father Seromba is all about.  In 1994 I was not in Rwanda, and not even you, the President, nor yourselves.  I got to know Father Seromba here, but since we are men of law and we practice law, I would like to go into what those who are the learned men, people who dictate or set the legal norms, persons thanks to whom they trail blaze, open the path for us.  

Madam President, common law, which is so dear to my friends on the other side, is a concept.  Reference is made to the good character, evidence of good character which, for us francophones, is viewed as evidence of good conduct.  In other words, the judge would have to bring to the attention of the jury, and we are told -- not me, because I'm a humble person.  

Madam President, for the record, the following is extracted from Archbold -- A-R-C-H-B-O-L-D -- Archbold on Criminal Proceedings, Evidence and Practice, published by Sweet and Maxwell.  Sweet is S-W-E-E-T, and Maxwell M-A-X-W-E-L-L, London.  Published the year 2000 edition, page 461 to 472.  And in that learned work we are told that that element of good character, the good character of Athanase Seromba, from (sic) whom I am pleading, can be pertinent in assessing the probability, whose proof of good character has been established, might commit the crime he has been accused of, and in order to strengthen his credibility, should he testify in trial.  

Well, for reasons I won't come back to under circumstances I shan't describe, he did not testify.  But, my learned friends from the other side, no one ever told you that before 1994, in Nyange, where he officiated, Father Seromba was known as a segregationist, holding -- who spoke words of hatred, anti-Tutsi, or committed any act against the Tutsi.  

Madam President, you here can testify -- the Witness B1 came here to testify and told us that when Father Athanase Seromba arrived in Nyange, he was the assistant to Straton Karanganwa.  And that archpriest (sic), who other witnesses can tell you, one after the other, had a very poor character, and no assistant lasted for more than a year with that parish priest, who finally left before the events of April.  And Witness B1 told us that the reason for the difference between them had anything (sic) to do with any bad feeling between them, but because of the poor administration of the caritas supplies.  Because the parish priest only handed out supplies to his friends, whereas Father Athanase wanted for the -- those supplies intended for the poor and destitute should indeed go to them.  And then Father Seromba went to a meeting in Ruhengeri, and having not been able to return to the parish, Father Straton told the parishioners that he had gone to have a good time with feminine persons.  You will remember, and I remind you of that to refresh your memory.  

Now, let us close the parenthesis, but I have said all that to point out that the Defence -- what the Defence claims, as stated in Bagilishema, according to which each time -- I quote:  "The good character of the Accused is established, and is of particularly probative value" -- and I quote, as not to err, I repeat:  "Every time it is established that the good character of the Accused is of especially probative value, in respect of the charges made, it would be up to the Prosecution to dispel any doubts that must result therefrom in respect of his theory."  Seventh of June decision, 2001, Prosecutor versus Bagilishema, ICTR-95-1-80 (sic) paragraph 116.  

And we also see on that subject, in the same section, the -- under the same title, Judgment of Trial Chamber I, in February 2001, Prosecutor versus Elizaphan --Elizaphan -- E-L-I-Z-A-P-H-A-N --Ntakerutimana-- N-T-A-K-E-R-U-T-I-M-A-N-A -- and Gerard Ntakerutimana, ICTR-96-10-T (sic) and 17-T, para -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
What -- paragraph 97?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
And in his (unintelligible) of the 20th of September 2004, and in his -- in his pre-trial -- in his final brief, he presents Father Seromba as being a Hutu extremist and activist and genocidaire, having committed the most abject crimes on the planet.  

It is undeniable, that until the Prosecutor decides, for partisan reasons, to proffer this indictment against Father Seromba -- Father Seromba, he was never accused of anything in Nyange, whether it was in respect of his personal acts or anything else.  He was never involved in any decisions -- discussions of Hutu and Tutsi, or any acts of aggression against the Tutsi.  And that is confirmed to Your Honours by Witness CBK, transcript, Madam President -- CBK, transcript of the 19th of October 2004, page 45; and also CBJ, transcript of the 13th of October 2004; but also Defence witnesses such as BZ1, transcript for BZ1 of the two -- 2nd of November 2005; and Witness BZ2, 7th of November 2005; and BR1, transcript of the 25 -- 25th of November 2005.  

What strikes me, in everything stated by the Prosecution, that they say nothing about Father Seromba, nor say what they wish to achieve by convicting -- convicting him at any price.  Like when they -- just as when they convicted Louis the 16th in France, and they contented themselves with crying, "Blood, blood", because they wanted to chop off his head.  

Father Seromba was born in 1964, Rutziro commune, Kibuye préfecture.  In April 1994 he was in charge of Nyange parish.  After studying at Nyakibanda seminary, he was, in 1993, ordained, and he was well known in Kivumu as being someone, the Prosecutor said, of having authority.  Which is the -- what we know -- and nothing else.  Go to para 654, page 161 of the final -- the Prosecution's final brief.  

Now, to judge a man, shouldn't you first try to know him?  To know his personality, his family background, his academic career?  That is what we, on the Defence bench, humbly try to do, by presenting factual witness, and also witnesses that make it possible to speak -- who could speak of their contacts with Father Seromba before and during the events in the course of his pastoral duties.  That's BO1 -- BR1 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Please, ask him to repeat.  This is much too fast.  We did not get that list of witnesses.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Mea culpa, mea culpa.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I shall repeat the names -- of pseudonyms of the witnesses, Madam.  

I was speaking, before being called to order, that CBK, Prosecution witness CBK, 27th of October 2004, page 45, Witness CBJ, transcript of the 13th of October 2004; that is as regards Prosecution witnesses, but also Defence witnesses BZ1, transcript 2nd of November 2005; BZ2, transcript of the 5th of November 2005; BO1, 24th of November 2005; and BR1, transcript of 25th of November 2005 came to tell you that Father Seromba never was unfavourably perceived by his parishioners.  

I also said, Madam President, that in the Prosecution allegations of Father Seromba's personality, of which he knows nothing, this is what he states in his final brief -- and I quote:  "Seromba was born in 1963 in Rutziro commune, Kibuye préfecture, in Rwanda.  In April 1994 he was the Catholic priest in charge of Nyange parish.  After studying in Nyakabanda major seminary, he was ordained in July 1993.  He was well known in Kivumu as someone of authority."  That is all that is known of his character.  "He was a powerful influential person in Nyange", para 461 then goes on to state.  That is what is stated by the Prosecutor to support his hard-hitting indictment.  And I put the question to you:  Can you really judge a man in our judicial system without knowing him, without trying to define his character, his origin, his family context, his academic career, his social position?  

The Defence has tried throughout -- throughout this trial to demonstrate who was and who is Athanase Seromba.  To discover the man behind his pastoral duties.  And what is striking -- I say this so that you do not forget it -- that the witnesses that came before you, some of whom are still detained in Rwanda, all came to testify here courageously so as to discover the truth.  And no one does not know (sic) of the risk run by the witnesses detained in Rwanda, and even those who are outside Rwanda.  Because you know that testifying on behalf of someone accused of genocide -- of genocide makes them suspected of genocide, and yet they come here to testify for a man, and in good cause.  Those witnesses was (sic) of various backgrounds, but by the mere fact that they came it is the incarnation, the living evidence that Father Seromba is not a Hutu extremist having organised the unfortunate, not to say tragic, events of 1994 in Nyange.  

It matters little, Madam President, that those witnesses be Hutu -- because in his final brief, the Prosecutor reproaches us for bringing only Hutu witnesses.  And I was wondering whether in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence there was any stipulation on the ethnicity of the witnesses called to testify.  And I was asking whether they should only be Tutsi witnesses for the Prosecution.  

And when I think of the great difficulty I had in finding witnesses, I must tell you, learned friend, you -- it was not easy.  Why would you call only 15 witnesses for -- for such serious charges?  Fifteen witnesses you called, of three -- of which three are not witnesses of fact.  I'm thinking Mr. Sahiri, Mr. Farruggia, and Mr. Massimo Materassi.  

And among -- apart from those three, there are many who spoke of Father Seromba during the events in Nyange, but who are incapable of recognising him here.  "We saw him killing, we saw him giving orders, we are three metres from him, but we can't recognise him."  Witnesses CBT, CBK, and CBR -- CBN, sorry, CBR, correction, CBN.  CBT, CBK, and CBN.  And the others, all they said is something they heard.  They took part in no meeting.  That is the evidence that was brought before you, Madam President, in asking for such a serious sentence before your honourable Chamber.  

Madam President, Your Honours, let me conclude on this character of Father Seromba by saying that Witness BR (phonetic), the transcript of 25th of October 2005; BV3, transcript of 8 November 2005, page 29; BZ14, transcript 9 November 2005, page 36; NAN, transcript of 7 November 2005, page 49; and PAN, transcript of 20th April 2006, page 6, all are persons ***************, told you in an honest and frank manner who Father Seromba was, the fact that he was a humane person.  

So, Madam President, Your Honours, the entire feature of Father Seromba's character clearly clashes with what was described by the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor's saying that he was a planner of genocide.  But this was a mere rural priest who did not have a problem with anyone.  

So this is where I will stop, Madam President, with this first part of the closing arguments of the Defence.  And, quite fortunately, I will now ask my excellent learned brother, Mr. Nekuie, who will talk about the applicable law here.  Thank you for your patience.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

Before Counsel Nekuie speaks, we take a 15-minute break.  Adjourned for 15 minutes.

(Court resumed at 1620H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  

Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, thank you.  

Madam President, Your Honours, after the brilliant submission by the president of the bar counsel, I would like to start by referring to some statements made by the lady Prosecutor this morning.  According to the Prosecutor, Madam President, Your Honours, Defence did not even read the indictment, as is proper.  To say the least, Defence does not even know why it is here this morning, or at any rate, this afternoon.  And so to interpret what the Prosecutor said, the Prosecutor only -- or sorry, the Defence will only be receiving lessons from the Office of the Prosecutor.  

So, let's now look at these courses, such learned lessons that we have to get from the Prosecutor.  Based on the most recent brief of the Office of the Prosecutor, and the brilliant submissions made by the four-person team of the Office of the Prosecutor, Defence comes to the conclusion that two, say, proposals are being made to your distinguished Court by the Prosecutor.  

The first one is that Athanase Seromba is someone who is literate and, therefore, could issue instructions.  The second proposal, Madam President, Athanase Seromba spoke the same language as the gendarmes and so he could issue instructions through them and secure their compliance.  

Well, I must admit if we refer to those as lessons from the Office of the Prosecutor, we remain confused.  We, the Defence, remain confused.  And this is the time and place to ask ourselves whether these principles as proposed by the Prosecutor, whether these are the principles that you are required to implement.  We do not dare allow ourselves to endorse that same learned approach as the         Office of the Prosecutor.  We will confine ourselves to what is done, to what is said, to what is recommended.  And that is why, Madam President, Your Honours, I am going, as my lead told you, to address the Court on the considerations of the Defence regarding the applicable law before your Court.

I would like to start by pointing out, Madam President, Your Honours, that among those considerations the first thing that needs to be viewed is the burden of proof.  And the lead counsel told you the burden of proof is governed -- via the lessons that we have learned, is governed by the principle of presumption of innocence.  This appears in Article 20 sub 3 of the statutes of this Tribunal, Madam President,     Your Honours.  The lead counsel told you -- he also told you about the various legal instruments that enshrine that principle.

Consequently, the implementation of that principle requires that the burden of proof, that is, regarding the guilt of the Accused, that burden lies -- that onus lies essentially with the Prosecution.  So in compliance - or, with that principle, the Prosecutor is bound to proof -- provide proof of the reality of the allegations that he or she makes, and the fact that these are attributable to the Accused.  The norms that apply are stated in Rule 87(A) of the Rules of Evidence of this Tribunal, is that the Prosecutor must establish such proof beyond any reasonable doubt.  In other words, all of the allegations made must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  That is what was stated in the Delalic case, that is, for ICTY, and taken up -- and this was actually acknowledged by the Prosecutor, taken up in the Akayesu case by the Chamber of Appeals.

Now, regarding to the Delalic judgement, I just wish to confine myself to providing the references of the judgement dated 16 November 1998, paragraph 603, "In that responsibility that lies with the          Office of the Prosecutor, in other words, establishing proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, your Court - or, the case law, or the settled law should be, where there is the least doubt in the discharge of that burden, where there is the least doubt, that should be placed to the advantage of the Accused."  This was the decision -- or the ruling -- or the findings, sorry, of the Appeals Chamber in Kayishema, 1st June 2003, page 113.  

Therefore, if the main charge, or that burden lies with the Prosecution, what is expected of the Defence?  Obviously, according to the Prosecutor and based on her submissions this morning, it seems to me it lies with the Defence to prove that he is innocent, because it looks as if it is the reverse, the contrary of the presumption of innocence.  But that is not the case law here.  Those are not the principles that govern you.  

The norm, or the threshold, that has to be reached by the Defence is necessarily lower, the bar, or level, is necessarily lower.  The Accused has to provide such evidence as to cast reasonable doubt on whatever accusations are levelled against him or her.  Such evidence should be sufficient to create reasonable doubt.  And so Defence should be more convincing.  So, there is not a reversal of that duty, one of the burdens of proof that lies essentially with the Prosecution.  

So what I heard this morning as being additional proof regarding that consciousness of guilt -- no, it is not before your Court, Madam President, Your Honours, that that type of evidence can be proposed. That type of evidence a posteriori, which comes under a system that is alien to your system, cannot be used in proving the guilt of someone who, until guilt is established beyond any reasonable proof, is there is proven.  So this aspect of consciousness of guilt does not even require that you pay any attention to it.

And so we asked ourselves about that -- the evidence as proposed by the Defence throughout the proceeding, evidence according to which Father Athanase Seromba was absolutely impossible did not have the means of preventing the occurrence of the events in his parish.  Well it is claimed that we didn't say what we were doing at the time and, therefore, we could not, today, allow ourselves to bring forward any alibi.  

Let me answer the Prosecutor on that point, and to say that this type of evidence as suggested by the Defence is enough, because we are entitled to that presumption of innocence.  And it lies with the Prosecutor on the other side to prove beyond any reasonable doubt, and the fact that such allegations should be charged to the Accused beyond any reasonable doubt.  So, if we are providing any evidence to clear our case, regarding the fact that we are unable to use any means at our disposal to prevent the occurrence of the events that happened in Nyange, it would lie, after we have done that, for the Prosecutor to challenge or to dispute that evidence, so as to clear any doubt.  Because our responsibility, our duty, is to be able, via the evidence we will provide, to bring or raise any doubts.  And that is what we do through the plethora of witnesses that have appeared before your Court.

What Judge Asoka de Z -- Judge Asoka Gunawardana said that this means of defence is equivalent to the defence of alibi or accident.  And in raising it, the Accused must adduce sufficient evidence.  To do so, he can base himself on Prosecution witness testimony, or call Defence witnesses, or both together, and adduce evidence before the judge of fact, sufficient evidence to encourage consideration by the Tribunal.  This does not reverse the burden of proof, and that burden of proof on the Defence is then reasonable by the judges in first instance.  And it is up to the Prosecution to contradict it beyond any reasonable doubt, otherwise reasonable doubt subsists.  And that is what Judge Gunawardana in Bagilishema, mentioned here this morning, states.  And it can be found in the judgement of                7th of June 2001; in that judgement, paragraph 10 of the separate opinion of that Judge, which can be usefully consulted.

After those indications, Your Honours, as to the standard of evidence applicable to each party, I should now like to consider what the rules say, and what the case law says as to the probative value of evidence.  The principle, Your Honours, and we all agree on that, I suppose, my learned friends from the Prosecution and I, is the liberty of the Trial Chamber to assess the pertinence and the credibility of the evidence.  It is up to you, indeed, to determine the reliability of evidence.  However, certain indicies do make it possible for you to fulfill your mission in accordance with the statutes of the Court.  Thus, as regards corroboration, even should you admit that this is a precedence which is not at all customary; the principle of testimony without corroboration by virtue of your discretionary powers.  There remains the fact that corroboration -- corroboration is always something that enhances the value of testimony that is corroborated.  

That is what was stated by the Appeals Chamber in considering that this precedence, which is rare -- of making testimony without corroboration, need not be -- not considered as blocking the path to corroboration which can be brought, as decided by the Appeals Chamber in Bagilishema, decision of the 5th of July 2002, paragraphs 179.  And it is moreover considered in the Tribunal's case law, that any element of evidence supported by another item of evidence, that is of more probative value than an item of evidence that nothing supports, unless the evidence is credible; which goes to show, Your Honours, in order to draw the attention of this august Court on the witness -- to the testimony brought by the Prosecution in this regard -- we will be going into it further, but it is time to point out to you that in most of the allegations made by the Prosecution, we will note that we only have to do with single testimony, or hearsay testimony.  And it should be good that your -- this august body should know, as of now, that it is up to you, your sovereign, but because of your discretion that corroboration makes all of the difference between one testimony and another.  In Musema, corroboration was an important factor in assessing the probative value of a substantial body of evidence brought before the Chamber by the parties.  The Musema judgement was rendered on the 27th of January 2000; in paragraph 75 of the judgement that is mentioned.

The assessment of the credibility of the testimony must be done individually, that is the case law before the Trial Chamber of the Tribunal.  And all circumstances must be assessed.  The Defence stresses, quite simply, that when the credibility of a witness has been put in doubt, the entire body of his testimony becomes doubtful, unless it is corroborated by an independent source.  As to hearsay evidence, the Defence recalls that proof -- evidence must be assessed cautiously.  In particular in light of -- of the importance of oral tradition in Rwanda, and subsequent alteration of the narrative, which is -- which the Tribunal is aware of since Akayesu; paragraph 136 of the judgement is clear on that point.  
And in other trials, it has been proven that most Rwandans lived in oral tradition, where an individual narrates facts as he perceives them, whether he lived through them himself or heard of it through a third party.  So we attract your attention not only to the very delicate nature of hearsay testimony, but also to the fact that what might be reported as being eyewitness testimony, claimed as being eyewitness testimony on the part of the Prosecution might be, in fact, the narrative of a third party.

As to the identification -- identification of the witness by an eyewitness, this is a particularly delicate problem that the former president of the bar has told you that some of the Prosecution witnesses could not recognise Seromba, although they claimed they had met him more than 20 times.  The Prosecution themselves recognised it in their final submissions, whilst minimising the phenomenon.  But that's not the position in the case law, which establishes for both Tribunals that a Chamber first -- a Trial Chamber must be very cautious as to identification of the Accused by witnesses.

In respect of assessing the witnesses having identified the Accused, the Trial Chamber takes account of previous knowledge of the witness -- of the Accused by the witness, conditions of visibility, possible influence of a third party, general credibility of the witness, and, in general, the identification of the Accused is to prove his presence in a given place.  In this instance, identification is something which makes it possible for the Court to determine that the witness -- the witness who says that he saw Father Seromba commit an act or give an order can do so by -- can be corroborated by that element of identification.  This is appropriate to recall, Your Honours, that just any allegations as to the presence of the Accused must be dealt with cautiously, and the absence of details raises doubts.

"And case law has established, that one or another -"  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel is reading a document, and he should, therefore, read at a reasonable pace because we do not have that document. 
MR. NEKUIE:
"The Defence recalls that any allegation as to the presence of the Accused must be dealt with cautiously, and the absence of details is of a nature to raise doubts.  In that -- if that is the case, the Trial Chamber must examine the testimony of other witnesses, so as to clarify the testimony of one or the other witness.  And if that method does not make it possible to corroborate the allegations, a doubt remains and the identity of the Accused has not been established."  And that is another extract from Bagilishema, 7th of June 2001 decision, paragraph 538 -- 532.

This morning, Madam Prosecutor spoke on the concurrence of crimes of offences.  I must say that the Defence did not understand the problem with regard to -- with respect to concurrence that the Prosecution referred to in the Defence's final brief.  We believe that if it is admitted, that there can be concurrence of crimes before this Court; nonetheless, cumulative sanctions must be conditional.  That is what the case law that we have quoted states.  I don't think that what Madam Prosecutor said is in contradiction with what we have said on this, which is why I don't believe I need to speak to this at great length.  Community -- commutative convictions with regard to commutative convictions of the same offence, it is necessary to prove a separate fact, which distinguishes the events from another.  And it is in the context of that interpretation that we can come to not accept the principle of concurrent convictions between genocide and complicity in genocide.  But I don't think there is any particular polemique between the parties on that point.  

And the time has come for the Defence to state before you what we feel is the law applicable, as established in international law, and by the statutes of the Tribunal and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and case law, as it stands.  What is applicable is governed, Your Honours, by the universal principle of nullum drimen sine lege, that there is no crime if there is no law.  And the statutes of the Tribunal must be in accordance with existing international law, and the principal of non-retro activity, and strict application of criminal law.  As to international criminal -- pertinent international law --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel corrects himself. 
MR. NEKUIE:
-- the sources and element are in Article 38, paragraph 1, of the International Court of Justice, in international conventions and international customs generally accepted as being law, in the principles of law, as recognised by civilised nations and secondarily in judicial decisions.  And we should like to clarify before you, Your Honours, as regards convention on the basis of which we are called to rule here, is the convention on genocide and your own statutes.  This is what the Akayesu and Kordic decisions -- Akayesu in paragraph 468, 2nd September 1008.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Strike Kordic, I think it is just Akayesu. 
MR. NEKUIE:
The principle, according to nullum crimen sine lege has as a corollaire a strict interpretation of a criminal law which means, Madam President, that your Court is not called to rule on the basis of regulations, only crimes provided for in the statutes can be considered by your Court, and the elements constituting the crimes are only those that were provided for in the rules and in the statutes.  You cannot go beyond that to assess principles that are not provided for either in the statutes nor by international instruments brought before the Court.  So you must stick to the statute.  You cannot proceed by analogy.  And if it is not in the text that you're called -- if is there an ambiguity in the statutes you rule upon, Madam President, that should be to the benefit of the Accused.  

Which brings me to say that in the instance the Prosecution has expressly applied -- chosen to apply Article 6.1 of the statutes and clearly (inaudible) intends to show Father Seromba's responsibility on the basis of 6.1 and not 6.3.  In other words, it is not possible for the Prosecutor to resort to the elements in 6.3 to ask you to find responsibility under 6.1.  

Now I shall make certain clarifications as to the approving spectator, as referred to this morning by the Prosecution, which is one of the rare occasions for you to move out of the strict application of the provisions of the statute.  But we must stick to the conditions which are extremely restrictive, which is not what appears to be the position of the Prosecution as set forth this morning.  

In paragraph 6.24 of the final brief, although they do represent Father Athanase as being responsible, in charge of Nyange parish, he knows very well, the Prosecution knows very well what his status was at the time -- as a Catholic priest at the time, which clearly means, as the former president of the bar stated, Father Seromba exercised no official function at the time.  And we cannot, because of him being charged -- because he is characterised as being in charge of Nyange parish does not involve any formal responsibility.  So the Defence draws the attention of the Trial Chamber to the need to exclude that theory as to the criminal responsibility by omission, which falls under 6.3 of the statute.  And we wish that the Court, Madam President, should assess the facts submitted to you on the sole basis of Article 6.1.  By which I mean to say, Madam President, Your Honours, that the Prosecution must adduce the evidence of what Father Seromba did, a positive act, a personal act, a substantive -- an act substantively linked to the crime itself, a deliberate act, for you to be able to convict him with conviction.

That is what the Prosecution must do; prove acts of commission of complicity.  And if they are not established beyond all reasonable doubt, you can not find him criminally responsible, you cannot find Father Seromba criminally responsible by omission, which is what emerges from the submissions of  the -- quart --  quartet -- the Prosecution quartet here this morning.  It is important that the Defence draw your attention, Your Honours, to that fact -- to that point.

What are the various forms of criminal responsibility provided for under the statutes of the Tribunal?  We must look at them, Madam President, Your Honours, in light of what the Prosecution has said in respect of principles involved here to establish individual criminal responsible under Article 6.1 on individual criminal response -- the meaning of criminal -- individual criminal responsibility under 6.3 in light of the responsibility of the approving onlooker, by-stander, spectator, which is what concerns in the instance Father Athanase, under 6.1 of the statute.  6.1 says that: "A person who plans" et cetera, (unintelligible) "shall be individually responsible for the crime."  So it goes from the initial planning to the execution of the crime.  

Defence notes in passing that in the final analysis the Prosecutor only submitted in his -- in her assessment of Father Seromba, just three of those forms.  One, planning:  Two, order; A, and encouragement.  In fact, that emerges from one of the statements or submissions by the                Office of the Prosecutor when referring to the responsibility of Father Seromba.  That submission was made just before the last submission by the Office of the Prosecution.  I believe it was the submission made by Mr. Townsend.  

We will get back to those three elements put forward by the Office of the Prosecutor, but we merely note that, contrary to what they had often said, it is the Office of the Prosecutor that has varied, Madam President, Your Honours, the allegations that it intended to submit to your Court.  Because from the outset, and in the indictment, that was not what the Prosecutor had intended to commit to your court.  And those were not the facts on which it had intended to adduce evidence through the Prosecution case.  And today we noted that there has been a change.  We will talk about it later on.  We are merely saying, Madam President, that these various forms of responsibility must -- or ought to have substantially affected or influenced the occurrence of these events.  

Now, let me talk about planning.  Planning implies criminal conspiracy which results in a determination to act, a matter on which more than two, or at least two people must have agreed.  That was the settled principle in the Musema case on conspiracy.  So we are referring here to premeditation; that is one.  

Secondly, that type of participation involves the fact that they would have reached a certain substantial level, a significant level.  In the Frisch case, the Accused was acquitted by the European war tribunal despite the fact that that person had been a minister, had operated, with a radio, his influence within ranks.  He did not occupy such a position that he could involve himself or participate in any meetings that would promote war.  So, in addition to involvement in planning, you have to have substantially affected or influenced the execution of the planned crime.  So mere participation is not enough.  Now, that is the law as it is settled since the Frisch case, as I just stated.  

Now, regarding the aspect of commission, there it is the main perpetrator that is involved, clearly in that forms part of your radiophonique jurisdiction, so that is not a matter which I will dwell unduly, Madam President, Your Honours.  But it is here the time and place for me to say that the need to commit such a crime under 6.1, and in actual fact, ICTR and ICTY found grounds to be able to penalise accused persons under 6.1 through omission.  But for that to be achieved, Madam President, Your Honours, it would be necessary for such omission to occur as in the case of an accused who had the legal obligation to act, and who failed to act.  And this takes me, Madam President, Your Honours, to say that it would be important for the Defence to present to you in detail that hypothesis of an approving spectator which will allow you to admit such responsibility under 6.1.

Now, the third form is that of incitement, same as planning.  In Akayesu, the judges held that it was a form of instigation because it was analogous to incitement.  Instigation; in English incitement, l'instigation in French.  Responsibility arising from incitement under 6.1 is analogous to what appeared, in Article 2.3 of the statute.  And then there is the order to commit a crime that we had referred to, Madam President, Your Honours, the responsibility of the Accused may be upheld until 6.1, in a case where he uses his position of authority in order to order the commission of a crime.  But it is stated in case law that that form of participation, Madam President, Your Honours, implies that there is a superior-subordinate relationship, that is between the person issuing the orders and the person implementing them or enforcing them.  That, also, is the position adopted by the Court in the Rutagunda case, dated 6 November 1999, paragraph 39.

Finally there is aiding and abetting, that is, involving support that is extended to someone.  There, again - or, this again was defined in the Akayesu case, 2nd of November 1998, already referred to.  But what is important to be mentioned here is that accomplices, when it comes to adding and abetting, such accomplices must have extended some assistance to the main perpetrator, knowing that such assistance would contribute to the commission of the crime concerned.   So if the Prosecutor wants to uphold Father Seromba's responsibility in that regard, they would need to prove that there was aid or assistance, or that such aid was used, fully aware of the fact that such assistance would contribute to the commission of the offences committed by the principle perpetrators.  And that does not seem to us to be the demonstration made by the Prosecutor until now.

I will, very quickly, Madam President, Your Honours, talk about individual re -- criminal responsible under 6.3, merely to say that contrary to the option, or approach adopted by the Prosecutor, that the evidence that she seeks so as to have you convict Father Athanase Seromba, that that evidence, actually, is found under 6.3, which provides for that type of a restricted responsibility arising from a mission.  If that is the case, it is important for the Defence to point out to your Court that on the basis of 6.3, three conditions must be met for such a responsibility to be established.  

The first condition, or the first requirement is that of a subordination, that is, a superior-subordinate relationship.  The second one is one of knowing, or having cause to know; and then the second (sic) one is the inability to prevent, or to punish.  Now, regarding the superior-subordinate relationship, Madam President, I would not dwell too long on it.  You see, when we talk of the superior-subordinate relationship under 6.3 we are referring to a link, or a relationship that exist between the subordinate and the person who exercises authority over the said subordinate, so much so that such superior is able to effectively control the conduct of his subordinate and to punish.  So the person has to have the authority comparable to a military -- that of a military chief or boss.  

So the Accused must have had the material ability to prevent and to punish any offences committed by his subordinates, otherwise the responsibility would not have been proven under this article.  In other words, the superior knew, or had cause to know that his subordinate was going to commit the said crime, or was in the process of committing the said crime, or had already committed the said crimes.  And that he had taken the necessary precaution to inform himself regarding the conduct of his subordinates.  Now, having that authority, as the authority to prevent the commission of such a crime, having had that authority, he did not act accordingly.  

So a parish vicar operates -- viewed against what has been said, did that parish vicar have the powers, or the authority over those who were at the Nyange parish?  Now, the parish vicar, as the lead counsel told you, Madam President, Your Honours, is the priest assigned to work with a parish priest, to assist him in his parish duties, or priestly duties.  Now, based on that description of the duties of the parish priest, or parish vicar, that the parish vicar, first of all, comes under the authority of the parish priest; and, at any rate, answerable to the diocese priest, because both of them actually come under the authority of the bishop.  So, it is not possible for a vicar in office -- it is not possible for him to exercise an authority not assigned to him, either by the parish priest or by the bishop.  That is what appeared in the canon law, whose provisions are mentioned or referred to in our brief.

And it clearly stipulates in canon law what occurs when a parish lacks a parish priest.  In the absence of the parish priest, when a parish is without a parish priest, for whatever reason there might be, it comes automatically under the direct authority of the bishop.  And the provisions of canon law provides that he organises the interim -- we referred to 549 (as translated) canon law 549 (as translated) and             540 (as translated).  533 (as translated) says that: "It is up to the diocese and priest to take the appropriate measures, in the absence of the parish priest, to ensure that a priest of necessary competence will be put in charge."  And 56 -- 59 (as translated) states that; "When there is no parish priest, or when for reasons of imprisonment, exile or relegation, incapacity or illness, the bishop will appoint a parish administrator as soon as possible.  That is a priest who can replace the parish priest in conformity with Canonic law 540, which stipulates that he is subordinate to the main duties as the parish priest.  In other words, the assistant parish priest cannot fake -- play the role of the bishop.  

And in any case, clergymen, as was said by the former president of the bar, do not have under their authorities armies or gendarmes.  Their mission is purely pastoral, and they cannot -- they cannot enjoy authority such as that from the body public, and certainly -- certainly not as causitive as administrative law.  And we should stress here that in the instance Father Seromba -- and this emerges clearly from Exhibit D.  5 -- wasn't even the parish priest in charge of Nyange, because he had been assigned to Congo Nile divide parish, and was therefore no longer responsible for anything in Nyange parish after the 6th of April.  

Hence, Madam President, having developed the idea of individual criminal responsibility on the basis of 6.1, of both 6.1 and 6.3, and having brought these clarifications as to the duties and position of a parish priest or assistant parish priest, we should draw your attention particularly to that type of office of approving spectator, onlooker, observer, (unintelligible) as it arise, in respect of 6.1, whereas in respect of offences by omission.  

The Tribunal has considered the matter, considered whether that category of persons, the approving spectator, held in such high esteem by the other perpetrators of the crime that his mere presence is an encouragement, apart from any judicial obligation as to relationship of superior to subordinate, by way of his approving silence.  In Aleksovski, the matter was considered.  And upon analysis, it appears that case law clearly establishes that no -- there can be no conviction on that sole basis.  That is your case law, your precedence.  Approving silence was not retained as an element of actus reus of complicity except in circumstances where it was a representative of the political authority, recognised as such by the perpetrators of the crime at the site of the crime or near by.  So the same type of authority is necessary; that is provided under 6.3 of your statutes.  And as long as one does not -- is not invested with such formal official power, your courts have never been able to find the accused responsible on the basis of that approving silence because, in general, in your case law on this matter it is necessary to demonstrate that the silence had an approving effect, an encouraging effect, and that the person had that intention, and had the power either to prevent the crime or to punish the perpetrators of the crime.  

We must, therefore -- it is necessary that the accused who is accused of approving silence find himself in a position -- find themselves in a position of being a public authority, that the authors of the crime, illegal act, known to have a degree of power such that if he orders them to stop the elicit act, they are of course obliged to do so because they know that they run the risk of being punished by that authority.  That is the constant position of all case law in the matter, whether it be that of the ICTY or that of the ICTR.  

And it is on that basis Bagilishema was referred to this morning, that: "The Court seeks to establish that -" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel is reading again.  Could counsel repeat what he is reading?  We do not have the document he is reading. 
(Pages 54 to 64 by Donna M. Lewis)















1720H
MR. NEKUIE (continuing):
"On that basis of authority, therefore, and approval given to the illicit act in Bagilishema, the Tribunal found that there must be proof that the defendant gave his approval and consent to continuing the monitoring acts at the roadblocks, notwithstanding the fact that within his capacity as bourgmestre he had the capacity to stop it, which is found in paragraph 8 -- 95, and there, please, note we're speaking of a bourgmestre, and that is the judgement of the 10th of October 2001.

And in Aleksovski, they found that the presence of someone of a certain authority is not enough to prove intentional participation and cannot be held responsible under 7 -- Article 7(1), to the extent that he has no direct authority over the main perpetrators of the crime.  So, only people with public authority can -- could be in such a position, and the official nature of the approval is stressed by case -- the case law in the matter.  Hence, this triple requirement, Madam President, Your Honours, is found not only in Aleksovski, Nkurinziza (as interpreted), Akayesu, Einsatzgruppen, Musema, Niyitegeka, and the trial that first raised this notion of approving spectator with this -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, I didn't catch that.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Anyhow, in that case, he was a prison director so he had an official position.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That must have been under ICTY.
MR. NEKUIE:
And he had published internal regulations.  He was the only one to receive visitors from CICR or the European Union, and would issue warrants for the transfer of prisoners, which couldn't be done otherwise, and was insulted -- and in his presence, a prisoner had been assaulted and insulted.  

In Akayesu, he was convicted for having committed acts of encouraging sexual violence by allowing them to be committed by Interahamwe in or near the communal office of which he was also the bourgmestre.

In Furundzija, the Accused was convicted of rape because the person he was interrogating was sexually assaulted and the Trial Chamber considered that his presence and the fact that he continued the interrogation assisted the accused to be -- to continue in the perpetration of his crime, but it wasn't his mere presence, that was enough moreover, because if he did not participate in a sexual act, he was actively interrogating the victim at the time.  So he was also holding official -- occupying official functions, had official powers and was actively engaged in the perpetration of the collateral crime, which explains why he was held responsible.  
In Niyitegeka, the Trial Chamber mentions Bagilishema in respect of the approving spectator, but in that instance -- but that was not the instance in Niyitegeka.  The Accused was convicted for a series of attacks in the same region; commission of genocide, complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity.  

So in Niyitegeka, not only did the Accused -- was the accused a person of authority in his capacity of minister of information of the interim government, but moreover he participated actively in the commission of several other offences in the context of the incitement, encouragement he gave to his subordinates.  

So in all circumstances, Your Honours, all circumstances involved with approving spectators show that the constitutive elements of the crime allowing the Trial Chamber to find the Accused responsible under 6(1) as an approving spectator are those established by Article 6(3).  As long as one does not have the official power of being able to exercise effective control over the perpetrators of the illegal act, it is not possible for case law to imply -- implicate responsibility of the Accused under 6(1), and that is something that a concern has been expressed over in your court, under the strict interpretation of criminal law and the principle of nullum crimen sine lege.  And it is clear that in the context of the approving spectator concept, it is present in no standard -- provided for under no instrument of international law; it is only the result of case law -- restrictive case law in the matter.  

In the matter of the synagogue, that example of the "synagogue" affair was founded exclusively on the fact that the Nazi party had already been declared a criminal organisation, so belonging to such a party and exercising any influence within that party and approving, by one's silence, the criminal acts of the perpetrators of the illegal acts led to the accused being found individually responsible, as judged in the famous synagogue trial.  

Coming to the Rome statutes, creating the International Criminal Court, there is no general provision as to omission which would justify that in exceptional circumstances that hypothesis of the approving spectator be of value before ad hoc courts, so, finally, Madam President, Your Honours, a delicate and exceptional form of responsibility that this Court takes into account only with extreme caution and systematically regrets when the accused does not enjoy the powers of a representative of the body public.  

Having made those clarifications as to principle, Madam President, Your Honours, I should like now to come to considering the indictment of which you have been seized, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, well, it's more than two and a half hours that Defence has been speaking.  You think you need how much more time?  Could you sum up?  Since we have all these in writing, if you could sum up.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Defence had not intended to present its closing arguments in this manner but, in view of your ruling, we were compelled to submit in detail, that is, in view of our closing arguments and the corrigendum.  And let me not hide it from you, Madam President, that we still have some amount of information that we would like to submit for your appraisal as part of our closing arguments.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time do you need to conclude?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Let me confess, I cannot -- we need at least three hours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe I should provide some information because -- we cannot sit tomorrow because this courtroom will be occupied by the Karemera case and Judge Kam will be sitting in that case.  So my understanding was that, with the coordinator, it had been understood that the Defence will do everything, maybe taking, say, slightly more than three hours, about the same time as the Prosecution took, would conclude in reasonable time.  It was not my intention to keep everyone until very late in the night.  Maybe if you might not want to go back on what we already have in your brief -- in your written brief, maybe pick up the points in answer to the Prosecutor, because if we were to continue that way, and I refer to your document, we're still at page 28 out of 70 pages.  That might go way beyond what we expect. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I don't know what the coordinator told you or didn't tell you.  I did write to him when we were asked for estimated time when we would be addressing the Court.  I did tell him that we would need seven hours.  No one told us what amount of time the Prosecutor would take.  In fact, when we came here this morning, we didn't talk about the time to speak because we went straight -- or, had problems.  But I'm compelled to say that there's something that is not working.  You know, we're allowed to speak and then we're told, "Well, there is no -- there is no space tomorrow."  Either we submit our arguments or we don't, because there is this feeling, and we're sort of ill at ease if each time and time again we have to submit because there are -- there is a time constraint.  It might not be necessary for us to continue with this trial.  I mean, we're trying to defend Father Seromba.  This trial has been going on for two years and we're still facing the same problem and we're the ones still submitting.  I mean, at this last turn, this last bend, we should be given the opportunity to express ourselves.  We said we needed seven hours.  It's not stolen.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Counsel, when you said you would need seven hours, did the coordinator not tell you that it was not possible?  Because both the coordinator and yourself knew that you had just one day for closing arguments.  And since the matter of taking up what is -- appears in writing, since we have it, and we've read it, and we're going to read it again before we come to a decision, and that's why I'm asking you at this juncture to try to see how you can organise yourselves so that we don't stay here until, I don't know, whatever hour in the night and keeping all those who are helping us with this session.  And it is in that regard that I'm asking you to try to see to what extent you could help us to conclude or end this session in reasonable time.  

Of course, you're free to elaborate on your brief.  The Prosecutor had three hours.  And if you're telling us that you absolutely need seven hours, there is some imbalance there, which is obvious.  Of course, we would need to -- we want to give you more than -- more time than the Prosecutor.  If you -- if it is four hours, four and a half hours, that would be really on the edge, but maybe you're asking us something too tough.  We've had a one hour break so that we can, you know -- did something if we have to keep people until midnight.  You know, that would not be proper.  So try to understand and maybe help us, because what appears here can be dealt with in one hour, one and a half hours, so that we conclude in reasonable time.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, nobody told us that that -- that we would be finishing today.  The Defence was never informed.  We were never told this.  Let me repeat, the coordinator is here, I told him -- I told him again and again that we needed seven hours.  We were never told that the session will conclude today.  So I don't know why we're being deprived of the right to speak.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think the registry's represented and we have the coordinator who was in communication with you, and they said just one day, the 27th.  No mention was made of any other date, the document is there, that the closing arguments will take place on Tuesday, the 27th of June.  They didn't -- no mention was made up of Wednesday, the 28th of June.  

In addition, we've just been told that the interpreters and the court reporters will be there until six o'clock, that's all.  So we're bound to continue until six o'clock.  

Well, we're trying to find some solution, but as I said the -- those assisting us are there since eight o'clock, it would appear at 6 p.m. they will leave and nobody to replace -- nobody to replace them.  We could still sit tomorrow, we have no problem with that, but then will we have a courtroom?  And then there is also Judge Kam who will be sitting in some other case.  There is no doubt that we were scheduled to sit today.  Well, I didn't see any problem with us going slightly beyond six o'clock because -- I'm now told that that is not possible because the interpreters and the court reporters are told that at 6 p.m. they could leave, so instead of wasting more time, maybe Counsel Nekuie should speak and then we will then be told what solution has been found.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, Madam President, sorry, please, I cannot continue to represent Father Seromba under those circumstances.  No one ever told us that we will have just one day.  That's the first point.  There is no document in that regard.  Madam President, we didn't get any such paper.  That is the first point.  

The second one, Madam President -- the second point, Madam President, is that the time allotted to speak for parties was not discussed.  If by chance we follow what the Court says, we will adjourn at six o'clock.  And if the Prosecutor had something to say after we had spoken, what would happen?  Really, you should allow us to say that -- we cannot argue in this way.  The fact that there is no courtroom, the fact that there is no problem with -- there is a problem with the language staff.  That's no business of the Defence.  So the Accused cannot speak, the counsel cannot argue, and then you want to end at six o'clock.  Well, just tell us that we cannot argue and then we can leave and you can deliver your judgement.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think the registrar's just shown you that document which was communicated to all parties.  It was just today, it didn't have to go into tomorrow.  It was quite clear to all parties.  

Counsel Nekuie, could you continue with the closing arguments until we find a solution regarding the interpreters and court reporters, in particular.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I had said that I need at least three hours.  How long am I going to be able to speak as of now?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the time being, I cannot answer you because I am waiting for those who have gone to contact the appropriate authorities to come and inform us of the results, so carry on for the time being.  And when we have the information we will inform you as to what will ensue.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I should like to consult my learned friends before I tell you what I intend to do.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, we've seen that you're following this document.  We have it all in writing.  Can't you continue by saying, "On this particular point, this is covered from this page and that page" et cetera, so that we try to move forward because now we are wasting time?  But we have this document.  We're going to read it.  It's not necessary for it to be repeated over and over.  I'm trying to find a solution that would get you out of this problem.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, it is not for us in the Defence to find a solution, it is you on the Bench.  I am told that there is a hearing tomorrow.  I don't understand.  Each time it is Seromba -- there is a problem.  Why not postpone it so that we can conclude this trial?  You're not going to ask us to correct some errors that are not caused by ourselves.  There is something that has to be argued.  We can't just pick things like that.  That is never done.  If we cannot argue it, Madam President, if we cannot argue this, just tell us that we cannot and then we meet again.  We are not going to try to curtail our work because of problems or with -- with the registry or the services of the Tribunal.  I mean that is not in compliance with our law.  We have to argue this matter right to the end under circumstances that I've explained to you.  We cannot cut short on it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's what we wanted to avoid.  It is because you are reading a document that we have before us.  You say what you want to say and then be referring to this document.  If you have something new to say -- 
MR. NEKUIE:
Well, we don't have the same document before us.  It is not the same document that we have and that is why we didn't understand -- did not understand this morning your ruling on the corrigendum.  There are some parts that you have.  But it does happen that there are important elements that were not available at the time we were submitting the original document and that is why we decided to follow the letter of this document, and that is -- I had to shift aside a number of points, and they are not in the document you have before you, but we want to go by the contents of that document because therein we have all the information that the Defence of Father Seromba intends to submit, you know, towards his judgement before your Court.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is what I was saying this morning.  You could dwell on those new aspects, but not take up what we have here before us because we followed the larger part of what you've told us, and what you've told us appears in this document that is written by the Defence.  

Well, we're not even able to get those who should assist us.  Now, let me make the following proposal:  We'll meet tomorrow, as from 9 a.m., in Courtroom IV.  It will be a 15 bis arrangement because Judge Kam will be involved in the Karemera case, so just two of us will be sitting.  So that's the only solution we have for you in view of what's happening.  

So we'll adjourn.  Very well, then, we shall sit tomorrow at 9 a.m., courtroom IV.  I hope arrangements will be made.  I rely on the registry to ensure that we'll convene tomorrow in courtroom IV to conclude.  

So how much time will the Defence need and whether the Prosecution would need to respond -- time it would need?  We need to conclude absolutely by 1 p.m. tomorrow, so we have to have all the information we need.  

Defence, please.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I have stated that I needed at least three hours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And Counsel Monthé, you want to speak for how long?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Why did you say "also"?  Counsel Monthé, has a right to address the Court.  I will conclude within the time allowed us.  I have already made mention of what we will do.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So this is how we will proceed tomorrow so that things are quite clear:  Now, the parties might make an arrangement amongst themselves.  There maybe some misunderstanding that has brought us to this situation.  We start at nine o'clock.  Defence will be given two and a half hours to conclude.  And then after that, we'll have one hour for your response, if there is any -- if there is any.  

Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, at this stage, I can indicate we have nothing to respond to, obviously it is subject to what is said tomorrow morning.  So I can't give you any final indication other than at the moment we have nothing that we wish to respond to, but that could alter in the course of the submissions made tomorrow morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  Fine.  

Then we resume at 9 a.m. and then we'll see if there is need to allocate that one hour that is scheduled, say, for response, so that we can conclude at one o'clock, no later than that.  So, please, do take every step to assure that we adjourn at one o'clock.  

So for now we adjourn.  We resume at 9 a.m. tomorrow.  Thank you.  Good evening, everyone.
