MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  

We shall proceed with the cross-examination of Witness FE13.  The Prosecutor has the floor.  

Mr. Witness, may we recall the solemn declaration which you made at the beginning of your testimony.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Good morning, FE13.  I would just like to remind you that we are in open session, and that if you need to explain, please, be brief, but most of my questions you will be able to answer with just a word or two.  And with that said, I'd like to start by asking you:  You were a male Rwandan of Hutu ethnicity; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And without saying the name of the school, you completed secondary school; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And I understand that you speak and read French; is that correct?
A.	I do try. 
Q.	Your statement to the Defence of 24 August 2005 says that that was the second meeting with the Defence.  How many statements did you give to the Defence?
A.	I thank you.  I met with the Defence team on two occasions.  The very first time I met one Sylvia.  And on the second occasion, I met with the investigators to whom I gave the statement to which I signed.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
It appears that channel 1 has a lot of background noise, Your Honours.  And, I think, if the technician is available or could help us that would be of great assistance.  

I note that channel 0 has less interference but that would be the floor channel, and you wouldn't be able to hear the English interpretation of the answers.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps we should try to proceed and see if things are better.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness FE13, you testified about a plaque on Nyange church as you saw it in 1994 reading "1953"; is that correct?
A.	You're right. 
Q.	And you mentioned that there was a church at the same site as Nyange that began in 1943; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And would you happen to recall that in 1993 Nyange church would have celebrated a jubilee?
A.	I don't know because I did not participate in the ceremonies. 
Q.	I'd like you, with the assistance of the registry, to take a look at what is photograph exhibit 2 -- P. 2-29 -- P. 2-29.  And, if you can, tell us if that appears to be a jubilee invitation of Nyange of the year 1993; would you agree?
A.	Well, I see that that is what appears on the invitation. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
With the assistance of the registry, if he could be shown photograph -- I'm sorry, exhibit P. 48 -- P. 48 and the previous exhibit put aside.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, looking at P. 48 you will see the photocopy with a circle placed on it.  Would you agree with me that that circle appears around what is a plaque to the right side of a church door?
A.	No, it is not close to the door of the church; it is, rather, close to the bell tower.  
Q.	And you'd agree that the circle appears around a plaque; correct?
A.	That's possible.  And where the plaque appears, the one I referred to, it would appear that was the place where the plaque I referred to is located.  
Q.	So you would agree with me that the photocopy that you have, P. 48, appears to refresh your memory and depict Nyange church with a circle around the plaque; would you agree?
A.	No, that's not correct because the last time we made mention of this matter I told you that I did not recognise the fact that this was the Nyange church because the picture or the photograph of the church could not been taken and, at the same time, see the bush or the forest that I notice without also seeing the presbytery.  And then, when you take a photograph, which would include the forest I'm talking about, that would mean that you're taking a picture of all that belongs to the church, the multi-purpose hall, the church itself.  And then, thirdly, I stated that in Nyange church, or the verandah of that Nyange church, was at floor level or at ground level and so a vehicle can actually move in there.  There were no stairs.  Fourthly, and when you look to the left-hand side of the church, you would notice that there's some sort of a window.  It would appear, one would say, there is something else built next to that church.  So those are the four factors on which I rely in coming to the conclusion that that is not the Nyange church.  Thank you.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that the plaque in P. 48, the document you have in front of you, is in the same place as you recall the plaque on Nyange church?
A.	If I were to say so, that's possible, but let me state this:  The Nyange church looks like the other churches.  For instance, if you were to go to the Holy Family Church in Kigali, you would see a church that looks very much like this one.  So, in Rwanda there are churches like that.  And if I were to say that the plaque is located at that place, that doesn't mean that that is Nyange church.  That could be some other church.  And -- so if I were to tell you that the plaque was located there, you shouldn't rely on that in determining that that is the Nyange church.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'm done with those exhibits.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	And, Witness FE13, I'd like to ask you that between 7 and 8 April 1994, in Kivumu, you would agree that Hutu assailants attacked the Ndakubana and Mwendezi families.  That is N-D-A-K-U-B-A-N-A and M-W-E-N-D-E-Z-I.
A.	Yes, those families were the victims of an attack.  However, since investigations were not conducted to determine whether these were Hutus or Tutsis, I don't know.  There was no investigation, therefore, I cannot say for sure that these were Hutus because your question is in connection with which Hutus were involved.  I have no evidence in support of that because there wasn't any investigation.  All I can add is that we were to respect the Mwendezi family.  That family lived in the same secteur as myself.  There was an attempt to arrest some of the attackers.  In fact, they were arrested but they were never convicted of that crime, so I cannot say for sure that they were the ones who attacked that family.  
Q.	And members of those families were, in fact, killed?
A.	That's right, there were deaths. 
Q.	And the victims were Tutsi?
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And you understood that a reason those families were targeted was because they were Tutsi?
A.	I cannot confirm that because when I made reference to the Ndakubana family, I did say that this was information told me.  And the person who launched the attack against that family was someone who did not agree with that family.  They were quarrelling over land.  So I cannot come to the conclusion that that person attacked that family merely because they were Tutsi, maybe because they did not agree.  
Q.	The attackers were sent by Ndungutse; is that correct?
A.	That is what I was told.  As I told you, no investigations were conducted in order to determine what it was all about.  This was information brought to my attention.  It was said that it was Ndungutse who was the brain behind the attack.  
Q.	And it was IPJ Kayishema who released those persons arrested for that attack; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that one I can confirm because on the 11th, when the meeting took place, a certain Karekezi was being buried.  And the next day, the 12th, therefore, those individuals launched attacks in particular secteurs.  Kayishema was in charge of the communal gaol and he was the one responsible for arresting those people and, subsequently, release them.  The story was that he was the one who released them.  
Q.	Do I understand correctly that Kayishema released those attackers after the meeting of 11 April 1994?
A.	Yes, he released them at night.  
Q.	And, if I recall correctly, those same attacks against those same families were, in fact, matters discussed at the meeting of 11 April 1994; correct?
A.	That's right, it was discussed. 
Q.	In general, in April 1994, would you agree that Tutsi civilians were targeted and attacked because of their ethnicity?
A.	No, I already answered that question.  I told you that I cannot confirm that.  I said that some families faced or experienced problems, and I cannot say for sure that these were the Tutsis or the Hutus who had decided to kill all Tutsis.  Let me further say that there were some Hutus who were being attacked in 1994.  There were all those people who had problems with their neighbours and were looking for some means to revenge.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that Tutsi houses were burnt down after 7 April 1994 causing them to flee?
A.	Yes, yes, you are right.  
Q.	So you would agree that with regard to burning, the Tutsi houses were targeted?
A.	I've already answered that question.  It was not only the Tutsis.  I told you that there were Hutu families who experienced problems.  This was a widespread war.  Well, but the Tutsis were a lot more threatened, but there were Hutus who faced problems. 
Q.	I would like to remind you we are in open session in answering this question.  In April 1994, most secteurs in Kivumu commune were allocated one or two communal policemen; is that correct?
A.	Just one communal policeman, just one. 
Q.	So that was one Kivumu policeman was allocated to each secteur; correct?
A.	The commune had 11 policemen -- communal policemen, and there were 10 secteurs.  Then there was the brigadier and -- so, therefore, each secteur had at least one communal policeman who was a native from there.  So in 1994, the secteurs facing problems were identified.  It was also known that the Tutsis were the victims of attacks, and communal policemen were deployed so that they work with the conseiller de secteur and guarantee the security of the people; in other words, therefore, there were some secteurs where communal policemen were not deployed.  So there were secteurs where there were no communal policemen.  
Q.	With regard to 12 April 1994, you witnessed an attack against Tutsi civilians seeking refuge at a secteur office; is that correct, yes or no?
A.	That did occur.  
Q.	Which secteur office did that occur?  
A.	The Kigali secteur bureau which building had just been completed, together with the support of the Germans and Rena Palatina (phonetic). 
Q.	And did you see Tutsi civilian killed there, yes or no?
A.	No one was killed at the communal office.  When we noticed that the assailants were numerous in number, we released those people and they sought refuge in the hills, in the collines, and they tried to throw stones at the assailants.  They were able to chase them away and someone took them right to Kabgaye.  There was a certain Isidore (phonetic) Higiro who was killed at the secteur bureau -- or, office, but he was taken from somewhere and killed at the secteur office?
Q.	The person you mentioned was killed, was he a Tutsi?  
A.	Yes, he was.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If I could ask the booth for a spelling of that name, or ask the witness if he could spell the name of that Tutsi victim.  
THE WITNESS:
The name is spelt H-I-G-I-R-O, Isidore. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Thank you.  The attackers at Kigali secteur were from that same secteur; correct?
A.	They came from several locations and, on that day, at the secteur office, four attacks occurred, launched from three different locations. 
Q.	I'd like to ask you about Friday, 15 April 1994.  Is it your evidence that you stayed home on that day, the day before Nyange church was bulldozed; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.  On the 15th of April, I did not get to Nyange because there were people who were killed at the secteur, and ************************************ of the said secteur in the burial of those who had been killed and whose bodies were lying in the hills or in the collines.  Burials took place on the 12th and the 13th -- or, rather -- rather, the people were killed on the 12th and the 13th, and we buried them on the 14th and the 15th.  And, so, on the 15th, I didn't get to Nyange.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that in addition to Kayishema and Ndungutse, other persons that played a major part in the killings in Kivumu commune in April 1994 included bourgmestre Ndahimana, Gaspard Kanyarukiga and Joseph Habiyambere?
A.	No judgement was delivered against those people.  I would say that amongst them, there were some who played a major role, a significant role in the events.  Each and every one of them had a particular role that he played in the events.  I don't think it is necessary for me to go into the details in this courtroom.  These are -- this is evidence that I have in my possession and which I'll use for my own trial.  
Q.	Now, you've made several statements to the Rwandan authorities.  Would you agree that no one ever forced you to incriminate Seromba; is that correct?
A.	We did not make statements willingly -- of our own will.  I don't think I'm the first to say so.  In 1994, we were arrested and we were accused of virtually everything, and each and everyone had to explain himself or herself so as to save their lives because there were people who were killed at the time.  A distinction has to be made between statements made on that occasion and the confessions that we made on our testimonies, that is, personal testimonies.  
Q.	My question is very specific:  With regard to the statements you gave to Rwandan authorities, you don't mention Seromba, that's because nobody forced you to mention him; correct?
A.	That will be dictated by the circumstances under which we were interrogated.  And I'm not saying that we were not compelled to make statements.  I was lucky to survive because I was not arrested in Nyange; otherwise, I would have been killed like so many others who were arrested in Nyange.  
Q.	I'll move on to the 16th of April 1994.  You told us last time you were here that you went from your home, on the 16th of April 1994, to the commune office; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And from the commune office you went to the Nyange Virgin Mary statue or Ishushu (phonetic) and then only up as far as CARITAS; correct?
A.	Yes, I did get to that location. 
Q.	And then from CARITAS, you went back to the commune, and after the commune you went to Gasave secteur; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Next you went from Gasave secteur back to the commune and then after that you went up close to Nyange church; correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And it's your evidence that on that second occasion on Nyange church is when you saw Kayishema calling to you; correct?
A.	Yes, Kayishema asked me to call the driver of the bulldozer for him.  
Q.	And when you say "driver", you're referring to Nkinamubanzi; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you saw a portion or a part of that bulldozing and then you went home; correct?
A.	After having called Nkinamubanzi, he came.  He approached Kayishema.  They spoke.  And after they spoke, I noted that Nkinamubanzi had started demolishing the church.  I left them and I went aside.  
Q.	And from the church, at that time, you went home; correct?
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And you learned that the tower or bell tower of Nyange church fell after you had left; correct?
A.	Yes, when the bell tower fell I was no longer there.  
Q.	Now, what time -- let me rephrase.  You left your home at eight o'clock that morning, is that correct, on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	On the 16th of April, I left my home at six o'clock because I had one hour from my home to the communal office. 
Q.	I would like to jump ahead to where you went to the commune office after having been at Gasave secteur.  Can you tell us what time you left -- what time you arrived at the commune office having returned from Gasave secteur on 16 April 1994?
A.	I got to the commune office around 1 p.m., but I did not look at my watch.  But I believe it was between noon and 1 p.m. 
Q.	And if you arrived at the commune office, having returned from Gasave secteur between 12 noon and 1 p.m., what time was it after that that you would have arrived up to where the church was located at Nyange?
A.	I told you that between the commune office and the church there was a distance which could be covered in 15 minutes.  I believe I have made such a statement.  
Q.	So you would agree with me that the soonest you could have arrived at Nyange church on 16 April 1994 would have been 12:15 p.m. and it could have been as late as 1:15 p.m.?
A.	1:30 would be too late. 
Q.	But you would agree that 12:15, 15 minutes after noon, would have been the absolute earliest you would have been at Nyange church; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you saw the bulldozer being driven, it was Nkinamubanzi driving and no one else?
A.	Yes, it was Nkinamubanzi who was driving the bulldozer and I believe I told you there were other drivers on the site.  If I'm not mistaken, I mentioned their names to you.  
Q.	When you saw the bulldozer being driven by Nkinamubanzi, or by anyone, on the 16th of April 1994, did you see a door on the bulldozer placed for purposes of protecting the bulldozer driver, yes or no?
A.	Normally, a bulldozer has a metallic cage on top of it.  But regarding the door, I do not believe I saw it.  
Q.	You testified that a letter of transfer had been issued for Nkinamubanzi.  What do you mean?
A.	I did not understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	What I heard through an interpreter was that some document was issued regarding Nkinamubanzi.  Do you have information about that or am I mistaken?
A.	I still do not understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  It is not clear to me.  
Q.	You testified, in direct examination, questions from Mr. Monthé, about Nkinamubanzi, and you mentioned something about a letter or a document.  Do you recall saying anything like that? 
A.	What letter are you talking about Mr. Prosecutor?  Who would have sent it and what would have been its contents?  
Q.	I'll move on to something else.  You testified that those in charge of security participated in the attacks and that the attackers could not refuse orders and nobody could disobey or object to their orders.  Do you recall that testimony?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Then would you agree that the attackers were following orders and acted in a concerted way?
A.	I would like to make a comment on this matter.  When I answered the question put to me, I had been asked whether anybody could refuse to obey orders given, and I answered that nobody could do such a thing because those who were able to do so were paying a significant part in the events.  As for saying that the events had been organised or planned beforehand, I cannot confirm such a statement.  They arrived on the site, the events took place, but as for these events being planned in advance, I cannot say anything about that.  
Q.	My question is slightly different:  Would you agree that the attackers were all following orders and that they acted together when you saw them on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	As you said -- I believe this is your personal opinion, but I cannot agree with it.  From my observation -- or, rather, my opinion is based on the observations I was able to make at the time but, of course, other people might have different opinions.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that the bulldozing and attack that took place with the bulldozing was the most important killing incident at Nyange?
A.	Yes, there was a significant attack on the 16th of April 1994, but there had been other attacks previously and more specifically on the 12th.  
Q.	But you would agree with me that the biggest number of killing took place by the bulldozer on 16 April 1994?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that evidence about the orders given to the bulldozer driver would be particularly important; correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you mention that conversation between you and Kayishema and the conversation between Kayishema and Nkinamubanzi to the Defence when you met with them in 2005, yes or no?
A.	I would like to say that even today, regarding the evidence which I'm providing, you cannot find this information anywhere else.  We made statements on our responsibilities and our fellow detainees were the ones who interrogated us, so we did not provide all the evidence at the time.  As regards my meeting with the Defence team, we discussed a number of subjects.  
Q.	My question is just about one subject:  Did you or didn't you mention a conversation between Kayishema and the bulldozer driver, Nkinamubanzi, to the Defence when you met with them, yes or no?
A.	We did mention the subject. 
Q.	And when you signed your statement of 2005 to the Defence, it contained that information about that particular conversation?
A.	Are you referring to my statement dated the 24th, Mr. Prosecutor?  I would like to know whether, indeed, you are referring to my statement made on the 24th. 
Q.	Yes, I am.  When you gave a statement to the Defence on 24 August 2005, and signed it, did it conclude your evidence about this important conversation between yourself and Kayishema and the important conversation between Kayishema and the bulldozer driver, yes or no?
A.	I believe the subject was mentioned.  We had a lengthy conversation and we had asked that some elements not be contained in the report because we would use them as evidence during our trial.  You cannot compare the statement I gave on that day and my confession because in my confession I reported on all the events that occurred from the 6th of April to the month of July.  I have evidence that I will use during the course of my trial, so we did not provide all the details.  And it is fortunate that I have come before this Chamber to be able to reveal a number of facts.  I don't think there's any problem with that.  
Q.	Now, you also gave a statement to the ICTR in August 2002.  Do you recall that?
A.	Are you referring to this Tribunal or courts in Rwanda?  
Q.	I'm sorry if my question wasn't clear:  Did you give a written statement to investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor of ICTR in August 2002?  Do you recall? 
A.	I do not recall the exact date, but I do recall that two officials among which one Pierre Duclos and Patrick came to me.  
Q.	Now, when you spoke to the OTP investigators, did you also mention to them, at any time, this important evidence about having witnessed a conversation between Kayishema and the bulldozer driver?
A.	Let me describe the circumstances under which I met with the investigators.  We were summoned.  There were 11 of us.  And we were called, one after the other, and questions were put to us on the Nyange killings.  We answered the questions.  We did not know who was involved, but later on I tried to get information, and I learnt that they were investigators from the Tribunal.  As far as I'm concerned, I do not recall the statement I made in which was put in a report.  And I must tell you that I do not remember the statements I made at the time because it has been a while.  
Q.	On 16 April 1994, at the commune office, bourgmestre Ndahimana gave bullets to assailants; correct?
A.	Yes, I do refer to this event in my statement.  The bourgmestre was the one who had the keys to the stock of ammunition and guns.  So he had the key.  And if he wasn't in possession of it, it was the brigadier of the commune who would keep the key to the storage area.  On the 16th of April, ammunition was used at the church, and I do confirm that the bullets were distributed by the bourgmestre.  And I should add that he was also present on the site.  I do know that on the 15th he was not there, but I would like to state that he did play a role in the events that occurred on the following day, on the 16th, because he was there when the events occurred.  
Q.	And did you see Ndahimana carry or shoot a gun?
A.	No, I did not.  
Q.	At Nyange church on the 16th of April 1994, you would agree that there were thousands of people gathered there.
A.	Yes, indeed.  There were many people there.  
Q.	And when you went up near the church in the afternoon of 16 April 1994, you spent only a few minutes there and then; correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, as a Catholic, did you attend mass at Nyange at which Seromba would have been present, yes or no?
A.	Could you please be more specific as to the period?  Are you talking about the period around the 16th or of any previous time?  
Q.	Let me make it simpler:  How many times would you have seen Seromba before the 16th of April 1994?  If you can give us just an estimate.
A.	May I specify that I would go back home after work and I would cover the distance in one hour.  Sunday was a day for resting when I had nothing specific to do in Nyange.  I would stay at home and pray at home.  And it was at that time that I would have the opportunity to know what was happening in my home.  I cannot tell you that I met Father Seromba because I was busy doing something else.  And during this war -- during these times of war, I did not have the opportunity to meet with Father Seromba, but after the 16th, after the killings that had occurred on the 16th, I do believe I met him.  
Q.	Sir, can you help us to give us a number of times you would have seen Seromba, total in your life, up to, let's say, July 1994?
A.	Even if I did not talk to him, even if I never had the opportunity to meet him during the course of a meeting, because he did not attend most of our meetings, for all intents and purposes, I believe that in 1994 he had spent almost one year in the church because I believe he arrived there towards the end of 1993, during the four months of the end of the year.  So, in April, he had spent almost half a year in the parish.  And during that time, I believe I must have met him because I believe having attended some of the masses which he celebrated.  
Q.	So having seen him for at least half a year by April 1994, can you estimate that you saw him more than 20 times, more than 30?  If you can give us an estimate, it would help.
A.	I believe you, yourself, understand how difficult it is to answer such a question.  It is not easy to specify how many times one has met somebody, and if you put to me the question of knowing whether I had met him or knew him, then I could answer you.  For example, everyday I come to this courtroom, almost everyday, and I know that if you put to me a question on an individual I would have met here, I would not be in a position to answer your question.  So I do not recall how many times I met Father Seromba.  
Q.	Let me ask you along the lines you've suggested, that on the 16th of April 1994, you would have been easily able to recognise Seromba; is that correct?
A.	Oh yes, I could have recognised him because I told you he had spent half a year at that location.  I could recognise him, same as all the people who were working at that place.  I know that he, for his part, might not have been able to recognise me, but for me it was quite easy to recognise him because he was someone from our area, who had come from outside our area.  
Q.	I spoke to you earlier about a statement you gave to the ICTR investigators.  I'm going to give you, with the help of the registry, a copy of that document.  And I'd ask you to take a look at it just to confirm that the signatures on it are, indeed, yours.  Before I get help:  You would recall that that statement was read back to you before you signed it; correct?
A.	When we were being interviewed during that period, we were summoned to the public prosecutor office, and anyone who refused to sign a statement would be locked up.  So be it -- whatever happens, it was necessary to sign the statement.  
Q.	Looking at what is the ICTR statement you gave on 12 August 2002, you would agree that that is your signature on the bottom of each page; correct?
A.	Yes, I do, indeed, recognise that signature.  It is mine.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
For the Trial Chamber, a point of clarification, the 2002 statement -- the two cover pages of the signed version are in French and the text appears in English.  And the French translation of the entire document is not signed.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, my previous question to you, Witness FE13, is:  Looking at the signed copy that you have, you would agree with me that it was read back to you before you signed it; correct?
A.	I know that when I was discussing with those investigators, there was an interpreter.  So you're asking me whether it was read back.  It was read.  And I notice that this is a document in English, so I won't be able to tell you whether this was the statement read back to me, otherwise nothing has changed from what was read to me.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
For purposes of the record, I misspoke.  The actual date of that statement is fifteen -- 15 August 2002.  

With the help of the registry, if the witness can be given a French translation of his statement of 15 August 2002 so he might be able to follow along as well.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	I'm going to ask the registry to provide you the French translation since you can read and follow that one, and you can put aside the one that is signed because it is in English.  And I'm going to ask you to look at what is page 3, in both versions, and look at paragraph 6, which is a one-sentence paragraph, and tell me when you've found it or look up, please.
A.	I've already read the excerpt you're referring to.  
Q.	Thank you.  I'll read it allowed, and I quote -- it starts, "I know Father Seromba" --  

"I know Father Seromba as he lived at Nyange parish, but I would not be able to describe him and not recognise him now."   

Do you recall making that statement?  
A.	I did make that statement, and I will give you the reason for making the statement.  I was asked if I knew Father Seromba.  I, however, stated that maybe he has changed, and if he were to be introduced to me now I might not be able to recognise him.  It is quite some time -- or, some time has elapsed since I saw him, so I wasn't too sure whether I would recognise him.  I was introducing a (inaudible) -- that I was going to look at him carefully to find out if he had not changed.  And since I saw him, it seemed to me that he didn't have the same height as he did at Nyange.  So -- he looked very physical.  I'm sure if he were to be introduced to the Nyange population there are very few people there who would recognise him.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I'd like to go to what is page 4 in English.  And in French -- in French, it's the last paragraph that starts "(French spoken)".  And in English, it is the second to last paragraph, but I'm going to start with the second sentence with begins, "(French spoken)".  This is on the 16th of April and read to the end of that paragraph.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, have you found that? 
A.	Yes, I'm there.  
Q.	I'm actually going to start with, "I then went to Nyange centre" which is two or three sentences down there.  So I'm going to quote -- it's the sentence that begins in French "(French spoken)".  And I quote:  

"I then went to Nyange centre and I saw many dead bodies in a hole.  When I asked who had killed these people, I was informed that there had been an attack against the Tutsi refugees and an ex-gendarmes, who was a reservist, called Rukara had thrown a grenade from the bell tower of the church which killed many people.  I was told that a hole had been dug by a Caterpillar to bury the bodies, and this was at the end of a row of shops at the centre.  I then returned to the commune to look for the bourgmestre.  I was informed that a group of attackers had come from Kibirira, Gisenyi, to kill the Tutsi people at Gasave secteur.  There were no -- there were no Tutsi people alive in my secteur, but others had survived in other secteurs.  I went with two police officers" -- I'm going to omit the names -- "when we arrived at Gasave secteur, I found that an entire Tutsi family had seen the attackers coming and locked themselves in their house and killed themselves with a grenade.  I cannot remember the name of the family."  

That's the end of the paragraph.  

And the next one begins, "On the morning of 17th April 1994".  

Do you see that in your statement, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I've seen all those details. 
Q.	So you would agree with me that when you spoke to the ICTR investigators, you, in fact, did not mention this supposed conversation between yourself and Kayishema and between Kayishema and the bulldozer driver that you described as important; correct?  It's not there.
A.	Yes, I do agree and admit I didn't make mention of that information.  I was answering questions that were put to me.  Now, you're cross-examining me.  You're not asking me questions on this or that.  I don't want to venture into talking about this fact.  
Q.	In the statement you gave to the Defence on 24 August 2005, you also didn't mention that -- and I'll give you a copy so you can read it.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
So I see now the registry is now giving you a copy of your statement in French given to the Defence.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Feel free to look at that.  Read it as you can.  And tell me if you agree that nowhere in that statement appears those important conversations about bulldozer driver?
A.	Let me concede that no reference was made to that information of the conversation, whether it be in the statement -- the first statement you showed me or even in this one.  But I believe I did say here that I got to the parish on two occasions, on the 16th of April.  I remember that I left the parish, went to the communal office and, subsequently, to Gasave.  That was my statement to the investigators.  However, before this Court, I did specify -- or, explain what happened on my return from Gasave.  And, once more, I would like to state that all I'm doing is answering your questions or answering questions that were put to me.  
Q.	I put it to you that if you arrived back and went up close to Nyange church, at the earliest 12:15 and maybe later, that that conversation that you say here took place, could not have happened because the bulldozing, in fact, had started hours before then.  What would you say?
A.	I do not share that view.  And I'm speaking of someone who was an eyewitness to what happened.  I believe we do agree that I was there.  Maybe there might be some detail on which we do not manage to agree, but let me say to you that that conversation did, indeed, take place. 
Q.	I also put it to you that if you were amongst thousands of attackers you would not have been in a position to see Seromba if he was, in fact, present near Nyange church on 16 April 1994?
A.	Yes, there were a lot of people.  If I made mention of Kayishema, it was because when I went there he called me up.  If I mentioned the name of the bourgmestre, I went there to look for him.  There were a number of people who were known to me.  If the question was to ascertain the number of people I met in Nyange, well, I didn't mention some names -- and there were some people who were known to me who played a role in what happened.  If you were to go to the Kivumu commune now, we're preparing for the Gacaca court sessions.  We're at the stage of gathering information, that is, with respect to anyone who was at the site -- were summoned to appear.  And at the appropriate time, each person will tell what he or she saw.  And during the making of my statement, I wasn't bound to give the names of all those that I saw.  I noticed that they were not interested in obtaining all that information.  I was only focusing on information that could be of assistance to them.  
Q.	Is it your evidence that the orders to a bulldozer driver, when it was destroyed by a bulldozer, the church was not significant enough to mention?
A.	In view of the fact that that question was not put to me in regard to that matter, my conclusion was that they were not interested in that question.  They just told me what they wanted.  And if they had wanted that information, I would have provided it.  They asked me questions and all I was doing was answering.  If they wanted to go into the details, I would have done so.  And, so, I was answering questions that were put to me.  And here, for instance, if you were to ask me a question, I would answer the question that was put to me. 
Q.	I would like to ask you a question about the second to last question and answer in your Defence statement.  And in your answer you said -- this is the second sentence of the second to last question -- it starts, in French, "(French spoken)".  And I'll read that sentence.  Quote:  "Some said that he, being Seromba, went on a mobilisation tour."  In French, it is (French spoken).  "But I did not see him."   

Would you agree with me that mobilisation or sensitisation in this context in April 1994 means inciting people to attack Tutsi; correct?
A.	Could you or could I ask you to ask your question again because I didn't quite get it and I can't find the passage from which you're reading?  
Q.	You have a copy of your statement, in French, to the Defence from 24 August 2005.  Your second to last answer.  Tell me --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Can you read the second sentence that starts, "(French spoken)".  And when you've read it, tell me doesn't that mean targeting Tutsi?  
A.	Well, when I was being interviewed, my replies -- or, I expressed myself in the Kinyarwanda language.  And I don't think it is that easy to interpret.  It's difficult to record all that was said.  Like, for instance, here, in the courtroom, when we talk about something that occurred outside, somebody's asked to take down all that is said.  I don't think that person would be able to narrate the events -- narrate the events in the same manner.  So let me say that we were detainees and there were people who were making allegations against Father Seromba; in other words, that he played a role in the massacre, and that's why he was arrested.  And if no one had accused him he would not be here in this courtroom.  Well, what I said in my statement -- I did specify that I did not see Father Seromba because the question that was put to me was, yes or no, whether Father Seromba was involved in that sensitisation.  And I said, "no" because some people had said that they had seen him, and I am saying that I did not at all see him, and I'm asking or wondering whether you're satisfied with the answer I have provided to your question.  
Q.	If I understand your answer, you've said that the meaning of sensitisation, in your answer, may have been misinterpreted, so it was a question of interpretation.  So my question of reasonable interpretation of that word refers to inciting the targeting of Tutsi, isn't it?
A.	But when you're talking about sensitisation, I don't think that can be interpreted in that manner.  You might need to ask something else because sensitisation doesn't -- is not synonymous with what you're saying. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that the question before that answer does not, in fact, refer to sensitisation or mobilisation and it was you who talked about that?  Look at the question.  I am saying it doesn't mention sensitisation, does it? 
A.	Again, let me go back.  The question put to me was worded in the following manner:  Do you think Father Seromba played a role in what happened, and my answer is "no".  But I also wanted to say that there were people who allege that Father Seromba did engage in sensitisation.  And I'm saying I did not see him.  I told you that when we were interviewed, we had spent some eight years in prison, and we managed to meet and talk about these matters.  There were people who were summoned to appear here to testify for Father Seromba or testify against Father Seromba.  Well, if there are people who did so, you cannot exclusively rely on their testimony, and I was -- I am wondering whether there were people who were testifying against Father Seromba.  I'm not too sure those people exist.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Your Honours, at this time, I'd ask and move to admit both the ICTR statement and Defence statement.  I realise we're approaching the break.  I have about 15 more questions for closed session.  So, if we could, at least, do the admission of documents at this time.  So I would move to seek for the admission of the 15 August 2002 statement by this witness, FE13, into evidence, both in English and French, as the next exhibit.  I'm at a loss for the number.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you assist us in connection with the number.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
I believe it's 58, I've been so informed.  So I would move that this exhibit be admitted as Prosecutor's exhibit 58 in English and French.  
MR. MUSSA:  
Yes, please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, the document which you would like to tender is the document dated 24th August 2005?  
MR. TOWNSEND:
That's the Defence exhibit, Your Honour.  We could do that first.  I was proposing second.  My motion was for the 15 August 2002 Prosecutor's statement.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So we have the two statements; one in English the other one in French, dated 15 August 2002.  So we admit that this document -- it will be P. 58A and B for the English and French versions. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 58A and P. 58B admitted, under seal) 
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you, Your Honours.  And that would be under seal.  

As to the second document, I would move to admit into evidence the statement of FE13, to the Defence, dated 24 August 2005 in French, and an uncertified translation into English as P. 59, also under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document dated 24th August 2005 is admitted into evidence as P. 59, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 59 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And P. 58 is also under seal.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Those are all of my questions for open session.  Again, I have about sixteen questions remaining.  If we were to come back after the break, I would be asking for closed session for the balance of my cross-examination, Your Honours.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court stands adjourned for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1103H)
(Pages 1 to 16 by Roxane Meena)














MADAM PRESIDENT
Mr. Nekuie, we are now in open session.  You may resume the examination-in-chief of Witness FE55.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:  
Q.	Witness FE55, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Witness FE55, I hope you are more relaxed this afternoon after the break from 12:30 to 2:30.  Are you getting me?  Do you feel a lot better this afternoon? 
A.	Yes, you are right, I feel better. 
Q.	Very well.  I, therefore, hope you will be in a position to answer my questions fully without taking into account any previous exchanges we had.  Have you understood me? 
A.	Yes, there is no problem. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.

Now, when we parted company before the lunch break, I put a question to you, asking you whether you went to the church after the mass of April 1994 which you attended, and your answer was yes, and you went on to say that you remember going back to the church between Tuesday and Thursday; was that, indeed, your answer? 
A.	Yes, that is indeed what I said.  I went to church when I went to see Wakayiru and other neighbours. 
Q.	When you had to go and see Wakayiru and other members who were there; did the latter tell you that they were deprived of their freedom to leave the church and go back to their homes? 
A.	In fact, when you flee from your home, how can you go back there?  However, I know that some persons left the church to go and eat at their homes.  There was a certain Muhigirwa who had a shop and he went to his home for his meals, but one Wednesday when he was going to his home to eat, he was caught and killed.  Of course, people left the church to move about a bit, but they did so discreetly because they could have been killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  You were, therefore, not told that those refugees were imprisoned by those gendarmes who were present there.  Did you not obtain such information? 
A.	No, those refugees could move about, because I use to meet them on the ground.  For instance, I met Joseph near the statue of the Virgin Mary whenever he came for a drink. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  During that period, did you hear that Father Seromba had deprived them of food while they were at the parish? 
A.	How could he have refused them water, since there was a tap in the sacristy?  There was another tap where mass servants prepared themselves, and there was another tap outside where refugees could, therefore, obtain potable water. 
Q.	Did it also happen that Father Seromba prevented them from obtaining food? 
A.	Now, Counsel, I believe I told you at the beginning of my testimony that the priest announced that the people could bring food to the refugees.  He issued an announcement to the effect that food should be brought to the refugees.  It was possible for CARITAS in Nyindo to bring food to those refugees, but I know that they went to Entandwe secondary school to fetch supplies, and since there were problems in transporting provisions or supplies in Nyange, they had to go to Entandwe to obtain food even if it meant that they would pay for the food once peace was restored.  I know that CARITAS was in charge of providing the refugees with food, but I am not in a position to know the type of food that CARITAS gave the refugees. 
Q.	Thank you, for this explanation, Witness FE55.
MR. NEKUIE:   
Madam President, I note that the name Entandwe is not on the list, and I would request the interpreters to spell it out for us, with your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the interpreters help us by spelling that name?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Entandwe is:  E-N-T-A N-D-W-E, Entandwe.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreter.  Counsel, you many proceed.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR NEKUIE:  
Q.	Witness FE55, you referred to refugees and you mentioned names.  I would request you to repeat the names.  You mentioned a refugee, who on his way home, to get food was attacked and killed.  Can you clarify the circumstances under which that refugee was attacked -- killed, and the Wednesday you are referring to, what date was that? 
A.	That person was killed on Wednesday, the 13th. I believe he was killed by a man known as Habumukisha.  That person was coming from his home.  He had just gone to get some food.  He had a shop.  I do not know the circumstances of his death.  His body lay on the road.  He had gone to have lunch. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  How far from the parish did that attack occur, and what was the name of that person?  Could you remind us of his name, for the record? 
A.	His name was Muhigirwa.  He was killed at the bend of the road from Kibuye, not far from the parish. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, with your leave, I would ask the interpreters to spell that name for us.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Muhigirwa is spelt as follows:  
M-U-H-I-G-I-R-W-A.  There was also Habumugisha, spelt as follows: H-A-B-U-M-U-G-I-S-H-A.  
MR. NEKUIE:
May I proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we thank you, the interpreters.

Please proceed, Counsel Nekuie.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE55, during that period, do you know the attack in which Muhigirwa was attacked -- the refugees from the church were attacked?  When would they have been attacked, to the best of your recollection?  
A.	On that Wednesday, a doctor called Ntangohurungu (phonetic) was killed while in Kigali, his mortal remains were brought to Kibuye on Thursday.  So there were Interahamwe among those who came to announce his death.  In the afternoon of that day, they went to church.  They were led by Ndungutse, as well as by another businessman, whose name I do not know.  That businessman lived in Kigali.  When they arrived, the gendarmes said this to them:  "Listen, there are very few of you.  You cannot attack those people.  You cannot attack those refugees because they are in large numbers."  So that group left and went to Montanuga.

I need to point out that during that period, war was raging and there were no meetings held.  There were small groups of people who stood here and there, or who met here and there to see what could be done.  There was a crisis committee in the communal office, and it's that committee that organised everything.  So that group came back on Friday to attack the church; they also returned on Saturday to attack the church.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  If you do not mind, I would like you to give us the name of the businessman you referred to, and, can you tell Chamber how you came by the information on the meeting that that group had with the gendarmes on the 14th of April? 
A.	I cannot give the name of that person in public, because you said we are now in open session.  I would prefer to put his name on a piece of paper. 
Q.	That is exactly what I was going to ask you to do, Witness FE55, with the leave of the Chamber? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, please give the witness a piece of paper and a pen, so that he can write that name.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I believe it is name No. 3 on the list I distributed, for purposes of the record.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have seen that name, can you please proceed?

MR NEKUIE:
Obliged, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE55, how did you hear of the conversation between that group you referred to and the gendarmes at the church?  Can you also tell the Chamber, when that group went to the church? 
A.	That group arrived on Thursday afternoon, because they met near the statue of the Virgin Mary.  There were some street kids who were preventing people who go food from the refugees on passing.  I arrived between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.  When that group arrived, I came with my brother in-law, I went out -- the brother-in-law was called ************* -- I went up to the group, and the gendarmes told them:  "Those people are too numerous.  Those refugees are too numerous.  They are close to a thousand of them.  You cannot attack them."  That is why we returned to Muntanoga, because the gendarmes had convinced us that they were more numerous than us, and stronger than us.  So, I asked Ndungutse, why people were blaming them for not -- for wanting to attack people, and his answer was, "We do not want to attack.  All we want to ascertain is whether those refugees had been disarmed, and to find out what stones they had -- to see the size of the heap of stones they had in the church.  We, the members of the population did not see why the group was going up to the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  Did Ndungutse tell you that it was Father Seromba's duty to disarm those refugees?  Did they also tell you whether they met Father Seromba during their visit? 
A.	No.  When Ndungutse went up, the group stopped at the church.  Ndungutse and Makoro remained at the church.  They had discussions with the gendarmes.  As for the Interahamwe, who had come from Kigali, as well as the brigadier, Ibonald, they surrounded the church.  In fact, it was in the afternoon, while the priests were taking their siesta, a meeting was held at Montanoga, that was when it was said that "You, Rushema, have to go to your native village to recruit members of the population."  They sent someone else to Kibilira, and so on and so forth, such that people were sent to their various villages, to recruit members of the civilian population who had to attack the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  You referred to a meeting held at Montanoga.  Who chaired that meeting and who attended it?  And when, exactly was it held?  Was it after the group went to the church or before?  Can you be more specific on that point? 
A.	In fact, before they got to the church, they met at Montanoga, then they went up to the church.  I met them at about 2 p.m. as they were heading for the church.  So, when they went down, they returned to Montanoga.  In fact, it was the crisis committee, but I would prefer to write down the names of all the members of that crisis committee on a piece of paper.  Thus, I would be in a position to better explain how people were sent to various secteurs. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, have you given him the piece of paper?  Could you, please, give him a piece of paper again? 
THE WITNESS: 
I believe I can give the names specifying the locations at which they were assigned.  I could do so in an orderly manner.  For instance, the person whose names I wrote on the piece -- on the previous piece of paper, gave a certain amount of money, and organised people.  Otherwise, he was not seen among the assailants, he remained at home at a specific place.  In fact, I would say that he was a coordinator.  For instance, I could go to the venue of their meeting, because of my brother-in-law.  I was not amongst those who were being pursued because of my brother-in-law as well.  Ndungutse was assigned to go and recruit people in Nyange.  Habiyambere, was put in charge of recruiting people in Ngobangoba. Some people went to Nyanza, like Warrant Officer Habarungira.  He was assigned to go to Nyanza.  That was the way they were organised.

1500H
BY MR. NEKUIE: 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  Witness, can you tell the Chamber whether that crisis committee was in touch with Father Athanase Seromba, and whether they had any meetings with the latter. 
A.	For instance, on the Thursday they were in Montanonga and I did not see the priest there.  They also held a meeting, but it wasn't a meeting as such.  It was a group of people who met here and there.  No meeting had been convened with an agenda.  They did things more or less on a make shift manner.  They were improvising. It wasn't something organised before hand.  For instance, regarding the meeting held on Thursday evening, when they talked about how people would be recruited, or be it a meeting held on the Friday, that is the day on which I buried the doctor.  I did not see the priest in the company of those groups during those days. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Do you know whether it was that crisis committee that had sent for gendarmes to be stationed at that church? 
A.	When the Tutsi sought refuge at the church, it was customally for the commune to protect them.  The priest distributed food through Caritas.  I was not an employee of the commune office such as to attend that meeting but I heard that a meeting was held on Monday.  It was Oliyemeye who informed me of a meeting that was held.  I, therefore, I am aware that a meeting was held and during that meeting it was decided that the gendarmes should be requisitioned in Kibuye, otherwise all the priest had to do was to provide food through Caritas.  

Regarding Caritas, there was no staff.  The priest had been killed and those were the circumstances under which he took food from Tandwe School to provide it to the refugees.  That was the situation prevailing at the time, but I did not attend the meeting held on Monday although I heard about it.  So I am giving you this information for purposes of information only. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But were you told that that meeting held on the 11th, was a crisis committee meeting coordinated by the person whose name you wrote on a piece of paper a while ago? 
A.	I heard about that meeting by Aloys Oliyemeye from the region of Memu (phonetic).  He had gone to harvest cassava and he was told not to harvest all the cassava, because the priest had informed him that food had to be provided to the refugees.  So part of the harvest had to be kept for the refugees who were at the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  You indicated that the crisis committee met on Friday, was that Friday the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	Regarding the meeting on Friday, it was on the 15th, and I recall that I had gone to attend the burial of 
Doctor Ntahuriwenga, and on the way I went to the church to look at -- to see what had happened.  There was blood everywhere.  So I went down -- I found a group of people next to the pharmacy, and I went close by to listen to what they were saying.  They could not chase me, so I heard what was being said.  And besides they didn't chase anybody else.  Anybody could attend their meetings. 
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber what you heard during the meeting of the 15th of April l994, and specify once again, whether Father Seromba attended the said meeting? 
A.	We finished with the burial around 4 p.m., and after the burial, some people came to us whereas others went elsewhere to have a drink.  We arrived in Nyange around 5 p.m., and I spent approximately 30 minutes there.  I told you that this man was with Ndungutse and Rushema in small groups, and amongst the words I was able to hear, this man said that he had not seen the intellectuals and that the priest had hidden them in the Presbytery. He asked that everyone do one search for the people to be found.  And he added that only Gatare and Miriam had been found.  And he also added that the priest had locked them in somewhere in the Presbytery.  He asked those people do their best to find these people and he also told them, if need be, that they were to destroy the church.  When I left the decision to demolish the church had not yet been made.  And I don't know whether the decision was made after I left or whether it had been made in the morning but when I left, they were visiting the demolition of the church.  And these words were pronounced by the businessman whose name I wrote on the piece of paper as well as Ndungutse.  And I would like to specify that during the course of that meeting, I did not see the priest. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55, for these clarifications.  But the intellectuals he was talking about, were they on a list which had been establish before hand by the priest and forwarded to the bourgmestre?  Could you shade light on this matter for the benefit of the Court? 
A.	That person sought refugee during the day not during the night.  For example, Rubonera, Aloys Rubonera,  Rutengesha, Charles and Rutengesha's son, as well as, Rubonera's daughter, 
	Gatare Anyisizi's wife, Anyizi Munkankanka, her son Jerome Hagatare.  And I heard that he worked here.  I hear him quite often on the radio.  There was also one, Rwamasirambo who survived, as well as, Kahiranga, all of them left the presbytery on Friday evening with the assistance of the priest.  And some of them were killed on the way.  Otherwise, no one was killed in the presbytery.  Some were killed in Ngobakoba. Rubonera's wife survived the killings but she was killed in Kabwaye.  Munkankanka is still alive and her son Jerome Hagatare, Jean Baptiste Safari is still alive.  And those are the people who were mentioned during that meeting. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  But could you tell the Chamber whether these persons were on a list which would have been established beforehand by father Seromba, and would have been submitted to the assailants for them to seek out these persons? 
A.	No list was established beforehand.  At least not to my knowledge.  Decisions were made on the spot, but no list had been established beforehand.  They would meet, they would converse and they would agree on one item or another. 
Q.	Thank you.  You mentioned Gatare and a certain Miriam who allegedly were killed on the 15th of April, 1994, did you hear that Father Athanase Seromba was the one who handed them to the assailants? 
A.	I heard that it was -- and he said it is Gatare who paid the gendarmes for them to kill him instead of him being killed by Hutus.  As for Miriam, I heard that she had gone out and when grenades were launched some Tutsis locked themselves in and Miriam was not able to go in with the others.  So she stayed outside of the church, and that is where she was killed.  I never heard that it was 
Father Seromba who had handed these people over.  Would he have handed over Gatare instead of handing over his wife or his son.  I know that both of them were in the church.  The intellectuals, the teachers, the doctors, the traders were the ones who sought refuge in the library of the presbytery.  I could see them, (inaudible) who had been my teacher.  We would bring them some bread or some lemonade.  The priest could not chase Gatare and leave his wife -- his son and his wife Munkankanka. 
Q.	Very well, Witness FE55.  Witness FE45,(sic) according to your narration, the crisis committee seemed to be quite active at the time of the events in Nyange.  Could you tell the Chamber if because of this (inaudible) of the committee, Father Seromba was at least informed of the existence of the said committee? 
A.	Which authority was to be informed?  Father Seromba was not the bourgmestre.  There were small groups of people who met here and there and made decisions in a disorderly manner.  And whoever wished to prevent them from doing what they pleased could be killed.  Otherwise, it was not necessary for Father Seromba to be informed of the activities of this group. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  According to you, the decision of the crisis committee made on the 15th of April 1994, was that the decision which led to the destruction of the church on the following day, on the 16th of April? 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, counsel must be careful.  The witness said that he was not there when any decision was made. And I dare say that almost every question counsel has asked is leading. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Let me rephrase, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE55, to your knowledge, do you believe it was the fact that the destruction of the church was mentioned by this coordinator the previous day, that led to the destruction of the church on the following, on the 15th of April l994? 
A.	I told you that on the 15th when I was coming back from that person's burial, I saw a group of people in front of the pharmacy who were saying that those who were in the church were not dead.  And they were visiting the possibility of demolishing the church.  But when the decision to demolish the church was made I was not there.  And the information I gave you was information I got while I was passing by.  And I would not like to hinder the work of the Prosecutor.  I am only narrating those facts which I was an eye-witness to.  But I would like to say that I was not present when the decision to demolish the church was made. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  Do you know whether any member of the famous committee reported to Father Seromba regarding the decisions made on that evening? 

MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
But Madam President, the witness has said that he was not there.  I fail to see what is the basis of this question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you kindly rephrase, please, Counsel. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I shall rephrase, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE55, after this famous meeting of 15th April 1994, were you able to ascertain whether some members of the committee met with Father Seromba to report on the decisions made?  Did you hear such a thing being said? 
A.	I reported to you the facts to which I was an eye-witness.  On the Friday.  I told you what I saw on that Friday when the crisis committee was meeting.  As for the events that took place on Saturday, the 16th, I was not there.  And I believe those who were there are in a better position than I am to talk about them. 
Q.	Thank you.  What were the events that took place on Saturday the 16th of April even though you were not present? 
A.	In any case the church was demolished completely on the 16th. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were you able to ascertain who gave the order to destroy the church on the 16th of April l994? 
A.	I would be hard pressed to talk about the events that took place on Saturday the 16th, because I was not there.  I cannot venture into doing such a thing.  I have come here to talk about those facts I was an eye-witness to.  As for the events of the 16th, I would not venture to talk about them since I was not there on that day. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  Since you were mentioning these facts before the Chamber, Witness FE55 and that you also talked about it to the Defence team -- about Father Athanase Seromba, did you have the opportunity to talk about these events with the investigators of this Tribunal? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps you be more specific.  What are you talking about?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am talking about the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If he made a statement, on what subject?  Because you did not specify. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am talking about the events of l994, in April, to which he was an eye-witness.
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to the events that took place in l994?  Madam President, Your Honours, I have made mention of the events of l994, starting with this specific event regarding those who died on the 8th.  I also talked about an individual who was killed after having had his breakfast.  I also mentioned the attack that was launched on the church around midday on the day when the gendarmes told us that the people were more numerous than we were.  And my brother in-law, Ndungutse, had informed me that they were going to determine how many refugees there were in the church and also look at the amount of stones that they had piled up there.  When they left that place, they went to Mutanonga to talk about the recruitment of people who would assist them.  And to talk about the way they would be deployed.  So these are events which I mentioned in my testimony. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  To be more specific, I would like to put the following question to you.  Did you have the opportunity to narrate these facts to a team of investigators of the ICTR?  If your answer is "Yes", did you, on that occasion, make any accusations, vis-a-vis Father Seromba? 
A.	I met with the investigators on two occasions.  On the first occasion I was in *******, and on the second occasion I was in the solidarity camp.  The first investigator, he came to ******** after information on Seromba.  He asked that I cooperate with him.  And he was asking me to talk about the behaviour of Seromba for me to be able to testify against him.  I told him that I would think about it.  I did not accept and I did not refuse either.  As for the second person, who came to me when I was in the solidarity camp, he was with someone called Ntuyisenge Mandi, who reminded me that I had been recruited and that I was part of the solidarity camp.  And he reminded me that I was to testify against Seromba.  He gave me a questionnaire to which I was to respond.  I put the questionnaire in my pocket and I went into a room where I found a white lady who had come along with an interpreter.  I was told that there was a white lady with whom I should cooperate regarding Seromba.  They begged me to cooperate but I refused, and the interpreter informed the deputy of the fact that I had refused.  Ginseng (phonetic) called me again and asked again what was happening.  I told him that I had agreed to cooperate with these people but under secrecy.  And I realised that they knew who I was.  He threatened me and told me that he would take me back to prison.  

Statements were brought to me which I signed, but I do not believe I testified against Seromba.  After the time I spent in the solidarity camp I was brought back to the prison to this day.  So these are the circumstances under which I met with the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor.  And I just told you the way in which they behaved.  They did not keep to their promise. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness FE55, but when you were telling them that you were willing to cooperate, were you considering making or giving testimony against Father Seromba on the events in Nyange? 
A.	I wanted to cooperate with them just as I am cooperating with you right now. 
Q.	Am I to understand that you wanted to indicate your availability to respond to their questions and merely that? 
A.	I wanted to tell them about the events that occurred from the beginning of the war until the end of l994.  As for them they wanted to put questions to me, but they also wanted to impose specific answers on me.  And I told them "That wouldn't do."  And as if that was the way in which the people in Arusha worked, I was ready and willing to go back to prison.  And I would like to say that my guilty plea was accepted and that I was able to participate in the solidarity camp.  But as you can see, I am still in prison and I have not been released. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  Do you believe that you have not been released because of your refusal to cooperate? 
A.	Yes.  Since it was proposed that I testify against the priest, I asked them what I was to say, they proposed a series of questions to me and the answers I was to provide.  I don't think it's useful to go into the details of all this.  And besides I do not wish to remember what happened to me.  I do not know what I can say.  I have suffered a denial of justice.  I was told that if I pleaded or rather if I testified against him, I would be freed.  But as you can see I have not been released and 
I am still in prison until this day.  I believe this is not justice whereas other people were released? 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE55.  And today, before this Court, Witness FE55, have you come to say what you know about the events of Nyange? 
A.	That is what I told you since I started testifying before this Court.  And I made a solemn declaration to say the truth.  I don't know what you want me to add to this. 
Q.	I just wanted to have this confirmation on your part, Witness FE55.  To then -- FE55, to then thank you for having had the courage to come and testify on behalf of Father Seromba, and I would like to wish you a safe journey back to Rwanda.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the examination-in-chief of Witness FE55, which is now fully at your disposal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Nekuie.  

Madam Prosecutor, you may start cross-examining Witness FE55. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, we are in open session, and I just wish to remind you of that before I begin to ask you questions.  So I am requesting that you do not name your cellule when I ask you questions until we are in closed session.  
Witness, you spoke of several persons who were killed immediately -- 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, I see the witness has his finger in the air and seems to ask a question of the 
Trial Chamber, I don't know whether I should continue. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, I have a problem.  Madam President, Your Honours, I have a problem.  The Prosecutor has just told me that we are now in a closed session, but that at any time we can go into closed session.  I would like to know when we are in open session and when we are in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  But it may happen that one of the parties -- the Prosecutor who is cross-examining you now, may deem it necessary for us to go into closed session in order to protect your identity if she deems that the question she is putting to you would reveal your identity.  Now we are in open session.  Understood? 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness.  Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, you gave evidence that several persons, whom you named, were killed immediately after the death of the President.  My question is this:  All the persons who were killed on the hills in your commune after the death of the president were Tutsis, correct? 
A.	Yes, they were Tutsis. 
Q.	And they were killed, these persons who were killed on the hills of your commune, they were killed by the Hutu neighbours, correct, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And they were killed, Witness, principally because they were Tutsi, correct, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  I had pleaded guilty to those crimes.  Crimes which I committed against some of those people.  But since it is said that the genocide was committed against the Tutsi, you are right.  They were killed because of their ethnic origins. 
Q.	Witness, you knew the IPJ of your commune, isn't that true.  At least you know of him and you know his name? 
A.	Yes, ***********************************************.  I even know his mother and his father. 
Q.	Very well, Witness, without mentioning his name since you have said **************************, we wish to be careful.  Do not mention his name.  This IPJ, he was the one who -- well, he was one of the persons who mobilised the youth in the community to attack the Tutsis who had taken refuge at Nyange; is that so, Witness? 
A.	Yes, he was a member of the crisis committee I have referred to. 
Q.	As a matter of fact, Witness, this person, the IPJ, he used a vehicle and went around to all of the secteurs and trading centres of your commune in order to mobilise Hutu youths to kill Tutsis at the parish, isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	Yes, indeed that is what happened.  And that is what I stated at the beginning of my testimony.  I told you that various personalities or persons were assigned to go and sensitise the assailants. 
Q.	And you, Witness, you personally saw the IPJ at the Kanyati centre, trading centre and he was telling everyone there to turn up at the church, correct, Witness? 
A.	I met the IPJ on the Friday morning.  When he came down in a vehicle, he was distributing whistles.  For instance, he gave one to Handiritwari (phonetic).  That is what I stated at the beginning of my testimony. 
Q.	When -- sorry.  When the attackers attacked the Tutsis -- 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, a technical difficulty is getting with you.  I must apologise.  I will start all over. 

Q.	Witness, when the attackers attacked the Tutsis in your commune, they looted their cows, isn't that so?  
A.	Looting of cattle started on a Wednesday.  For instance, a young man called Emmanuel who had sought refuge in my home asked me to lead him to the church when he saw that on that Wednesday I brought meat home.  I brought home, some meat.  I roasted it and I ate it.  And the child was afraid.  He pleaded with me to lead him to the church so that he could join his father.  I am not hiding anything.  We ate the cattle of the Tutsi. 
Q.	And would you agree with me, Witness, that when the IPJ was sensitising and mobilising Hutu youths, he was, in fact, inciting them to go to the church to kill Tutsis? 
A.	In fact, the situation became critical in the church when a doctor called Juvénile Nyarugunga was killed in Kigali by gunshots.  When his body was brought to his native secteur of Lukoko, the person who accompanied his body came with Interahamwes.  That is how the situation deteriorated.  Of course, Kayishema played a leading role.  That was the event that made matters worse.  In the meantime members of the population had been bringing food to the Tutsi refugees.  Those who had banana beer brought it to them.  Those who had food also brought it to the refugees at the church but following that event the situation deteriorated. 
Q.	Witness, would you agree with me that you did not go to Nyange parish church on Saturday, the 16th of April l994 because a gendarme who had been guarding Colonel Nzaphapkumunsi had advised you not to go?  Would you agree with that?  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I stated right at the beginning of my testimony, that I arrived in Nyange on a Thursday.  I was in Nyange again on Friday.  And I mentioned the exact time when I got to the parish.  On Saturday I was very tired, I remained at home.  It is true that the gendarmes had advised me not to go there.  There are documents and there are witnesses.  If you find that I went to church on Saturday or if there's someone who has appeared before this Chamber to state that he saw me on that Saturday.  Well, if there's any proof to that effect I would be ready to explain myself. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, for the record I will spell Nzaphapkumunsi.  N-Z-A-P-H-A-P-K-U-M-U-N-S-I. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, I would like to simply observe that if the Prosecutor is making propositions on the basis of the document she has in her possession, it would be proper for her to disclose those documents, because we see here using documents and we, of the Defence don't know what those documents are. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, Counsel may rest assured that at the appropriate moment I certainly intend to make copies of any documents that I propose to use, available to him. I was making general propositions and I will go back to the document.  I want to continue now in open session and in a little while, I will -- when I am ready to use the documents properly I will hand them to counsel -- I have copies for him and for the Court, and I have made them already available to the interpreters.  

Might I proceed, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Go ahead.
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
obliged. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness -- 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, I see yet again the witness has a question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  As I have already been asked whether I met ICTR staff members.  Those staff members wrote most of my statements in English.  If they had taken them down in French, I would perhaps try to understand, but I must say that those documents are in English.  And I don't have copies of such documents.  This poses a problem.  The Prosecutor is putting question to me on documents I don't have.  Furthermore, when those statements were given, their contents were not explained to us.  I thank you, 
Madam President, Your Honours
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You did not refuse to answer questions put to you.  On each occasion you answered them.  The Prosecutor says that she will use those documents and at the appropriate time she will disclose those documents to you, and you will be able to follow what she is saying. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, would you agree that when the refugees first arrived at Nyange church, that they were not inside the church itself but that they remained outside of the church in the premises?  Would you agree with that proposition? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I do not know how to answer this question.  I do not know how you are wording your questions.  You are asking me whether I agree with you?  You should rather ask me, is this how it happened?  I believe this is the best procedure to use, to put your questions to me.  Having said this, I would like you to repeat your question; otherwise, you are putting questions to me as if you are setting a trap for me to fall into. 
Q.	I sure you, Witness, that I am merely asking questions, and I am a Prosecutor and not a trapper.  However, for your edification, Witness, I have no problem repeating the question, and I will try to rephrase it.  Let me try to say what you said.  You gave evidence when you were being questioned by the Defence Counsel representing Mr. Seromba, that Rwakaruga -- Rwakaruka, sorry, told you that there were refugees at the church and that they were not yet inside the church.  I just want to ensure, Witness, that I have properly recorded your evidence.  Was that your evidence, that is, that when the refugees first arrived they were not inside the church? 
A.	When did I purportedly make that statement, Madam Prosecutor?  Tell me when I made that statement.  
Q.	Well, Witness, I can't say the exact time, but you made that statement today when you were being examined in-chief by Defence Counsel.  It was not very long ago? 
A.	The refugees started heading for the church when people started throwing stones at Rwangasana's vehicle.  When they arrived at the church, they went to Father Smith's hall.  He was a white person.  When the hall was full they then went to the church.  The person who gave me that information is called Rwakayiro. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, when you attended mass on Sunday, the 10th of April l994, did you attend the first or the second mass of the day, do you recall? 
A.	Listen, Madam Prosecutor, I told you that Father Seromba officiated at the second mass.  That was when he asked parishioners to assist Christians who had problems.  He said that the roads were closed and people were in a dead end and they should be kind to their colleagues in difficulty. 
Q.	In this -- sorry, during this second mass that you attended, aside from Athanase Seromba, do you recall whether you saw any other clergyman? 
A.	Prosecutor, what I said was that I attended the first mass and not the second mass.  I believe there's an error somewhere. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I thought I had heard second mass -- I stand -- first mass, I stand corrected, Witness.  So this first mass that you attended did you see any other clergymen present? 
A.	Prosecutor, that happened 12 years ago.  I remember that priest because he was at the hotel -- no, he was at the alter; I beg your pardon, when he made that announcement.  Normally two priests celebrate mass when it is a feast day.  We were going through hard times.  That mass was celebrated as a mere formality because we were going through very hard times.  Nobody paid particular attention such as to know what was happening. 
Q.	I see, at this mass that you attended which Athanase Seromba celebrated, was a communique read out which had been issued by the commune? 
A.	Really, Madam President, you are making life difficult for me -- Madam Prosecutor, really you are marking life difficult for me.  It was the priest who read out the communique to the faithful.  You are mixing up two things.  There was a communique by the commune authorities and another read out by the priest.  At least in Rwanda, that's not how things happen. 
Q.	Okay, Witness, we are not understanding each other.  Let me ask this question again.  At the mass that you attended on Sunday the 10th of April, l994, did the Accused Athanase Seromba read out, in front of that mass, a communique which had been prepared by the commune, did he or did he not? 
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  I am sorry; I do not quite understand your question.  Although that communique was read out at mass, I did not hear it. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps I misunderstood you yet again.  You actually physically, personally, attended the mass that was celebrated by the Accused on the 10th of April? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And yet it is -- is it your evidence that you -- although you were present and although you knew that a communique was read, that you did not hear when it was read to the church that you were in, is that your evidence? 
A.	Ever since I have been here I promised to tell the truth on the events I was an eye-witness to.  And I told you that what I heard at mass was that Father Seromba asked the faithful to provide food to the refugees at the church.  As regards this communique, I must tell you quite frankly that I did not hear it. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, the gentleman who was killed on Wednesday the 13th of April l994, that is Mr. Muhingirwa; he was Tutsi, wasn't he? 
A.	Of course, he was a Tutsi.  He had sought refuge in the Presbytery. 
Q.	On that -- sorry.  You spoke, Witness, of the fact that Caritas was responsible for providing food for the refugees.  You, yourself, with your own eyes, never saw the refugees receiving food, correct, Witness? 
A.	I talked about Inspector Uwirineyemeye, Alex, and I said that during the meeting that they held and I believe it was on Monday the 11th, from what he told me, they asked the priest - or, rather, they asked the commune to protect the refugees who were in the church.  And the priest had been asked to make food available to them through CARITAS.  And I said that since 1959 '63, '73 until 1990, people customarily sought refuge in the church, and it was CARITAS which provided food to them.  Everybody knew that; and that is also what happened in 1994.  It was a fact that people were used to.  And this is why the refugees went to seek refuge at that church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  However my question is this.  In April of l994, did you, personally, with your own eyes, see the refugees receiving food of any kind? 
A.	All I can say is that I went there when I was bringing food to Joseph and he informed me that he had been receiving food.  And I also told you that Father Seromba had agreed with the monitor of the Hintamo Secondary School, who made the food of the students available to the refugees.  We were getting information from everywhere.  One could not be everywhere at the same time in Rwanda.  So information was flowing during the war.  When one was at the trading centre, for example, and that is where we would exchange information such as this. 
Q.	Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, I believe it is fitting for us to take a break now. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, I am unable to see the clock from here, and I have no watch.  So if it is time for 
the 4 o'clock break, of course, Madam President, that would be a rather convenient time to take that break. 

Before we take the break, and I am ever so sorry, I don't expect to be very much longer with this witness.  And we may wish, as the Court pleases, to begin another witness when I am finished.  So I thought perhaps now would be a good time when there's a small break if the Court so pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to turn to the Defence.  Who is the next witness, who, you wish to call in to testify after FE55.  Would that be FE4 (sic)?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, my apologies.  Our next witnesses are as follows: PS1, PA1 -- PS1. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You repeated PS1, didn't you?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No, I am just repeating from the beginning.  So our next witnesses are PA1, PS2 -- PS1 and Father Athanase Seromba. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Then that leaves us with two other Defence witnesses, such as CF4 and FE13.  We wondered whether if impersonate CF4 may have been the next -- I think I am still speaking generally -- in general terms.  What my question was the next immediate witness? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, could you please repeat?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, I have not finished and the Prosecutor did not have the courtesy to listen to me to the end and started making observations.  I was indicating, Madam President, that those were our next witnesses and the Defence is withdrawing Witness CF4 and FE13.  So these were the last points I was going to mention, but to leave the floor to Madam Prosecutor, who seems to like having the floor. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
I thank the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could we recap.  So the next witness would be PA1. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
PA1. PA1, followed by PS2.  That is the case, then followed by PS1 and our client. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we have four witnesses to go.  But is PA1 present because we had thought that CF4 would be the next witness.  So is Witness PA1 present? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
PA1 should arrive on the 18th of April, in the morning in Arusha.  He will leave Amsterdam on the 17th in the evening and he will be here in Arusha on the 18th. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And will he come before the Chamber on the 18th?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
If we are to sit on the 18th, Madam President, we will make sure that he will be present 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What about the other witnesses, PS2, PS1?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
The other witnesses will follow in the order mentioned here, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we shall adjourn voluntarily and come back to you with a number of questions linked to this change in the order of appearance.  We shall look at our timetable.  I thank you.  The meeting stands adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court adjourned at: 1610H)
(Pages 36 to 48 by Judith Kapatamoyo)

1633H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  

Prosecutor, please, proceed with the cross-examination of Witness FE55. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Obliged, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, you said when you were giving your evidence this morning that a certain Ndunguste told you that he was going to the church to see whether the refugees were armed.  Do you recall that evidence? 
A.	Yes, I recall. 
Q.	Did you ever hear, Witness, that the refugees -- the Tutsi refugees who were gathered together at Nyange parish were disarmed by the authorities before they were attacked.  Did you ever hear of this? 
A.	I heard that from Ndunguste.  A person who was with me asked him why they were going to the church in small numbers, and Ndunguste answered that by saying that he had invited those people to go and see how many refugees were there, and the type of weapons they had in their possession.  So I am not inventing anything here.  That statement was made by him and that is the information he gave me on that occasion. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, thank you.  After that conversation, do you know whether -- or, did you hear whether the arms or the stones or anything to defend themselves that had been in the possession of the refugees were taken from them?  Did you hear of that? 
A.	I left with Ndunguste.  Emakoro (phonetics) went on one side, and the Interahamwe on the other.  When he returned, Ndunguste talked to the gendarmes and they told him that there were many refugees that they could not confront them.  But during the fighting, a certain Gatoya from Murambi cellule was killed with an arrow.  The arrow was shot from within the church.  That is why I am not in a position to tell you whether they were disarmed or not.  I heard that someone was struck by an arrow shot from within the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you gave evidence that on the 15th of April, which was a Friday, 1994, that the Interahamwe surrounded the church.  You went on to say that the priests were taking their siesta.  Do you remember this evidence that you gave this morning? 
A.	I said it was a Thursday and not a Friday at about 12:00 noon.  I said it was a Thursday.  That was the day on which I met Ndunguste near the statue of the Virgin Mary.  We went there together.  It was on Thursday the 14th. 
Q.	And on that day, would you agree or would you know whether the security situation of the refugees who had been gathered at the church was very bad, was very precarious?  Isn't that so, Witness? 
A.	They were not attacked on that day apart from the person who had been killed the previous day that was on a Wednesday.  On Thursday, there was no fighting, but it was obvious that they were afraid.  When we arrived on that Thursday at about 12:00 noon, they told us we are ready to confront you, but there was no fighting on that day.  
Q.	So why --
A.	The attacks were led the following day, that is, the Friday. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
My apologies, interpreters, I thought it was finished. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	So, Witness, is it your evidence that in this situation where, although the refugees were not attacked, they were obviously frightened, the priests of the Nyange parish still kept to their siesta?  Is that your evidence? 
A.	That was only an example I gave.  I said that when we arrived, the priests may have been having their siesta or going about other duties.  I did not go to the presbytery to ascertain whether they were asleep or not.  I was just giving a rough idea of what happened.  I didn't want to give any details -- any specific details. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, we will now speak very briefly of the crisis committee.  The crisis committee targeted Tutsi intellectuals, correct? 
A.	I couldn't find a word in Rwanda for crisis committee.  I said that those people who were led by a businessman met in small groups to hold discussions and then they later on went together to carry out attacks.  Please could you repeat your question because I didn't quite understand it?  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  This small group of persons led by the businessman of whom you spoke, did they target Tutsi intellectuals to be killed? 
A.	I explained myself on that matter.  On Friday evening, it was that businessman who took the floor.  He told members of the group that they hadn't done anything; no teacher had been killed, no medical doctor had been killed.  And he told them to get people from Kibilira to go and guard the church because people in the vicinity could make them to escape.  There was, for instance, Bonera, who had sought refuge in the presbytery.  And the person who caused him to escape was dressed as a woman and people did not know that it was Bonera.  And that is why he said that they should do all they could to find that person, and if need be, they would have to destroy the church, demolish the church. 
Q.	Did anyone, at that time when the businessman was speaking, did the businessman himself or anyone else say that if the Tutsi intellectuals were allowed to live, that we, Hutus would have failed or words to that effect?  Did anyone say this on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	They spoke in turns, Ndunguste, Kayishema and even Habiyambere, to be more specific.  On Thursday evening at about 7:45 p.m. when the mortal remains of the doctor arrived, the vehicle was searched and they almost open the coffin to find out whether there were no ammunition in it.  A woman who was in that vehicle was asked to step down and go into the church, and she was killed on the spot. 
Q.	Okay, Witness.  Perhaps you did not understand my question.  Can you listen very carefully?  My question was simply this:  On that occasion when the businessman and other persons spoke on the 15th of April 1994, did you personally hear anyone of them say that if the Tutsi intellectuals were not killed, then we, Hutus, would have failed?  Did you hear anyone saying that on the 15th of April, yes or no, Witness? 
A.	That statement was made by Kanyarukiga. 
Q.	And you only spent about 30 minutes at that centre around -- 30 minutes at that centre on the 15th; is that so, Witness? 
A.	Yes, when I alighted from Hungo's vehicle, I went to the church, I retraced my steps and I took a drink, and at about 7:00 p.m. when Ndahimana arrived from Ruhungo, I left him in front of the pharmacy and I went home.  He had come to join the group.  He was greeting them.  And when I saw the inspector's vehicle, I got on board it and I went home. 
Q.	You referred us well, Witness, to, I believe, a gendarme saying that there were about 1000 Tutsi outside Nyange church with stones, do you remember saying this? 
A.	I said that they said that we could not face a group of a thousand people, whereas there were only 100 of us.  That is what Makoro told Ndunguste who was leading that attack.  And that is why we turned back.  On that day there was no fighting, although we attacked the presbytery.  There was no fighting as such. 
Q.	Witness, there were, approximately, at Nyange church 1,500 to 2,000 refugees, correct? 
A.	I could give a figure per chance.  I know there was a census conducted and some of those who participated in that census came to give testimony before this Chamber.  But to be very honest, I do not have any exact information.  I am only giving you the estimates that we got from the gendarmes, otherwise, I wouldn't speculate and give any figures whatsoever for fear of lying.  
Q.	I am only asking you, Witness, for an approximation.  So what you want to give is exactly what I am asking of you.  Were there, approximately, 1,500 to 2,000 refugees inside the church?  Is that your approximation?  We are not asking you for an exact figure.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, if I were to give you estimates, you would attribute it to me.  You would say that it was the witness who gave that figure.  Please get such information on those who did the head count of those refugees.  They would be in a position to give you an exact tally of the number of refugees who were at the church. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, I had hoped to move on from here, but I would like to read for the witness one sentence from his statement to the Defence.  It is in the possession of the interpreters.  And I am speaking here of the statement of the witness of the 19th of August 2005, page 4 of the uncertified English translation, and it is the second to last question and answer. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, did you say this to the Defence when you were being questioned:  Question:  "Seromba is accused of having made a census of the Tutsis who remained in the villages, what do you know about it and how many refugees were there approximately?"  Response:  "I did not hear about the census.  There were approximately 1,500 to 2,000 refugees."  Did you make that approximation, Witness, when you were speaking to Defence counsel before you came to Arusha?  Was that your approximation then?
A.	That was an estimate I was giving on the basis of the estimates that the gendarmes had in turn given.  I do not have an exact figure because I did not conduct that census.  Those who conducted that census are the ones who are in a position to give you an exact figure. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you hear, Witness, that there was a meeting between the authorities and the priests, including Mr. Seromba, and that the purpose of this meeting was to remove the bodies of the victims?  Did you hear of that meeting? 
A.	The meeting was held by priests.  A cousin of mine working at the church had informed me that the priests had held a meeting during which the burial of bodies was discussed.  I do not know the date of that meeting.  It was a certain Canicius who gave me that information. 
Q.	And in that meeting the communal authorities -- sorry, let me rephrase.  The communal authorities and Mr. Seromba attended that meeting, correct, Witness, was that your information? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I have told you that I heard about that meeting which was purportedly held by priests with a view to determining how they could clear the church and the sacristy of bodies.  I got that information from ******************.  He said a meeting was held regarding the problem of disposing off bodies. 
Q.	Did your cousin tell you that among those priests who met, was Athanase Seromba?  Was that your information? 
A.	Which cousin are you referring to, Prosecutor?  I referred to *****************************************.  Ndunguste did not go to the presbytery.  It is Caniscius who gave me that information. 
Q.	Was the information you received from Caniscius that Athanase Seromba was amongst the priests who attended the meeting with the authorities to remove the bodies of the witness (sic), was that the information that you received? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, you keep referring to administrative authorities.  There was Father Seromba and other priests from Nyundo, including Nturiye and Kayiranga.  I do not know why you are referring to administrative authorities; I have not referred to them.  I did not say that they were present during the meeting. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, might I refer the Court again to the witness statement to the Defence, of the 19th of August 2005, also on page 4 of the English version.  It is question 5. "Did you see the above mentioned authorities?"  That is how the question begins, and I read.  
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	"Did you see the above mentioned authorities visiting Seromba between the 7th and 16th of April 1994?"  Response:  "According to what I heard, there was a meeting between the authorities and the priests, among them Seromba.  The purpose of this meeting was to remove the bodies of the victims."  Is -- sorry -- Witness, does that reflect -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	May I ask a question before you give us a response, please, Witness.  Thank you.  Does that reflect what you told Defence counsel before you came to Arusha? 
A.	I believe I was necessitated.  I explained what happened as I did here.  I said that the matter was discussed during a meeting held among priests only.  Otherwise, the communal authorities discussed the issue of the refugees who were at the communal office and who were to go to the church.  On that occasion, Father Seromba was requested to provide food through CARITAS.  I never stated that Seromba had held a meeting with the authorities.  I don't think my statement was consigned properly and I have not made such a statement.  

Madam Prosecutor, from the very beginning, I shared my concerns with you regarding our links with the investigators of the Tribunal.  And I can tell you that next time you might not have any witnesses because of the behaviour of your officials vis-à-vis the witnesses. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness, for that injunction.  However, I was reading to you a statement -- a sentence from your statement to the Defence and not the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor.  I thought I had made that clear.  Having made that clear, again, do you still affirm that you never made that statement; that is, that Mr. Seromba and the authorities had a meeting to discuss the removal of the bodies?  Do you still maintain that evidence?  Now that you know that it was read from a statement you gave to the Defence for Athanase Seromba.  
A.	I believe this has been misspelt.  If that has not been corrected, it is not my problem, but I can tell you that this is not my statement I made.  I remember that they found me at the stadium, we were building.  I asked for permission to go and have a glass of water.  The authorisation was refused.  I had to sign immediately. I accepted, I signed.  And I would like to tell you, 
Madam President, Your Honours, that we are not here to lie, but your employees come to our country, they do business here and there, they come to us around 3:00 p.m., they start interrogating us and then they asked us to sign the document.  So if they do not report on what we've said faithfully, I don't think this is any of our problem. 
Q.	Witness, if it is -- well, let me restate.  In your statement -- in your statement that you gave to the Defence for Athanase Seromba, it is said that there was a meeting between the authorities and the priests.  That statement -- in your statement to the Defence, are you saying that you never made it and, in fact, that the Defence misrepresented you when this was included in your statement?  Is that your evidence? 
A.	The statement was taken in French.  I remember that one Arsin came and we wrote down more than 30 pages, and I was quite surprised to note that the statement was that long.  We gave testimony; we gave documents to these people, then they withdraw the documents.  Have you seen the documents yourself?  
Q.	To be clear, Witness, I am not speaking -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Microphone on. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	And to be clear, Witness, I am not speaking -- for the record -- of a statement that you gave to the Office of the Prosecutor, but to the Defence attorneys, one of whom is standing.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, objection from the Defence.  Just as I was saying, the Defence would like to take responsibility for the mistake made by the -- for the mistake mentioned by the witness.  And perhaps Madam Prosecutor would like to go to another point -- the Defence takes full responsibility for the mistake mentioned by the witness. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, the Defence has had his opportunity.  He has examined in-chief from his statement.  I do not believe it is fit and proper for the Defence at this juncture when I am cross-examining the witness and going into issues of his credibility, to be taken onto himself, issues of the same statement that he used.  I say no more, Madam President.  I do intend, however, to move on to another topic. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, now let us speak briefly and finally about your statement to the Office of the Prosecutor.  You gave evidence this morning, Witness, that the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, they wanted to impose answers on you.  Was that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, indeed, they wanted to impose a number of answers on me, I refused.  The official went out of the room.  He went to see Nsenge (phonetics), the deputy prosecutor who called me -- who threatened me.  I am not going to repeat what he said.  I am a diplomat.  And also for my own safety, I shall not repeat what he said.  But he told me if you refuse to cooperate with the Tribunal, you are going to go back to prison.  So I told him rather than lying and levelling accusations against someone, I would rather not do it.  You should not dictate to me what I should say, especially if they are untruth.  So at the end of the solidarity camp, the préfet came to close the camp.  But the next day, I was sent back to prison.  There is a document -- a letter which was to release me, and I have this document in my possession, but I am not in a position to show it to the Judges, but I do have a copy of the letter.  I should have been released a long time ago. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Is it your evidence that you never -- tell me if I am misrepresenting you.  Tell me if I understood you -- were you saying or, are you saying, Witness, that the investigators of the Office of Prosecutor wrote a statement for themselves, and they simply handed it to you and you were told to sign?  Is that your evidence?  Have I properly represented what you said? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, several investigators of the Arusha Tribunal came to me on several occasions.  Some of them found me in ********; others found me while I was at the solidarity camp.  I do not know to which statement you are referring.  Are we talking about the statement made on the 19th, or are we talking about previous statements?  Thank you.  
Q.	This time I am going to show you a statement.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
It is for the record, the statement of this witness to the Office of the Prosecutor dated, D -- sorry, dated, the 13th of March 2003 and the 29th of April 2003, but it is one statement.  I'm going to show this statement to the witness.  I have a copy for counsel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The Judges also have a copy.  We thank you.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, for the record, might I note that the cover page of the English version is in French, and it is the version that is signed.  I have given counsel for the Defence the French version, because I know that French is their language of choice.  If counsel prefers I can also have them see the English version. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, look on the first page of that document in your hand, on the first page.  I am handing over the English version to counsel merely because the signature is on the first page of the English version.  Yes, Witness, do you see your signature on the bottom left-hand corner of that document?  Is that not your signature? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, this is, indeed, my signature.  I did sign the document, but I am here before this Court, and if you put questions to me on this document, I will have the opportunity to provide explanations.  But I must say that you made a signed document in Rwanda, for example, here the document is in English.  What do you want us to do?  We are given documents, the contents of which we ignore.  But since there is nothing we can do, then we signed them.  For example, the person who came to me on the 23rd was told by me that I spoke French and that he was supposed to draft the statement in French, he refused and he drafted the document in English.  But since the document is before me, you can put questions to me on the document and I am willing to answer your questions, on the condition that you don't say the content of this document to me in Kinyarwanda 
Q.	I am not faulting you, Witness.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, I have handed the witness the English version because his signature was on that version.  Now that he has recognised his signature, I am also going to provide for him the version that is in French.  
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	Witness, I have only a few questions for you on this document.  You having recognised your signature, 
	I am suggesting to you, Witness, that this is your statement that you gave to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor. 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I do not know whether the document you have just given to me is legally valid.  If the document is translated and that you show me my signature, then I can recognise the document as being valid, otherwise, I do not deem it valid. 
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, might the interpreters read one sentence, it is on page 4 of the English version.  There are only two paragraphs on that page.  It is the second paragraph and it begins on Saturday.  I will read:  "On Saturday gendarmes guarding Colonel Nzaphapkumunsi told me not to go to the church because there was going to be a big war between Hutus and Tutsis at the church." 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	My question to you, Witness, is this:  This is information that you gave to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, correct, yes or no? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Madam Prosecutor?  I was reading, and I did not follow the question. 
Q.	I read to you a line from this statement.  The line said that to remind you that the gendarmes who were guarding Colonel Nzaphapkumunsi warned you that there was going to be a battle between the Hutus and the Tutsis.  My question to you is this:  This statement represents what you told the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, correct, Witness? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, as I said earlier on, I was made to sign this document.  I had asked for the document to be translated into French, but I was told first to sign it without it being translated for my benefit.  There is another document dated 3rd of April 2004, as well as the document dated 9th of April 2002.  And the document dated 3rd of April or, rather, 9th of April 2003 and the document of the 3rd of April 2003, I was asked to level false accusations against Father Seromba, but I refused.  I would like to remind you that the officials of your Tribunal betrayed me.  I must say that this is very hateful to me. 
Q.	I see.  Witness, I am suggesting to you that this statement which you gave to the Office of the Prosecutor, you did not accuse Athanase Seromba.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, this statement is not mine, or, rather, I do not recognise it.  It is true that I made such a statement, but the document was drafted in English, and when I do not speak English.  It was an investigator from Nigeria.  I expressed my concerns to him.  I told him to translate the document for me into French so that I might sign it.  He refused.  I signed the document after all because I thought I would be given the opportunity to explain myself before this Court.  For example, when I signed -- when I signed the document on the 23rd, the situation was critical.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, would you please listen attentively to the questions put to you and try as much as possible to answer them in a brief and concise manner for us to be able to make progress.  Because if you keep on reiterating how the situation was when you were making statements, you are simply repeating facts, but we are not making any progress. 
BY MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Q.	And, Witness, finally, I am suggesting to you that not only is this your statement, but that no one forced you to make this statement which does not even accuse Athanase Seromba of anything.  That is what I am putting to you finally, Witness, what do you have to say in response? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I was asked to level accusations against him.  If I had included lies in this document, I would have been released.  I would not still be in prison, but as I did not do what was asked of me, I am still in prison. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Madam President, Your Honours.  This is the end of my cross-examination of this witness.  I now merely seek, Madam President, Your Honours, to put into evidence the documents that I referred to when I was cross-examining this witness.  So, I, therefore, move this Court, Madam President, to allow the Defence statement, dated the 19th of August 2005 in French and the uncertified English translation to be entered into evidence as 
Prosecution Exhibit 60. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence regarding the admission into evidence of the said document?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Madam President.  I would merely like to have some clarifications.  Would 
Madam Prosecutor wants both documents to be admitted as a single exhibit or with two exhibit numbers?  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
I would prefer -- but of course, as Your Lordship please, I would prefer if the documents be entered as one document, Defence -- sorry, Prosecution Exhibit 60(A) for the French and B for the English, as the Court pleases. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
As well, Madam President, I will move this Court to have the alleged statement of this witness entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit No. 61.  I would ask that the copy that is signed with the cover sheet in French and the document itself in English, be entered as 61(A) and the French translation as 61(B).  It is the 13th of March 2003 and the 29th of April 2003, for the record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection from the Defence?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness's statement dated 19th of April 2005 is hereby admitted into evidence as Prosecutor Exhibit 60(A) and (B) for both the French and English versions.
(Exhibit No. P. 60(A) and (B), admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statements dated 13th of March 2003 and 29th of April 2003 are admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit P. 61(A) and (B), for both the English and French versions, once again. 
(Exhibit No. P. 61(A) and (B), admitted)

No other matters regarding -- Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR: 
Not anymore for this witness.  Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Counsel Nekuie, would you like to put questions to the witness for re-direct?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Not at all, Madam President, no further questions for this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony before this Court.  The Tribunal would like to thank you for having come to testify and for having answered the questions that were put to you and wishing you a safe journey back to your country.  

Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours, for having thanked me for my cooperation with this Court.  I greatly appreciate the way in which I was welcomed at the airport, in Rwanda or here, and also the welcome which was given to me by the officials of the victims and witnesses unit, as well as the nurses in the hospital.  I would like to thank each and everyone of you for having welcomed me before this Chamber.  But I must say that the officials of the Office of the Prosecutor betrayed me and there is nothing I can do except to pray for them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, I had forgotten one small thing.  I would like, with your leave, to be able to greet Father Seromba if that is possible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken note of your request, Mr. Witness.  The Defence knows all the procedure for you to be able to meet with Father Seromba before you return to Rwanda.  
Thank you.  You may leave the courtroom. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
(Witness withdrawn)
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, we would like to indicate that the Defence did what it should have regarding this meeting and does not understand why such a meeting was not organised by the section to this day.  Perhaps this should be brought to your attention because witnesses from Rwanda have stopped testifying before your jurisdiction. 

I would also like to seize this opportunity, Madam President, to inform you that I forgot to ask for the name of the person which was written on a piece of paper by the witness, be put under seal and be included in the minutes of the meeting in closed session of this -- in closed session, the name of the witness which he did not want to mention here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Regarding the witnesses, I believe the Chamber has ruled on the matter of witnesses from Rwanda.  We have heard all the witnesses at this stage, and there are no other detained witnesses that are to come before this Chamber.  They will soon leave, and we ask that they be able to meet with Father Seromba, and this is the second time we give such an order.  The document which was tendered by the Defence on the name of this trader will be admitted as Defence Exhibit D. 88 -- D. 88 under seal.  No objections, I suppose, from the Prosecutor.  It is a name which is mentioned by the witness.
(Exhibit No. D. 88, admitted under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  We shall retain you for a few minutes, for us to discuss about the rest of our proceedings.  We have received a document from the Defence for Father Seromba, and we would like to know whether the Defence was able to assess the time required from today to the 27th at the latest, and how the Defence intend to proceed for the four remaining witnesses?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, the Defence sent a letter to the Chamber, dated today as it had committed itself to do.  So as we said, the next witnesses would be PA1, PS2, PS1 and Father Seromba.  As soon as the witnesses would be available, they would be brought before this Chamber.  As for the rest, we shall provide all the practical provisions to the Chamber, as well as indicative duration of their testimony for all the witnesses.  And on the basis of our estimate and regarding examination-in-chief, I do not believe the examination-in-chief of these witnesses would last more than two days. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, perhaps we did not receive your letter yet, and we did not understand you correctly.  Did you say that for the four witnesses about the duration of the examination-in-chief would be two days?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, the estimation in our mail is four hours at maximum for PA1, the same for PS2 and for Father Seromba, a maximum of five hours.  So this is not -- give us two days in total. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It seems you did not give us information on PS1 or PS2.  We heard PS1 and we do not know whether it is PS1 or PS2 and it is four hours.  As for the other witness, how long would it take?
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, for PA1, four hours; PS2 four hours; PS1, four hours, and Father Seromba, 
five hours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you have heard what the Defence just shared with us, any observations?  
MR. MOSES: 
But two observations, Your Honours.  Firstly, we have heard from less important witnesses than the Accused who have themselves been led in evidence in-chief for more than one day.  I am surprised if that -- on that basis that the evidence of the Accused will be done in five hours.  But I hear my friend, it may be that it's to be more focused, then I am certainly not wishing to encourage him to take any longer than -- than as necessary.  And I am sure, as he has always pointed out, he will take as long as he deems it appropriate.

But I simply make the observation that based on previous witnesses -- once I am sure that my learned friend wishes to stick to these estimates, it is possible that, for variety of reasons, that matters could go for longer.  Of those witnesses, I am aware, Your Honours, that PS1 is here in Arusha.  I am unsure in terms of the -- what has been proposed by the Defence.  If, as I understand it, he is proposing that the next witness be PA1 -- and I am not sure exactly when that person is going to arrive -- if they are arriving on Monday or Tuesday -- it is my understanding that they are due to arrive either Monday or Tuesday.  I am aware, from my own experience -- recent experience that there are no flights into Arusha on a Monday at the moment.  So, if he is arriving on a Tuesday, then it would be Wednesday next week that we could -- before we could commence that person's testimony, bearing in mind that PS1 is present in Arusha.  And it would be in the Prosecution's submission, anyway, subject obviously to what my learned friend might wish to say to Your Honours, but it would seem sensible to use any time that is available to the Court in dealing with PS1, I don't expect the cross-examination of that witness to be very long at all.  So, it may well be that we can deal with the evidence in-chief and cross-examination well -- in well less than a day.  Those really are my only observations at the moment.  It may be that my learned friend can assist Your Honours in the advice he has received from WVSS as to the arrival times for his witnesses because, obviously those are matters which may influence any decision Your Honours may wish to make.  Those are my only comments for the moment subject to any possible response to matters that my learned friend wishes to raise.  Thank you.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, thank you.  Madam President, I would like to provide a few clarifications regarding Witness PS1.  I believe there are some matters pending and perhaps we could go into a closed session in order for me to be able to talk in detail about this specific case of PS1. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection, from the Prosecutor?  
MR. MOSES: 
No objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall now sit in closed session to listen to Counsel Monthé, as requested.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 62 to 63 ] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
