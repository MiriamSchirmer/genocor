P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  I would like to ask the registry to please read the case.  
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andréas Vaz, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 27th April 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of Prosecutor vs. Seromba, Case No. ICTR-2001-66-T.

May it please Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to thank the registry for that, and would ask the parties to present themselves.  We start with the Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Yes.  May it please Your Honours.  Counsel's name is Moses.  I appear this morning with 
Ms. Silvana Arbia, senior trial attorney, Ms. Alexis-Windsor, trial attorney, Mr. Townsend, trial attorney, and Ms. Oloweye, case manager.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  And we would like to ask the Defence to make a presentation, please.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.  My name is Barnabé Nekuie, and I am co-counsel for 
Father Athanase Seromba.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber notes that the Accused, Father Seromba is absent.  Counsel Monthé, lead counsel is also absent, we note.  We would like to ask the registry to please read the notice that we had asked to be served upon the Accused, for the Accused to take part in the proceedings.   
MS. NTILATWA:
Your Honours, first of all, there is a removal order which has been -- which was sent to the UNDF covering today and up to 28 of April, as it reads:  From the Registrar to the commanding officer, UNDF.  Please be advised that Mr. Athanase Seromba is required to be present at the Tribunal's headquarters from Thursday, 23rd of March 2006 to Friday 28th of April 2006 at 8:30, unless otherwise instructed.  You are, therefore, instructed to remove him from the Tribunal's detention unit for the appropriate period of time, including the time necessary for the transportation and the time necessary for security requirements and to transport him from and back to the detention units.

Furthermore, yesterday, several calls were made to Mr. Diathe, for making sure that today Mr. Seromba will be here.  Myself, I called him, and Zerthum also, the secretary of the Registrar called him, but he promised that Mr. Seromba will be informed, and we are very sure - and, it is certainly confirmed that 
Mr. Seromba was informed of his presence today morning (sic).  But the information we received, even through the e-mail here, is that Mr. Seromba has refused to come, and the reasons for not coming, the Defence counsel is going to tell the Chamber.  So, this is the information we have.  May it please 
Your Honours.

This is another removal note sent to him, which reads as follows: "From the Registry to the commanding officer: Please be advised that Father Athanase Seromba is required to be present at the Tribunal's Headquarters on Thursday 27th April 2006, at 10:30, unless instructed otherwise.  

So, please, Your Honours, be kindly advised. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to thank the registry for that.

Yes, Mr. Diallo, you may address the Court.
MR. DIALLO:  
Yes, I would like to provide a small clarification -- a few details. The problem that has arisen, it is not that we had not sent any order.  We can make sure that the Accused appears before the 
	Trial Chamber, however, he has refused to appear this morning.  It's not that we had not sent the order in time, it is, in fact, that the Accused refused to appear before the Trial Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Diallo.  Counsel Nekuie, you may address the Court, if you have anything to say, of course. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I don't think that I have anything to say immediately.  But if you ask me to say something and if you force me to address the Court, I will do so, but for the time being, I will be present, and that is all.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, we would like to remind you that we are here this morning because we asked you, once again, yesterday, and we asked the Accused Father Seromba, to reconsider his position in view of the fact that he willingly and freely decided to testify before this Trial Chamber.  Now, since last Friday, we have not been able to hear any further witnesses, even though we still have PS2, and the Accused, himself, outstanding.  That was your decision.  It was your decision to proceed in such a manner before the closing of the Defence case.  So, if you have anything to tell us, as regards to the attitude of the Accused, we are all ears.  But if you think that you have nothing further to say, we will note that fact and we will then ask the Prosecutor to address the Court, if he has anything to say.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, I think that since yesterday -- I think that it was yesterday that we convened, Father Seromba clearly stated to the Trial Chamber what his position was.  He indicated to the Trial Chamber that he has filed a motion for disqualification of the Judges -- all the judges sitting in this Trial Chamber.  This is still pending before the Appeals Chamber of this instant Court.  And as a result, we are of the opinion that until the Appeals Chamber has not ruled on the procedure that opposes us, the Defence, to the Judge, there is no reason for there to be any further submission until the decision has been handed down.  That is the position of Father Seromba.  And his position is also justified by the fact that this Trial Chamber, subsequent to the motion of disqualification, adjourned sine die.  So, it did not wait for the decision of the bureau on the disqualification of the Judges, because, of course, it was that we did adjourn sine die, and we did not -- the Judges did not wait for that decision to be made.  So, Father Seromba feels that his rights are reserved, and that he should wait until the Appeals Chamber has ruled on the disqualification of his motion and the disqualification of the Judges, and, then, procedures and proceedings can recommence; and then, the testimonies that will be heard before the Chambers can be heard.   That is the position of Father Seromba.  It has not changed and it had not changed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Nekuie.  I would like to ask the Prosecutor to address the Court.  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.  I won't be long, Your Honours.  The Prosecution understands, from the submissions made that counsel has now had the opportunity to confer with the Accused since Your Honours made it clear yesterday that you had not granted a stay and sought to hear his position as to whether he wished to testify.  The counsel has, this morning, indicated the position of the Accused, which is similar to that which was expressed to Your Honours yesterday.  Your Honours, what I would like to do is hand a copy of the Appeals decision -- it is a decision of the Prosecutor and Delalic and others, Appeals' decision on -- entitled, "Decision on motion to disqualify judges, pursuant to Rule 15, or in the alternative, that certain judges recuse themselves."  I have got copies for Your Honours.  The date of the decision is 17th of September 1999.  I simply have provided that decision, Your Honours, because -- it is in English, I am sorry, Your Honours for that.  I simply have provided that, because the Appeals Court, have, in fact, ruled on the issue that we submitted yesterday and Your Honours ruled on, namely that; the subject matter of that motion -- of that motion to appeal, a decision under Rule 15, is not a matter for the consideration of the Appeals Chamber, which was our submission yesterday, and this is simply authority for that proposition.  The Appeals Chamber has no jurisdiction to hear an Appeal of 
the -- under Rule 15.  So, we simply maintain our position that Your Honours made the correct decision yesterday, such an appeal cannot provide the basis for a stay, especially as there is no jurisdiction for that appeal in the first place.  Our submission, Your Honours, is that we have reached a stage in the proceedings, where Your Honours should set a date for closing arguments and a date for the parties to file the closing briefs.

Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Prosecutor. 

Mr. Diallo, you wanted to address the Court?
MR. DIALLO: 
Yes, Madam President.  Just to say that this order was handed over to Father Seromba this morning, and despite that, he has refused to appear before the Court today.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Diallo.  

The Chamber:  The Chamber has heard Witness PA1, or had Witness PA1 on the 21st April 2006.  The Chamber was then to hear Witness PA2, and the Accused, Father Seromba, on the 26th of April 2006, when all the arrangements had been made in South Africa and at the ICTR, with a view to hearing Witness PS2, the Defence refused to lead in examination of said witness, under the pretext that they had appealed the decision of the bureau of the Tribunal, dismissing or denying the motion for the disqualification of the Judges of the Trial Chamber.  The Accused decided not to appear before the 
Trial Chamber, despite having been served notice to do so.

We are obliged to note that the Trial Chamber has no further witnesses to hear, and as a result in view of the fact that the Defence does not have the -- does not intend to hear the Accused, the only decision that the Trial Chamber can take, is to note that the Accused refuses to appear, and as a result he is waiving his right to testify before the Trial Chamber.  So, we can only reach the conclusion that the Trial Chamber no longer has any further witnesses to hear and that the Defence case closes today, on the 27th of April 2006.

The Chamber would like, furthermore, to remind you that the parties were consulted on the order for filing the final closing briefs and the final submissions in which questions on the subject of sentencing will also be covered by the various parties.  For this reason -- or for these reasons, the Trial Chamber orders for the final submissions of the Prosecution to be filed by the latest, on the 26th of May 2006, and for those of the Defence, to be filed at the latest, on the 16th June 2006.

Furthermore, the Trial Chamber orders for the parties to present their closing submissions on the 
27th of June 2006 at 9 a.m.  Such is the decision of the Trial Chamber.  And as we said before, we consider that the appeal does not amount to stay of the proceedings.  
There was a slight slip of the tongue at an earlier stage.  We said that, "In view of the fact that Prosecution did not want to have Father Seromba appear as their witness," of course, it was a slip of the tongue, I meant to say "the Defence," but the English booth did, in fact, say the Defence.  So that was a slight correction.

Now, we are going to adjourn if there are no further issues.  And, we now close the Defence case.  

Any further questions?  Court is now adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1050H)
