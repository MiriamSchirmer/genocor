P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

We're sorry to start with 25 minutes' delay, but apparently the registrar was under the impression -- well, the registry, in fact, was under the impression that we were not in session this morning, so we had to run around getting everything ready.  So very sorry about that.  

It would appear that the Defence and the Prosecutor have agreed -- in order to amend the list of appearance of witnesses; is that correct?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  As far as the order of appearance of the Defence witnesses is concerned, there has, indeed, been a slight amendment.  Witness CF4 should follow on after CF23.  However, in his place we will have FE56, after whom we will have FE13.  The Prosecutor has indicated to us that Mr. Moses will be 24 hours late in arriving, so, as far as he is available, we will start with FE32 a little later.  Otherwise, there will be no change of the appearance of the witnesses.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

Prosecutor, you may address the Court.  I suppose that you are in agreement with these changes, and you may continue with your cross-examination of the witness, Witness CF23.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
That is correct, Your Honours.  Thank you very much. 
WITNESS CF23,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	CF23, good morning.
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	I'm going to pose to you questions again today most of which you'll be able to answer yes, no, I don't know, I don't remember; do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand, but, please, let me add that sometimes you ask me to reply with a yes or no answer, but I think that in so asking you deprive me of a specific right, that is, to explain and to show to you the truth of the matter.  
Q.	Thank you.  My first question is:  Nyange church could hold 2000 persons; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I saw Nyange church specifically on days of festivity, but their seating capacity could not -- there was not a seating capacity, in my opinion, of 2000 people. 
Q.	What is your estimate of the seating capacity?
A.	In my opinion, there was a seating capacity of a maximum of 1,200 people. 
Q.	Now, you testified on Friday and called the Nyange courtyard the jubilee courtyard; is that correct?
A.	There was a recreation ground.  And whenever there were festivities, ceremonies were held on that recreation ground and it was called the jubilee courtyard. 
Q.	And that was directly in front of the front door of Nyange church?
A.	No, it -- we're talking about another recreation ground that was a little bit further away towards Nyamiyugili school.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If I could pardon the booth for a spelling.  
THE WITNESS:
The recreation ground was towards Nyamiyugili, but you don't have to arrive at the school at such.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyamiyugili is N-Y-A-M-I-Y-U-G-I-L-I, Nyamiyugili. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	And it was called jubilee because it had celebrated a 50th anniversary; is that correct, yes or no?
A.	When I was still young, the recreation ground was called the jubilee recreation ground, but the parish had not yet celebrated its 50th anniversary.  In fact, when we talk about the 50th anniversary, we're talking about 50 years from the year when the evangelisation began in this parish and when baptisms commenced within the parish. 
Q.	You testified that Nyange church had a plaque that contained the year 1953; is that correct, yes or no?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	What would you say to the proposition that the construction of Nyange church was completed in 1953?
A.	In 1953 the church was constructed, indeed.  
Q.	My question was:  Was the construction completed, yes or no?
A.	When I was born, the church had already been constructed, but in view of the fact that the plaque -- or, the date 1953 -- I was told that, during that year, that was, in fact, the year of construction.  
Q.	So it is your understanding that the church construction began in 1953 and was completed in the same year of 1953?
A.	I'm not able or in a position to know the exact date when construction began on the church, or the date at which the church was completed.  But I was told that the church was constructed in 1953.
MR. TOWNSEND:
Can we look, please, at Exhibit P. 2-30 -- P. 2-30.  And I ask that it be shown to the witness.  It is the interior of the building.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Witness, you're going to be shown photograph Exhibit P. 2-30.  If you could look at it closely and tell me, does that show the interior of Nyange church to you?  Do you recognise that photograph depicting the interior of Nyange church, yes or no?
A.	Yes, I can see the photo, but I'm not in a position to identify the place, but I do think that the benches are not laid out in such a way that I remember them to be laid out, plus the fact that there are also small benches towards the front of the church, to my recall, and I don't see them here on the photo.  However, the interior, on the whole, is more or less similar to the interior that I remember.  
Q.	Do you recognise the person that may be a priest in that photograph -- Exhibit 2-30?
A.	I am not able to identify the person on the photograph. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
If we could turn to a different photograph, which is photograph Exhibit P. 2-29 -- 2-29.  And if you could withdraw the previous one.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, that P. 2-29 is before you, would you agree with me that that shows a 50th jubilee in the year 1993 for Nyange church, yes or no?
A.	What I believe and what I can confirm is that all feasts and celebrations, that I am aware of, occurred when the priests remembered baptisms and other feast days.  I know there was a jubilee celebration marking the year when the first -- when the first communion was given and when the evangelisation began in the church, because before that church was constructed, evangelisation was carried out in other buildings.  There are other buildings in which communion was given and baptism was celebrated.  That was before that church in Nyange was operational.  
Q.	So you have a recollection of a jubilee?  Would that have been in 1953; is that your recollection?
A.	Doctrine and baptism began in 1953.  By the way, if you go to Nyange, you would find the ruins of the former building prior to the construction of Nyange church. 
Q.	My question was different though.  My question was:  Based on your recollection, in 1953, was there a jubilee celebrated, the one to which you've just referred?
A.	There were jubilee celebrations every year and ceremonies were conducted in the Nyange church.  Many Christians commemorated the celebration of their baptism, and priests also celebrated their ordination and their baptism.  There were many jubilee celebrations, it wasn't only in 1953 that a jubilee celebration was celebrated -- that there was a jubilee celebration. 
Q.	What would you say to the proposition that Nyange church construction started in 1943, and that 1993 would have been the 50th year jubilee, starting from the year of the ground breaking of construction?  What do you say to that proposition?
A.	That is not true because we were shown where doctrine classes were given before the church was constructed.  
Q.	The plaque which you said bore the year, would you agree with me that that plaque was on the front or facade of the church to the right-hand side of the door, the front door, as one looked at it, yes or no?
A.	It depends on where you are standing.  But what I know is that the inscription was on the side of the church bell.  You showed me a photograph last week, there was a cement plaque on which the inscription was written.  I believe I saw that inscription on the photograph you showed me last week.  
Q.	And that plaque was on the front of the church, correct, the same as the front main door?
A.	Yes.  The plaque was opposite the church, on the side of the main entrance to that church.  
Q.	I'll take that as a yes.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
And if Prosecutor's Exhibit P. 48 could be shown to the witness, P. 48, and the previous one withdrawn.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, P. 48 is going to be put in front of you.  Could you take a look at it.  And would you agree that that photocopy has a circle around what would be the plaque to which you have just referred; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I can see the point you have circled.  That is where the plaque was.  But I continue to say that this photograph is not a photograph of Nyange church, even though the church looks like Nyange church.  
MR. TOWNSEND:
Thank you.  Those are all the exhibits I'm referring to this morning.  I believe they can be withdrawn.  I have a different question.  
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	Now, Nyange parish had a Suzuki vehicle; is that correct, yes or no?
A.	Yes, it had a Hyundai vehicle. 
Q.	Did it have a Suzuki, yes or no?
A.	I cannot make the distinction between the two types of vehicles, but I can assert that the vehicle was a Hyundai.  You could read the inscription "Hyundai" on it. 
Q.	And did Seromba drive that vehicle away in July '94, to your knowledge?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recollect the colour of that vehicle?
A.	It was a white vehicle.  
Q.	And, to your knowledge, that white vehicle belonged to Nyange parish; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	On the 13th of April, when you went to Nyange parish, Father Stratton would have already been gone, and it was Seromba who possessed the keys to Nyange; is that correct?
A.	Did you refer to the 13th of April?  I do not think I properly understood your question.  Could you please repeat it?  I haven't quite understood the question you put to me.  
Q.	On the 13th of April you went to Nyange church; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And by that date, the 13th April 1994, Father Stratton had left Nyange; correct?
A.	He did not leave on that exact date. 
Q.	My question was:  On that date that you were there --
A.	He had been in Nyundo parish for a number of days. 
Q.	So because Stratton wasn't there, you would agree with me that it was Seromba who possessed the keys to Nyange parish; is that correct?
A.	Yes, the priest of the parish had the keys of the parish. 
Q.	I'm asking you a question now about just the date.  You testified that Seromba attended meetings of a committee for peace and justice.  Would that have been in 1994?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And because Stratton was gone, it was Seromba that assumed the responsibility of Nyange parish, let's say, after the 10th of April 1994?
A.	As of 10th April 1994, it was Father Seromba who was at Nyange parish. 
Q.	And he had assumed responsibility for the parish, you would agree?
A.	I do not know what responsibility you are referring to because the church -- came to the church -- the bishop came to the church after the problem posed by Father Stratton.  He had said that he would resolve the problem posed by his behaviour, but that he would not leave Nyange church completely.  I believe Father Seromba had not yet assumed responsibilities for Nyange parish. 
Q.	Who had, as of the 10th of April 1994, assumed the responsibilities, if not officially but in fact?  
A.	At that point in time, it was Father Seromba who could assume responsibility for the parish.  I have told you that he was the one who had informed the bourgmestre that there were many refugees at the church.  
Q.	So would you agree with me that Seromba became a de facto priest in charge in April 1994?
A.	That is possible.  
Q.	You testified that "Father Seromba was like a parent to us"; is that right?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Seromba was respected by members of the community, and his instructions were observed or obeyed at Nyange; is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And although he was not an official, you would agree that he was an important person; is that correct?
A.	He was a religious personality -- religious authority. 
Q.	And as a religious authority in a community that was mostly Catholic, you would say that he was an important person?  Would you agree with me? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  If you take into consideration the Catholic community -- if you're referring to the Catholic community.  
Q.	Although Seromba was not a civilian authority, you would agree that he held de facto authority at the Nyange parish as priest; correct?
A.	I do not very well understand your question.  Are you referring to the authority he had in the entire community, or you are referring only to the Catholic community?  
Q.	I'll move on to something else.  Before April 1994, can you estimate how many times you had seen Seromba; less than five, more than 10? 
A.	Are you asking how many times I saw him since he came to Nyange parish?  Please specify the period you are referring to, otherwise I cannot count the number of times I saw him before the month of April.  
Q.	My question started, "Before April '94".  That's the time period.  Total times you saw Seromba before April '94, if you can give us that estimate, please, and help us.
A.	I saw him on a number of occasions after the time when he arrived and until the month of April.  I'd like you to be more specific about the time span that you're talking about and give me the exact dates that you're referring to, otherwise it is not possible for me to tell you how many times I saw Father Seromba from the time of his arrival until April 1994.  
Q.	My question is:  The total number of times that you saw Seromba before 1994, in your whole life, if you can give us an estimate.  
A.	I can tell you the number of times I saw him in the month of April, and I can try and give you an estimation.  Let's say that I went to mass on two occasions, on two successive Sundays and that's when I saw him on those occasions. 
Q.	Those two masses, are you referring to April 1994; is that correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And had you seen Seromba before those occasions at mass in April 1994; yes or no?
A.	I can't give you the precise number of times.  He arrived late 1993 until 1994.  Let's just say I can't tell you precisely how many times I saw him.  In fact, you're putting me in a difficult position here.  I'm not able to remember how many times I met Father Seromba, especially in view of the fact that at that time we, of course -- I didn't know that I would have to respond or answer such a question one day, so I can't tell you how many times I saw him during that period. 
Q.	My question is for an estimate.  Are you able to give an estimate of the number of times you saw Seromba before 1994, or if you can't, just say you can't? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Objection, Madam President.  The witness has already said that he can't answer this question, and I think that the Prosecutor should move on to another type of question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, we asked you to avoid objections as much as possible.  I think that we have before us a witness who is answering questions and he's very much aware of what questions are being put to him.  

Witness, could you please answer the question.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I'm going to try and answer, but I think that I've already answered.  Let's say that if I were to give an estimation -- but before so doing, I would like to say that there were days when Father Seromba was absent when he had gone to meetings, and there was a period of one week during which he was absent and, at that specific time, Stratton went about putting him down.  Unless, of course, we were to calculate, using a calculator, there were some Sundays when I went to mass, and I could come across him or maybe not.  You're putting me in a difficult position here because I can't give you the exact number of times that I saw Father Seromba. 
BY MR. TOWNSEND:
Q.	I'll move on to something else.  You testified that around 1988 the nuns stopped cleaning the sleeping quarters of Nyange priests because one of the priests had had sex with a woman; is that correct?
A.	It is true that in 1988 they no longer came to clean the buildings at the parish because they had been harassed.  It is not a rumour as such because one priest had actually been done over after having gone to see his mistress.  The priest in question asked for pardon from those Christians who came to celebrate mass for the act that he had committed. 
Q.	By whom was that priest beaten for having slept or had sex with a woman?
A.	He was beaten by Bizuru, the son of Birigumundo, who was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Was he part of the clergy or lady, that Bizuru?
A.	No, he was a normal citizen and he was married.  The case was taken before the Byumba sous-préfecture jurisdiction.  And afterwards, then, the priest resigned. 
Q.	You testified that a certain priest -- let me withdraw.  You said that Stratton said a certain priest would be absent from the second mass because that priest had gone to enjoy himself with a woman.  Did you understand Sratton to be referring to Seromba when he said "that priest"?
A.	Yes, he was talking about Father Seromba.  He explained it clearly.  And he didn't take it into effect that he had already received the authorisation to take part in the meeting. 
MR. TOWNSEND:
At this time, Your Honour, I would move for a closed session as the balance of my questions will touch on the identity of this witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections from the Defence?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
No objections, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We will now move into closed session in the interest of justice and in order to protect the identity of the witness. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 8 to 42] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

(Court resumed at 1630H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session. 

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
You are a Defence witness with the pseudonym FE56.  Before you answer the questions put to you by the Defence in examination-in-chief, followed by those that will be put to you by the Prosecutor during their cross-examination, we will kindly request that you make the following declaration.
MR. MUSSA:
Witness, will you please raise up your right hand, and you will repeat after me:
(Declaration made by Witness FE56 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  I will now kindly ask the Defence counsel, Nekuie to carry out the 
	examination-in-chief of Witness FE 56. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the booth cannot see the witness because of the curtains.
MR. NEKUIÉ:
Madam President, perhaps we could also draw the curtains out, the ones that are on the side of the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So is that okay now?  Counsel Monthé -- sorry Counsel Nekuie, you have the floor.  
MR. NEKUIÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon.

WITNESS FE56,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NEKUIÉ:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness FE56.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness FE 56, I shall conduct the examination-in-chief shortly, but before doing so, I would like the Chamber to ask the Registry to go to the -- to come to the Bench and take the identification form to the witness -- sheet -- sorry, to the witness, for him to confirm that it is, indeed, his identity which is contained in the said document. 
MR. NEKUIÉ:
I thank the Registry.  
BY MR. NEKUIÉ: 
Q.	Witness FE 56, an identification sheet has just been submitted to you.  I would kindly request that you check the information contained therein and tell the Chamber whether the information, indeed, corresponds to your identity.  
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, this is, indeed, my identity sheet. 
MR. NEKUIÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, the witness has just confirmed that the particulars are his and I would like to tender this identification sheet as Defence Exhibit No. D. 76, and that it be put under seal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Nekuie.  Are there any objections from the Prosecutor?  It seems that this document should bear the number D. 75.  
MR. NEKUIÉ:
The Defence confirms that it should be D. 76, Madam President -- unless --  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, have you been able to check?  It seems that it would, indeed, be Exhibit D. 76.  Were you able to check? 

The identification sheet of Witness EF 56 is admitted as Defence Exhibit D. 75, and it shall be put under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 75 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel Nekuie.
MR. NEKUIÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Defence would like to apologise for the misunderstanding between registry and ourselves regarding the number of this exhibit, but it seems that one of our materials was admitted as Defence exhibit but was not included in the files of the registry, but we shall have opportunity to check on that matter subsequently, and the information shall be provided to you on the matter.

Madam President, at the beginning of the examination-in-chief of Witness FE 56, I would like to kindly request that this session be held -- be a closed session, because I have a number of questions to ask the witness, which might reveal his identity.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections from the Prosecutor?  No objection.  Very well.  We shall sit in closed session as to protect the witness in the interest of justice.
