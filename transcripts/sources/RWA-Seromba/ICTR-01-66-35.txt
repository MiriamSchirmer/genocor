MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  The witness is awaiting the testimony, but before we get to that, the Chamber has a decision to render; then we will hear the parties, as it seems that they have oral applications to present.

Given the Chamber's decision of 27th October 2005 in which it based itself on the decisions taken by the Chamber during the status conference of 5 April 2005, when the parties met with the coordinator of the Chamber to go through and make an inventory of the exhibits to be disclosed to the Defence by the Prosecution.  Given the transcript of the hearing of 28th October 2005, and the confidential report submitted by the coordinator of the  Chamber, recalls the orders -- status conference 5 October 2005 statements, recalls that there are two types of statements, statements from clergy members on page -- pointed out on pages 8 and 9 of the Defence motion dated 11 March 2005.  The Chamber notes that the Prosecutor has only disclosed to the Defence the statements made by the clergy members; and notes that the Prosecutor has only partially respected its disclosure obligations.  And, consequently, orders the Prosecution to disclose to the Defence, by the latest today, all of the documents mentioned in pages 8 and 9 of the Defence motion, dated 8th March 2005, referred to the said pages.  

The Chamber further notes that the Defence still -- or may not still have disclosed the statements of all of its witnesses to the Prosecution, contrary to the orders of 27 October 2005 given by the Chamber.  The Chamber, therefore, reiterates its order, urging the Defence to disclose the above-mentioned documents to the Prosecution, at the latest, today.  The Chamber rules that each of the parties must respect their disclosure obligations and, if they do not respect those obligations, possible sanctions may be enforced.  The Chamber urges the Trial Chamber coordinator to report to it with regard to              the -- respect of the disclosure obligations.  This is with respect to the Chamber's decision.  

Now, we would like to give the floor to the parties, beginning with the Office of the Prosecutor.  You have the floor.  
MR. MOSES:
I'm sorry, Your Honours, I was advised by the Trial Chamber coordinator that the Defence had matters that they wished to raise.  So, perhaps we can just hear what the Defence wants to raise first.  I was told that that was the reason why we were to sit, initially, so the Defence could raise matters.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I turn towards the Defence.  

Mr. Monthé, you have the floor.  

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence was waiting for the decision based on the note from the Trial Chamber coordinator of 27 October 2005.  The Defence would also remind the Chamber that it filed a motion with regard to its investigator; we still have not received a response.  Madam President, those were the two concerns that we had.  The first has been met.  Besides the motion that is still pending, which perhaps has not been dealt with by the Chamber, but with regard to the first concern, the Chamber has favourably dealt with that concern.  I have no other points, Madam President.  I thank the Chamber.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  That decision will be given perhaps tomorrow.  We are currently dealing with that matter; there is still some research to be done, in fact.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, the only matters I wished to raise were two, and Your Honours have dealt with the first matter by virtue of Your Honours' order this morning, and that was regarding disclosure, so I won't make any further comment regarding that.  

The only other issue, Your Honours, which I should indicate and intimate to Your Honours is with respect to the Prosecution's cross-examination of the Defence -- or the first six Defence witnesses.  We will, as Your Honours have asked us to, commence our cross-examination if we get the material on Monday, as Your Honours indicated you would like us to.

We have, however, been advised by the investigation section in Kigali that they simply cannot carry out background checks on these witnesses by that time.  Today is a holiday in Kigali.  Tomorrow, there is Gacaca throughout the country; and there is an Idd on Thursday or Friday, or both.  

As Your Honours may well be aware, these first six witnesses all reside outside of Rwanda.  They all left Rwanda at the end of the genocide, about July '94.  We simply are unable to confirm or deny whether these people are who they say they are; what, if anything, they did during the April to June, July period.  Now, it may be that there is nothing that we need to ask in respect of them once we have received reports from -- from the investigations; but the Prosecutor has a duty, not only to -- not only to the Prosecutor himself, but also to the victims of Nyange, that we carry out proper, thorough investigations of these people before we indicate to Your Honours that our cross-examinations are concluded.  

And I simply want to indicate to Your Honours whilst we can cross-examine on the materials that they may testify to in court, we will be unable to receive such information as may be necessary, and I emphasise "may", to cross-examine them regarding details of who they are, what they were doing, and whether they bear any relationship -- have any relationship with either the Accused or other co-conspirators.  

It would not be the first time in this Tribunal's history that people have testified when they are not who they have said they are.  We don't have to go very far in this particular case to know that people have been living outside of the country using false names.  These are matters which need to be properly investigated.  Now, I simply, at this stage, want to tag or highlight the issue for Your Honours that whilst we will conduct the cross-examination based on the material and the evidence that they testify to in court, there may be additional matters we need to cross-examine these witnesses about once we have received full information from the investigation section.  

That, of course, Your Honours, is one of the reasons why Your Honours ordered that we have 21 days, not only to prepare on the basis of the statements, but also so that proper background checks can be made.  That cannot be done overnight, and it cannot be done within a period of a week or ten days.  So I simply want to raise that issue and highlight it for Your Honours so that there is no surprise to anyone if we should at the end of the cross-examination say, "These are all of the questions we have for now."  It may be that we want the witnesses recalled. I simply wanted to raise that now so that there is no element of surprise, or why hasn't the Prosecutor raised this on an earlier occasion.

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Yes, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, you would agree with me that I didn't know what the Prosecution was going to say, so I wasn't in a position to respond.  So on behalf of the Defence I am a bit surprised that the Prosecutor wants to conduct investigations.  That is their own business, but they cannot cross-examine witnesses of the Defence, but on the basis of the statements that were disclosed in these adversarial proceedings, and perhaps what they said in their testimony.

The Defence could never conduct investigations and then cross-examine a witness on the basis of the information that it received in Kigali on the bases of those investigations.  I have never seen this type of procedure before where you will go and get information on individuals in conditions nobody knows about to come afterwards and ask questions about those matters to the witness, matters which are not dealt with in court.  I am surprised by the Prosecutor's approach.  They are trying to skirt their obligations in cross-examining the witnesses.  There are witnesses who are currently here in Arusha.  They have all of the necessary tools they need; in other words, the statements of those witnesses.  Those are sufficient for them to move forward.  Now, with regard to us, we did what we had to do.  You have just issued an order, we will respect it.  

Madam President, I wanted to end by saying the following; it is easy to reproach us for the lack of disclosure.  I have explained why we have had difficulty, but I want to point out to your Chamber that as we begin to present our Defence witnesses, the Defence has asked your Chamber for the famous Kibuye file, that we still do not have it.  We were told that there were translation problems; we have been waiting for several months.  Once again, I do not want to create a plemic, but the problem remains.  

I want to conclude by saying that it is good that the pace has been restored, disclosures will be made.  All of the documents that are necessary for the manifestation of the truth will be disclosed.  For my part, I will respect your orders.  For the other parties, they will have to respect your orders, but with regard to the Defence, we are ready to proceed with our next witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé. 

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MOSES:
Just regarding the last issue regarding the Kabuye^ and Ruhengeri files, I have been advised that the entire file that we received from Rwanda was disclosed to the Kinyarwanda on the 20th of December last year with registry.  As it was translated into French, we disclosed it as we received it from the translation section in that it was disclosed on the 20th of April, the 21st of April, the 26th of April; and, finally, the 23rd of June when the final part of the file was translated and was filed with registry.  

I don't know, you would have to check with registry if they have passed it on to the Defence. I presume they have, but we have certainly complied with what obligations we have.

Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Duly noted.  If the Defence still has issues with this, they should raise them with the Chamber.  It appears that the Kibuye file was filed with the registry; we have the French version.  In principle, you should have it, Mr. Monthé.  According to information we have just been given by the Prosecution, these files were disclosed in April and June; as such, by now you should have the French versions.  Please make the necessary verifications and keep us informed, Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I will check. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you.  The Chamber will now have the second witness brought in.  We want to know if the third witness on the list is, indeed, in Arusha. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, yesterday I indicated to the Chamber that currently in Arusha there are six Defence witnesses; consequently, the third one is here.  I also told the Chamber so that these are fair hearings and properly conducted hearings, we asked that the Prosecution cross-examine them after their examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  Please bring in Witness BZ14. 

Mr. Monthé, here is the Chamber's proposal, given the fact that the statements were disclosed tardily; in other words, after the expiration of the time limit, we propose that we hear the first witnesses.  You conduct your examination-in-chief of them.  And after -- given that Thursday and Friday will be    holidays -- the Prosecution will have an opportunity to prepare itself and then we can move on to the cross-examination of those witnesses, beginning on Monday.  That will allow us to move forward normally, if I can express it that way, since the Prosecution will have the witness statements today, by the latest, to prepare further witnesses and be in a position to cross-examine the witnesses directly after their examination-in-chief.  However, for these current witnesses this week, we have to allow them the necessary time to prepare. 

Good morning, Witness.  You are a protected Defence witness, and here you will be referred to as Witness BZ14.  And the Defence will lead you in-chief, and then the Prosecutor will cross-examine you.  And there may be questions from the Judges that you'll be required to answer.  And there will be re-examination by the Defence if it deemed fit.

If questions are put to you which may reveal your identity, kindly inform us, and you are also required to avoid providing information about your own identity in your responses.  Now, you shall take the solemn declaration and you will be assisted in this by the registrar. 
(Declaration made by the Witness BZ14 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Witness, for having taken your solemn declaration, assisted by the registry.  

We now give the floor to the Defence for the examination-in-chief of this witness, Witness BZ14. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, before I begin, I wish to respectfully inform the Chamber that I have circulated an identification sheet, a copy of which should be on your desk.  It is now being distributed, I can see. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have just received the identification sheet.  Please give a copy to the Prosecutor and one copy to the witness. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Quite so.  Maybe we can request the witness, by your leave, Madam President, to see if the information on this identification sheet is in conformity with his status.  If that is the case, then he should kindly sign it so that we can have it as an exhibit; and if there are any errors therein, that those errors should be corrected.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, have you looked at this document carefully?  It is entitled "witness Identification sheet".  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document before me.  The information on the document is correct in its entirety, apart from the telephone number, which doesn't appear, but I understand that because at the time this was recorded, I didn't have a phone. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please give the witness a pen?  

Do you have something with which to write, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I do not have. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please place the telephone number on the identification sheet and then sign it, to signify that the information therein is correct. 
THE WITNESS:
Could you please tell me what date it is today?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
1st November 2005.  

Very well, Mr. Monthé, you have the floor. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  By leave of the Chamber, may I request that you admit this document as a Defence document and its reference will be D. 44; and can it be placed under seal?  Thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  No observations from the Prosecution.  Very well, so this document is admitted as a Defence exhibit under reference D. 44, and it shall be placed under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 44 admitted under seal).
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you.  Madam President, the Defence also has a proposal to make to the Chamber in order to avoid having to go into closed session and thereby avoid certain difficulties; I have adopted your suggestion of yesterday.  So, I have placed names on the list and I have numbered them.  And this document should be distributed to each of the interested parties.  In this manner we should avoid the difficulties such as we experienced yesterday.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  That is an excellent idea. 

Counsel, there are three Judges.  Can you kindly distribute the right number of documents to the Bench. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I do apologise, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you. 
WITNESS BZ14
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ14, good morning.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	You are going to testify as a Defence witness.  And I'm going to ask you a series of questions requesting you to kindly give me an answer in a complete manner.  And in the event that you do not understand any one of my questions, please so inform me so that I can reformulate my question.  Please be careful to avoid making answers that are likely to reveal your identity.  Thank you.

Are you ready?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  Witness BZ14, can you please inform this Chamber where you were in April 1994?  Were you in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I was in Rwanda in my native village in Nyange, in Nyange secteur. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember whether in April 1994 there occurred an event in Rwanda?  And if you do recall, what exactly happened? 
A.	What I recall is that on the 6th of April, the night of the 6th to 7th April, an event did occur, and that was the death of the former president of Rwanda, Mr. Habyarimana. 
Q.	Do you know how he died, Witness BZ14?  Do you know how the former president died, the former president of Rwanda?
A.	Yes.  As far as I know, he died in a plane accident; the aircraft was brought down. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please tell the Chamber how you learned of this news concerning the destruction of that aircraft? 
A.	On the 6th of April during that night, I did not get to hear of that news.  But on the 7th of April in the morning, that is when I heard this news, when I woke up.  It said that the president had died the night before.  I hadn't been able to listen to my radio because I wasn't able to receive to frequency 90.  I normally could hear news in the mornings, but on that morning I heard music, special kind of music, and I learned of the death of the president.  I could no longer remain in my house, and that is how at about 8 o'clock or 8:30, 9 o'clock, I went out to see what the situation was outside.  And that is how I went to the small centre which was near me -- Nyirabunoshi is name of that centre -- so I could get news about the prevailing situation.  I wanted also to hear the comments that people there were making.  

When I reached the centre, people were giving their versions of the events; and the versions were very varied.  But I can say that when I arrived, I found two men at the centre, Télésphore Ndungutse was one of them.  He was one of the persons, one of the intellectuals of the local area because he had received training as a teacher, but he was the manager of the People's Bank, Banque Popular.  And he was in the company of a policeman who was known as Kibyutsa, that was his nickname, but his real name was Aloys Nishyerembere.  So, I was there with them.  But as for us ordinary peasants, we would come close to these intellectuals so that we could hear what they were saying about the death of the president.  That is how Ndungutse asked the communal police, Kibyutsa Nishyerembere.  "You are there, you are a communal police and you have a gun which belongs to the commune." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please go a bit more slowly, and I would like you to spell the names, if you can spell them; otherwise, we will request that the interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth does the spelling, because these are names that we are not necessarily familiar with. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, if you wish, I'm going to assist the witness to recapitulate a little.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please be precise in telling us what was the atmosphere in your -- in your local area, and what was the climate like after they learned of this sad news? 
A.	Yes, I wanted to tell you that as I was on the road, we could see that people were discouraged and they were confused.  People who were going about their normal activities were discouraged and they didn't know what to do.  As for this man Ndungutse, I am seeing his name on the list, the list which is on a document I have here before me. 
Q.	Can you please spell that name, because you have the name on the list and I think the presiding Judge and the Judges would wish to have those names spelled correctly.  I'm going to mention some names, and I think this is what the presiding Judge wanted you to spell, because you said you met                 Mr. Ndungutse and that second person, the policeman.  Could you please spell their names for the benefit of the Chamber.  
A.	Ndungutse and the policeman were in a place known as N-Y-I-R-A-B-U-N-O-S-H-I (sic), Nishyerembere? 
Q.	Witness BZ14, at that point in time when you met Ndungutse, were there any movements of people in your commune at that point in time?  What exactly did you see? 
A.	At that point in time we could see people moving about on the roads; some people were not even aware, even if the president of the republic was dead.  There were no particular events or special events that had taken place at that point in time.  People were merely surprised by the death of President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ14.  Let's come back to Télésphore Ndungutse; you heard him speak to the policeman.  What exactly was he telling him.  Could you please repeat that for the benefit of the Chamber? 
A.	I have not seen the name of the policeman on the list that I have, but I told you that he was known as Kibyutsa.  But that was his nickname.  His normal name is Aloys Nishyerembere.  So he said to him, you --  
Q.	Can you please spell these two names for the benefit of the Chamber? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And can counsel kindly wait until the Kinyarwanda booth is done, because otherwise the beginning of his questions would not be heard because we are using the same channel. 
THE WITNESS:
Nishyerembere is spelt N-I-S-H-Y-I-M-B-E-R-E, (sic), Nishyerembere.  Aloys is his first name, A-L-O-Y-S. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I believe the witness made a small error in the spelling of the name.  I do not know whether the interpreter can be of any assistance. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Let me spell Nishyerembere, N-I-S-H-Y-E-R-E-M-B-E-R-E, Nishyerembere. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Interpreter.  

Yes, you may proceed. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
 
Madam President, with the Rwandan names and given my incompetence in the subject,                Father Seromba is telling me that there is still a mistake despite the new spelling.  He says that there is an "I" which has been left out.

It would seem that it is Nishyere and not Nishyire.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You may proceed.  Nishyerembere. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, Nishyerembere.  
A.	The man's name was, indeed, known as Nishyerembere, so the interpreter's spelling was correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let`s proceed.  Télesphore Ndungutse was with Nishyerembere, and what were they saying about the death of the president? 
A.	They were discussing the death of the president, we could hear them.  But most important is that I heard him tell him that, "You are a communal police -- policeman, and you know that President Habyarimana is dead.  You are here and you are not acting, you are not doing anything, whereas the president has died."  Do you want me to proceed?  
Q.	(Microphone overlapping) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This interpreter canot provide provide that rendition because the beginning of the sentence of counsel was not heard by her. 
THE WITNESS:
The policeman responded by saying that, "It is true that I'm a communal policeman and that the president is dead.  What do you want me to do about that?"  Ndungutse responded, "If you cannot do anything, don't you know what you should do?  It is because you are ungrateful towards President Habyarimana.  If were you wearing this uniform and you are carrying this weapon, it is thanks to Habyarimana."  Do you want me to proceed?  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you.  So did Ndugutse remain together in that place with the policeman, or what happened? 
A.	During their discussions, as I witnessed the event, Ndugutse was not happy.  In fact, he said to the youths who were present "Let's go home."  And that is how the youths left with him.  And they went to a place known as Karuteyi.  There was a drinking place in that location.  It is about three and a half kilometre from Nyirabunoshi.  So they went towards Karuteyi.  So they left, and I remained there, and at a given point in time, I wanted to go back home, so I went back to my house and carried on with my daily activities.  But I didn't see any particular problem.  The inhabitants were calm, but at about 2 or     3 p.m., life changed completely.

This began in Ndugutse`s cellule, because at around that time we saw smoke going up into the sky.  The disturbances had just begun.  And I asked my neighbours what was happening.  I was told that there had been an attack originating from Ndugutse's cellule.  And that they had attacked Rakariyu`s home.  Rakariyu was also a teacher 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know what ethnic group -- to which ethnic group this man belonged? 
A.	I knew Rakariyu very well.  He was a teacher and he was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Tell me, according to you, was he a first victim in the commune?  Was he the first person killed, according to -- according to you?  And, if you know, why was it he who was targeted? 
A.	Yes, these are things that I witnessed.  Since he was a Tutsi, he was, in fact, trying to criticise the Tutsis.  I think this is why he started with that man.  And he was the only Tutsi who lived in the neighbourhood.  And I think that is why he started off with Rakariyu.  Maybe he thought that Rakariyu was an intellectual who could provide advice to other Tutsi.  That is what I think, but I don't know why Ndungutse decided to start with Rakariyu. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Could you please tell the Chamber why, after this event, the destruction of the aircraft, Ndungutse decided to attack Tutsis, as you have just told us? 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, with the greatest of respect, that has to call for speculation.  How can this witness know what was in Ndungutse's mind?  It is simply calling for speculation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you want to respond to that objection raised by the Prosecution?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, to respond, I would simply repeat my question, which is the following -- I do not know whether the Prosecutor followed my question:  I asked the Witness Why Ndungutse decided to attack the Tutsis after the destruction of the aircraft. 

I have not invited any speculation.  I'm not inviting any interpretation, nor any speculation.  I'm asking why Ndungutse decided to attack the Tutsi. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the Prosecutor asked you how could the witness know what was in Ndungutse's head or in his mind.

MR. MONTHÉ: 
He said that Ndugutse went with the communal policeman to a bar, and he asked the communal policeman why he has a gun and he is in uniform and he is not doing anything.  I think you are following what I am saying.  The witness is developing what he saw and observed on that day.  And my question seems to go along with that context and I'm asking why Ndungutse was attacking Tutsis. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, rephrase your question.  The Chamber believes that that question calls for speculation.  

Please proceed. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness BZ14, please tell us when teacher Rakariyu was killed, why was he killed? 
A.	Let me go back a bit.  I said that the teacher was not killed.  I said, rather, that the assailants attacked his house.  I don't know why they wanted to attack him, but given what Ndugutse said, it was because that teacher belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.  According to Ndungutse, Habyarimana had been killed by the Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you, BZ14.  After that attack at that Tutsi teacher's house, were there any other attacks in your area and, if so, how did they occur? 
A.	The attacks were not limited to just that one house.  There were other attacks on Tutsi homes.  There were also other attacks in other cellules.  Things happened in other cellules in the same way.  Let me remind you that during that war there were thugs who killed and looted.  They said in other areas the work had begun.  That was how the situation infected, if you will, other cellules; up to the point that the entire secteur was infected. 
Q.	Tell me -- or rather tell the Chamber were the attacks directed solely at Tutsi? 
A.	Yes, the attacks were directed solely against the Tutsis.  People were attacking the Tutsis, and in the attacks they sought to take and eat their cattle. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know if those Tutsis defended themselves against those attacks and, if they did, how did they do so? 
A.	As I said before, this all happened in the countryside.  Tutsi were spread out everywhere each was looking for refuge.  I remember at Vungu, there was a Pentecostal church.  The faithful of that church went into hiding; others went into hiding in the bush; others took refuge at the Catholic church.  However, each and every one was trying to save his or her own skin. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You have just said that they fled and they took refuge here and there, and then you said they took refuge at the Catholic church.  Which Catholic church are you referring to? 
A.	I'm referring to the Nyange Catholic church.  I also talked about the Vungu Pentecostal church, the faithful of that church also took refuge. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let's talk about Nyange Catholic church.  According to you, when did the refugees begin to arrive at Nyange church? 
A.	I said that some refugees went into the bush, but when the unrest broke out, people started to be killed, refugees started to go towards the parish.  In those days, refugees were on their way to Nyange church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You were in that area.  Did you know about Nyange church; did you go there on a regular basis? 
A.	I know Nyange church very well.  **************.  I used to go to the nuns' home in the parish.  Yes, I know Nyange very well. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in 1994 you said that you used to go to Nyange church.  Now, tell the Chamber who was the priest at the church at that time and tell us whether or not you knew the person. 
A.	I believe that the priest was named Straton.  I also knew Father Seromba.  I met him in mid-January 1994.  Before that, I didn't live in the area.  I met him in January.  What I know is that Father Athanase was not the priest at that church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In January 1994, you met father Athanase Seromba what were the circumstances of your meeting him? 
A.	I went to the parish, supplies had been brought there; they were for poor people.  In fact, my mother was ill and needed supplies herself.  So I was at the parish to pick up some supplies for my mother.  They handed out beans and rice and cooking oil, sugar as well, if I'm not mistaken.  That is how I met Father Seromba.  There were other people who had come for the same supplies, just like I had.  I'm not sure if I should add any more details to that.
Q.	Please do.  
A.	In fact, I can't add anything more.  Times were peaceful and simply, as I said, we had gone to the church to pick up supplies.  Let me add one small detail.  Some supplies were missing and people were wondering why there were no more supplies, where they had gone.  At the time there was a seminarian called Apolinaire (phonetic), he was in charge of distributing the supplies.  People asked that the father be contacted to assess the situation, because other people wanted to ask the priest what was happening.  Others said that Father Athanase should be asked the question.  

People concluded that the priest brought the supplies to Vungu so that they could be given to RPF acolytes.  There was a shortage of supplies at the church.  People had a problem with that.  They went home and there was no incident after that. 
Q.	Witness, the supplies that were handed out to poor people, tell us about them.  Who did they belong to? 
A.	They said that Caritas distributed the supplies. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you met Father Seromba at Nyange parish, what did the parishioners think of him?  What did they say about him during that period? 
A.	Up until the war broke out, I never heard people say anything negative about Mr. Seromba, but they did criticise Father Straton.  They said that he was giving supplies to the Inkotanyi in Vungu; but I never heard anyone say anything negative about Father Seromba.  With regard to the priests, they were saying that he was bringing supplies to the Inkotanyi in Vungu. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you say Inkotanyi, what are you referring to?  What does that word mean placed in the context of that time and place where you were? 
A.	According to our understanding, Inkotanyi meant RPF troops.  They were guerrilla fighters.  The people understood that these were fighters of the Tutsi army.  Father Straton was accused of being an accomplice of those RPF troops. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you remember when the violence broke out in your area; violence that broke out to such an extent that the Tutsis had to flee and take refuge at the church? 
A.	On the 7th, the day after the president died, the violence broke out.  In fact, even on the same day.  In our area the Tutsis spent the night in their homes; but when the violence broke out, people could no longer stay at home.  When the violence spread on the 8th, people began to flee towards Nyange church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know if the people who were fleeing to the church went voluntarily, or were they forced to go there by certain individuals? 
A.	Nobody could force them to go to the Nyange church.  Were the attackers going to tell them what to do?  Everybody did what they wanted to do.  Sometimes husbands were abandoning their wives; sometimes the children stayed at home alone.  Every person went voluntarily.  They were trying to save their skin.  Nobody forced anyone to flee at that time. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know why they went to the church? 
A.	I think that in 1973 there were the same problems, people were trying to seek refuge at the church because they felt safe there.  That was the habit they had; whenever there were problems, when there was unrest, they would go to the church for refuge. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know what type of welcome the refugees received at the church? 
A.	When they arrived at the church, people welcomed them.  The church is a building which demands respect.  Many times the church was closed, people would go there just to pray.  If people spent the night in the church, it means that they given authorisation, the church was opened up.  They didn't knock down the church doors to get inside.  The church was opened to them.  They were welcomed into it.  Now, had they not been welcomed into the church, they would have knocked the doors down, and you would have been able to see the obvious evidence of that, of which there was none. 
Q.	Witness BZ14, when the refugees arrived at the church, were they inside of the church?  Had they settled inside of the church, or were they somewhere else on the parish grounds? 
A.	No, the refugees were at the parish, but I heard that there were others who had gone to the communal office.  And later on those refugees left the communal office because there was nothing to eat there.  I heard that some refugees had left the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When the refugees arrived at the church, was Father Seromba there?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, before we get to that, can we please have the witness establish whether he was present.  We simply don't know whether this witness was present when the refugees arrived.  With a lot of the evidence that has been given, I think we are all left in the dark as to whether or not this is information that this witness was present and saw or heard, or whether or not he is telling the Court what he heard from someone else.  I haven't objected, to date, but I'm objecting now and asking, before that question is answered, can we please establish whether the witness was present, or whether he is simply telling Your Honours what he heard from someone else.
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I am happy to hear that you are finally making an objection.  You have said that you were sitting there and didn't want to stand up, but finally you have an objection.  I will listen to the objections, but I should not be told how I should ask my questions.  I should not be told how to put my questions to a witness.  I don't need lessons and lectures from the Office of the Prosecutor.  I have done this for a long time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  The Prosecution objected to the question you asked the witness.  Do you wish to respond to the objection, or do you have another question?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I will not respond to that objection.  Let me put a different question to the witness.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, did you stay in Nyange at the time the refugees began to arrive at the parish? 
A.	Yes, I stayed there. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you saw the refugees go there? 
A.	I could see them on their way, but they were trying to hide.  The killers were waiting and watching them, later on.  Then the church was full.  We could not see the people move all of the time, but certainly the people were trying their hardest to get to the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  There were many refugees therefore at the church.  Did you hear anyone say whether or not Father Seromba was there at that time or not? 
A.	Even if I didn't make it there, Father Seromba was present.  He tried to give them food from the supplies that were available.  In fact, the refugees could not stay in that area without any food.  So they remained there, up until the point they were attacked. 
Q.	Witness BZ14, how do you know that Father Seromba was giving the refugees food and water; and I'm talking about the refugees at the church? 
A.	The people who used to go to that place said as much.  They said that, "The refugees are at the church and they are being assisted." Even if I didn't make it up to that area, at one point in time when the refugees were attacked -- maybe I will say it, later on I can talk about this when I talk about the attack launched against the refugees.  
Q.	Witness, I have a question for the time being; you say there were many refugees at the church.  Do you remember which day of the week it was? 

A.	I can't tell you how many refugees were at the church.  Their numbers grew, people came from the countryside.  Since the killers couldn't find anyone to kill on the countryside, they decided to attack the refugees at the parish.  There were no more refugees on the countryside.  Everyone had fled. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I want to know which day of the week it was when all of the refugees arrived in force at the church following the crash of the presidential plane.
A.	I'm not sure I understand your question. 
Q.	Let me repeat it.  Earlier, you said that there were many refugees at the church -- and there were no more refugees in the countryside; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you have any idea which day it was when they filled the church; which day in April?  That is the question.  Do you remember which day of the week it was, or the date if you have it? 
A.	I don't know the exact date, but I believe it was around the 12th, 13th or 14th of April.  On those dates the church was packed full, people went to that place.  And those who were at the church said that the church was full.  There were many people because there was a market near by.  People would go to visit the church and try to give the refugees something to assist them, some supplies.  Some people gave gifts of livestock.  

Sometimes there were intermarriages, and so people had friends at the church.  They could go to find them there.  But sometimes on the way to the church people died; not everyone could make it there.  Someone, for example, whose mother-in-law was moving about could go to the church to try to find that person; same goes for father-in-laws, et cetera.  At any rate, there were many people at the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, do you know how many refugees there were, approximately; how many were there, approximately, at that time?
A.	I don't know.  I couldn't venture to give you a figure.  I would be lying if I told you a specific number, because I don't know. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Witness, we are now on the 13th, the 14th of April correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The 13th or 14th of April.  At that time, were you able to find out whether or not there were any attacks launched against the refugees at the church? 
A.	I heard mention made of attacks which were perpetrated on the 14th and 15th.  On the 15th, there was a large-scale attack.  But before then the troublemakers would pass by the place in order to see what was going on:  Maybe this was in preparation for the attacks.   But the attack per se was on the 15th.  It was on the 15th that I was able to go there.  I arrived there at about 11 in the morning, and I found that there was a terrible war waging.  That was the first time that I went to the church during the time. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please tell the Chamber what you mean by "a large-scale attack"? 
A.	Regarding that attack, maybe I should go back a little to explain to you how I managed to get to the place.  In fact, I was married to a Tutsi woman, and this is to explain to you that I wasn't really at ease.  I was trying to do everything in my power to find information so that I could protect and defend my wife.  I, indeed, managed to protect her, thanks to the assistance of the responsable of the cellule, the cellule official.  

On that day, a Friday, the responsable mentioned, had a boy who was running a shop in the area.  The latter asked us to guard his shop so that looting against the shop would not take place.  However, in the morning of the 15th, that Friday, we heard noises and we even heard gunshots.  The noise was not coming from far.  I was with my uncle, and he said that he was going to watch over our women, but he went on to say that he needed to remain behind with a few people so that he could protect the property of the refugees.  In turn, he asked us to guard his son's shop. So we went to that place in which the shop was located, and we watched over it.  However, at the same time the situation had become serious at the parish.  Do you want me to continue?  
Q.	Yes, please continue in order to answer the question that I asked you, because you have gone back a little in terms of your recital.  So, please answer the question that I asked you. 
A.	Could you please repeat the question so that I can respond to it more specifically? 
Q.	Thank you.  Let me refresh your memory.  You stated that on the 15th of April, at about quarter past 2 in the afternoon, in fact, that was the only time that you were able to go to the church.  And we were being told by you about the large-scale attack.  And I had asked you to define what a large-scale attack was for the Chamber; and you have done so.  

Now, I am asking you about the 15th of April.  Could you explain, precisely, since you were there, what you saw at the parish? 
A.	On that day, there was attack -- there was an attack on that location.  The attackers went up, up to the church building, and the refugees themselves realised that they were going to be attacked.  And they tried to defend themselves by throwing stones at the attackers.  The attackers attacked the refugees, using bladed weapons.  Now the refugees themselves defended themselves by throwing stones.  Among the refugees there were some who had traditional weapons.  The fight was violent, and at some time the refugees managed to repel the attackers.

When the assailants withdrew, the refugees who were in the church, seemed to me to have been able to attack, but I had not at that point in time yet approached the church.  The fact remains that the refugees repelled the assailants up to the small shopping centre at Nyange.  And it was the reservists who were at Nyange who were able to counteract the approach of the refugees using grenades.  There were many deaths among the refugees, and they withdrew again back to the church.  

Since they withdrew again back to the church, the assailants attacked the building, and they were firing through the windows and on the walls.  And the situation continued like that until the evening, until the following day when the church was demolished.  
Q.	We will come back to that.  We will come back to that.  This is now the 15th; but now I want you to specify for the Chamber whether you were able to know whether there was any attacks before the 15th, an attack on the refugees who were in the church?  Can you say anything about that?  
A.	Yes, I spoke about people who had got there, but maybe they were trying to observe before they launched their attack.  But I am saying that this is not something I saw myself; I heard people say it.  Nothing actually happened, but the attack per se took place on the 15th. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let's talk about these people who were attacking.  Were they people from your neighbourhood, or were these people from elsewhere? 
A.	No, these were not people who were living in the area.  There were some others who had come from other areas, especially Kibilira, therefore, from Gisenyi.  And others came from far off secteurs.  And I'm thinking of Sunzar (phonetic) secteur and others.  In fact, they came in pursuit of Tutsis from their areas who had fled to our area.  There were, in particular, Tutsis who left from Sunzar (phonetic), who had left Sunzar (phonetic), because Tutsis were fleeing from everywhere.  So the attackers were coming from their locations because they were in pursuit of the fleeing Tutsis. 
Q.	Now, these attackers, as you called them, were you able to know who their leaders were, or who were the people who were directing their actions, if you were able to know about that? 
A.	In our area, there were people who were leaders, people who were involved in these acts.  I know that Ndungutse was very active and other responsable of the secteur.  I can also mention these soldiers who had been sent away from the army because of indiscipline.  And there were other people who I would refer to as vagabonds or rogues outlaws.  We realised that these were good-for-nothing people who had taken the law in their own hands; that is what I realised.  

However, I do not know whether we can say something about some of the communal officials.  I know that there were some who played a role in those events. 
Q.	Yes, we will come to that.  I want to ask you a question now.  According to you, these attackers who were coming from various locations which you have mentioned, did these people have any link whatsoever, or any relationship, from what you heard or what you saw, with                                   Father Athanase Seromba? 
A.	No, none, because normally the priest is a civilian.  I really don't see any relationship he might have had with those people.  The priests live in the presbytery.  They do not go to the bars.  All I know is that his mission was to teach, to teach the good news.  No, the priest never had any relationship with these people.  Furthermore, he could not give them any orders whatsoever, because they would not have obeyed him.  I never heard anyone say that the priest had said this or that.  

More so, because the president's death was a surprise to us in our area; we were not expecting it.  What happened is that people went to seek refuge at his place, and later these people were killed; just as they would have been killed even if they had remained in their own homes. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness, when you arrived on the scene of the parish on the 15th, did you see any members of the national gendermarie? 
A.	Yes, the gendarmes were there, but I wouldn't be able to tell you how they got there.  I saw them on that day.  Furthermore, even if they were not showing openly that they were playing a role in these attacks, they apparently did have a role.  But in order to answer you, the gendarmes were there.

1215H
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to get to know for how long they had been there at the parish, or would you have said that they arrived there on the 15th? 
A.	I myself arrived at the parish on that day and I saw them, but, in the evening, during our night patrols, people were saying that there were gendarmes and, in fact, when I arrived at the church I realised that the gendarmes were there.  So I realised that the person who told me that was right, but I don't know how they arrived at the parish. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, when on the 15th you got to the church and you saw the gendarmes, what were they doing on the 15th of April?  Were they defending the refugees, or were they doing something else? 
A.	If I were to judge by what I saw, I believe that they were not dealing with protecting refugees quite sincerely.  Rather, I saw that they were giving a helping hand to the killers, just like the policeman from the commune and the reservists who were living in the commune and former soldiers who had been dismissed from the army.  All these people were involved in the attacks against the refugees.  That's what I saw at the time. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, on the 15th of April, when you arrived at the church and you saw the gendarmes, was Father Seromba among the gendarmes and the policemen that you saw there? 
A.	Be it the 15th or the 16th, I did not see Seromba.  I didn't see any other clergy there.  Even the seminarists, I didn't see them.  I didn't see any of the clergy at that time.  I don't know whether they had locked themselves up inside, but I didn't see anyone fitting that category. 
Q.	From your observations -- you've just spoken about this -- but did you hear mention made during that time that Father Seromba was seen among the people who were there -- the policemen and the other attackers that you've mentioned? 
A.	He himself is here present and I think, if he had been seen in the area, he would have been killed.  I'm saying this because there were important Tutsis who were being looked for, and it was said of them that he had hidden some of them.  So the leaders of those attacks were asking them questions concerning the origins of Seromba.  They were saying that they needed to know more about this, because there were people whom he had hidden, especially on Saturday -- I don't think we've got to the events of Saturday, but this was said more about the events that took place on Saturday. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for your answer.  You said that you were on night patrols in the area.  During those night patrols had roadblocks been set up in your area?  If so, who had set up the roadblocks? 
A.	We had set up a watch on our hill on our village.  The conseiller or the secteur had ordered that night patrols be done.  They did not support the killings and they asked us to carry out those patrols on our own hill.  They said that we could occupy strategic areas, such as the tops of the hills, so that we could see the enemy come.  At that point in time there were no roadblocks and it was only after the killings that took place at the church that roadblocks were set up, and these roadblocks were set up in order to monitor the movement of people and to determine whether there were any RPF troops which may be in circulation.  So it was after that period of time that the roadblocks were set up, and that was done for the reasons I have mentioned. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for that clarification.

Now, the 15th of April you were present in the area and an attack begins.  Can you tell us how this happened exactly?  What did you see on the 15th of April?
A.	On the 15th, when these attacks began, since there were many attackers coming from all corners, they first of all surrounded the church.  There was an exchange of stones which were being thrown here and there.  Some people were killed in the courtyard and others went into the church.  It was being said that the church was already full, so there was fighting until the time when the people who were in the church came out.  The refugees were using traditional weapons that they had carried along with them, and this continued until the gendarmes went and spoke to the refugees, telling them that they could not be opposed to -- that they could not be resistant, because they were there as refugees.  

In the night of the 15th, the gendarmes said that these refugees were, rather, combatants and this they were saying because of what had happened, and the gendarmes were saying they did not know which side to help.  So that is why they took away all the weapons from the refugees.  So, the next day, during another attack, the refugees did not have any weapons. 
Q.	Let us conclude with the 15th of April, first of all.
A.	Very well. 
Q.	You were saying that the gendarmes asked the refugees to surrender the weapons they were carrying.  When you were talking about weapons, are these traditional weapons, or are they other kinds of weapons?
A.	They were traditional weapons.  You know, when someone leaves his home and if he is fleeing, he carries his spear, he carries a club, a bludgeon, or a machete.  Those are the kind of weapons they were carrying when they left their homes. 
Q.	Can you be more specific, for the benefit of the Chamber?  About what time was it when the gendarmes disarmed the refugees, as it were?
A.	I think it was about 4 p.m. -- it's then that the gendarmes asked the refugees to surrender their weapons, and once that operation was concluded, the refugees went back into the church believing that the gendarmes were going to be responsible for their security and safety.  But, in truth, I had the opportunity of contacting some of the gendarmes and I saw that they were in connivance with the assailants.  From time to time we could see them discussing with Ndungutse, or other sector officials, and this makes me say that even if they had come with the intent of protecting the refugees, at a given point in time they changed their minds and when they decided to get the weapons from the refugees, in fact it was a way of stopping them from defending themselves in the attacks that followed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ14.  You stated that after the gendarmes took their weapons, the refugees went back into the church.  What did they do once they were in there? 
MR. MOSES:
Once again, Your Honour, how can this witness, unless he was inside the church, tell Your Honours what the refugees did inside the church?  If he was inside the church, I have no problem with the question, but perhaps we could have some basis for that question being asked.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, please, can you respond?  Yes, first of all, you need to ask whether he went into the church in order to see what was happening.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, he says that the gendarmes disarmed the refugees, who then went into the church.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	So I'm now asking him -- Mr. Witness, when they went into the church -- when they went back into the church, did the refugees shut the doors?
A.	When they went back into the church, there was no longer any more fighting and, since night was falling, some of the attackers decided to come and spend the night at the church, and they kept the doors locked until the church was destroyed.  The night had just fallen and there was no more fighting and they had just been asked not to fight anymore.  And the other events took place on the Saturday. 
Q.	According to you, did they close the doors from the inside or from the outside?
A.	The refugees went into the church and they locked themselves in from the inside and the attackers remained outside. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Chamber, when the refugees closed the doors to the church, did they do that under someone's instruction, or was it at their own initiative?
A.	They did it on their own; they were afraid.  At that time, it was impossible to gain access to those people.  They were furious, angry.  People weren't in the mood to approach those people. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I see that it is time perhaps to take the break.  I should like to stop there, with your leave.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you still have many questions for this witness, Counsel?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, I have a few.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, you still have a few.  In that case, we will adjourn now for the luncheon break.  We will resume at 2.30 this afternoon.  These proceedings are adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1438H)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  We are going to proceed with the examination-in-chief of witness BZ14.

Mr. Witness, we would like to remind you that you are still under solemn declaration.  Mr. Monthé will continue with his examination-in-chief.  Mr. Monthé.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon to you, too.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to resume our conversation, for that is what it is, and I'm going to start with where we left off at 12.30.  Unless I'm mistaken, you were explaining to this court how the doors of the church were closed or locked by the refugees.  Can you recall, for our benefit, how the refugees locked the doors? 
A.	When a grenade was thrown amongst the refugees and they became discouraged because some of the refugees were killed, they decided to withdraw into the church after several refugees lost their lives.  The assailants tried to continue with their attack on the refugees, which is why the refugees went into the church and locked the doors immediately. 
Q.	Very well.  This is still the 15th of April, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it is the 15th of April. 
Q.	Thank you.  When they decided to close the doors, what time do you think it was, if you can remember? 
A.	When the refugees closed the doors it was about 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.  I do not know whether the assailants stopped the attacks, but there was someone in the crowd who said, "Listen, people have gone into the church.  Stop attacking them."  Afterwards, there were instructions, perhaps secretly given.  These instructions were given by the leaders of the assailants to the effect that the attacks were to be abandoned and that they would be resumed later.  But the leaders of the assailants did not tell their comrades to go back home.  They told them to stay at the church.  I, for my part, went home; I didn't stay at the church.  That is all I can say about the attacks that took place on the 15th. 
Q.	Witness, you have just used the expression "the leaders".  Would you say that Father Seromba was one of the leaders, to use your own expression? 
A.	No, I did not see him on the scene on that day -- at the scene on that day, nor did I see him there the following day.  I know the people who were saying these things.  It does not mean that I don't know the people who said these things.  I can say that I did not see Father Seromba there; he was not present. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ14.  Do you know whether these assailants threatened Father Seromba? 
A.	No, Seromba was not to be seen at that time. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like to ask you whether you heard -- that is, before you went to the church on 15th April, I want to ask you whether you heard that Father Seromba, at any time during his homilies at Mass, asked the parishioners to attack the refugees; did you hear that at any time? 
A.	I know nothing of that.  I did not attend Mass during those days. 
Q.	Thank you.  To return to the matter of these refugees, did you learn at any point that there was a list of Tutsis to be hunted down that was being circulated.
MR. MOSES:
It has to almost get a prize for the most leading question, Your Honours.  My friend could rephrase the question without trying to put words in the mouth of the witness. Thank you.  

I also note that this evidence is nowhere to be found in any of the statements that this witness has given to the Defence on previous occasions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, the Trial Chamber holds the objection of the Prosecution.  Be so kind as to rephrase your question. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the Trial Chamber has upheld the objection without my having a chance to respond to it, but I'll oblige.  There's no problem.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, concerning the arrival of the refugees at the church, did you hear that they went there because they were under pressure from someone?
A.	Who would have forced them to go there?  Everyone was trying to save himself by going to the church, so everyone went to the church of his or her own volition. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I am going to ask you -- and I'd like to emphasise that we're still referring to the         15th of April -- when you returned to your home on this 15th of April when you left the church, what time was it?
A.	When the doors were locked and instructions were given that the attacks should cease -- we're talking about these things as if these were ordinary events, but they were really dangerous times.  Actually, I sneaked off, because it was difficult; it was dangerous to leave the church.  Someone had given me a message which I was to pass on, so I was able to go to my home.  When I went there, I went for night duty as usual, so I left home at about 10 p.m. -- I left at about 10 p.m. to go to bed.  

In the morning I saw leaders going round the hill to call people to go to the church.  These people were saying threateningly that people who would not go to the church would be in serious trouble.  So, in view of that situation, I went to church as well -- I went to the church as well. 
Q.	Well, we're still with the 15th.  Let's deal with the 15th.  So, on the 15th, you went home at about 10 p.m. and you went to sleep.  This is my question:  when you went back, did the assailants stay there?
A.	Yes, I told you that I sneaked off -- I escaped actually, because everyone had been ordered to stay at the church.  I told you that there were people who had come from distant regions like Kibilira,  Kibanda Kibanda (phonetic) and these people did not leave the church at all.  Food had been prepared for them.  Actually, the people who returned to their homes are those who lived near the church, but they had been asked to go home and then return to the church.  So I went to my home, I ate, I went to see the conseille r, I went for the night round, and at 10 p.m. I went to bed. 
Q.	Now, let us move to the 16th.  You were in your home.  So you woke up on the 16th in your home.  What did you do?
A.	I woke up in the morning, the morning of the 15th -- of the 16th, I beg your pardon.  I went to see the leader.  I spoke with him.  His wife was at his father's, because my uncle's wife was also Tutsi, so these two women were together at the leader's home, and he assured me -- he reassured me that the women were safe.  So I went back home, or went back to the home of the person who had asked me to look after his home.  So I got to the location at 8.30.  

I saw or I found a bulldozer there, and the assailants were shooting into the church.  They were throwing stones into the church through the windows, and the bulldozer was digging a hole at that time.  So that is at the time when I got to the church and I heard people saying that, since the church was completely sealed, if we were to break down the doors, we would be in trouble.

So the assailants said, "We're going to destroy this church.  It is because of the strength -- it is from the strength of the Hutus that this church was built, and so we will build it again."  So I saw the bulldozer begin to demolish the church.  I don't know whether you wish me to proceed.  
Q.	Witness, I was just going to ask you to clarify one or two matters.  In reference to the assailants a while ago, you said that they had stayed at that place -- at the church and that the food had been prepared for them.  Who prepared that food for them, do you know?
A.	There was a coordinator of the bataille, if you will, who was supposed to make sure that these people had food.  He was called Rushema.  It was he who was in charge of feeding these people. 
Q.	Do you think that this coordinator had any relationship or any ties of any nature at all with Father Seromba?
A.	No, none at all.  Rushema came from a place called Gasave, I believe, and from what I know        Father Seromba is not even a native of Kivumu. 
Q.	Now, let us return to the 16th.  So you see this Caterpillar at the church.  Did you know to whom it belonged and who had brought it there, and I'm referring, when I say "there", to the parish?
A.	The bulldozer -- well, I don't know who brought the bulldozer to the church.  All I know is that the bulldozer belonged to Astaldi -- the Astaldi company, which was working on the Gitarama-Kibuye Road, but at the time of the attack the roadworks were not ongoing, so I cannot tell you who brought the bulldozer to the church. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you see the bulldozer at the church when you arrived that morning.  What was the bulldozer doing, what exactly was it doing?  Was there only one bulldozer?
A.	I told you a while ago that when I got to the church the bulldozer was digging a hole.  There were dead bodies next to that hole.  Some assailants were shooting at the refugees.  I told you about people who had firearms like army reserve -- army officers on reserve, who were shooting at the doors, and the bulldozer was digging a hole.  When the assailants failed, people began to say, "Since you cannot shoot the door open, the only solution is to demolish this church.  It is we who built it, so we can build another."  
Q.	Thank you.  For further clarification of the action of the Caterpillar, you say that there were dead bodies around it, but what was the hole that was being dug destined for?  Were you able to find out, or did you know?
A.	There were bodies of people who had been killed the day before -- on Friday.  I think the bulldozer was digging this hole to bury these dead bodies.  As to the assailants such as Christophe (sic) Ndungutse and other assailants from other secteurs and communes, they were saying that these bodies should be put in the hole.  So, the bulldozer dug the hole so that the bodies could be put into it. 
Q.	Were the bodies then put in that hole and the hole covered over again by the bulldozer?
A.	No, not all the bodies were buried on that same day.  Actually, the bulldozer was taken over so that it could be used to demolish the church.  So the bodies were buried in the days that followed, because the bulldozer was given over to the work of demolishing the church. 
Q.	All right.  Let us now come to this part of your testimony.  You say that the bulldozer was taken over from its initial task, which was to bury the victims.  Who took over the bulldozer, in your view?
A.	Ndungutse was amongst those who took over the bulldozer. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In the interests of truth and for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, can you tell us whether, when the bulldozer was taken over, you saw Father Seromba at that place?
A.	No, I did not see Father Seromba on the premises. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see any member of the clergy?
A.	No, I saw no member of the clergy there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you then tell us now -- since you were there -- tell us how the church was destroyed?
A.	After the bulldozer was given to this other job, it went to the area where the sacristy is.  There was a small road on the side of the sacristy and the bulldozer entered through there.  As the bulldozer approached, people were shouting that, "The church must be destroyed; the church must be destroyed," from the back of the church.  So the bulldozer sank its claws into the walls until up to the bell of the church was destroyed.  I was there; I saw everything.  I know that there was a Tutsi who fled.  He was called Vincent, but he was killed close to the bamboo which was nearby there. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness, who was driving that bulldozer, according to you?
A.	I know the driver of that bulldozer.  The driver was the one who would drive it within the Alstaldi company.  He was a driver from Alstaldi and, when I enquired, I was told he was a native of  Kibilira in Gisenyi.  I don't know his name very well, but I know him physically; I would be able to recognise him. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did that driver often come to your area?
A.	Are you referring to my native area or --
Q.	I mean the Nyange parish.  
A.	No, the road building was not close to the parish.  Astaldi, the company, was housing the workers in a place which was not far from the parish.  There was a small centre there, and that's where the houses of the Astaldi employees were to be found. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, the driver you're referring to, did he destroy the church all by himself, or did he ask for assistance from someone?
A.	There's another tall man, who was very dark in complexion, and he helped the driver.  The driver didn't destroy the church all by himself.  He received assistance from someone else, and it's that other person who helped him who in fact destroyed the bell. 
Q.	Previously you stated before the Chamber that the destruction of the church began from the sacristy.  Now, according to your description, as the walls were falling, apart from the attackers, were there -- was there anyone else, maybe gendarmerie, soldiers, or communal policemen?
A.	Yes, there were; there were people who were carrying firearms.  They were the ones supervising the destruction of the church.  They were encouraging the people, the inhabitants, to remain at the place.  They were carrying weapons, firearms, and they were watching as the church was being destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  When the first part of the church was destroyed, what did the refugees say?  Did some of them manage to escape?
A.	I do not know whether there were any who managed to escape.  I know that most of the refugees met their death in the church, and the one whom I said tried to escape was later killed and, as the bulldozer was destroying the walls, the roof was caving in.  It was difficult to escape.  I know there are some who survived -- I met them later on.  They had wounds on them, so I would presume that there were survivors from that event at the church, but I must say that the survivors were very few.

The church walls were very high, and escaping alive from that destruction would have been very difficult.  And there were those attackers who were waiting to finish off those who were trying to escape.  So it was very difficult to survive, given the circumstances.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Can you please be kind enough to tell this Chamber whether you know for how long the destruction of the church lasted?
A.	The church's destruction lasted for a number of hours, because I arrived at the church at about 10 and its destruction had already started, and it continued until 3 p.m., the time when the bell came down, and it's at that point in time that the authorities were asking the inhabitants to track down the survivors in order to kill them.  So people were saying that there were influential people who had not been found amongst the dead bodies.  Furthermore, Seromba also -- almost paid for this, because people were thinking that Seromba had hidden the influential people who were not found among the dead. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I now want to ask you to give us more clarifications on a concept that you've used.  When you refer to the term "authorities", about whom are you thinking exactly?
A.	There was the commune official, there was the CID officer, there was the brigadier, and there were the conseiller, and the cellule committees.  When I'm referring to the "authorities", I'm referring always to these people who had different positions within the commune.  Generally speaking, there were some persons in authority from whom the inhabitants would seek advice, and I must say that the inhabitants would normally obey the orders issued by these authorities, and I would be included in the group of inhabitants. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  I'm going to ask you the question.  According to that definition that you have just given us, would Father Seromba fall under that category of "authorities" in your commune or cellule?
A.	No.  The priest was normally the pastor of the faithful in the church; he's not an authority.  You would meet him at church and you would meet also when he officiates for Masses.  He's not an authority as such. 
Q.	Please tell me if I followed you correctly.  Did you say the bell fell at about 3 p.m.?
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, so the bell falls on the refugees and you are still there.  What happens next?  Did all the refugees in the church die?  Were they dead by that time?
A.	I wouldn't be able to state that all the refugees died.  I believe a few survivors were lucky enough to escape, but they were very few.  Furthermore, those who were about to die were finished off at that time.  There were problems or incidents.  I remember very well that I approached the body of one doctor where we used to dry off the drums.  I saw his body covered in blood, and people were saying that some other influential Tutsis were being sought, especially one Bonera, that they considered to be the king of the Tutsis in Kivumu.  There was also a lady known as Nyirarucaca, who was a registrar at the tribunal.  She was considered to be a main accomplice and there was also Mayor Rwamasya, who was also being looked for, and there was one Kayiranga, who was also being sought.

Since the bodies were not found, people said that it was Seromba who had hidden them, and that it was necessary to destroy the presbytery, and people began to wonder where he was.  People continued, and they said, "The assistant bourgmestre is not a native of this area, neither is Seromba, so they must be looked for because they are accomplices of these people."  This is what I heard said.  And the people said that it was Seromba who was giving the refugees food to eat, and they decided that the priest must be looked for, but someone among the inhabitants pleaded in his favour and said, "He is not the one who hid them.  Please do not destroy all the buildings.  If need be, we are going to look for these people at his home, but the buildings should not be destroyed."  So even he was threatened. 
Q.	Thank you.  You went a little bit fast, however, Mr. Witness, and in order for the Chamber to follow us closely, I want to bring you back a little bit.  I apologise for that.  When the bell fell, so the church is destroyed, my question was: what did the assailants do?  Did they remain where they were at the parish, or did they go away?  Please, can you tell us exactly what happened?
A.	After having demolished the bell, the attackers finished off the survivors with clubs, and they chanted slogans such as, "We have just exterminated them."  And, after those events, I went back home, so I left the assailants where they were. 
Q.	Thank you.  Before you went back home, I want to know when the bulldozer was destroying the church, what was the role of the inhabitants, as you've referred to them?  What were they doing, the ones standing around?
A.	When the bulldozer was demolishing the church, the inhabitants were aside and they were on the lookout for any possible survivors, and they were on the lookout to deal with anyone who may have wanted to escape. 
Q.	Witness, during the church's destruction, were you able to know whether Father Seromba was in the presbytery or not?
A.	He is right there.  Maybe he can answer that question.  But, as far as I know, I don't know whether he was in the presbytery or not.  He's here, he can explain that himself.  As far as I'm concerned, I didn't see him there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please tell us, if you are able to know, whether at the parish there were other clergy?  Did you hear anything said about such a possibility?
A.	I didn't hear anything about that. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you a more specific question.  Did you know at Nyange parish Father Kayiranga?
A.	Did you say Father Kayiranga?  I didn't know him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you hear mention made of Father Nturiye?
A.	On that day?
Q.	No, I'm not asking only about that day particularly.  I wanted to know whether --
A.	Nturiye was a native of Nyange and he was a priest, but I didn't see him on that day.  I know that he was from Gasave. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you hear mention made of Father Balthazar Habimana?
A.	I did not know him. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  During the 15th and 16th of April, as you were present in that location, were you able to know whether some Tutsis that you knew and who were living in your neighbourhood were killed at the parish and, if so, could you please give us their names?
A.	I spoke of some of those Tutsis.  There was one Gatare who was killed there.  Gatare was my teacher.  There was another Tutsi who was a trader at Nyange and there's the assistant bourgmestre I mentioned, but he was not a native of Nyange.  There were other Tutsis, including Damien and this Tutsi was from Nyange.  There were quite a number of others whose names I cannot recall. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Now, we want to know for further clarification whether, at that point in time, during the killings that were taking place in your native area, did those killings concern all Tutsis, or were there only some who were selected because of their social status?
A.	These killings were targeting all the Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, I now want to ask you the following.  You went back home after the bell fell.  Now, when you were leaving --
MR. MOSES:
We just haven't had any evidence of that fact, that he went back home after the bell fell.  That has been suggested, as I understand it, from my learned friend, but I don't recall there being evidence.  I stand corrected if there was. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
You are indeed mistaken, because you're not listening to what the witness is saying.  He explained that after the destruction of the bell, he went home, and that's what I want him to clarify, Mr. Prosecutor.  Yes, if you're not sure of your submissions or argument, please do not -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He did, indeed, talk about the destruction of the church, which started after he got there at 10 o'clock, and it went on until about 5, 5.30 in the afternoon.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, thank you very much.  May I proceed, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, proceed. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	So you go back to your home.  As you were leaving, in what condition was the compound of the church?
A.	The church had been destroyed, there were dead bodies, and there were the inhabitants who had launched the attack.  I left when the bulldozer had just completed the destruction of the church and it was moving some bricks, so I then decided to go home. 
Q.	Thank you.  I want you to take us back to a matter you raised earlier this morning.  You told us that some refugees had hidden in a Pentecostal church at Vungu; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 

Q.	Thank you.  Now, those refugees who were in Vungu, you also told us that they were being pursued by the assailants; is that correct?
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Very well.  Were they in fact killed?
A.	All those refugees were killed.  Furthermore, they were killed before the attack was launched at the parish on the 9th, and there were some Tutsi Christians who were praying within that church, and none of them survived.  All those refugees were killed.  The church is in the rural area.  It was circled and the attackers led the refugees to be drowned in a river, and the situation got worse.  People thought that it was necessary to drown the refugees in the river, and those who could no longer walk were killed. 
Q.	When you are saying that people were drowned in the river, what are you referring to; which river are you referring to?
A.	I'm referring to Nyabarongo River. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let's now come back to the Pentecostal temple, because if they are Pentecostals, it must be a temple.  Now, when these refugees were being killed, did anyone try to help them?
A.	No one tried to help them.  There was the pastor, and he was the only person who could have defended their interests, but this was someone who was not a native of that area.  He came from Gakere, so the assailants said to him that, if he tried to intervene, he would be killed, so he was unable to do anything, and so they took these people away. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, you should have before you a list of names and numbers indicated to the right of the paper -- piece of paper, and the numbers go from 1 to 5.  Since we must comply with the            Trial Chamber's direction regarding the protection of witnesses such as you, I'm not going to mention the names that you have before you; I am going to put questions to you while referring to the numbers next to the names.  Do we agree on that?  I understand that you said "Yes".  May I take it then that you said "Yes", because I didn't hear an answer from the booth?
A.	Yes, that's right.

1530H 
MR. MONTHÉ:
     Thank you, Interpreter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Actually, the witness just nodded and then the witness spoke; that is why the interpreters interpreted what he said. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President, I just wish this to be included in the record.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ: 
Q.	Witness, do you know the person indicated as Number 1? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Did you see the person during the events that you have recounted to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	He was not there because it was he who was responsible for collecting rewards that were to be granted to these people.  Actually, I might say that he was coordinator of these activities, the coordinator of this battle.  He was not at the scene.  He had other things to do.
Q.	So, in your view, this person was the coordinator of the assailants, was he? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like to ask you whether you know the person indicated as No. 2. 
A.	I know this man. 
Q.	Did you see him during the attacks that you have just described? 
A.	I am going to make a comment about this man.  This is someone who refused to be involved in the activities of that war.  And, in fact, he was punished for it.   He was dismissed from his duties.  When I was going back, on my way back, I saw him, and he was being criticised for refusing to give the equipment that was in his keeping.  So, I know this man, he is an innocent man in so far as these events are concerned.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, if you will, we shall move to the person indicated as No. 3.  What can you say about this person? 
A.	This man had been an inspector.  That is what I know about him.  I know nothing about him insofar as the war is concerned, but I would like to add that I do know the man. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, let us move to No. 4.  Did you know this person? 
A.	Yes, I know the person who is indicated as No. 4.  I know that at one time he was in charge of the drums.  He was a drum beater at the parish.  That's what I know about him. 
Q.	Now, No. 5, do you know this person? 
A.	No, I can't see who it is.  Really, I don't know this person. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I am done with the numbers.  I am going to ask you now whether you know the persons below or the following persons: Fulgence Kayishema, do you know this person or did you see this person during the events? 
A.	He was a judicial police inspector in the commune.  He was with the people whom I have already referred to.  He was always with them. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether this person had any connection, any ties with Father Seromba?  Did you see them together during the events at Nyange? 
A.	There were no ties between these two people.  He was always with his driver Gitiku and he was always moving about in his vehicle.  So, he had no contact or connection with Seromba. 
Q.	Thank you.  I shall now ask you about Gaspard Kanyarukiga.  Do you know him? 
A.	Yes, he is a native of Kivumu secteur. 
Q.	Did you see him during the events we are referring to? 
A.	He had a pharmacy in Nyange, and at that time I saw him, he was in front of the pharmacy which is in Nyange. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you said at great length that you saw Thélesphore Ndungutse, so I shall put the question to you. However, do you know Grégoire Ndahimana?  
A. 	He was head of the cellule of the commune.  In fact, he was the bourgmestre. 
Q. 	Did you see him during these events? 
A.	He was often in the company of Ndungutse, I saw him. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the next name is Aloys Rwamasirabo.  Do you know this name? 
A.	Yes, he was a trader.  And he was one of the people of whom it was thought that Seromba had hidden.
Q.	Did you see him during the events or not? 
A.	You referred to Rwamasirabo?  No, I did not see him.  I did not see him.  Actually, none else saw him because if they had seen him, then they would not have said that Father Seromba was hiding him. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, you were in Nyange on the 16 of April, you witnessed the destruction of the church.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether you feel that these events could have been prevented? 
A.	Thank you.  If I go by what I witnessed from the beginning to the end of these events, if the authorities of the area had wished to prevent the crimes from being committed, they would have succeeded. I will start with Ndungutse.  This is someone who urged the people to act, beginning with the policemen.  You have mentioned a good many figures of authority.  All these figures of authority were present and they were in company of security personnel such as policemen, the conseiller, and the judicial police inspector. These were the people who had some influence with the public.  Since they were present and since other louts about that I have mentioned were present, these included soldiers who had been dismissed from the army for indiscipline.  Since all of these people were present, I think that the authorities were in a position to warn off these assailants and prevent what occurred.  So, I think that if these authorities had so wished, they would have prevented these events.  No civilian shot through the church windows because the civilians did not have firearms.  If rocks were thrown into the church, it is because they saw people with firearms behind them.  I know that other people were molested because they refused to take part in these events.  I personally was molested for that reason. In short, since the people obeyed the orders of the authorities from the head of the cellule and down to the conseiller of the secteur and the bourgmestre, I think that these authorities were sufficiently powerful to prevent these events from taking place if they had so wished.  That is my position on that question.   
Q.	Thank you.  Do you think Father Seromba could have prevented the tragedy of Nyange? 
A.	What is a priest before a bourgmestre, his conseiller, and all these people with bearing arms, wearing arms, all these louts?  Do you think a priest has got an army, or a security force?  What influence can he have amongst the people?  He doesn't have a police force.  So I think, I do not think that he was able to prevent these events from occurring.  He was at the church.  He was at the parish that is his home if I may say so.  And people came to seek refuge in his home, but he was not able to protect them.  He did not have the means to do so.  We are talking about it well after the fact.  We are talking about this from a position of safety.  But when you think about it at the time, people had turned into animals.  They acted like beasts.  And if he had shown his face on the premises, he would have perished.  He could not have dared to suggest that such and such a thing be done. I think we should thank God instead that he survived these events.  I do not know what he could possibly have said in the commune that would have prevented these events from occurring. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like put another question to you.  We were told here all through these proceedings that in your country, Rwanda, priests enjoyed great respect.  At some point, I got the impression that they were practically venerated and that everything they asked people to do they did.  What do you think about that? 
A.	Yes, I grant you that priests are respected.  This is true in times of peace.  Do you think that one can respect a priest more than one respects a minister or a prime minister?  You know at the time things had changed.  People did not respect anything whatsoever.  There were bands of -- there were gangs of louts who lit down the way where they went and did as they wished.  Otherwise, in peace time priests enjoyed respects because they teach the unity of the people.  But in wartime, if they had had any respect, still for the priests, they would not have dared to destroy the church.  This edify which is used house of prayer.  So people didn't respect God any more.  At time, what more a priest.  
Q.	You told the Trial Chamber this morning that you married a Tutsi.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	I believe, in fact, I know that you left Rwanda after the events of 1994 and that you are now in exile. Can you tell the Trial Chamber why someone who had married Tutsis and was therefore on good terms who had married a Tutsis and was therefore in good terms with the Tutsis why such a person had to leave Rwanda? 
A.	Now, if we return to this matter, I will say this:  When the PRF army attacked, it did so from Byumba and they said that it was killing Hutus along the way.  So, the things became complicated when Hutus killed Tutsis in their turn which means that there was conflict between the two groups.  So when I fled, I fled because I was a Hutu and I bore in mind the fact that these people, who had been killed before had been killed because of their ethnic origin.  When I thought of that, I decided to flee independently of my wife's ethnic origin because she counted for nothing in the RPF.  She did not have a brother who had joined the RPF.  What could she have done to save me?  That is why I decided to flee.  And when I fled, I took her with me.  I fled with her. 
Q.	Do you know what became of your wife?  Is she still with you or did she leave? 
A.	My run of good luck that I had during the war did not continue.  When we got to Zaire, there were various sorts of people in the camp where we were. I did not have the means that I had had at my disposal before and there were Hutus, Hutu refugees in these camps and they included the Interahamwe which means there was great insecurity in the camp and from time to time people were abducted based on their ethnic origin.  So, I decided to take her to other people who were Rwandans, but who were living in Zaire.  So she stopped living in the camps.  There was a family of Tutsis who lived in Zaire that I gave her to them.  Afterwards, there were upheavals or unrest in the area and there was growing insecurity.  So, these this family decided to return to Rwanda and did so with my wife.  Later on, when I went to that place, I realised that these people had done to Rwanda and I have no further news of my wife since then.  This is the same for my family, my mother-in-law and my mother. 
Q.	Well, during our conversation, I didn't ask you whether you are a catholic.  Were you a catholic 1994? 
A.	Yes and I still am. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, two questions before I end our very interesting conversation.  From what you know about Father Seromba when in Nyange in 1994, did you hear or did you see, did you hear that he killed any refugees or caused any refugees to be killed, that is Tutsis at all? 
A.	Based on what I saw, Seromba is innocent.  I would add that during that time, anyone who was married to a Tutsi woman was in danger of losing his life.  Since I was there, and I was able to see the people who were active in these events, I would not have had the courage to come here before this 
	Trial Chamber to testify in defence of Seromba bearing in mind that that person is a priest.  If he had been involved in these events, I would not have been able to come before you as I have.  I am still a refugee.  I cannot come here to testify in defence of someone who was involved in these killings.  Actually, I was surprised to hear that he was being tried by this Court, whereas there are other people who are accountable and responsible for these events.  I am really surprised that he is being tried by this Court for this. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  For how long have you not seen Father Seromba? 
A.	The last time I saw him was when we were still in Rwanda.  Since then, today is the first time I am seeing him. 
Q.	Would you recognise Father Seromba if you saw him? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Look inside this Trial Chamber and see exactly whether Father Seromba is in this Trial Chamber and where exactly, he is, I mean exactly? 
A.	I can't-- I would delay, here he is.  He is next to you.  He is wearing glasses.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President may the record show that the witness did indeed recognise 
Father Athanase Seromba here in this courtroom next to me. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:  
Q.	And that is my last question for the witness.  Mr. Witness, you told us that you were a catholic and that you still are, did you tell the truth when you came here to Arusha?  Have you told the truth? 
A.	Yes, In the name of the Almighty God, I am telling the truth.  I have added nothing.  I had added nothing to make Father Seromba seem innocent.  God is my witness.  I have not said anything that is not the truth. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I have concluded the examination-in-chief of Witness of BZ14.  I would like to thank the Trial Chamber for its attention and I would like to thank the witness specially for agreeing to come here to come to give testimony.  I hand the witness back to the Trial Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

The Trial Chamber directs that it be indicated in the record that Witness BZ14 has recognised 
Father Seromba in the courtroom.  

Counsel, we wish to ask you regarding this document on which is indicated numbers next to names; we wanted to ask you whether you wished to tender this as an exhibit? 
MR. MONTHÉ.
Madam President, Your Honours, in view of our need - - decision not to use closed sessions to protect the witness's identity I decided to use this option.  I shall, therefore, ask you to enter this as 
Defence Exhibit D. 45, if I remember correctly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Prosecutor, do you have any objections?  No. I think it would weary if you place this document under the seal.  So this will be Exhibit D.  45 under unseal.
(Exhibit No. D. 45 admitted under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
At this time I shall ask the Prosecution whether he is ready for cross-examination of this witness. 
MR. MOSES: 
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  From the information at our disposal, there is no witness available here.  We are going to take a break now and see whether it is possible to bring in the next witness.  I think the next is -- Counsel 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I would like to suggest this to the Trial Chamber:  I do not wish it to be taken as shirking my duty.  The next witness on our list whom I saw yesterday is not in the best of health especially as this witness has a young child who is unwell.  As the Prosecutor is not prepared to conduct the cross-examination, I suggest that we resume tomorrow morning so that this witness will be in a position to give testimony.  That is what I wish to suggest because I think it is indispensable in respect of this witness, but this is suggestion, it is only a suggestion.  I am here to work, I just want to indicate that this witness has problems and you may refer to the WVSS to see whether my -- what I say is true.  So perhaps we will verify with the WVSS whether Witness BZ4 is available.  We shall not therefore hear BZ2 who has a few problems.    
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps we might start with BZ4 today, Mr. Monthé.  What do you think? 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, I put suggestions to the Trial Chamber.  For the truth to be known, we have to do things in the appropriate manner.  My personal view if, or my personal plans are that BZ2 should come and the cross-examination and I would do the cross-examination of BZ2 to myself and then my colleague will take over the other witness.  So what I suggest to the Trial Chamber is that we comply with what I suggest.  I do not have a habit of asking the Trial Chamber for much.  I am saying this because there a few problems with BZ2.  If you wish, you may proceed with BZ4.  It is your decision, but I see that the Prosecution is not responding.  So, if it happens that BZ4 is to give testimony, you will, but I suggest that we resume tomorrow with BZ2 because this is the most reasonable thing.  Perhaps the Prosecution will have time to consult his notes and that will be well for everyone. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Prosecutor, what do you think? 
MR. MOSES: 
We are ready for whichever witness is called now, Your Honours.  We don't need any delay.  There need not to be any delay.  So we give the decision -- so the decision as to whether we start now or tomorrow is in Your Honours' hands, we are ready if Your Honours order that we commence today with the next witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone, please, Madam.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, we do not know whether we quite understood what you said.  What you are saying, you are saying that you will cross-examine this witness tomorrow? 
MR. MOSES:  
It was my understanding and I may -- okay. My understanding was that Your Honours wanted to proceed with BZ2, and the counsel indicated that BZ2 may have an issue.   Your Honours then said what about BZ4, and to which my understanding was that counsel had said now he wanted to start tomorrow.  And then my understanding then was that you then asked me what the Prosecution attitude was and I indicated that we were happy with either of those witnesses to commence this afternoon, if that was Your Honours' decision.  So, we don't mind whether Your Honours orders BZ2 or BZ4 and whether that is to be this afternoon or tomorrow is in Your Honours' hands, but we are happy for it to be this afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, yes, it is clear to us that we are referring to examination-in-chief and not cross-examination as we had heard a while ago. Very well.

Witness, thank you.  Your cross-examination will take place later.  You will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  We ask WVSS to take back the witness and find out whether Witness BZ4 is available as quickly as possible so that if possible the witness can be brought during the break.  I think we could resume at 4:30; is that all right?
MR. MONTHÉ:  
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Yes, we are going to take a break.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. MOSES:   
--I that it's important, Your Honours, if both the witness and WVSS are reminded that now he has completed his evidence-in-chief, he is not to discuss his evidence with anyone and WVSS, as I understand it normally take actions so that they can be assisted with that order. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is correct.  We didn't see this because we thought it was self-evident.  When witnesses are going to give evidence, they can no longer have any contact with anyone here. So they must communicate with other people and they must remember that they are still under solemn declaration.

Yes, Mr. Monthé, did you wish to say something? 
MR. MONTHÉ:  
No, well, I just wanted to say that it was self-evident and I don't know why there is any talk about it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. We are agreeing.  We will take a break now. If we have a witness by 4:30, then we will start with the examination-in-chief of Witness BZ4.

Court is adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1610H)
(Pages 32 to 39 by Petrus Chijarira)

































(Court resumed at 1645H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good morning, Witness, or good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected Defence witness, so, for the purposes of these proceedings, you will be referred to as Witness BZ4.  You will be examined by the Defence and then cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  If necessary, the Bench will put questions to you.  There may be a re-examination by the Defence after all this. 

Before you answer the questions, we are going to ask you to make a solemn declaration, and registry will assist you to do so.  
(Declaration made by Witness BZ4 in French) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel has the floor for examination in-chief of Witness BZ4.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, can the registry be requested to approach the Defence Bench, please?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please approach Mr. Monthé. 

Counsel, we have received the details of the personal particulars of Witness BZ4 and the witness has a copy before him. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I give the registry a copy for the witness and I think that the witness does, yes, have a copy before him.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I shall proceed as indicated with the examination in-chief of Witness -- Defence Witness BZ4.  
WITNESS BZ4,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	You know that you are here to give testimony as a protected witness.  Consequently, I shall put questions to you in a manner calculated to avoid revealing your identity.  I shall therefore request you to answer the questions in detail, but avoid any details or information that might reveal your identity.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I have understood. 
Q.	Thank you.  BZ4, you should have before you a list containing your personal particulars.  Do you have a piece of paper of that description before you?  Well, since you do, please look at it carefully and tell the Trial Chamber whether the information contained therein is correct.  If such information is correct, please sign the piece of paper when you will have finished reading it.  
A.	Yes, all the information contained on the piece of paper is correct. 
Q.	Be so kind as to sign it and return it to the Registry.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I think the witness has signed his personal particulars, and since the information has been verified, I shall ask the Tribunal Chamber to enter it as a Defence exhibit under number D. 46.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  No objection on the part of the Prosecution, so the personal particulars of Witness BZ4 are entered as Defence exhibit D. 46 under seal.

(Exhibit No. D. 46 admitted, under seal)

Please proceed, Counsel. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
For the examination in-chief, Madam President, I shall ask you to request that the registry approach the Defence Counsel to collect a list of names which will be used in the examination in a little while. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, may I suggest that, in regard to the names -- to place names and the names of people who are mentioned by your witnesses, may I suggest that you provide us with a list so that, instead of penning them out, each person could have a copy. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
(Microphone not activated)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Microphone please, Counsel. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, you should have before you a list of names and, next to the names, their numbers.  Do you have that piece of paper before you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Very well.  I am going to start what is called here an examination in-chief.  My first question is:   Can you tell this Court where you were in April 1994?  If you were in Rwanda, where were you? 
A.	In April I was in Rwanda in Kivumu commune in Ngobagoba secteur and in Gaseke cellule. 
Q.	In April 1994, did you experience anything or did you witness any event in your secteur?  If you did, what event is that? 
A.	The exceptional event that occurred in April 1994 was the death of President Habyarimana after the crash of his aircraft when he was returning home from abroad. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, but when you say "the plane crashed", what do you mean? 
A.	I'd say that there was a war between the rebels and the Rwandan army at the time.  President Habyarimana had traveled abroad and, when he was returning to his country in the company of the president of Burundi, his aircraft was shot down.  That is how he died.  His aircraft was shot down by the rebels. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Witness, how did you hear that the president's aircraft had been shot down, and on what day did you hear this? 
A.	I heard that the president's aircraft had been shot down in the early hours of the 7th of April on Radio France International, RFI. 
Q.	When you heard of the assassination of the president of the republic, were you in your cellule?  
A.	I was in my cellule in the cellule where I lived, and of which I am a native, actually. 
Q.	Thank you.  So when you heard the news, what did you do, do you remember? 
A.	When I heard the news, it was still very early, but later in the morning I tried to contact all the people to find out what had actually happened, and we tried to think about -- to imagine what would happen -- what would happen after that. 
Q.	You say that you tried to contact all the people.  Were these people near your home or elsewhere? 
A.	They were my neighbours, my closest neighbours. 
Q.	So you and your neighbours began to talk about the president's death.  What were your neighbours saying? 
A.	Most of my neighbours were saying that the president's aircraft had been shot down allegedly by the RPF.  But other people were worried about what would follow.  I should say here that most of my neighbours said that the RPF was mostly composed of people of Tutsi origin. 
Q.	You have just said that people were mostly concerned about what would follow.  What do you mean by that?  Could you explain to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	By that I mean, and I have already said that -- that since people were saying that the RPF was made up of people of ethnic origin, and that they were responsible for the -- for shooting down the aircraft of President Habyarimana, what would follow automatically was that Tutsis would be hunted. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you have these discussions only with your neighbours, or were they extended to your commune generally? 
A.	I'm telling you what I saw or what I observed when I was chatting with my neighbours, but I think that generally in the commune people were talking -- must have been talking about this extraordinary event.  
Q.	Thank you.  After that, what happened in your area?  Were there events that occurred? 
A.	In my area there were exceptional events, because after the death of President Habyarimana, we thought -- while we thought that Tutsis would be hunted down, they too were convinced of the same.  That is why they began to leave their homes, to go and hide in the homes of friends or elsewhere.  I was living on the border between Kibuye and Gitarama préfectures.  Most of the Tutsis began to cross the river, which was the border, to take refuge in Gitarama préfecture.  So there was a general migration of the Tutsis because they knew that they were under threat. 
Q.	To clarify our examination-in-chief, would you please tell the Trial Chamber what river you refer to when you say "the river"?
A.	I'm referring to Nyabarongo river.  This is a big river between the Gitarama and Kibuye préfectures. 
Q.	Thank you.  What you have just described to the Trial Chamber, this migration, do you remember on what day it occurred?  You said that this was after the president died.  Do you have any idea as to the date, however, on which it occurred? 
A.	It was a very long time ago and I cannot be specific about the dates, but the death took place on the night of the 6th of April, and I believe that already on the 7th and the 8th people were on their own hills, but they were afraid.  As from the 9th of April, they started to collect their belongings to go and seek shelter elsewhere. 
Q.	Thank you for your answer.  When you say "they started to collect their belongings" and to see where they were going to seek refuge, had they already been attacked on the 9th of April? 
A.	No.  There had not been any significant attacks as yet, but there had been attackers or cattle thieves; people who were stealing crops, and they would go into people's houses or would take advantage of the night in order to steal. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BZ4.  Now, let's come to the 9th of April, because that's the day which is of interest to us right now.  You stated that the Tutsis were leaving their homes to go and seek refuge in the homes of their friends elsewhere, is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  They were leaving their homes in order to go and hide in the homes of friends, or in the bushes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.  Apart from the fact that some ne'er-do-wells came to steal their cattle, did you see whether the Tutsis were the object of some acts of violence? 
A.	Yes.  I saw those acts being committed, myself.  For example, there was my neighbour who was killed, and his property was stolen.  They threw his body near the road.  That means that the violence had already begun. 
Q.	Please tell us and, for the benefit of the Judges, please tell us what was your neighbour's name.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That question may reveal the identity of the witness, Counsel.  Counsel, I think that as long as the name has not been mentioned, please avoid that this name is mentioned.  But if this name had been mentioned and is on the record, it should be struck from the record.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the witness had not answered the question, so there is no name appearing on the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your neighbour was killed by the attackers and this was still on the 9th of April, is that correct? 
A.	I cannot be very specific about the date.  All I can say is that he was one of the first victims to be killed after the death of President Habyarimana.  In any fact -- in any way, he died around the 9th. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you ever get to know why the neighbour was the first victim?  Was there any particular reason for that? 
A.	I'm trying to refer to my own native cellule.  I do not know what happened in other neighbourhoods and with whom they began their killings. 
Q.	My question is as follows:   I was asking the witness whether, in his cellule, whether it was indeed that neighbour who was the first victim, and if he was able to know why he was the first victim.  
A.	Yes, I know why the attackers started off with this person. 
Q.	Can you tell us, then, what were those reasons? 
A.	The attackers killed him first because he was a Tutsi, and people were saying that he was a sorcerer, that he was using poison to kill people.  Furthermore, it was said that his eldest son was with the ranks of the RPF in Uganda. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When that neighbour was killed by the attackers, what happened to his body? 
A.	After he was killed, his body was thrown close to the Gitarama-Kibuye road near our home, and this was a place which was near the Gaseke centre where there was a bus stop, and everyone was able to see his body. 
Q.	Thank you.  According to you, did the body remain there for a long time or was it removed? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you for how many days the body remained in that place.  All I know is that the body remained there for several days. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  After the death of your neighbour, what happened?  Did the violence increase in your area or not? 
A.	Yes.  As days went on, the acts of violence increased.  That person was killed, and we were used to the fact that, when someone was killed, the perpetrators of the crime were brought to book.  But in the case of this individual, his body was placed by the roadside and no one wanted to make an enquiry as to why this man suffered that fate.  So this event encouraged criminals who did reprehensible acts; in other words, they went and stole foodstuff and they killed other people's cows. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, this neighbour of yours was killed under the circumstances you have told us about.  What happened afterwards?  Did we see the atmosphere in your locality changing or not? 
A.	Yes, the atmosphere changed because many Tutsis -- Tutsi households were attacked throughout the secteur.  Tutsi houses were attacked and their belongings were looted, and this is because the Tutsis had left their homes, and they had gone to seek refuge in the bushes or elsewhere, as I had said earlier. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Now, these Tutsis, did they remain hidden for a long time in the bushes or in the homes of their friends? 
A.	What followed is that the criminals pursued them into the bushes and, when the Tutsis realised that this was happening, apart from those who had sought refuge in Gitarama, others went to seek refuge at the parish.  So Tutsis sought refuge, or tried to seek refuge, at the parish, as well as the commune office. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  When you say that they went to seek refuge at the parish, which parish are you referring to? 
A.	We only had one Catholic parish; in other words, the Nyange parish. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  Were you living close by that parish, and did you go to that church? 
A.	I was baptised in that parish.  I was confirmed at that parish and that's where I received communion, and I would go to mass every Sunday.  It wasn't far from my home because we could go there on foot, and we were able to know what was happening there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Since you regularly went to mass at that parish, can you please tell the Chamber who, during that period of time, April 1994, was the priest at the Nyange parish? 
A.	Earlier there was Father Stratton, who was the priest, but during these events he was no longer at the parish.  He had been replaced by another priest, namely, Father Seromba. 
Q.	When you saw the parish, and during that period of time, did you ever have the opportunity to meet Father Seromba? 
A.	I didn't meet him when he arrived, but when I went to attend mass, I would see him, or when I attended other activities which were taking place at the parish. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please tell the Chamber under what circumstances the refugees came to the parish.  Do you remember? 
A.	I'm going to try and tell you about the events which I witnessed myself; in other words, events that occurred in places that I went.  There were refugees who came to the parish on board a vehicle.  Others were hiding in the bushes and would continue on their way on the road until they reached the parish.  At one point in time there were many people at the parish who had come from various places. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, these refugees who came to the parish, did you ever get to know whether they were going there of their own accord, or had they been compelled to go there? 
A.	The refugees were not forced to go to the parish.  They went there because they thought that they would enjoy security and safety at the parish, given the events which had taken place in our country, Rwanda.  The refugees who had gone to such places, had enjoyed safety and security, so these refugees were thinking in like manner.  They said to themselves, "If we go to the parish, we shall be safe, and no one will attack us."  So that was the theory that motivated them to go there. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you saw those refugees go to the parish, can you tell us approximately when it was that they went there?  On what date?  You said that you do not remember dates very well, but I would like you to tell us approximately when the refugees went to the parish.  
A.	From what I observed, namely, from the 12th, there were no longer any refugees in the bushes or in their homes or close by their homes.  In other words, most people had come to the parish, and I must say that after the 12th, and maybe the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th, there were many refugees at the parish.  In other words, there were many refugees as from the 12th until about the 14th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you have any opportunity around the 12th to go to the parish? 
A.	I didn't go to the parish on the 12th. 
Q.	When did you go there? 
A.	I went to the parish on the day when we heard that criminals were no longer finding anyone in their houses or in the bushes, and that they were pursuing them right up to the parish.  So it was around that date that we heard of the attacks at the parish against the Tutsis who had sought refuge there.  You will therefore understand that, given that we had acquaintances at the parish, we went to go and see how the authorities were going to save the refugees who were at the parish.  I, myself, went to Nyange centre in order to assess the situation and see how it was going to develop. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you ever get to know at that particular moment whether, if the refugees reached the church, they were welcomed by Father Seromba? 
A.	At any rate, it was Father Seromba who was in charge of that parish.  The refugees were able to settle down in the church, and I know very well that it was Father Seromba who had the keys to the church.  If he did not welcome them, the refugees would not have entered the church.  Moreover, Father Seromba called for people to come to the assistance of these refugees, especially in respect of food and drink. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When you say that Father Seromba called for people to help these refugees, are you telling us about what you, yourself, heard, or was it something that was reported to you? 
A.	Where we lived was -- had 85 percent Catholics, and wherever I was, I would have been able to know what Seromba said or did.  In the space of five minutes, I would have known what Father Seromba did or said.  So we knew that Father Seromba had called on the people to come to the assistance of the refugees at the parish.  Furthermore, most of these refugees were Catholics. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When he made that appeal, did you get to know whether the faithful of the parish responded favourably to the call? 
A.	A few Christians, whose names I wouldn't be able to mention now, responded favourably to that call, but that did not continue because the situation changed in the country.  There was war and there was shooting.  There were people who were fleeing and people gave different versions of the situation prevailing in the country, and there was this selfish attitude.  People wanted to keep their property for themselves.  Maybe if it was during peace times, people would have responded more -- in larger numbers to the appeal made by the priest. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Since you were well informed of the events that took place there, would you have been aware whether Father Seromba mistreated the refugees who were in the church? 
A.	I am not aware of anything of the sort.  I never heard people say that Seromba mistreated the refugees.  Moreover, I never heard people say that Father Seromba allegedly mistreated any refugee. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, so we have the refugees in the church, and what happens next?  Until what period of time -- until what day will they be arriving at the church?  Can you remember the date up to which they were still coming to the church? 
A.	I'm going to tell you about the events, but please do not dwell too much on the dates because I'm not very sure that I will be exact.  

As I have said, on the 12th, the refugees came to the church and the criminals, who wanted to kill the Tutsis, sought them out from the bushes.  And since they did not find them there, they joined them at the parish around the 14th.  I told you that there was an attack which was launched on the parish, so the attackers wanted to attack the church by throwing stones, using sticks, and the refugees tried to defend themselves.  So they came out of the church to try and face up to the attackers.  During that confrontation they went down to Nyange centre.  The church overlooks the centre in question.  In the meantime, someone went onto the roof of a building and threw a grenade into the crowd of refugees.  Some of them fell down and others went back to the church. 

During that disarray, the killers, who were armed with spears, machetes, and clubs, attacked those refugees, and those who were caught were killed.  The refugees who managed to get back into the church locked up the church doors, and they took the church pews in order to strengthen the barricade, and that was the first attack which brought about the deaths of many people. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  I would like to ask you whether you knew where these assailants, to use your expression, came from.  Were they civilians?  Were they policemen?  Were they gendarmes?  Did they come from the commune around Nyange or did they come from elsewhere? 
A.	I was not far from the scene of the events at the time.  When the war broke out in Kigali, our region had many young people.  Our region was somewhat backwards in terms of development, so many young people had left for Kigali to find opportunities for improving their lives.  When the war broke out, and since they had not found what they had gone to seek in Kigali, they returned and they began to loot and pillage in our region.  It is many of these people who took part in the attacks.  It is they who confirmed that it was because of the RPF Inyenzi-Inkotanyi that they had fled the town.  So they said that they would kill sympathisers of the RPF.  Many young people were involved. 

There were also communes that bordered Gisenyi préfecture, bordered our commune, which is in Gisenyi préfecture, and it is said that there were not many Tutsis in Gisenyi préfecture.  So the young people of that commune were -- did not find anything to loot.  So they came en masse.  They came from Kibilira, Cyambogo, and along that route there was an armed crowd that was coming towards -- else while they were singing.   It is these people that came en masse to Nyange church, to Nyange centre, and it is these same people who hit and molested the refugees.  So I do not know these people who committed these criminal acts. 
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Tribunal Chamber whether these people, whom you have described, had any connection whatsoever with Father Seromba? 
A.	I say that these people did not live in Nyange.  They did not know Father Seromba.  They could not have any links whatsoever with him.  In my view, these people were bestial.  They were like animals.  You couldn't ask them to stop.  You couldn't tell them to stop using their sticks.  When we came to see what was going on, we were careful to stand apart from them.  If those people found you, and you were a man, especially, they would force you to do what they, themselves, were doing.  And if you refused, you would suffer the same fate as the persecuted Tutsis.  That is why we were supposed to stay apart from them.  That is how things were. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When these assailants came from their different areas of origin to the parish, do you know whether there were any gendarmes or communal policemen at the parish? 
A.	There were no policemen at the parish, but there were gendarmes who had been posted there, but I do not know under what circumstances the gendarmes were posted at that place.  In Rwanda we know that generally the gendarmerie was in charge of security in the country.  So when people saw them there, they thought that they had come to protect the people who had come to seek refuge there. 
Q.	Thank you.  When these assailants were flocking to the parish, did you see Father Seromba with these people at that time? 
A.	No.  No, I never saw him with these people. 
Q.	Thank you.  You described to us a while ago the fact that, after the first attack, refugees were killed, and others went to barricade themselves in the church.  They locked the doors behind them, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, quite so.  They went into the church.  They barricaded the church doors using the pews. 
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  Can you tell the Court if, when they locked these doors, they did so on their own initiative, or they had received instructions from someone when they were barricading themselves into the church? 
A.	The refugees fell back when they realised the losses that they had suffered.  When they were locking the doors, they thought that they had to lock the doors of the church and barricade them with these pews.  I think they did so on their own initiative. 
Q.	Did you find out, or did you see whether, when the assailants were attacking the Tutsis, they attacked all Tutsis indiscriminately, or just some of them? 
A.	All the Tutsis were targeted.  There was no particular group of Tutsis that were targeted.  If a Tutsi was found, he was killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, after they barricaded themselves in the church on their own initiative, what happened?  If you know, tell us.  I'm referring to the time after the first attack that you described a while ago. 
A.	I told you about the first attack, so then they fell back to the church, the killers didn't leave though.  Actually, they spent the night there standing guard around the church.  What I know happened -- what I know is that -- what I know happened at night, although I was not there, was that grenades were thrown because they were trying to break up the church wall.  They tried to do so by using grenades, but it was in vain.  They were not able to get at the people who were inside the church.  So the following day someone had idea (sic) that the people -- the bodies of the people, who had been killed the day before, should be buried first.  It was suggested that a bulldozer be used to bury these bodies.  Afterwards, the killers also conceived the idea of using the bulldozer to destroy the church. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But let's first finish with this day that you were referring to and the events of that day, that is, the actions of the killers of the refugees.  You said that there were gendarmes in the parish.  What were they doing there?  Were they armed?  Were they there to protect public order? 
A.	I think the gendarmes came to protect people, but in view of the situation in the country, I can only say that the gendarmes could not face up to these assailants.  And considering the location of the church, there is a main road between Gitarama and Kibuye.  There was a military camp in Kibuye.  On this road there were always vehicle carrying soldiers.  Often when the soldiers drove by, they would stop for refreshment there, and most of the time, when they went -- when they went past there, these soldiers would encourage the killers.  They said, "Kill these people.  If we were in this state of affairs, it is because of these people.  These are the people who killed the head of state."  So I think that no one could stand up to these killers.  This means that the gendarmes who were present decided to remain neutral.  No one could give orders to these killers.

1545H
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell this Chamber whether during these events you saw any roadblocks, or you heard of any roadblocks in the area? 
A.	Yes, there were roadblocks that had been put up in our area.  There was a roadblock in Cyambogo; there was another in Gaseke; and there was one in Nyange. 
Q.	Thank you.  For the benefit of the Trial Chamber, can you tell us, if you know, what these roadblocks were used for? 
A.	Roadblocks had been put up to check passers-by.  If you went passed a roadblock, you would be asked to show your identity cards.  Identity cards showed ethnic origin, whether one was Hutus or Tutsi.  If someone, a passer-by, was suspected, he was asked to show his identity card. 
Q.	Thank you.  You said that the assailants, to use your term, "came from various places. "  If you know, could you tell the Trial Chamber approximately how many there were?  If you do not know, obviously, you shouldn't answer. 
A.	I really couldn't give you a figure.  I know that there were many of them, but I really couldn't give you any figure whatsoever. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You would say that there were more than Tutsi refugees, wouldn't you? 
A.	Yes, yes, there were very many. 
Q.	Thank you.  So, these assailants who you saw going to the parish, were they led by                        someone -- someone who was organising their attacks, I would say?  Did you see anyone who was acting as their leader? 
A.	At that time I was an adult, and nobody was leading them.  I never saw anyone -- anyone draw the report of people who were killed.  People would meet somewhere, and when they realised that there were Tutsis in the church, well, then they would attack the church.  If someone had come from his home with a grenade, or a machete, or even a rock, he would use that as his weapon in the attack.  This means that there was no prior organisation as such.  Everyone acted according to the dictates of his conscience. 
Q.	Were you able to find out whether at the time of those events there were clergy at the parish? 
A.	What I know is that there were priests and clergymen at the parish, but they were not outside.  This did not mean that they were outside and that they could be seen.  You see, there was the church and then a little off to the side, off behind, there was the priests' house.  I can say they may have been in the buildings, but no one came out.  There was a building where there were Tutsi.  Not far from there you had the assailants.  It was like a battlefield.  Nobody could dare to go out during the events.  I saw no priests or anyone who was at the parish come out during those events. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  If I gave you some names of clergy, members of the clergy, would you be able to tell whether you know them or not? 
A.	Yes, if I know someone I will tell you.  But if I don't know anyone -- if I don't know anyone, I will tell you. 
Q.	Thank you.  I was going to ask you whether you have heard about Father Jean François Emmanuel Kayiranga? 
A.	Yes, I have heard about this priest.  He lived in that parish for some time. 
Q.	At the time of the events that we are talking about, that is, the 12th -- between the 12th and the        14th of April, were you able to find out whether Father Kayiranga was at the priests' residence? 
A.	No, I was not able to find that out. 
Q.	Do you know Father Edward Nturiye? 
A.	Father Edward Nturiye I know.  I know him.  He also stayed in that parish for a while, but at the time of the events he had already left that parish and was living in Nyundo. 
Q.	Now, I will ask you whether you know father Balthazar Habyarimana? 
A.	No, I don't know that one. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let us return to the situation you described earlier on.  You have the refugees inside of the church.  You are under threat; you, the public, the assailants are there.  So what happened when the refugees were barricaded in the church and were surrounded; what happened? 
A.	What happened was that these people tried to kill refugees.  The refugees who were inside could do almost nothing.  The assailants were trying to get at the refugees.  They threw grenades in an attempt to burn down the church, but they did not succeed. 
Q.	Was there any reaction then from the refugees in response to the assailants?  Did you see the refugees do anything? 
A.	No, the refugees who were inside of the church couldn't do anything, so they did nothing. 
Q.	Now, I will ask you whether you remember any Tutsis of your area who were known to you who might have been killed at the parish?  Do you have the names of some of these victims?  If you do, of course, be so kind as to tell us.
A.	I can remember someone who taught me in primary school this person is Anicet Gatare, a teacher; even his wife taught me at some point in primary school, and his children were my friends.  This is one of the people who fell at the parish.  There are others, but I don't remember their names. 
Q.	So let's talk about Anicet Gatare.  Did you find out how he died?  Were you present when it occurred, or were the facts related to you? 
A.	When Gatare died, he died of a gunshot.  He was shot by a gendarme at his request, because he did not want to be killed with a machete.  He did not want to die a horrible death.  So he asked a gendarme to shoot him before the criminals got to where he was. 
Q.	Now, still with Anicet Gatare, I would like to ask you whether you remember whether Father Seromba had a hand in the death of Anicet Gatare, in any way possible. 
A.	Father Seromba played no role in the killing of Anicet Gatare. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I would like us to talk about what happened after the refugees barricaded themselves inside of the church, surrounded by their assailants, as you said.  Were you still present or had you left? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you conclude with this question please, because we -- we will have to adjourn. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, would you please ask the question again for my benefit?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I shall put the question to you tomorrow morning.  

Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief for this afternoon.  Of course, I thank the Trial Chamber and I thank the witness.  And I hope he will be here tomorrow morning to continue this examination-in-chief.  Madam President, I hand the witness back to the Trial Chamber.

Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We shall adjourn today.  We shall resume tomorrow at 8:45 with this same witness.  Perhaps we might have BZ2 come in for tomorrow as well. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, for the benefit of my team work and for the rest of my work, might I be told when the Prosecutor will start working.  We need to know.  It is very difficult for us to work in such conditions.  We would like to clarify this; otherwise, I in my turn will have to do as they have done. 
(Pages 50 to 52 by Donna M. Lewis)
















1800H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, have you disclosed the witness statements to them?  
MR MONTHÉ:
They received part of the statements today.  They are going to receive others, but I'm yet to receive anything from them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have been very clear on the matter.  You were told to disclose these witness statements immediately.  If these witness statements had been disclosed immediately, if you had respected the Trial Chamber's order, we would not be in this situation.  We are granting the Prosecutor this time, because he did not receive the witness statements as planned.  

The Trial Chamber has already made another order to confirm what it had already said before.  As we have said, we are going to follow the order of appearance of witnesses as you gave it to us.  For the time being, we have Witness BZ4 here.  We shall continue with that witness tomorrow.  We ask WVSS to bring BZ2.  If this witness is able to appear tomorrow, then the witness will.  Otherwise, we shall move on to Witness BZ5.  Of course, we expect the Prosecutor to cross-examine these witnesses and we are asking the Prosecution to tell us, as soon as possible, when they will be able to cross-examine the witnesses who have already undergone examination-in-chief by the Defence.

I think that these few days -- this holiday, which is upcoming, that is, the Idd-el-Fitri feast -- will enable us to clear up a few matters, and we will then be able to proceed normally after this holiday.  But all witness statements, all statements of witnesses who are to give evidence must be given to the Prosecution.

Witness, thank you.  We would like to remind you that you are still under solemn declaration.  You may not discuss what was said in this Trial Chamber with anyone.  We shall continue your examination-in-chief tomorrow with the Defence.  Have a good evening, and see you tomorrow.  Thank you everyone.  The court is adjourned.
