MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Registry, could you please call the matter on the roll for this morning, please. 
MR. FRY:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam is now sitting in open session today, 19 January 2005, for the resumption of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Seromba, Case Number ICTR-2001-66-T.

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you, registry. 

We now wish to turn to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Madam, could you please introduce yourself. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  On behalf of the Prosecutor, myself, Silvana Arbia, senior trial attorney, Jonathan Moses, senior trial attorney, Gregory Townsend, trial attorney, Althea Alexis, trial attorney, assisted by Tolulope Olowoye, case manager.  Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

We now go to the Defence.  Counsel Pognon, please. 
MR. POGNON:
I am Mr. Pognon, counsel for Seromba.  Mr. Patrice Monthé, co-counsel for Seromba, and Ms. Sylviane Glodjinon, our assistant. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Pognon.  

We are resuming this morning the Seromba trial. 

Madam Prosecutor, you had a few witnesses you were to call before this Chamber.  Could you please tell us who is the witness you wish to call this morning.  If there are any problems we could consider them before ushering in the witness. 
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  According to our written submissions, our next witness will be Witness CDL.  The Prosecution has three witnesses remaining, and the first of these three witnesses is, as I've said, CDL.  He's ready to testify.  We do not have any other matters on behalf of the Prosecutor to submit to the Chamber except maybe issues pertaining to motions which are still pending, but this is not really a matter of discussion at this point in time and, therefore, I believe that we are ready to have the witness called to the bar.  Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

There is, indeed, one motion on judicial notice and we are awaiting for the submissions from the parties so that we can make our rulings.  We have received two other motions to which the Prosecution have not provided a response because these have just been filed.  Are there any issues from the Defence side?  I see none.  Very well, thank you.  

Can you kindly usher in Witness CDL.

Good morning, Witness.  You are a protected Prosecution witness and we are now going to ask you -- we are going to ask you to take your solemn declaration and then you will be examined by the Prosecution.  A member of the Prosecution team will examine you, and then will be cross-examined by a member of the Defence team.  We request that you answer precisely and concisely to the questions put to you.  Your pseudonym is CDL.  Yes, do you have a problem, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem.  I do not understand the Kinyarwanda very well.  I cannot hear what is being said.  The message I am receiving is not in Kinyarwanda so I have a technical problem here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Do you want to follow the proceedings in Kinyarwanda or in French?  Which is your preference?
THE WITNESS:
In Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Can the technician come to our assistance, please, because apparently the witness is not receiving the interpretation of the proceedings in Kinyarwanda.  The witness can now hear the proceedings.  

Counsel, you may now proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are Witness CDL.  When responding to questions, please avoid providing information which may reveal your identity.  If a question is put to you which you believe might reveal your identity, please indicate to the Chamber and we will see what to do.  Right now you are going to take your solemn declaration, please. 
(Declaration made by Witness CDL in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may examine the witness. 
MS. ARBIA:
Madam President, the examination-in-chief of this witness will be taken by my colleague, Althea Alexis.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Alexis, you have the floor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours. 

Might a member of the registry please assist me with the PIS.
WITNESS CDL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:  
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might the translator from the Kinyarwanda booth be permitted to proceed to where the witness is to assist him? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can one of the interpreters from the Kinyarwanda booth please go to the witness to help him out.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, Witness, you have --
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the Defence wishes to know the reasons for this particular method of proceeding.  We do not why things are happening in this manner.  We wish to know.  We wish to be informed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, this is a normal practice.  When the witness should not say out loud what is on the identification sheet, the interpreter helps the witness to understand, and then the witness can then say whether the information was correct. 
MR. POGNON:
We were not aware that this was the normal proceeding. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thought that this was the usual procedure.  We thought that everybody was aware and that is why it is being done this way.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has confirmed the information pertaining to his identity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness, and we also thank the interpreter for his assistance.

Madam Alexis, please proceed.
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness CDL, the contents of the document before you, you have confirmed.
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I've just confirmed that information.
Q.	And your signature is on that document as confirming that the contents thereof are true and correct?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, it is normal that this document is circulated so we can see it.  We do not have it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you not have the information sheet concerning the witness?
MR. POGNON:
No, we do not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you kindly give this document to Mr. Pognon, please, Mr. Registry. 

Mr. Pognon, have you seen the information contained on this identification sheet?  I think this is in line with the information we already have in our possession which went together with the witness statements. 
MR. POGNON:
Yes, I do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Very well, Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President.  Madam President, with leave of the Court, if my friends on the other side have no objection, might this document which contains the personal information of the Witness CDL be entered into court as Prosecution Exhibit Number 19 and sealed please, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections, Mr. Pognon?
MR. POGNON:
None.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber is admitting as Prosecution witness -- Prosecution Exhibit P. 19 the I.D. sheet, the identification sheet of Witness CDL.  This document shall remain under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 19 admitted, under seal)
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged.  Madam President, later on in the proceedings I will be asking for a short closed session, but I will begin in open session.  Madam President, with your leave. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness CDL, do you recall the death of the president of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, I do remember the date of the death of the president.  I learned of that.
Q.	And when did you learn of it?  What date did you learn of the death of the president?
A.	I got to know of his death on the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	After the death of the president, Mr. Witness, can you describe to us the security situation in your commune, without saying what is your commune?
A.	Are you saying that I should mention the name of the commune, Madam Prosecutor?
Q.	No, Mr. Witness, that is exactly what I said you must not do.  Let me ask the question again: Can you describe the security situation in your area?  I am merely reminding you not to give information which would reveal your identity.
A.	Thank you.  From the date of the 7th of when everyone had become aware of the death of the president, the security situation began to deteriorate in our commune.  Indeed that evening, the evening of that day, people began to die.  And there was a man who was saying that since the head of state was dead it was necessary to avenge his death.  That man was saying that those who had killed the president were members of the RPF and, basically, these were persons who belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.  May I proceed? 
Q.	Let me ask you another question, Witness: The persons who were being attacked you said belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.  What was the ethnicity of the attackers?
A.	Actually, the person who was saying all of this was the vice-chairman of the MRND party, and he was the one who was saying that the head of state had been killed by the Tutsis, so he was a Hutu and he was a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, can you tell us the attackers -- what was the ethnicity of those who were attacking the Tutsis?
A.	Indeed, the person I am referring to who began the killings belonged to the Hutu ethnic group.  He was telling the Hutus that they needed to attack the Tutsis because the latter had killed the head of state.
Q.	Witness, can you give us some of the names of the persons who were killed in that period of time right after the death of the president?
A.	In the night of the 7th to the 8th, an attack was launched against a cellule on the family of Ndakubana, and two children were killed, three others were wounded.  The wounded were taken to the dispensary.  They -- there was quite a significant amount of destruction of property.  In the night of the 8th to the 9th, in another neighbouring secteur, an old man named Thomas was killed.  The same night in another secteur, the one neighbouring the one I had referred to earlier, other attacks were launched, cattle were killed in the home of a Tutsi.  In the night of the 9th to the 10th, at Nyange centre, a businessman was killed there, a Tutsi businessman was killed by his colleagues.  The trader in question was killed during the day.  And in the night of that same day an agricultural monitor named Martin was killed.  Briefly, those were the initial killings which were perpetrated in our commune. 
Q.	Witness, what was the ethnicity of the Ndakubana family?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel please repeat that question because of the relay mechanism we interpreters have to use.
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well.
THE WITNESS:
The Ndakubana family was of the Tutsi ethnic group.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That was the answer from the witness.  The question was not interpreted because of the technicalities.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	And Thomas -- Witness, can you tell us what was the ethnicity of Thomas?
A.	He too was a Tutsi.
Q.	And Martin, what was his ethnicity?
A.	He was also Tutsi.
Q.	Witness, what was the ethnicity of the persons who killed these various Tutsis?
A.	Those who killed the persons I mentioned belonged to the Hutu ethnic group. 
Q.	As a result of these killings, was anyone arrested?
A.	Regarding the various killings which I mentioned, I will start with the first.  The authorities went to the location but did not carry out any investigations.  The authorities asked if -- for the children to be buried.  Now, as for the death of Thomas, some individuals were apprehended, including those who had eaten the cow that had been killed.  It is quite likely that after Martin's death about three people were apprehended and detained for a brief period of time.  Subsequently, they were released.  After the death of Muhigirwa, no one was apprehended.  And the inspector of the judicial police visited the location and he ordered that the victim be buried, but he failed to proceed with any investigation concerning the matter. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, what was the name of the IPJ, inspector of police?
A.	At that time, the inspector of the judicial police was known as Fulgence Kayishema.
Q.	These persons who had been arrested and who, according to you, had been detained, can you tell us, Witness, where were they detained?
A.	These persons who were apprehended were detained at the commune gaol.
Q.	And, Witness, how long did they remain in custody?
A.	They were apprehended on Saturday, I think that was the 9th or around the 9th.  They spent the day in detention, but it was well known that by evening they had been released.  That situation obtained until Monday the 11th, and the IPJ ordered that Martin be buried, after which they were allowed to go back to their homes.
Q.	Who allowed the persons arrested to be released?
A.	I have just said that it was the inspector of the judicial police.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when the security situation deteriorated, did the Tutsis in your area, did they remain in their homes?
A.	Having realised that the security situation was deteriorating and that the authorities were not coming to their assistance, some of the Tutsis took refuge at the commune office, others went to seek refuge at the parish.  Obviously there were some Tutsis who went to seek refuge in their neighbours' homes, but I saw with my own eyes that the Tutsis -- some Tutsis went to the commune office and others went to the parish.
Q.	When you say parish, Witness, which parish are you referring to?  What are you referring to?
A.	I am referring to Nyange parish which was located in our commune.
Q.	And what kind of church, what denomination was this Nyange parish?
A.	The Nyange parish was a parish belonging to the Catholic Church.
Q.	In April 1994 who was the priest at the Nyange Catholic Church?
A.	In 1994, the priest at the parish was known as Athanase Seromba.
Q.	Witness, in April 1994, who were the assistant bourgmestres in your area?
A.	Do you want me to give the names of those people?
Q.	Yes, Witness.
A.	At that time, there were three assistant bourgmestres; namely, one in charge of administrative and legal affairs, his name *****************.  Also --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please spell that name for the purposes of the record? 

THE WITNESS:
You want me to spell the name in question or is there someone else who can spell it?  Must I spell it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I would rephrase my questions and then I would ask this question later on.  I have conferred and it appears we may run into difficulty.  I would put it for another session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, let me take you directly to a particular date.  Let me take you to the date of the 13th of April 1994.  Can you tell us, Witness, where did you go on that day?
A.	On the 13th in the morning, I went ****************************************** (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  Later, I returned home, and in the afternoon I went to the local marketplace where we would always meet.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I have tried to phrase my questions in such a way so as to avoid asking this Court at this earlier juncture for a closed session.  But try as I might, Madam President, it appears to me that we seem to be broaching into areas which ought not to be broached into in open session.  In that case, Madam President, I find myself forced to ask this Honourable Court that this part of the evidence be undertaken in a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, you stood up.  Do you wish to take the floor?  Mr. Pognon, do you have any objection regarding the request made by the Prosecutor?  
MR. POGNON:
No objection whatsoever, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We apologise to the public, but we must go into closed session so as to protect the identity of this witness.  This is in the interest of justice.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 9 to 17] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 8 by Roxane Lane)




BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, we have now returned to open session so that the members of the public will be present.  Please be careful when you are answering to not to give any information which may lead to your identity being revealed. 

Witness, can you give us an approximate number of the refugees who had gathered at the parish by this week, Friday, the 15th of April 1994?
A.	There were approximately more than 1500 refugees, well, between 1500 and 2000 of them.
Q.	And can you give us, Witness, an approximate number of the attackers?
A.	It's difficult to estimate.  I wasn't able to look through the entire parish to see, but it's clear there were many attackers at the centre and in the surrounding areas; however, it is difficult for me to give you a number.  I wasn't able to walk all around the place.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Can you tell us, Witness, what, if anything, became of the dead bodies which you had seen?
A.	With regard to the dead bodies that I saw, ways and means to bury them were looked for so that they can continue after they were buried.
Q.	Did you do anything with respect to making sure that these bodies were buried?
A.	Yes, I did something.
Q.	And can you tell us, Witness, what did you do?
A.	I saw those dead bodies when I was walking around the area.  When I arrived in front of Kanyarukiga's pharmacy, Ndugutse and Kanani with a gendarme showed up.  They ordered me to go to the Astaldi Company's worksite and they asked me to talk to the foreman at that site and to bring -- to ask to bring back equipment that could be used to bury those dead bodies.
Q.	What is the Astaldi Company?
A.	Astaldi is a company, a construction company.  They build roads.  It was said that it was an Italian company.  At that time they were building a road from Gitarama to Kibuye.  In fact, at that specific place, that company was looking for gravel that it used to build the Gitarama-Kibuye road.
Q.	And how did you go to the Astaldi Construction Company?
A.	They gave me the order to go there.  I thought that it was far away and so they called a vehicle.  They requisitioned a vehicle from Ramisabo (phonetic).  He was a Tutsi and his vehicle was taken away from him.  He had gone into hiding.  During that period Huimana (phonetic) was the driver of that car.
Q.	And did you go to the Astaldi Company?
A.	I did.  I went there.  I was on board the vehicle driven by the man whose name I have just given you.
Q.	And did you there speak to the foreman, as you had said?
A.	Yes, I found that person there, and I gave him the message that was given to me.
Q.	And did you, thereafter, return to the church?
A.	I did.  I came back after that.
Q.	On your return to the church, where were the bodies that you had seen?
A.	When I returned to the church, I noticed that the bodies were being buried in a ditch in a mass grave.
Q.	Where was this mass grave?
A.	That mass grave, where the bodies were being buried, is located between the centre and the parish, behind a restaurant that it was said belonged to CARITAS.
Q.	How were these bodies being buried?
A.	The person in charge of logistics showed up with bulldozers, as well as a lorry.  One of the bulldozers was used to dig the grave.  There was a mechanical shovel that picked up the bodies and then the bodies were thrown into the grave.
Q.	After they buried the bodies, did you see Father Seromba?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Where was he?
A.	He was standing in front of the priests' homes.
Q.	Was anyone speaking to him when you saw him?
A.	When I saw him a gendarme was next to him.  They were talking and they were making gestures, talking to the people around them.  He didn't want many people to come into the back courtyard.  There were people who were trying to kill the Tutsis, and he told them that they were not supposed to come into the back courtyard of the church, that instead they needed to kill the people inside of the church.
Q.	And when you say he was making -- when you say Father Seromba was making gestures, can you show us what these gestures were?
A.	He was talking to the gendarmes, and the attackers wanted to come and kill the Tutsis who were in the presbytery.  He was making gestures, saying, "Move away.  Move back.  Instead you need to kill the people who are inside the church."  In fact, he didn't want much killing going on in the back courtyard of the parish for fear that the property there would be damaged.  He preferred that the killing go on inside the church.
Q.	After Father Seromba had indicated to the attackers that they should kill those refugees that were inside the church, what did the attackers do?
A.	At that point in time -- well, in fact, the attackers wanted to begin with the people who were in the back courtyard.  He said, "No, start with those inside the church.  The others, they will come later.  We'll send them to you."  After that, the attackers began to attack those who were inside the church.
Q.	And when you say they began to attack those who were inside the church, can you tell us, what was the first way -- what was the first means that they used to attack the church?
A.	The first means that they used, given that the refugees were using bricks to defend themselves from within the church, the attackers threw stones, shot arrows and those that had firearms shot through the windows of the church.
Q.	And can you tell us, Witness, what was the next means that they used to attack the church?
A.	The objective of the attackers was to enter the church.  They tried to knock down the church door by blowing it up with dynamite.  After that they went to get gasoline, so as to find a way to get in the church.
Q.	Who was the person who had brought the dynamite?
A.	The dynamite was brought by Emmanuel Bagumya, who was an employee at Astaldi, and he brought it on a vehicle.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, Witness gave a name that we did not get clearly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please repeat the names of the persons you said earlier?
THE WITNESS:
Bagumya B-A-G-U-M -- pardon me, B-A-G-U-M-Y-A, Bagumya.  Emmanuel Bagumya, also known as Rutomde.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	When the dynamite was brought, what, exactly, did they do with it?
A.	They attempted to blow up the door, but they were not successful.
Q.	You mentioned, Witness, that they had brought, as well, gasoline.  Can you tell us, Witness, who had brought this gasoline?
A.	Kayishema, the IPJ, brought the gasoline.
Q.	When Kayishema brought the gasoline, what was done with it?
A.	They brought the gasoline.  They sprayed it on the doors and then they tried to set the doors on fire.  They even tried to do the same to the windows and set it ablaze.  They had a pump they were using, the kind of pump normally used for insecticides, and they tried to set it ablaze but they were, again, unsuccessful.
Q.	Who were the persons who were involved in trying to use gasoline to try to burn the door?
A.	Besides Kayishema, who brought the gasoline, the others who actively participated included Uwolinaiye and Nibarere, Faustin (sic) Nibarere.  They tried to pump gasoline onto the door and the others tried to set it ablaze with a match.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Those names need to be spelled.
THE WITNESS:
*I shall begin to spell Nibarere, and N-I-B-A-R-E-R-E, and (unintelligible) is the first name. The other person is spelled U-W-O-L-I-N-A-I-Y-E, first name Faustin, F-A-U-S-T-I-N.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed.
MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you Madam President.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	And after this attempt to burn the church, did the attackers continue trying to attack the refugees?
A.	The attackers were saying that they had no more weapons and even those who had firearms no longer had any ammunition and so they had to stop the attack, and they decided to start anew the next day.
Q.	Around what time, Witness, did the attacks stop?
A.	At about 6 p.m.
Q.	And the attackers, can you tell us, Witness, whether any of them remained at the parish?
A.	When they withdraw, they agreed that those from Kibilira would remain there, the attackers from Kibilira would remain there, and they would stay to make sure that the refugees would stay in the church and not be able to escape.
Q.	These attackers from Kibilira, were they given any reward or promise of reward for their participation?
A.	They were promised cattle as a reward; but if you will allow me, when I speak of people in Kibilira, that is what was being said.  There were others amongst them.  There were some from Ramba and from Rutsiro, but they were known, the group was known as the people from Kibilira.  Ramba is spelled 
R-A-M-B-A.  Rutsiro is spelled R-U-T-S-I-R-O, Rutsiro.
Q.	And who had given these promises to the attackers?
A.	Ndugutse and Kayishema made that promise, because on that day those two were in charge of the group of attackers, in lieu of the bourgmestre.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, perhaps is this an appropriate time to take the break?
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We adjourn for 15 minutes.
	(Court recessed from 1110H to 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Session is called to order.  

Madam Prosecutor, you may proceed with the examination-in-chief of the Witness.

MS. ALEXIS:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, just a few questions before we move on.  Can you tell us if you know what political party Kanyarukiga belonged to?
A.	On the basis of rallies which took place, he was a member of the MDR party.
Q.	And when you told us earlier that Kanyarukiga said, at the centre, on the 14th of April, that the RPF was at the river, which river was he referring to?
A.	I stated that Kanyarukiga had said that the RPF had reached Nyanabongo River in Mushubati commune, next to Kivumu commune, and this was the Nyanabongo River that I was speaking about.
Q.	Okay.  Witness, you told us that Father Seromba was speaking to attackers and making gestures to them to go toward the church, and then you went on to tell us that the church was attacked afterwards.  My question is this, Witness:  The persons who attacked the church after the burial of the bodies on the Friday, were those the same persons whom Father Seromba had spoken to?
A.	The attacks would occur in the morning and, after they killed the people I referred to, they would stop the killings briefly, and after Ndugutse consulted the priest, they stopped the killings and, subsequently, it would be the same persons who would continue with the killings in the presbytery.
Q.	Very well.  Witness, when the attackers were trying to destroy the church, you told us, by shooting, by dynamite, by using fuel, where was Father Seromba?
A.	Father Seromba remained in the inside courtyard at his home, because I didn't see him when the assailants came back.  So there were the assailants, as well as the victims.  For the last time, on that day, I saw him opposite the place that he lived when the attackers were using dynamite or petrol, but at that time I didn't see him.
Q.	Witness, I will now take you to the next matter, Saturday, the 16th of April 1994.  On that day did you return to the church?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	And upon your return did you see Father Seromba?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	And did you see anyone speaking to him?
A.	In the morning, at about 7:30, that's when I arrived, the bourgmestre went near him, greeted him, and they spoke.
Q.	Can you -- afterward, after they were speaking, did you see other authorities?
A.	After they spoke, I saw other authorities.  And speaking about the whole day, I don't really know at what specific point in time you wish to refer to.
Q.	Very well.  Witness, do you know, on the morning of that day, whether the authorities came to any decision?
A.	After their conversation the bourgmestre had come with several policemen, as well as the leaders of the attacks, such as Ndugutse, Habiyambere and Kayishema.  There were also reservists there.  The bourgmestre gave the example by shooting at someone who was up above the church and the attacks began, the killing began.  On that day, it was no longer possible to kill people using bullets.  They had sought other ways and means for committing those massacres.
Q.	And what was the other way that they sought to destroy the church?
A.	Use was made of bulldozers which destroyed the church.
Q.	Whose decision was it to destroy the church by use of bulldozers?
A.	It was the various authorities.
Q.	Can you, for the purposes of the record, tell us, exactly, who were the persons involved in the making of the decision?
A.	Firstly, I can say that when it became impossible to destroy the church using bullets Habiyambere and Kayishema sent a message to the bourgmestre -- they were in the company of the retired warrant officer.  The warrant officer was known as Habarugira.  Now they met opposite Kanyarukiga's pharmacy in the presence of Kanyarukiga himself.  Gendarmes were also present.  Then Habiyambere and Kayishema said that they had just spoken to the logistics chief in Astaldi who had agreed to give them bulldozers to use.  The only problem they had was they were saying they had no petrol, they had no fuel for the bulldozers. 

When they agreed that the trader was going to fetch the fuel, they decided to go and use the fuel belonging to Astaldi, the company, waiting to be paid by the businessmen.  So they went to 
Father Seromba, who was standing in front of the secretariat, and they told him that they no longer had any other possibility, other than the bulldozers, to destroy the church so that they could reach the refugees.  Father Seromba must have understood them and he said, "That if you have no other means, bring the bulldozers then, and destroy the church."
Q.	When they where having this conversation with Father Seromba, where were you?
A.	I was often close to where the bourgmestre was, in order to keep an eye on what was happening.
Q.	And after that conversation, did the bulldozers, in fact, arrive at the parish?
A.	After the bourgmestre spoke with Father Seromba, when he agreed to the proposal, not much time elapsed because Kayishema and the others went to bring the bulldozers, and a few moments later the bulldozers reached the church.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, an approximate time of the arrival of the bulldozers?
A.	It was about 10 a.m.
Q.	And when the bulldozers -- firstly, how many bulldozers arrived?
A.	There were two.
Q.	And when the bulldozers arrived, which part of the church did they first try to destroy?
A.	After the arrival of the bulldozers, one of the bulldozers began from the side at which the church tower was located.

	1145H
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	And were they able to bring down that side where the church tower was located?
A.	The church tower was next to the main entrance, on the side opposite the Nyange centre.  The other bulldozer was to the side facing the priests' housing, and that's the place where we referred to, the place which was -- or the square which was reserved for women.
Q.	Did the bulldozers then go to any other part of the church to try to destroy it?
A.	The drivers were using a way of destroying -- of using these bulldozers.  They were trying to destroy the church from one side, and they saw that it was difficult, and Father Seromba advised the bulldozer's driver to go and start from the side of the sacristy.
Q.	Which side is the side of the sacristy?
A.	Considering the way the church was built, there was, on the one hand, the tower on one side and the other side where I would say there was the part of the church which was for the placement of mass objects, and there was the side at which the priest would be when he was saying mass, and then there was the other part which was known as the house of jubilation.
Q.	And were the bulldozers successful in breaking down that church?
A.	They managed to destroy the church and they continued to do so until they managed to destroy the tower.
Q.	And what happened to the Tutsi refugees who were inside the church?
A.	Many of those Tutsis were killed because sheeting, timber and beams were falling on the refugees, and bricks as well. 
Q.	How many people would you say, approximately, lost their lives at Nyange parish?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, on that day, about 1,500 died. 
Q.	And whose permission was the church destroyed?
A.	As I've already explained, the decision to destroy the church was taken after people spoke with the drivers of the bulldozers and Father Seromba accepted their decision.  After that, the church was destroyed. 
Q.	And after the destruction of the church, did you remain in that area?
A.	After the church was destroyed, I went home.
Q.	Witness CDL, beginning from the start of 1994 until the events of April 1994, can you tell us approximately how many times did you see Father Seromba, approximately? 
A.	I would often see Father Seromba.  In any case, it wouldn't be less than ten times.
Q.	And, Witness, when you told us earlier that the bourgmestre gave an example by shooting, can you explain to us what you meant by this?
A.	I said that after the conversation with Father Seromba, he gave the example by shooting.  What I meant was that he gave the sign for the killings to begin.  In other words, this meant that there was no crime as such, even if people killed on that day.
Q.	The side of the church which was destroyed first, would that be closest to the highway -- sorry, to the main road or away from it?  Can you just help us to understand. 
A.	The location of the road in relation to the main road is that the two were close to one another.  In other words, there's the main road below the church, and if you were to make a kind of comparison between where the tower was to be found and where the sacristy was, you could easily say that the two sides were parallel to the main road.  You would be able to come from down below on the main road and reach the church, just as you would be able to come from Rugabano and get to the church. 
Q.	On that day, the 16th of April 1994, did Father Seromba do anything to protect the refugees from being killed?
A.	I didn't see anything.  I didn't see anything at all.  As I have already said, he was showing the fragile or weak part that one needed to start in order to kill the Tutsis, and he was talking -- they were talking with the father.  Nothing was done without his consent.  At least, he did not show any desire to come to the assistance of the refugees in question. 
Q.	Can you give us a physical description of Father Seromba?
A.	I don't quite understand your question.  What part of his body do you wish to refer to?
Q.	Can you tell us about his face and his body size, his height, those sorts of things. 
A.	It's a long time since I last saw him, but at the time, Seromba was a young priest of average height.  I would say that I was taller than he was, and he wasn't very well built, either.  His face was somewhat round and he didn't have much hair on his head. 
Q.	Witness, if you were to see Father Seromba now, would you be able to point to him? 
A.	One cannot forget someone whom one has seen and with whom one has had a conversation.  If he has changed, one would still be able to point him out.
Q.	Witness, can you look around this court slowly, take your time, and tell us whether you see 
Father Seromba present in this court.  And you can stand, Witness, if that would make it easier. 
A.	Even while seated I can see him.  He is the second person on that row and I can see he is wearing spectacles. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President.  

Witness, thank you very much. 

	Madam President, I believe the witness has properly identified Father Seromba and might the record so reflect.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the record reflect that Witness CDL has identified the Accused Seromba in the courtroom. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might the record also reflect that the witness also pointed to Father Seromba. 
	Madam President, I would now like the witness to be shown some photographs which have been entered into evidence, and for this reason, might the witness be allowed to go toward the overhead projector. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you may stand up and go toward the overhead projector. 
THE WITNESS:
Should I bring my headset with me? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might the witness be shown what was entered as Prosecution Exhibit 3-1. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, are you able to properly see that photograph?
A.	Yes, I can see it.
Q.	And do you see a building in that photograph?
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, it is difficult for the interpreters to hear the witness.  If he could please approach the microphone. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Perhaps I can ask the question again.  Do you see a building depicted on that photograph?
A.	I do.  I see the building.
Q.	And can you tell us, Witness, what building is this?
A.	Clearly, this is the secretary's office for the parish.
Q.	Witness, in your evidence, you told us that Father Seromba was standing in front of the secretariat when they came to tell him about the decision to destroy the church.  If such an area is visible on that photograph, can you point to us where Father Seromba was when the authorities came to him.
A.	Here (indicating). 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I have a photocopy of this photograph which perhaps it would be easier to mark, if my friends have no objections.  Perhaps the registry can take the photocopy to my friends so that they can see that it is the same photograph that is depicted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please show the photograph to the Defence. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, Witness, can you mark for us where Father Seromba was standing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't see that very clearly.  Please mark it with a large X.  Very well.  

You may proceed, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if the Defence have no objections, might this, which is a photocopy of Prosecution Exhibit 3-1, be admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit No. 20. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Defence?  No objections.  This document should be marked with the pseudonym for this witness. 
MS. ALEXIS:
CDL.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Have you finished with this copy? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please.  Madam President, we'd now like the witness to be shown --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Pardon me.  Said document is admitted as a Prosecution Exhibit, number P. 20.
	(Exhibit No. P. 20 admitted)
MS. ALEXIS:
I'm obliged to you, Madam President.  

I'd now like the witness to be shown what is Prosecution Exhibit 3-17.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness.
A.	Yes, I can hear you.
Q.	You are able to clearly see what is depicted here?
A.	Yes, at least as regards the visible buildings.
Q.	Can you tell us what are those buildings?
A.	These are the buildings located at Nyange centre.  In fact, these are shops. 
Q.	You spoke earlier of Kanyarukiga's pharmacy.  Can you show us, if it is depicted there, the approximate place where this pharmacy is located?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, yet again, I have a photocopy of this exhibit. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Yes, Witness, isn't that photocopy -- if such an area is depicted, can you mark for us around where Kanyarukiga's pharmacy is located?
	And, Witness, you told us in your evidence that on the 16th of April 1994, the authorities had gathered somewhere in front of Kanyarukiga's pharmacy.  If that area is depicted on that photograph, can you point us where the authorities had this conversation?  
A.	They were talking to one another at this place.  The same place that I've marked.  It's at that exact same location where they were speaking.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might this marked photocopy of what was entered as Prosecution Exhibit 3-17 be entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 21. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Defence?  No objections.  Very well.  The said document is tendered as a Prosecution exhibit, and it shall be marked P. 21.
	(Exhibit No. P. 21 admitted)
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Might the witness now be shown Prosecution Exhibit 3-21. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness.
A.	Yes, I hear you.
Q.	Do you see what is depicted on that photograph?
A.	I do.
Q.	And do you recognise that building?
A.	I can see this is the part where the tower of Nyange church is located.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I have another photocopy of the photograph.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	When you spoke of the tower, the church tower in your evidence, do you see the church tower depicted in that photograph?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	And can you point to us and mark which part of that building you see is the church tower you spoke of?
MR. POGNON:
We did not hear the Prosecutor's question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you kindly repeat your question, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Certainly, Madam President. 

BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, you spoke in your evidence of a church tower.  If such -- if that tower you spoke of is depicted on this photograph, could you point to it?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, the witness is pointing and placing a mark on what he had spoken of as the church tower. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, that building, what building is it?
A.	I said that this is the part of the church where the tower is located.  This is Nyange church.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might this photocopy be marked as Prosecution Exhibit 22 and entered into evidence, if my learned friends have no objections. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Defence?  May the tower of the church be marked with an X.  He indicated where it was, but I didn't see him marking it. 
MS. ALEXIS:
(Overlapping microphones)...Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It also should be indicated on this photocopy, CDL, the pseudonym of the witness.  Very well.  This document is tendered as a Prosecution Exhibit and it shall be marked P. 22.  You may proceed. (Exhibit No. P. 22 admitted)
MS. ALEXIS:
I'm obliged, Madam President.  Might the witness now be shown Prosecution Exhibit P. 2-09.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness.
A.	Yes, I hear you.
Q.	Can you tell us what is that building depicted on that photograph?
A.	This is the priests' housing.  Of course, in that building there were also some offices. 
Q.	And in your evidence, whenever you spoke of the house of Father Seromba, would it be that building you spoke of?
A.	Yes, this is the building.  He was standing in front of this building at the point in time when the refugees went to hide. 
MS. ALEXIS:
That is all for this photograph.  Madam President, might the witness finally be shown what was marked as Prosecution Exhibit 2-30. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Mr. Witness.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if this may assist, we are not asking this Honourable Court to admit any more of the photocopies into evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't know if I have completely understood.  You are going to tender the photographs you wish to tender.  There is no problem with that.  We have found P. 2-30.  That is the one we are referring to now. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, do you recognise the building?  I have no questions to ask you about the people.  Do you recognise that building in which those people are?
A.	I recognise this building.  I even recognise the priest who is among those people.  I can see that this is the inside of Nyange church.
Q.	And who is that priest?
A.	I believe that's a priest named Nzanana.  N-Z-N-A-N-A (sic).
Q.	And, Witness, this of course would be the inside of the Nyange church.  Sorry, this would be -- you said it was inside of Nyange church.  But this of course would be before its destruction. 
A.	Clearly, yes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, these are all the questions I have for this witness with respect to these photographs, and the witness may now proceed to the witness box. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Do you have any further questions for this witness, Madam Prosecutor?
MS. ALEXIS:
No, please, Madam President.  It remains only to tell the witness thank you very much.  And thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  We should also like to thank the witness.  
Judge Hökborg has a question for the Defence. 
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Yes, thank you.  Well, I would like to address the same issue that we were discussing yesterday, one of them, anyway.  That is the list of witnesses for the Defence.  And we had the meeting yesterday.  We discussed this at length, and now my first and hopefully only question is, has the list been submitted yet, whether it is provisional or not, and I would turn to Maître Pognon, who is the head counsel.  Has the list been submitted?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the list has not yet been disclosed between yesterday at the close of the meeting and now.  I think that there was too little time for that.  I don't know if this is a status conference that we have come into or if this question is supposed to be put before this witness in his presence.  It doesn't seem that this is the appropriate time, with all due respect to the Judge.
(Pages 25 to 32 by S. Eboe-Osuji)






























	1230H
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Well, this is in the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour's microphone, please.

Thank you.
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Well, whether this is in the presence of the witness or not, it was clear from my part that it was finished, this hearing of the witness.  And, Monsieur Pognon, I had one question; you answered it no.

My next question is: when will we have the list?  Because I understood you yesterday, that we would have it today or tomorrow.  I would just like to have this confirmed without having to refer to our conversation yesterday.  Thank you.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, once again, this is the Prosecution case.  We had an informal meeting yesterday dealing with those matters.  When we were invited to that informal meeting by counsel, that we had, we had a certain number of things to say, and I don't know that during the Prosecution case questions regarding status matters can interfere when the witness is still in the witness box.  So, in a way, I have already answered the question.

We are working on this, Madam President and Honourable Judge.  I don't understand why that question is being asked now in front of the witness.  I am trying to give a response and give a date, but it is difficult for the Defence to be put in this position.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please escort the witness out of the courtroom.

Mr. Witness, we will resume at 2:30 this afternoon.

Counsel, we are surprised by your response.  A judge has the right to ask questions.  Honourable Judge Hökborg put two questions to you.  You didn't answer them, and after that you made some inappropriate remarks.  The question was very simple.  We simply wanted to know if you've already filed your list of witnesses.

The second question was, if you have filed the motion that we are waiting for.  Now, if you haven't done that yet and you are going to do it tomorrow, you simply answer by saying so, and the matter is dealt with.  But we have spent much time dealing with this, too much time.
Yesterday, during the meeting, we said that Friday was a holiday and it would be a good idea for you to file the motion for the protective measures for your witnesses and even the provisional list of your witnesses, and that it had to be filed by tomorrow, which is today.  So you could have answered the question without making those observations you made.

If there are no other matters to be dealt with at this stage, we shall adjourn and resume, as we said earlier, at 2:30 this afternoon, at which point we will proceed with the cross-examination of this witness by the Defence.
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

Mr. Pognon, are you the one to cross-examine the witness, or is it Mr. Monthé?
MR. POGNON:
It will be Mr. Monthé who will begin, and if I have questions to put to the witness, I shall do so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Monthé, you have the floor for the cross-examination of Witness CDR.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon.  Madam President, since it's the season of wishes, before I begin my task, I wish you and your colleagues all our best for -- from the Defence, as well as to the Prosecutor, to the registry, as well as to the witness who has agreed to come so far.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	As you know, I am one of the Defence team and I have the duty to cross-examine you.  I am going to put to you some questions, asking you to respond as precisely as possible.  If, by chance, any of the questions appears not to be very clear to you, please notify me so I can put it to you again.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, the way in which I wish to proceed with my cross-examination -- in order to avoid the usual difficulties, maybe I will start off with a closed session so that I could put to the witness questions which may cause a problem in an open session, and then I would kindly request that we come back to the open session so we proceed further.

I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel, for your good wishes.  Please receive the same from us, and I'm sure you address the same to the Prosecutor.

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objection whatsoever for the closed session requested?
MS. ALEXIS:
None at all, Madam President, none at all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Madam Prosecutor.  We thank you.

We apologise to the gallery, but we are going to sit in closed session in order to protect the witness and also in the interest of justice.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 36 to 39] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 33 to 35 by Verna Butler)























MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are now in an open session.  You may proceed.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please tell this Court when you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana and where were you?
A.	I learned of the death of President Habyarimana in the morning of the 7th of April 1994.  I woke up on that day and I was getting ready to go *************** in order to see what the situation was like there, and when I reached the centre close to the tribunal, the court, that's when I learnt of that news.
Q.	When you got to hear of that news, were there any people around you?  What was the atmosphere that prevailed?
A.	You will understand that when we heard of this news, everyone who was at the centre was astonished.  We were saddened by the death of the president.  As for the rest, that depended on each individual.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  On that day of the 7th of April, was there any particular event that occurred in your commune over and above the death of your president?
A.	Whilst we were still there a soldier, whose name I did not know, who was on leave, came to where we were.  He told us that he was getting ready to go back to Kigali because after the death of President Habyarimana the situation was critical and he was saying that, since he hadn't found any vehicle to take him there, he was going to commandeer the ambulance because he said he had to go back to Kigali and that, at any rate, a war needed to be started in order to avenge the death of the president.

Another thing is that in the evening -- well, in fact, throughout that day, I tried to go ************** and when I got to the place known as ********, below the commune office, I met Ndugutse when I was going back *********** and Ndugutse said that he had just received the approval of the fact that the president's death needed to be avenged; thus, that evening the attack led by Ndugutse was launched against the family of Ndakubana.
Q.	In other words, according to you, the killings began right from the 7th of April.
A.	Yes, in our commune the killings began as early as the 7th of April.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in your statement you said that when suspects were arrested and brought to the communal office they spent the day there and then on that evening they were released to go out and spread the ideology.  What ideology are you referring to, Witness?
A.	I am testifying to say that people were arrested and detained after the death of Thomas, for example, and after people ate the cow of a Tutsi from Ngobagoba.  Those people spent the day at the communal office.  In the evening they were released and they went out and spread the message to continue the killing.  They spread the message throughout the population.  That is the ideology that I speak about in my statement.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, how did you know that the people who were apprehended and held in the gaol were released that evening?
A.	As I already said, I told you that I was an ******************************.  But I also went by ********************************, so during the day I could see them at the ******************.  Regarding the events of that evening, there was a communal police officer who told me.  During that time of insecurity there was a communal police officer who was on duty at the communal office.  His name was Aloys Nishirimbere.  He told me.
Q.	Can you explain to us: *************************************************************************************, why didn't you denounce that serious violation of the law?  **************************************************************?
A.	During that period who could I have addressed such a complaint to?  The people who I could have spoken to are those same people who were committing the crimes.  And, in fact, *******************************.  I didn't see which authority I could have spoken to.
Q.	Witness, was there a préfet where you were?
A.	The préfet had his office at the seat of the préfecture.
Q.	Regarding the administrative organisation in Rwanda, isn't the préfet the superior of the bourgmestre?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You didn't think, Witness, *******************************, "Killers have just been released illegally and they continue to commit violent acts"?
A.	In fact, at one point *********************************.  I told you that the authorities were supposed to uphold the law, but the same laws that they were breaking.  I had no way of going to see the préfet.  I didn't have a vehicle, and at that time it was difficult to travel.  I didn't have a telephone.  So you will understand how difficult it was to go to find the préfet.  What I do know is that what I saw did not please me.
Q.	Any responsible citizen cannot just let those things happen.  But what I am asking you: was there some kind of constraint, or was there a reason that you didn't tell the préfet that the IPJ, that the communal authorities and the bourgmestre were perpetrating crimes or were encouraging criminals?
A.	I did not have the resources to contact anyone regarding those crimes.  Perhaps that is why, later on, we decided to shed light on those events.  For example, in 1990 the same crimes were almost committed, and we worked with the bourgmestre at the time and we were able to put a stop to the killings.  People were arrested.  We were able to contain the attacks that were brewing from Kibilira.  And this was known.  So, later on, it was no longer possible for me to do the same thing.  I didn't have the resources.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you said that since the security situation worsened in the commune the Tutsi began to flee and took refuge either at the parish or at the commune office.  Did that happen spontaneously or did any authorities invite them to take refuge in those different places?
A.	When you see that there is no safety, you immediately look for a place to take refuge.  So some people moved about on their own; just as others did at the time in 1990, there were people who did it on their own.  However, some people were encouraged by the authorities at the local level.  The authorities would bring people to their families, for example, because they were not safe.  There was a meeting that took place on Monday, the 11th, and I think during that meeting a decision was made to tell people to not move too far when fleeing, that they needed to seek refuge in the surrounding area.  So we were told that we had to transport the people who were at the communal office and bring them to the parish and they were to be brought to the parish to be protected.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Witness, you spoke at length about 1990.  But I think in 1990 the president was not dead so that's a totally different context, isn't it, Witness?
A.	Well, it's very clear that it's not the same context.  I was simply giving you an example.  You said that you did some research.  If you look at the situation closely, you will see that if, at that time, the administration didn't take care, there would have been more killings.  You mustn't think that the Tutsi were only killed in 1994.  I gave you an example.  We were able to make sure to contain those killings.  Of course, in 1994 the killings reached their climax because, among other things, the president died.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I'm not going to say that the Rwanda history is fraught with killings since the seventeenth century, but let's get back to what we were saying.  Witness, did you ever take part in any attacks?
A.	In fact, I took part in the Nyange attack, where I have gone to Nyange.
Q.	During that attack, Witness, did any people perish?
A.	Yes, on that day people were killed.
Q.	Did the attack take place at Nyange church?
A.	It did, yes.
Q.	You participated in that attack by throwing stones at Tutsi refugees; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	As you were throwing the stones, Witness, wasn't there anyone else around you, who was shooting firearms, others who were throwing grenades?  So, in fact, you were aware that people were killing those refugees; isn't that correct?
A.	As I explained, I said that I arrived at the parish.  I didn't arrive with the attackers; I arrived alone.  And if you'd like, I can explain why.  When I arrived there I saw that people were throwing stones at the refugees, and I did so as well.  But at that point in time people hadn't died yet, but we did surround them.  We tried to throw stones at them so we could try to get closer to them.  At that point no one was using firearms.  They hadn't yet started to use firearms.
Q.	Witness, I want you to specify for us, for the benefit of this Honourable Chamber: on that 15th of April you were throwing stones; did anyone die as a result of that?
A.	I tried to give you an explanation regarding that matter.  We were throwing stones at one another and no one had died yet; however, at about noon or after noon, Rukara -- in fact, that was his nickname; his real name was Théophile -- that Rukara went on top of the roof of some of the shops and started throwing grenades into the crowd of refugees who were gathered in the courtyard.  Then people were killed because the grenades exploded.  The refugees were looking for hiding places and the attackers went after them.  So, indeed, on that occasion people died.  That is clear.
Q.	Thank you very much.  So we can conclude that you were amongst the attackers when the Tutsi refugees were killed?
A.	As you say, and as I said, I participated in those killings and that is why I am asking for forgiveness, because I participated in those criminal acts.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, tell us: as you were throwing stones, was Father Seromba with you?
A.	As I explained, on that day when I saw Seromba he was standing in front of the secretariat building.  I did not say that he was throwing stones.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Witness, you stated that, in fact, you participated in the attacks against the Tutsis, and you did so because you were afraid of those who had power at the time; is this correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What were you afraid of, Witness?
A.	There were instructions that were given ,on the one hand, and I have already mentioned that.  Those orders were given at the centre, the marketplace.  The bourgmestre and his collaborators in the attacks said that those who did not participate in the killings, as the others, would be treated as accomplices, that they, too, would be killed thereafter.
Q.	Tell me, Witness, prior to Habyarimana's death, Rwanda had just become a multiparty state.  Wasn't there confrontations between the MRND and MDR members which sometimes caused deaths?  What were you afraid of, therefore?
A.	Yes, they confronted one another, but it was only a debate; they didn't confront one another physically.  Perhaps that took place elsewhere, but I cannot testify to that.  That was not the case in our commune.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you acknowledge that you were afraid that the assailants could eventually consider you as an enemy and take revenge on you.  You could also agree that, perhaps, Father Seromba was afraid for his life vis-à-vis those attackers.
A.	The fear that I had regarding participating in those attacks can't be compared to Father Seromba's fear.  Father Seromba was a decision maker; he decided, along with those attackers.  They decided together.
Q.	You are ******************.  Are there different types of fear?  Can you calculate the fear of someone facing such a situation?
A.	I agree that, indeed, there are different types of circumstances that can lead to fear.  The same goes for what happened at that time, but each person has to explain what made him afraid.  It's up to each individual to explain their own fear.  I can't explain anyone's fear for anyone else.
Q.	Thank you for being honest, Witness.  Witness, you said you know Leningrad.  You've certainly heard about Stalin and his methods, haven't you?
A.	Yes, I learned of that in the history books.
Q.	But you didn't experience that.  You are a lucky man.
A.	You are correct.  I learnt about that at school.  We were told about Stalin and how he was.
Q.	Witness, let's now talk about ****************************.  This morning you said that the bourgmestre had a certain number of responsibilities, including which -- including for which he was assisted by a security committee and by an enlarged security committee.  Do you confirm that information, Witness?
A.	Pardon me; I was never ***************.  All that I said is that I was ******************************.  Now, as regards security, those committees existed and they did assist him.  They gave him ideas; they took measures to ensure security.
Q.	Mr. **************************, I'm not the one to teach you that ************************ is called the **************; an assistant mayor, they call him mayor.  Nevertheless, what you said, that committee, was it a lawfully set up committee or was it ad hoc?
A.	That committee was governed by the administrative law for the commune.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, with your leave, I have a document before me.  It's the law on communal organisation in Rwanda.  It's the law of 23 November 1963.  Could the registry kindly assist me to distribute this document?  We would like to give a copy to the witness.  If he could look at the document.

Madam President, should I give you also a copy of the document?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you should give a copy to all of the parties, including the Chamber.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS:
This is not an objection, Madam President; it is merely a point of clarification.  The witness has ************************** and my learned friend has asked him -- has suggested to him that the committee was part -- was it part of the administrative law, and the witness said yes.  I am not sure which committee the witness was referring to and, as a point of clarification for the record, I would very much like if my friend can be a bit more specific.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Absolutely.  I thought that I was more clear.  Let me go back over this.  Madam President, I said that in the law of 23 November 1963 you have the communal organisation for Rwanda.  Nowhere is there mention of security committees, nor of enlarged security committees in that law.  Nowhere is there mention of that underneath the heading of the bourgmestre's responsibilities.  So this is what I'm trying to get at, Madam President.  Have I been sufficiently clear, Madam Prosecutor?
THE WITNESS:
Let's not spend too much time on this issue.  There is mention of the communal council.  When the communal council dealt with security issues, they would have to set up a security committee.  Then there was the enlarged committee for security.  As such, the committee included the bourgmestres and conseillers, and when there were security issues that arose the criminal investigations officers and the IPJ would get together and study security.  When there were security problems that became serious, the department heads were invited and religious representatives were invited to the committee to take a decision and take action as quickly as possible.  If you go in all of the communes, you would notice that the conseillers met every week to deal with security matters.  When security matters were being dealt with in that meeting, you could refer to that meeting as a committee.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I simply wanted to point out that in this law there is no committee that has been provided for by the legislators.  The testimony that the witness has given cannot be admissible because in the law there is no mention of a security committee.  The law is very clear on this, and I don't want your Chamber to be misdirected.  And I don't want to dwell on this too much, but the law is very clear on this matter, Madam President.
THE WITNESS:
In fact, you are saying that you don't see mention of this committee in this law.  You must know -- and I know what happened.  I don't know if you are going to try to change what we did when we were in the commune.  You could ask the bourgmestre we worked with.  He will confirm this information.  These meetings did take place.  These committees existed.
MR. MONTHÉ:
We don't know that; we don't know if they existed, because the law says that they did not exist.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, at this juncture I must object.  Madam President, learned counsel is arguing with the witness; counsel is arguing with the Court.  There is a particular function for this learned Tribunal.  This Tribunal, at the end of these proceedings, must consider all the evidence and come to conclusions.  Learned counsel has said that the law does not exist -- that the law is not written in the actual existing law (sic).  That may be so.  To continually be saying so is merely giving evidence, one, from the Bar table.  Secondly, because counsel disagrees with the witness, and it is counsel's right to disagree as he may, it is not a reason to ask the Court that the witness's evidence in this respect be inadmissible.  It is not within the precinct of counsel, with all due respect, to tell this Court what is admissible about a witness's evidence merely because counsel does not agree.  And I so place my objection on record.
THE WITNESS:
I have a question; well, in fact, it's a clarification.  This law counsel is using, which forms the basis of his argument, does not at all mention the canton tribunal or the commune officers.  As such, he cannot base himself on this law.  The Chamber must decide.  There is mention of communal agents, but the communal administration is not mentioned, for example.  Therefore, to place oneself and one's argument on this law would only be backtracking -- would amount to backtracking.  This law is dated 1963.  We managed the commune in the 1990s.  I'm speaking to you about my own experience, and I don't think this has anything to do with the killings that took place.  What I can tell you is that there were some anomalies that could be corrected, but, for me, that should not stop the Chamber from moving forward with its work.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I'm seeking clarification.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to respond to the objection?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Just a clarification regarding the text: if you look at chapter 3 of the law, you will see that it's titled "Communal Administration".
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, I don't think we are going to belabour this point.  It is up to the Chamber to assess this evidence, and we will look at this law dated 1963 very well.  It is up to the Chamber to assess that and we shall do so with all of the other information we receive here.  You may proceed, Counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes.  I wanted simply to make that clarification, to say that this is the only law we have; there is no other law.  And I shall proceed, as you wished.
THE WITNESS:
We need to understand certain things properly.  If counsel wants to rely on this law, he should do so; and if I say that the communal council dealt with security, that was the case.  It dealt with security, and there were also heads of departments and heads of technical commissions who attended those meetings.  But it was not all the sections that could be represented.  It would depend on the size of a commune and the departments that were to be represented.  So there's absolutely no argument, and he should not say that what I said does not appear in the law.  Depending on the circumstances and the location, one could add certain aspects.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please proceed.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just given us a demonstration in relation to this committee and you stated that **************************** there was a meeting which was held.  You listed a number of persons, but you didn't mention any of the clergy.  Why was that the case?
A.	In 1999 when I began to testify, I was unable to say everything in one go because at the time it was not easy to understand the reasons and to say the whole truth, but gradually truth comes about by itself, and I think that from what I said in 1999 -- I did state that there were killings of a large scale in Nyange parish and in Kivumu.  And if I said that killings took place in our commune, the priests could say the same.
Q.	You say, Mr. Witness, that the truth is gradual.  Can one tell exactly when it is that you are speaking the truth?
A.	What I said at the time is true, but I did not speak the whole truth.  The essence is that I spoke about the killings which were perpetrated in the location, and at the time maybe I did not mention by name all the persons who participated in the crimes.  And when I completed my testimony I did state that I was ready to provide further information to those who may seek such information from me.  I think I did say that at the end of my testimony.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Can you please tell the Chamber why the bourgmestre could hold these meetings, not at the communal office, but at the parish?
A.	Through my testimony I stated that normally meetings were held at the commune office when there were no other activities or other difficulties, but I did indeed say that the bourgmestre could take any room that was available in his commune, anywhere in his commune.  I didn't say that the bourgmestre was obliged to hold meetings at the parish.
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 13th of April 1994 you state that during a meeting it was decided that an attack should be launched.  Could you tell the Chamber, kindly, where this meeting was held?
A.	I explained to the Chamber that that meeting took place at the commune office.
Q.	Did Father Seromba attend that meeting?
A.	Yes, Father Seromba attended the meeting.
Q.	Were you, yourself, there?
A.	No, I wasn't there personally.
Q.	Well, how, then, did you know who attended that meeting?
A.	As I have already stated, the meeting took place at the commune office and in the evening -- or, during the afternoon we were at the centre, and the centre is located between the parish and the commune office.  I have already stated to the Chamber that I was able to know the name of those who attended the meeting through the assistant of the bourgmestre known as Kanani.
Q.	In truth, you are reporting to the Chamber what you heard, not what you saw, are you not?
A.	I think that I have already said in my testimony there are certain events which I heard and saw myself, and other events that were reported to me; in particular, this meeting.  Someone, as myself, who was a member of the MDR was invited to the meeting.  Myself and our chairman, as well as others, who -- some of whom refused to attend.  But the event took place in broad daylight and everyone saw them when they were going to the meeting.
Q.	You are taking us on a walk, if I can express myself that way.  Can you be simple?  If this was told to you, you should just say so; but if you saw people passing by, you should tell us and tell us where they were going if you saw them pass by.
A.	This depends on your objective or, rather, what you want to hear.  Those who were going to attend the meeting, we saw them, and when they came back from the meeting we also saw them.
Q.	You said that at the end of that meeting, according to you, there were only figures of authority who attended; is that correct?
A.	During that period of time at which the security situation was rather precarious, it would be the people who had the same objectives who would attend such meetings; in other words, persons who were directing or launching attacks, including Ndugutse, Kanyarukiga and the authorities who collaborated with them in order to carry out their objective.  It was not necessary to invite all the conseillers or all the heads of department who were not interested.
Q.	For our information, can you please tell us who you mean when you refer to the term "authority", "those in authority"?
A.	I do not know whether we are going to use "those in authority" or "leader", but, for me, this would be someone who shows others what they need to do in order to attain a certain objective which they may have assigned to themselves, or an objective which is determined by the state.
Q.	In that regard, you said that at the end of that meeting a civil servant, an assistant bourgmestre, was allegedly appointed by Father Seromba in order to go and see if the refugees in the church were armed; is that correct?
A.	I told you that when I met that assistant bourgmestre he said to the others that he had been with them in the meeting and that they had just finished with their responsibilities, and I was curious to ask him questions.  And he answered by saying that during the meeting it had been decided that they were going to see whether the refugees in the church were armed or not in order to defend themselves.  This was because the attackers were to attack them, depending on the case.
Q.	If I understood you correctly, those two individuals were supposed to disarm the refugees who were in the church, were they?
A.	Rather, he told me that their mission was to go and check whether they were armed or not and, if so, what weapons they had so that they, themselves, could possibly prepare themselves for an attack.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us that ************************************************ in your commune.  So ********************.  Why were you so concerned about the security situation of that school?  Because **********************************.
A.	I did say that ******************, yes, but as an ordinary inhabitant one needs to be concerned by the security situation where you live.  If we were to think about it together, we would realise that when there is no security one can do nothing at all, and that is why the security situation was of concern to me.
Q.	********************************?
A.	No.  As I have already told you, that school had just been started.  There were five teachers, and ************************.  It was during the holidays.  The Zaireans had gone home and the other teacher was not a native of the locality.  He was from Gitesi.  That is why the headmaster **********************************.
Q.	Was the headmaster from the same commune as yourself?
A.	The headmaster was a Zairean.
Q.	Thank you.  So you went to the school, and this was during the holidays, and you would go there ************.  And you say that you got there and you realised that one of the watchmen was not at his post, one Kabilisa, and that his colleague allegedly told you to go and look for him, and you decided to go and look for him.
MS. ALEXIS:
(Microphone not activated)... and far as I recall, this was not a matter -- he must bring it before the court -- take that statement and indicate which statement, the date of the statement.

Madam President, there is a procedure for these things.  My friend has intervened the evidence, has interwoven the evidence, that which is on the statements, that which was given in evidence, and he has made it one concrete block.  Madam President, I would wish to state that it is not, in fact, one concrete block at all, that if my friend wishes to go outside of what was given in evidence today, which is what the evidence is, then he must expressly say so.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, if I had been allowed to complete what I was saying, maybe I could have done so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have already raised the question.  In fact, the objection is sustained because we, ourselves, didn't hear this.  So please give us details about the statement, the dates and the pages so we can follow, because we are somewhat disoriented by your questions, which sometimes go along which has been said here, and what you are lifting from the written statement that you have.
MR. MONTHÉ:
When it is said here, I do say it is said here, and in the present instance I was interrupted so I wasn't able to complete my sentence.  So let me repeat my question.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q. Mr. Witness, you state that you passed by the school where you saw that the watchman -

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel -- I do not wish to interrupt you.  Please tell us, where you are getting this statement from.  That's all we are asking for.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, in his letter of 25th January 2002.  I'm speaking about the witness; 0335032, that is the code, and the title is "Shedding light on the events which took place at Nyange church", at page 2.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, have you found the letter?
MS. ALEXIS:
I have a letter which I believe is a letter that was referred to by my friend.  It's K00335032, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is correct.  Kindly give a copy to the witness, please, Registry.

Counsel, you may proceed.  We are with you.  If you give us the references, we will be able to find the documents because we have a whole pile of documents here before us.
MR. MONTHÉ:
On page 2 of the document which I mentioned a moment ago, and this is what the witness says: "When we left *******, I went by the school where I found Boniface Kabilisa, the watchman.  His colleague Bayingana, who stood guard with him, did not show up to work, and Boniface, who had spent the night alone, asked me to go to find Bayingana, who could relieve him.  I immediately went to the church and found many attackers there"; end of quotation.  My question for the witness is as follows.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Why, did you go to the church to look for this watchman and not elsewhere?
     (Pages 40 to 50 by Verna Butler)












	1600H
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  

Before I answer your question, may I address this Court?  I realise that the translation was not properly done, unless I am shown the original in Kinyarwanda so that I stand corrected.  In fact, the watchman who was on duty was Bayingana and it was Boniface who did not show up.  However, it is said here that it was Boniface who was not at work, while it was Bayingana. (sic)   Even Bayingana, who told me he had spent the night alone in the absence of his colleague, Boniface.  I don't know whether you will go about making the necessary correction or amendment, but I know fully well that in the various statements that I made I believe that it is Boniface who is said elsewhere to have shot at people at the church.   That having been said, I can answer the question which was put to me by counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I'm waiting for the answer to my question.  All those issues pertaining to translation do not concern me.  I am asking the witness why he went to look for this watchman at the church and not elsewhere.
THE WITNESS:
I myself, in turn, would like to know whether this error, which I have just mentioned, should be corrected.
MR. MONTHÉ:
This is the story of the fish eating its own tail.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think this is important for the witness because he has said that he wants it to be said that it's Boniface who went to look for the other and not Bayingana.  

So you went to look for Boniface at the church, is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you are being asked why you went to the church and not elsewhere in order to look for Boniface.  Can you answer that question?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.

THE WITNESS:
I went to look for this watchman at the church because Bayingana, whom I had found at his post, had just told me that Boniface had failed to show up for work and that he had spent the night at the roadblock with the attackers.  And he had told me that he was probably still with the attackers; the attackers with whom he had spent the night were probably at the church and they had launched another attack against the church.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now, since you've raised the issue, I want to speak to you about the roadblocks.  You said that your watchman was likely to have been seen at the roadblock.  Who was it who decided on the erection of the roadblocks within the commune?
A.	Normally that task was that of the security committee, because it was the one which decided the locations where the roadblocks were to be erected.  When the members noticed that there was an incident that may affect the security of the commune they would decide to erect a barrier,  a roadblock at a given place.
Q.	Very well.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, please refer to the witness's statement of 8th August 2002 and 
23rd February , 2003, K0264623 to 55, K0264623 to 55, fifth paragraph.  Presumably this would be for the French text.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to the presiding Judge.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I have found the English, but could you please give us the references for the statement in the English version?  It would seem like we are wasting quite a lot of time.  Please put your question to the witness.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would like to read the witness statement, given the references I've mentioned at paragraph 5, and the witness states to the investigators of the Prosecutor, "Fulgence Kayishema was the IPJ of the commune.  He directed all the attacks in the commune.  He was the one who decided where all the roadblocks of the commune were to be erected."  Now here comes my question.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, again I am loath to interrupt my friend, but since I was waiting to see where my friend was going with this I didn't want to make an objection too early, but if my friend is using the statement as a point of inconsistency, then there ought to be -- to put a full sum picture of what, in fact, the witness said in the statement.  I would ask the Court, without that I would mention exactly, I wouldn't read it because that would be unfair to my learned friend, but in the English version, at page 6, paragraph 2, starting with "Father".
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, you were saying, page 6 in the English version, K02600863, is that correct?
MS. ALEXIS:
I'm obliged.  In that paragraph, beginning with "Father", the first sentence beginning with, "It was" and ending with "due".  The sentence begins on the fourth line of that second paragraph, "It was".
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph is that, in the second one you said?
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President, second paragraph, it starts with "Father"; I am talking about two sentences.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Which page?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, may we have the page, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
"It was a member?"
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President.  Having regard -- sorry, I don't know if my friend is ready.  I will wait.  If my friends have seen where I was pointing to, Madam President, I would like to continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Monthé, have you located the passage?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, I have, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, he's found it.
MS. ALEXIS:
I'm obliged to my friend.  

Madam President, having regard to what was said here, I was merely wondering if my friend -- if both passages were to be read together.  If my friend really wished to raise this issue as a point of inconsistency and if he does, Madam President, having regard to the joint effect of what has been said in the statement, I do not agree that there has been an inconsistency, and I would like to so place on the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  We were wondering if we should continue or if this would be an appropriate time for a 15-minute break.  Normally, we are going to sit until 5:30 this evening.

MR. MONTHÉ:
Well, then, we can take a break, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé prefers to take a break.  We shall do so, therefore; 15 minutes break.  We adjourn for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1620Hto 1635H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
      Proceedings are resumed. 
      
      Mr. Monthé, you have the floor.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I must say that I did not understand if my learned colleague was making an objection earlier or if she was just raising a translation issue.  I must admit that I'm a bit lost.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You're referring to the document?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, regarding the question that I put to the witness.  I was interrupted and I didn't entirely understand what the issue was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, she wanted to draw your attention to the difference between the English version and the French version of the text.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I don't believe there is any difference, whatsoever, and once again, the Prosecutor acted too quickly.  I'm not saying that I read English, but I would ask you to refer to the document. Look at K0260861 in the English version, K0260861.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph?
MR. MONTHÉ:
The very first paragraph of the English document, K0260861, first paragraph in the English version.  If you have that document before you it says, "Fulgence Kayishema was the IPJ of the commune.  He was the leader of all the attacks in the commune. He was the one who decided where to erect all the roadblocks in the commune."  Once again, I was prohibited from putting a question to the witness and I was speaking about things that were said and written down on paper.  So I don't see where the translation issue -- there's no problem here.  What the Prosecutor indicated, at the end of the statement in French, K0264656 is exactly what I raised.  I that think we are making to much of this and forgetting the document we have right before us.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I was actually not bringing to the attention of the Court a translation issue.  My issue was this, that it doesn't matter which statement it is, whether it is in the French or in the English.  What I'm saying -- and my example was the English statement since this is my mother tongue -- what I'm saying is that the witness had said -- had given a particular version in answer to my friend in cross-examination.  My friend is raising what the witness said about Kayishema, Fulgence, as a point of inconsistency.  All I was saying, Madam President, is that this is not the end of what the witness said in the statement.  This witness said this about Fulgence Kayishema, but he also said what I had pointed out to the Honourable Court, which is actually not inconsistent with what the witness had said.  So that, all I was suggesting is that it did not appear to me that, if one read both what the witness said about Kayishema and as well as what the witness said with respect to the duties of the security committee, that the statement -- the statement is not inconsistent with what the witness gave in evidence.  And if my learned friend wishes to put the statement, the sentences from the written statement, he must put both, to be fair to the witness, for the record to read in a particular fashion.  Because to put before the witness only that -- what he said in Court is inconsistent with what he said Kayishema said, is not to be putting the entire picture before this Honourable Tribunal.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, we followed you.  

Madam President, if I had been listened to, I was going to read this statement out to the Chamber and say that in fact the witness had said something else.  I couldn't only tell you about this and bring something else up later and say they were different.  In fact, the translation is very good here.  With your leave, I would like to, once again, put this question to the witness, although we've lost a lot of time on this question and I would like to put it to the witness, what is the situation exactly?  I don't know if he's understood the question because there were many interruptions, but perhaps I can put the question to the witness to find out finally what indeed happened.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, put your question to the witness again.
MR. MONTHÉ:
	Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Witness, in your statement of 8th August 2002 and 24 February 2003 you said the following, at K0264656 you say the following.  "Fulgence Kayishema was the IPJ of the commune.  He was the leader of all the attacks in the commune.  He was the one who decided where to erect all roadblocks in the commune."  In the same document, towards the end of your statement, you say, "Father Seromba was a member of the security committee of Kivumu.  This was a permanent committee which was responsible for assessing the state of security in the commune.  The committee did not hold meetings every day; the committee met only when there was a problem in the commune.  It was the members of this committee who determined where roadblocks should be set up." 

Here is my question, therefore, Witness:  Was Mr. Kayishema the one who decided to put up the roadblocks or was it the committee which decided to do so?

THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Madam President, in fact, Counsel should not dwell on these issues too much.  In fact, the information in this statement is complete.  The bourgmestre is in charge of security in the commune.  He, himself, had to decide when to put up roadblocks, but since he wasn't there, Kayishema, as the police inspector, along with other people who assisted him, on the 7th decided to erect a few roadblocks, ones they considered urgent, and if I'm not mistaken, that was on the 7th.  When the bourgmestre arrived on the 9th, he called a meeting on the 11th.  During that meeting, as I said before, not everyone was present, but decisions were taken, given the circumstances that prevailed at the time.  Seromba participated in that meeting of the 11th.  At that meeting it was decided to erect other roadblocks.  So if I said that Kayishema led the attacks and decided to erect some roadblocks, and if I say that Seromba participated in the meeting and that he was the member of a security committee, I don't see where there's a problem.  The Catholic Church had many followers in that region.  It was an influential church in the region.  So be it under normal circumstances or under particular circumstances, the security committee could make decisions, as could any single member of the committee.  Later on, they could annul one of the decisions made by a committee member.  So Kayishema or the president of the canton tribunal took a decision to set up some roadblocks.  Thereafter, when the bourgmestre came back, it was decided that other roadblocks would be set up.  So I don't see the problem there. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	There is indeed a problem because if it is a committee, necessarily it means that it's just not one person.  Just to be clear, was it one single person who decided or was it a committee which decided?  I simply wanted to point this out.  And I note your response.  But as regards the issue of the committee, you have different answers to the questions.  Let me put this to you, Witness: did you raise the issue of what happened at Nyange with the organisation African Rights?
A.	It is difficult for me to answer that question.  When people came to see me I spoke to them.  I don't quite remember someone who came on behalf of the African Rights association.  People did come to see us and ask us questions, but I don't remember all of it; for example, you're asking questions about Kayishema.  If someone else asked me a question regarding the communal council, I will answer that question based on the question put to me.  I don't clearly understand, therefore, Counsel.
Q.	Well, we're trying to seek out the truth here, Witness.  Witness, in your guilty plea of ******* 1999, K0335635, page 15, you say the following, Witness -- K0335649 as regards the French version.
MR. MONTHÉ:
And, unfortunately, Madam President, I don't seem to have an English version.  I have no English version, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have the document in French, we do not have it in English. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, in that document, French version, on the second paragraph of 15, it is stated, "As the bodies of the victims were too many in the church courtyard, Father Seromba asked Ndugutse and the gendarmes to put a stop to the killings and to start first bearing the bodies.  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Here's my question: how can the witness know that Father Seromba gave such orders to the gendarmes and to Ndugutse?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  If you clearly followed my testimony, I said that I personally went to look for the bulldozers so that those bodies could be buried.  Ndugutse, in fact, sent me.  As I said, he talked with Father Seromba.  And when they came back they told me that they had agreed and that Seromba believed that there were many bodies and, therefore, they had to be removed, and it wasn't a good thing to leave them lying on the ground.  So Father Seromba deemed it necessary to first bury the bodies and then to resume the killings afterwards.  Ndugutse told me this after speaking with Father Seromba.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I simply wanted to point out for the witness that other witnesses came before this Tribunal and said that the bulldozers were found by Kayishema who went to go and seek them.  I'm not going to say who is right here, but I simply wanted to point out that inconsistency. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	I have a question for you, Witness.  I'm still dealing with your guilty plea.  This is the first paragraph of page K0335650, which in fact is page 16 of the French version.  In the first paragraph you say, "Father Seromba asked the assailants to go and kill the Tutsis who were inside the church and not those who were at the presbytery."  So my question is the following: why would Father Seromba, who, according to you, had decided to exterminate the Tutsis, why would he discriminate between the Tutsis at the church and those at the presbytery?
A.	Thank you.  First, let me comment on what you said.  You said that some witnesses said that Kayishema brought the bulldozers.  Let me tell you that I personally went to the Astaldi worksite.  I went by the school.  If Kayishema arrived with the bulldozers, I don't see what the problem could have been.  There were other -- there were bulldozers that were dispatched the day the church was destroyed.  I'm saying this to shed light on these matters for the Chamber, to shed light on the circumstances regarding the arrival of the bulldozers.  Now, regarding Father Seromba and the question of discrimination that you raised, Counsel, I believe he said that you had to start with the Tutsis inside the church.  Now, that -- so that they would not come and destroy the property at the presbytery.  For him it was preferable for them to be killed outside of the presbytery.  I thought that he was thinking about the property belonging to the parish and how to protect it.  It wasn't because he pitied those people who were in the back courtyard that he said that; he simply thought it best to deal with those inside the church and he wanted to protect the property of the presbytery.  That is how I understood it. 
Q.	Witness, in the parish, as you said, and I think we understand each other because you do speak French, there is the church, the presbytery and everything surrounding it.  Can you reasonably tell us that the priest in charge of that parish would make a distinction between the church, where he gives mass every day, and the presbytery where he lives.  Doesn't all that property belong to the parish?
A.	What you are saying is correct; all of that property belongs to the parish, but I'm telling you he wanted to keep the homes intact, the homes in which they lived.  Even today those buildings are intact; however, that church no longer exists.  All of that took place in front of his very own eyes. 
Q.	Witness, let me go back to what you said in the very beginning.  You wanted to go and get the bulldozers instead of other people.  Why would you be the one to go and get the bulldozers, you who were an outsider, if you will, to that situation and to those people?
A.	They are the ones who should answer that question.  I told you that those people found me there.  They told me to go and deliver that message, and I don't deny that.  If someone else was sent, you can say that, but the fact remains that I was sent and upon my return I passed by the school -- that I should also point out -- but as regard your question, it is up to them to tell you.  They arrived and they sent me to deliver that message to commandeer that equipment. 
Q.	Tell me, Witness: how were you able to commandeer bulldozers; by virtue of which title?  You said you were ***********.
A.	I, myself, did not commandeer the bulldozers; I delivered a message to the persons concerned.  Indeed, I was ************************************.  Even when I was, I was in charge ************************.  So when that company set up shop in our area, I worked with the employees of that company.  When it was decided that ********************************, for example, I worked with them, but in this particular instance I delivered a message and I even knew the people I was giving it to because I worked with them, as I explained moments ago.  So there's nothing strange about me being sent.  And the people who sent me were ***************.  It is true that I was no longer *****************************, but I had worked with them in the past.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what your exact role was during the events?  You were everywhere, ***************************, at Kanyarukiga's pharmacy, at the communal office, at the church, you were everywhere.  There were killings, there was insecurity.  What were you doing all about?
A.	I told you the truth.  I told you where I was and what I did.  Moreover, I don't believe that someone told you that something bad happened at ********** when I was there.  No one ever said that something occurred at ********** while I was there, and given the prevailing circumstances, it was normal for a citizen to move about to see how things were developing, how the situation was developing.  I would like to point out that my activities and my profession at the time were such that I moved about.  I don't see what the problem there is.  I simply told you what I did everywhere I went.  I don't know if you're familiar with these places.  Moreover, Counsel, I don't know if you can evaluate what kinds of trips I took from one place to another so that you can say that it's unlikely. 
Q.	You said yourself that while you were at the church there were people who died and that you participated in an attack where people died.  That is an observation.  That's in the file, in the case file.  But you were afraid of the political powers and you were afraid of reprisals, and even with that fear you were everywhere, even with the attackers.  How do you explain that, Witness?
A.	There's nothing surprising about that.  If you look at the days when the attacks took place, you can even do some investigations yourself if you like.  People will tell you that I participated in the attack that took place at the parish.  Perhaps that seems outrageous to you, but I didn't say that all the Tutsis in that area died at the parish; others were killed elsewhere.  You will be able to find information about me at other places where there were other attacks, and if you found other information, I'd be very surprised.  Instructions were given.  We were supposed to be visible.  If you didn't see someone, questions were asked.  You could be considered as an accomplice.  I couldn't abruptly leave the area and go home.  That was impossible.  I went about here and there so that the authorities could see me, but that does not mean that I had particular duties and responsibilities.  They wanted to show the people that the authorities were there, that everyone was there, that we subscribe to what they were doing.  I could not, once I arrived to a place, claim I had something to do at home and go home.  That would not have been well received by the authorities.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  At that time you didn't want to appear to be an accomplice.  Have you become an accomplice today?
A.	No, I am not an accomplice, no.  Even then I wasn't an accomplice.  Quite simply, that is how one would have been considered.  I don't think you ever heard of any state secret that I infringed upon.  It was one way of looking at things.  Even right now I am no one's accomplice.  I'm speaking the truth.  I'm talking about events I eyewitnessed or things which I was told.  Consequently, you cannot tell me that I am an accomplice of whosoever it may be.   Quite simply, the time arrived -- the time came for us to shed light on what happened.  I'm not anyone's accomplice.  And if you're not on the same wavelength as someone, maybe you could be considered as an accomplice or whatever, but otherwise I'm not an accomplice. 
Q.	Thank you.  You have stated and argued that Father Seromba had worked at the church to ensure the extermination of the Tutsis and you say this on the basis of the fact that you claim he ensured that those who had sought refuge in the church be -- first of all, he encouraged that they be removed and then he also was for the destruction of the church.  Now, here's my question: if Father Seromba wanted the Tutsis to be killed during that period of time, it would have been easier for him not to welcome them into the church.  He could have simply closed the doors of the church and left them at the mercy of the attackers.  How is it that you say that he gave them refuge and then subsequently that he encouraged that they be killed?
A.	It would be better for you to repeat your question.  I didn't quite understand it, especially the very beginning.
Q.	With pleasure, Witness.  I put it to you that you alleged that Father Seromba attended meetings and participated in the extermination of the Tutsis at the church, but you also said that he welcomed them into the church and that if he had wished the latter to be killed, he would not have received them, he would have left them to the mercy of the attackers who were attacking the church.  And you say that he preferred to have the church destroyed.  Why would that have been the case?
A.	Thank you.  If he welcomed these refugees into his church, as I've said in my statement, that was decided on by the meeting, given that he was going to make them believe that there was security, and this was not the first time that people had been saved because they found refuge in churches.  Security was assured to them in the churches and they were told that they wouldn't be killed, but when they got to the church -- if this is not clear in my statement, I do believe that these people were indeed in the church, but for someone who was going from meeting to meeting and preparing their massacre, if he didn't want them to be killed there, he would have alerted them, he would have warned them because there are cases of people who are able to cross the river.  So, in brief, lies were told to them.  They were informed that there would be security in the church and in the commune so that they could be assembled and killed.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mr. Witness, you also argued that Father Seromba allegedly accepted, without any hesitation, the option for the church to be destroyed as had been suggested to him.  How can you confirm such a statement?  Are you able to do so?
A.	I confirm that statement because it's not difficult to understand.  I told you that there was a meeting in the pharmacy belonging to Kanyarukiga.  At the end of that meeting, he came to say that they were short of bullets and that the only way to go about it was to destroy the church.  I was present.  I could see him.  He was on the verandah of the secretariat.  He agreed when the bourgmestre and others offered him that option.
Q.	But now, Mr. Witness, when you say you were present, and you saw him on the verandah, what verandah are you talking about?  Were you attending that meeting?
A.	I have told you that he was standing on the verandah of the parish secretariat building.  As for being at the meeting, I don't know what you're referring to as "the meeting".  I was simply following what was happening.  Everybody could see what was happening and there was no longer any secret.
Q.	So you were saying that there was a meeting, so -- and that everybody was following what was happening.  So there was no meeting, was there?
A.	I think if you had followed what I was saying in my testimony, you would realise that the authorities went into the pharmacy, they discussed and they came close to where he was in front of the secretariat.  It's up to you as a lawyer to say whether that gathering was a meeting or not.  It's up to you to determine or define what a meet -- what that situation was.  I have described it as it was.  There were many people.  There are those people who are directly involved or concerned by a situation, and what was of interest to me in this situation was the people who consulted one another and came to a decision.  It's up to you, therefore, to determine what that gathering was according to the law. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I now want to look at page 18, K0335652, of your confession, and this is dated ************ 1999.  I've already referred to this document.  And you state at the third paragraph --
MR MONTHÉ:
Madam President, for your benefit, paragraph 3, and the beginning of the sentence appears at the end of the line.  Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	"And I tried -- I tried to stop the people from taking away the dead bodies as confirmed by my accuser Charles Kagenza.  Can you tell us why, after having these Tutsis welcomed in the church, some of them were killed?  Why did you not stop the killings and then you stop people from looting from the dead bodies?  Why did you do that?  Can you tell us?
A.	Thank you.  I think there's nothing strange in that.  I did, indeed, say that there was throwing of stones on the 15th.  Now, the looting from the victims, I stopped that from happening on the 16th.  I stopped the attackers from looting from the victims and yet I didn't stop them from the killings.  Those are two separate issues.  The planning of the killings was supported by several individuals who were more powerful than myself; whereas, the looting from the victims was an individual initiative taken by the inhabitants.  No one was there to stop them from doing so.  Even if, according to law, looting from a victim is something which ought not to be done.  It was not possible for the attackers to be stopped from killing because they had apparently received orders to kill. 
Q.	I'm realising that you are still in the location to stop the looting, so you were also at ******** and you were surveying what the attackers were doing?
A.	I think I have explained this adequately.  I went to the church and when I met the bourgmestre and the policemen who were going to attack, I changed my mind and I then went to the parish.  First of all, through my statement, I admitted that between 7:30 and 8:00 in the morning I was at the parish.  This was the very moment when the bourgmestre started to shoot at the victims.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have given the impression or, rather, you said that Father Seromba had helped in bringing the refugees out of the church so that they can be killed.  Can you please tell the Chamber now how he went about doing that?
A.	I don't know whether you heard that today.  Nowhere did I say that he removed the refugees from the church.  In my statement I said that while stones were being thrown left and right, the refugees were outside in the open air, outside the church.  Maybe you know how they came out of the church, or maybe it was the father, the priest who took them out of the church.  All I know is that they were killed in the church and some other refugees were outside the church and they were cut up with bladed objects when they were trying to get into the church, but nowhere did I state that I know how they were made to get out of the church.  Maybe you're better informed than I am.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement of 8th August 2002 and 24th February 2003, K0264656.  In the first -- third of that page and the words are "Pendant ce temps", "During that time", I believe in the English. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you kindly repeat the references.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, by all means.  It is the statement of 8 August '02 to 24 February 2003 and the K-number is K0264656.  That is the relevant pages.  K0260862 in the English.  And it's at the second line of that page, page 50/8. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I do beg your pardon, page five of eight pages, line 2. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, the witness states the following:  

"Father Seromba was standing in front of the presbytery."  
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	My question to the witness is as follows: what could Father Seromba do, given that there was this crowd of attackers?
A.	Did I say that he did anything whatsoever?  I indeed said that on the 15th, when I saw him standing in the location, he didn't do anything.  He was there -- he is there.  You can ask him what he could have done.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you came from very far in order to come and testify and now you're making accusations.  So please answer the question.  You said at the end of your statement you were ready to come to Arusha, so please answer my questions.
A.	As I have already stated, and I stand by my word, I am still ready to testify on events to which I was an eyewitness; otherwise, ask me what such-and-such a person did or what a such-and-such a person's obligations were.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm not refusing to testify.  When you say that you saw someone standing and you are asking me what he ought to have done, I do not know how to answer you, given the fact that we are all here before this Tribunal and we are looking for the truth about what happened.  Therefore, you can ask him what he could have done because he is there with you.  He was just looking at what was happening.  Maybe he was the one who would have been able to determine what he could have done.  So I do not think that you can look at that as testimony I could have given.  What you should maybe look at is what could have been done.
Q.	So what could have been done, according to you?  What could have been done? 
A.	If we were to look at this as a discussion, if he accepted to provide shelter to the refugees, if he was feeling pity for them, he could have at least asked for help.  He should have warned them of the danger so that they can manage on their own.  He shouldn't have remained there being passive, looking on to see what was happening.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know that Father Seromba sought and received the assistance of the gendarmerie at the parish?  Are you aware of that?
A.	I saw gendarmes myself.  I do not know the circumstances under which they came.  All I know is that those who were there came together with the bourgmestre, maybe on the 10th or on the 11th.  If those gendarmes had been brought by Father Seromba, he's better informed.  What I know is that I saw gendarmes and throughout the period of the killings there was a gendarmes next to him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Monthé, it is now 5:30.  Do you still have many questions for this witness? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Yes, I do still have quite a few.  Maybe we can stop here and continue tomorrow, by your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time would you need tomorrow morning in order to finish? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I can tell you that we'll finish tomorrow morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow morning.  Very well.  So kindly prepare the next witness for tomorrow morning, Madam Prosecutor.  Very well.  

We are going to rise, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, we thank you for your testimony.  We shall resume tomorrow at nine o'clock in order to continue with your cross-examination by the Defence.  

Thank you one and all.  Have a good evening.  The session stands adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
