MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

I hear lots of humming, but I think we should able to hear each other in spite of it all.  I think there's a technical problem, so if you can see to that.  I can't hear anything.  We ourselves cannot hear anything.  Are things going to be sorted out?  

Are things getting any better?  (No interpretation)...can the technicians be of some assistance to us here?
(Technicians approach the Bench)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Madam President say something so we can know.  (No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)  

Mr. Technician, can you come and see what's happening here with the microphone.  

(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I can hear the President.  I don't know about the French booth.  (No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)... Très bien.  (No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You want me to say something or is it for the Prosecutor to see if they can hear me?  Yeah, you can hear me but we still have this hum, this background noise.  I don't now how it's going to look like when we start working, but probably we could give it a try. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I fortunately have no such hum.  I hear very clearly. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, we can hear the Kinyarwanda booth -- thank you -- which means we can, present, set the ball rolling.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Thank you.  

I would like first of all to thank the interpreters, the parties, especially those who took part at this morning's sessions in order for us to make some progress with respect to the translation of some documents.  We had a report to the effect that out of the 465 pages that were supposed to be translated, about 97 of them had been translated.  We are now trying to put them together in order to disclose them to the Defence and we hope this should help them in their work.  

Right now we have Witness CBS, who apparently did not have any problem with disclosures, like other witnesses, so we can begin with the examination-in-chief of that witness. 

Mr. Witness, good afternoon.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Madam President, good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness for the Prosecution.  Here, you will be known as Witness CBS.  You will be led in evidence by the Prosecutor, after which you will be cross-examined by the Defence.  We will invite you to listen keenly to the questions that will be put to you and to provide a concise answer thereto.  But before that, you will have to take a solemn declaration.  You'll make a solemn declaration.  

And, please, Registry, can you assist us in this.
(Declaration made by Witness CBS in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Madam Prosecutor, you may begin to lead the witness in evidence-in-chief. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President.  

Madam President, might the witness be shown the protected information sheet, and might an interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth please assist the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have an interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth to move closer to the witness. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has a problem insofar as his occupation is concerned.  The post he used to hold, as written in the sheet, he had that, rather, from '80 to '96 instead of '80 to '94.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the correction be made.  And there he can sign where he made the correction.  
Thank you, Madam Interpreter.  
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I think there's a problem on the identification document, the last thing that was put there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I requested the court assistant to draw his attention to that problem, Madam Prosecutor, as concerns the cellule. 
MS. ALEXIS:
The cellule?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Apparently there's a problem with the cellule. 
MR. POGNON:
Or, rather, it's the commune.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So it is -- the problem is with the commune.  It's the name of the commune instead of the cellule. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, it depends on how you read it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The problem is the word coming after; that is, you give the name and then what comes after, because the name of the commune is there.  What we saw, therefore, is supposed to be the cellule and not the commune.  Very good.  

So please show the document to the witness and we can append his signature on it, at the bottom. 

Madam Prosecutor, you may take the floor. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President.  

The difficulty is one of language.  The witness does not understand the registrar and the registrar does not understand the witness.  It is easily resolved, Madam President, by me asking the witness direct questions which would be interpreted to him. 






WITNESS CBS
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the contents of that document have been read to you?
A.	Yes.  I understood, but I am being asked about the date of today so that I can sign. 
Q.	Witness --
A.	So I should be told what is the date of today, after which I will sign.
Q.	Okay, Witness, you will sign in a while.  Can you answer my questions and we'll get to your signature.  My apologies.  Very well.  That document, the contents of it, has it been read to you?
A.	Yes, the contents of the document have been read to me.
MS. ALEXIS:
Sorry, interpreters. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	And do you agree that those contents represent your personal information?
A.	Yes, it is true, those are my personal particulars, of course, if we take account of the change that has been made where there was an error, but the rest is correct.
Q.	Very well.  Having so confirmed, Witness, can you do this Court the honour of signing your name and placing the date, which is the 5th of October 2004, next to your signature.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, that document, having been confirmed by the witness, I now ask that this Court admit this document as Prosecution Exhibit No. 13.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection from the Defence side?  Good.  

The document is therefore admitted as a Prosecution exhibit and numbered P. 13 -- P. 12, I beg your pardon.
(Exhibit No. P. 12 admitted, under seal)
MS. ALEXIS:
And, Madam President, since this document contains the personal particulars of this witness, might this document be placed under seal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document is placed under seal. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged. 

BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, do you recall the death of the president of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, he died on the 6th, during the night.  However, we learned of the death of the president in the morning on the 7th.
Q.	Witness --
A.	And we learnt of it over the radio.
Q.	After the death of President Habyarimana, can you describe the security situation in your area, and that is without giving us particulars of your area.
A.	After the death of President Habyarimana and when we learned of that news -- well, a press release was read over the radio, and everybody was forbidden from going out of their homes, and all gathering of more than four persons was also forbidden.  In my locality, security became undermined, became precarious, especially as the Hutus in the locality started looking at us with ill-will, our colleagues, neighbours.  Tutsi were accused of being the cause of the death of the president.
Q.	At this time, after the death of President Habyarimana, can you tell us whether anything happened to the Tutsis in your area?
A.	In the area in which I used to live, the Hutu inhabitants started eating cows belonging to Tutsi.  In fact, we realised that the Tutsi were no longer safe and they spent their night in bushes, in particular, on the Murambi hill that was opposite our own hill.  And it is then that, on Sunday, people started being attacked.  The next day and Monday, on our hill, people started killing the Tutsi, and that is the day on which my father was killed.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, who spearheaded the attack against your father?
A.	The people were my neighbours.  I can't say they were people who came from afar.  They were Hutus who were our neighbours.  The ringleader of the attack that was launched against our family was a certain *********************************************************************************, and other people whom I did not know.  The persons whose names I have given are the only ones that I was able to identify. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, when was your father attacked?
A.	We were attacked on Monday evening.
Q.	And, Witness, if you can, can you give us the date of that Monday evening?
A.	That Monday evening was the 11th.
Q.	And which month was that?
A.	The month of April.
Q.	Witness, after the death of your father, what did you do?
A.	After they had killed my father, I was in the vicinity.  The other members of the family had dispersed because they were fleeing.  In fact, I almost spent the night in the location and I left at dawn.  I met my mother and my junior brothers, who had spent the night in our neighbours'  homes.  It is then that we took the decision to go and take refuge at the parish.  We were hearing that other persons had gone there to seek refuge. 
Q.	And when you said you went to seek refuge at the parish, can you tell us in particular which parish do you speak of?
A.	I was talking about the Nyange parish.
Q.	And, Witness, what is the approximate date that you went to Nyange parish?
A.	It was Tuesday morning, and that was the 12th, and we got there very early in the morning.  We found other refugees there and there were very many refugees that we found there.
Q.	How, meaning by what means, did you go to the church?
A.	We went through the bushes and at all times we tried to avoid dangerous areas.  Definitely at certain points we had to go by the road, but we passed through the bushes.
Q.	And why would you have considered some areas to be dangerous?
A.	This is as a result of the fact that people had started setting up roadblocks at which people of the Tutsi ethnic group were being killed.  So when you had to travel, you wouldn't take roads that were well known; you would take other roads by taking roundabout ways or detours.
Q.	Witness, what made you decide to go to that church?
A.	We took that decision because in 1990, in the Kibirira commune, the present district of Nyagasagara, there was unrest there and people who had been unable to take refuge at churches were saved, and that is the reason wherefore we decided to go and take refuge in the church, believing that we would be safe there.
Q.	And, Witness, you told us that you saw very many people on your arrival at that church.  Can you tell us what was the ethnicity of these persons?
A.	The Tutsi were the ones who had begun to take refuge there.
Q.	And can you tell us, Witness, the approximate number of these Tutsis that you saw gathered at the church on the day of your arrival?
A.	We spent the days in the courtyard and at night we will be inside the church, but the number of people increased on Wednesday, and I'll see if I can give you the estimate.  I would say that the number of refugees totalled 2,000.
Q.	Once the refugees arrived at the church, were they permitted to leave the church compound?
A.	No, we were not allowed to leave the compound, since that location had already been surrounded by gendarmes.
Q.	Whilst were you at that church, can you tell us, Witness, whether any of the refugees were taken away by anyone?
A.	No, people were not taken out of that place, but on the Thursday some Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men came out of there.  Fulgence, who was the criminal police inspector, came and took them out.
Q.	Can you tell us, if you recall, Witness, approximately how many of these women were taken away?
A.	I believe there were three of them, but I could identify only one of them called Nyiramtama (phonetic).  I did not know the names of the others.  Nyiramatama lived in Nyange secteur. 
Q.	On the arrival of the refugees to the church, did any one of the refugees -- or did any of the refugees, arrive at that church with things with which to defend themselves?
A.	No.  There were two or three doors to enter into the church.  The gendarmes had surrounded the church.  When you went inside the church, as you were going inside, if you had a stick, you were asked to put it down before going inside.  But refugees, when they were leaving their homes, had those equipment or things which they laid down when they arrived at the church.
Q.	Whilst you were at Nyange church, did you receive anything to eat?
A.	No food was given to us, but some teachers asked the priests to give them food, food which was normally meant for the poor and which was stored at CARITAS, but the priest who was present on the premises did not give them the food, and that is Father Seromba.  When we were refused food, we went into the banana plantation.  We found bananas there and we roasted them.  When the priest came and saw the smoke, he ordered the gendarmes to shoot at anyone who would go into the banana plantation, that is, amongst the Inyenzi.  We therefore had nothing to eat then up to the end. 
Q.	When the teachers requested food from Father Seromba, can you give us the approximate date?
A.	It was on the 13th; it was a Wednesday.
Q.	And if you recall, Witness, can you tell us the names of these persons who requested food from Father Seromba?
A.	There was a teacher called Charles Rutagesa (phonetic).  Another was called Anicet Gatare (phonetic). 
Q.	And you told us that Father Seromba responded.  Can you tell us what, if any, response was made by Father Seromba when the teachers asked him for food?
A.	He said that did he not have to give food to those who were there.  He said he did not have any.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, this conversation, did you hear it or --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, it seems there is overlap between the witness and the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, please observe a pause between the answer and your questions. 
MS. ALEXIS:
I am guided, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, this conversation between the priest Father Seromba and the teachers, did you hear it yourself or did someone tell you?
A.	I myself heard those statements. 
Q.	Using this -- the dimensions of this court, if it is possible, Witness, can you indicate to us how far away Father Seromba was from you when you had this conversation with the teachers?
MR. POGNON:
Objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
It is true that we have the plan of the courtroom, but there's a problem.  I don't understand how we can use the courtroom as dimensions or specifications, whereas he was in the open, where distances could have nothing to do with this courtroom.  That is why I am objecting.  This question is a leading question, seemingly to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, we believe you should perhaps ask the question in two phases.  Start by asking the witness at what distance he was from that person, because it could be well beyond the dimensions of this courtroom, and if the witness gives you an approximate distance, you can then try to use the dimensions of the courtroom to have a more precise idea of the distance. 
MS. ALEXIS:
I am guided by the Court, but I must say that I don't agree with Defence counsel that it was a leading question.  But I am guided by the Court and will do so accordingly.  Thank you. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us, if you can, approximately how far you were from Father Seromba when this conversation took place between Father Seromba and the teachers?
A.	Between the place where I was in the courtyard, very close to the parish buildings, and the position where they were, were about four metres.  It is as if I could see somebody there.  When they asked for food, I was standing up and I could follow the conversation. 
Q.	And since, Witness, you could follow this conversation, can you tell us exactly what Father Seromba said?
MR. POGNON:
Objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
The question was asked and the witness answered.  He said that he did not have food; that he did not have any.  It was noted.  That was in -- at the beginning of this afternoon session.  So to ask the witness to repeat the question is to suggest something else to the witness.  I think the records speak for themselves, can be verified. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if I may.  Perhaps there is an issue, a very small one, but a very important one nonetheless, and it was one of interpretation and translation.  I heard a word, and I am not certain that it came out in the French translation.  I am reluctant to say this word lest I be accused of prompting the witness and that was the question I asked again in order to be clear that everyone heard what, in fact, I did.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, can you please rephrase your question. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President.  I'm obliged. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, you said you heard what Father Seromba said.  If you can recall when Father Seromba responded to the teachers, did he pinpoint any particular ethnic group?
MR. POGNON:
Objection.  Objection.  Objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the answer was given; it can be read.  It can be verified on the records.  But if the Prosecutor wants to get something else out of the witness, that is something else, because the answer was given.  I don't know whether the Chamber, by asking that the question be rephrased, counsels the answer given.  But now I observe that by rephrasing the question, the Prosecutor wants the witness to say something else.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am not sure we understood what you said correctly, from what you said.  Because as far as we are concerned, we didn't think it was a leading question.  We asked the Prosecutor to rephrase it because we were not very sure that there was some fidelity between the English and the French as to what the witness was expected to say.  

As regards your objection, I believe the Prosecutor could answer your objection, since you raised an objection. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. POGNON:
I would propose that we proceed under the circumstances as is the case before the Chamber.  When a question has been asked and we have to rephrase it, we have to look at the previous question to see if that was the question that was asked.  I believe the Prosecutor is rephrasing the question.  The problem may be one of translation because I speak French and the others speak English.  So what should be done is to ask the interpreters what question was asked and what answers were given by the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't know whether the interpreters can assist us.  Are you in a position to help us? 
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
You are right, Madam President; we interpret as we go along.  We do not remember what is said well before then.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, would you like to answer the objection or rephrase your question again? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, with the greatest of respect to my friend, I fear that if I rephrase the question that there would be yet another objection and these proceedings would be further protracted.  Perhaps the issue could be solved if the Court is so minded, Madam President, to have the witness leave the court for a very, very short time.  Then I can say openly, without fear of contaminating the witness, to say what is at issue.  If the Court is so minded, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please take off your ear sets.  

Does the witness speak English?  Does he understand English?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, the witness -- Mr. Pognon, can I finish speaking, please.  Thank you.  

Madam President, the witness does not speak English, but the -- there is a particular word which in fact is a word that the witness will understand.  So in all fairness to the Accused, the witness should not be in court at all. 
MR. POGNON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Pognon. 
MR. POGNON:
The witness speaks Kinyarwanda, Swahili, French and English.  This document is from the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, we do not deem it necessary to have the witness taken out of the courtroom.  The question that you asked, as far as we are concerned, should be rephrased, or you just have to move on to another question.  Because you made mention of ethnicity, and that appears somewhat -- whatever mention is made of ethnicity, it could lead the witness towards a certain answer.  This is the approach we are making in your regard.  Either you rephrase the question or you move on to another question. 

Witness, could you please put on your headset, please. 
MS. ALEXIS:
I'm obliged to the Court.  But, Madam President, another solution occurs to me, and perhaps I should tell the Court and see if it finds approval.  Perhaps the audio of what has occurred during the last -- what has been answered during the last few questions can be read back to us, if that is within the approval of the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't know what is happening, but we are having problems with the ear sets again.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, would you like to rephrase your question or to ask it again? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I was merely suggesting, subject to the approval of the Court, that what would assist is that, since the interpreters cannot remember and, of course, it is difficult for them to do so, perhaps the audio cassettes, which I believe are made simultaneously, could be read over to us, if that meets with the approval of the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Honourable Judge will read the question again for us.
JUDGE HOKBÖRG:
This is on line 23.  

Question: "Witness, can you tell us, if you can, approximately how far you were from Father Seromba when this conversation took place between Father Seromba and the teachers?"  

Answer: "Between the place where I was in the courtyard, very close to the parish buildings, and the position where they were, were about four metres.  It is as if I could see somebody there.  When they asked for food, I was standing up and I could follow the conversation." 

Question:  "And since, Witness, you could follow this conversation, can you tell us exactly what 
Father Seromba said."

And then Maître Pognon made his objection.
MR. POGNON:
The question came before.  The issue regarding four metres came later.  The witness was asked whether he heard the conversation himself and he said he yes, indeed, he heard it himself.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have to go a little further up then.  Please.
JUDGE HOKBÖRG:
I don't know if this is the one.  It starts on line 19.

Question: "And if you recall, Witness, can you tell us the names of these persons who requested food from Father Seromba?"

[Answer] "There was a teacher called Charles Rutagesa.  Another was called Anicet Gatare."

Question: "And you told us that Father Seromba responded.  Can you tell us what, if any, response was made by Father Seromba when the teachers asked him for food?"

Answer:  "He said that did he not have to give food to those who were there.  He said he did not have any."

[Question] "Can you tell us, Witness, this conversation, did you hear it or --"

And then there was an overlap.  Is that it?
MS. ALEXIS:
No, please.  Your Honour, the question was, if I remember, "Whilst you were at the church, did anybody receive anything to eat," and his answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Listen, do you remember the question that you asked?  I think I remember that you asked the witness whether these words were targeting a particular ethnic group.  
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, the question that the Prosecutor put the first time regarding whether or not the witness and others received food is this: "Did you ask for food from Father Seromba?"  So it was after the question of the bananas, after the team that went to see the Prosecutor, and then he referred to some names, and then he said Father Seromba said that he did not have any food.  He was asked whether it was a question that he heard about or that he heard himself, and he answered that he himself heard these words spoken.  This is the time at which he was asked how far he was.  He gave the distance at which he estimated at four metres.  

I write very fast on paper, and every single question -- and I write down everything.  The draft will show that there was a question and there was an answer given.  If we can go in the direction that Madam President, you yourself gave, then let's do that; let's make some progress.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You're saying that in the direction that we gave? 
MR. POGNON:
Yes, because the draft shows she tried to ask what the man Father Seromba said, and that is why she's asking this question.  She wants to find a particular answer.  The witness gave the answer that he gave without any details as to ethnic origin.  I think that the Prosecution wishes to have something said about the ethnic origin, which is why the question is being put.  If he has not said something, he must not be made to say it.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President.  Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We've lost a lot of time for nothing.  Actually, everything has been taken down.  We have not been able to find the passage immediately, but you may move on to another question because we have all of the answers. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President.  I don't wish to waste any time of the Court, and I am certain the records will speak for themselves.  

Madam President, I will, as Your Honours have directed, move on to my next question. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, you said that people went to the banana plantation of Father Seromba and got bananas, and Father Seromba saw them and that he responded.  Can you tell us, Witness, what was the response of Father Seromba when he saw that bananas had been taken. 
A.	When he realised that we were roasting these bananas and that smoke was rising, he came and found us there and he spoke to the gendarmes as follows: "If any Inyenzi, any Tutsi-Inyenzi were to go back to the banana plantation, the gendarmes should shoot at him."
Q.	When Father Seromba said this, can you tell us, Witness, approximately how far you were from him?
A.	He found us in the courtyard where we were roasting these bananas.  I would say that the distance between -- that the distance was between or within the distances in this room.  There was no distance that was further than the size of this room because we were in the courtyard and smoke was rising and we were roasting our bananas and nobody went back to the banana plantation.  He had just given the order that anyone who returned there should be shot. 
Q.	Using the dimensions of this court, if possible, Witness, could you indicate to us your approximate position and the approximate position of Father Seromba when he made this statement?
A.	Your Honours, I would like -- I would say that we were in the courtyard roasting these bananas.  We were in the row that is opposite, and Seromba found us there.  He was standing not far from me.  It would not be true to say there was a great distance between us.  He found us at the place where we were roasting the bananas, and after he said these words.  

Nobody returned to the banana plantation.  He for his part went away again.  We went to the place where leaves where so that we could used them to roast the bananas.  It was in the courtyard.
Q.	Witness, could you tell us whether you understood the word "Inyenzi" and, if so, could you tell us what you understood this word to mean?
A.	At the time the Tutsis were given all sorts of names, serpent, cockroach, Inyenzi.  It meant enemy.  We were called all sorts of names, and Inyenzi meant Tutsi.  So the Tutsi was compared to Inyenzi, which is cockroach.  They also called us serpent.  They called us all sorts of names.  In fact, we were dehumanised. 
Q.	Witness, while were you at the church, did you ever see any figures of authority come to that church?
A.	Yes, I saw authorities who came.  I saw about five.  There was the bourgmestre Ndahimana.  There was a judicial police inspector, Kayishema.  There was Mbakirirehe.  There was a teacher known as Telesphore Ndugutse.  There was the trader called Kanyarukiga.  These people arrived at the scene and went to Father Seromba's house.  When we saw them, we concluded that a meeting had been held, and some refugees were thinking that they were coming to save us.  These figures of authority went away again, but Kayishema, the judicial police inspector, returned.  

When they left the meeting, Kayishema returned and asked the women whose names I had referred to, who had married Tutsis, and these women were saved on this occasion.  It was on a Thursday.  Thursday it was.  On Friday, people were killed in the church. 
Q.	Witness, the women who had been married to Tutsi men, what was their ethnicity, that is, the women who had been taken away?
A.	They were Hutu women who had married Tutsis.  They had also sought refuge in the church.  I said that there were three in number, these women, and I have identified one of them.  She is still alive.  She's still alive. 
Q.	Witness, do you know if Kayishema has another name, and if so, can you tell us?
A.	He was called Fulgence Kayishema.  He was judicial police inspector for Kivumu commune. 
Q.	And, as well, Ndahimana, did he have another name?
A.	He was called Gregoire Ndahimana.
Q.	And, as well, Kanyarukiga, did you know him by any other names?
A.	He was called Gaspard. 
Q.	You were just telling us, Witness, that on the next day there was an attack.  Can you tell us the approximate time of that attack?
A.	If I were to make an estimate on that Friday, everywhere on the hills, drums were beaten.  There was whistling, and people, many people from the countryside left the countryside to go to the church.  Some even came on board vehicles belonging to the Asatardi company.  So people gathered at that place in the morning, and they surrounded the place where we were.  The vehicles would drop them and they would surround us.  They were covered with banana leaves, and they began to attack us from between 9 and 10 a.m.  The fighting began around that time.  

The gendarmes who were present on the scene told us that these people had come to kill us.  These gendarmes said that they had guns but that the guns were for their own safety, so they asked us to defend ourselves against the assailants.  We threw stones at them, but they threw grenades back at us, and people were decimated.  We were throwing stones, and when they threw grenades at us -- you see, here there are more than 20 people.  The refugees did not have the strength to resist.  So they decided to go to the church, whereas others went to the presbytery.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us the ethnicity of the attackers?
A.	They were people of Tutsi extraction -- sorry, Hutu extraction.
Q.	And can you give us, Witness, if you can, the approximate number of attackers?
A.	These people were many.  You could say that everyone in the commune had gathered at the scene.  Their number could be evaluated -- it is difficult for me to say how many there were.  It is difficult for me.  What I can just say is that there were many.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us, in relation to the number of refugees, were the attackers more or less?
A.	If you make an estimate, the refugees were -- the assailants were far more numerous than those of the refugees.  The refugees were less numerous. 
Q.	Witness, you said that the assailants used grenades.  Could you tell us whether they used any other weapons?
A.	They also used machetes, traditional weapons, clubs.  They even killed us with the weapons that they had taken from us, our own weapons that they had taken. 
Q.	And these grenades, Witness, do you know whether anyone gave these grenades to the attackers?
A.	When many people came to the scene, I saw Kayishema distributing grenades to young people before the fighting started. 
Q.	When the attackers were attacking the refugees, were they saying anything?
A.	The assailants attacked while singing and saying, "Let us exterminate them; let us kill them."  They used many slogans and they were even shouting them.
Q.	Witness, during this attack, can you tell us where was Father Seromba?
A.	Seromba was at his home.
Q.	You said, Witness, that when the refugees were being killed, some went to the church and some went to the presbytery.  Can you tell us, Witness, where you went?
A.	I went.  I was able to go to the church, and there were many people who were going in.  We were being cut with sharp objects.  Since I was unable to succeed, I climbed the presbytery wall and I found myself in the inner courtyard of the presbytery.  One would say that there are two courtyards.  There is a rear courtyard and there is a front yard which you find when you are coming in.  I went towards the rear courtyard.  There is actually two yards.

	1550H
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	And having gone to that inner courtyard, as you said, Witness, did you go there after anywhere else?
A.	When I climbed over the wall and -- I got into the courtyard.  I found several people.  There were several buildings.  I went towards the presbytery kitchen.  We went to the place where food was cooked, food that we even ate, and there were several people.  The building where I entered contained several people already.
Q.	And whilst there, Witness, did anyone find you there?
A.	After eating at this place where I found other people, since there were glasses or there was glass in the windows -- transparent glass in the windows of this building, we went into the corridor.  We stood there.  There were other people whom I found there.  Father Seromba found us there and the people who were there said, "Father, hide us please."  And father said, "Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to you; I'm going to hide you."  He closed the door and went towards another building which was a storey building.  I stood near the door and I saw Seromba who was going out through the door that led to the courtyard at the church.  He met the gendarmes who were there and I saw them come immediately.  I decided to leave the place immediately, passing to the bins store.  Just after I left, I heard these people -- the people who were in the corridors screaming in pain and asking the priest for mercy.  I stood near the building that was near the chicken house, and from there I heard gunshots and people screaming in pain.  I climbed up on the table (sic), and I stood there over the tables up to night, and I took advantage to take this --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness -- correction of the interpreter: he didn't mean "table", he meant "stables".
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	After that, Witness, can you tell us whether you went anywhere?
A.	Since behind the presbytery killing was still going on, I left this place at night, so I stayed above this stable up to night at about 9 p.m.  And during that time they were killing, they were throwing grenades, they were yelling.  So I left this place and went towards -- further down from the parish, and I went to Nyabarongo which is in Kigali secteur.  I crossed Nyabarongo towards Gitarama considering that the killings had not yet started in that préfecture.  So I spent the night in Gitarama.  There were other refugees who went to -- who were going to Kabgaye, so I joined them to go to Kabgaye where I spent some days.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us, did you ever return to your commune?
A.	I cannot tell you how long I spent in exile in Kabgaye, but the RPF liberated us and close to Rwango then to Kigali.  And when peace returned and the government was set up, I returned to my home.  I was now safe there. 
Q.	When you returned to your home, Witness, can you tell us in what condition did you find your home?
A.	There was nothing, there was nothing left.  The houses had been destroyed.  They were in ruins; mine -- both mine and my brother's homes, as well as my uncle's homes.  There was nothing.
Q.	Can you name, if you remember, Witness, some of the attackers who had attacked the refugees at Nyange church?
A.	It is difficult to say.  I would say that they were figures of authority who had attacked or supervised these activities in Nyange.  You can reach Nyange from several directions and there -- some people came from Rukoko who were led by (By order of the Court, these names have been extracted and filed under seal), they were conseillers.  There was a person called -- well, there was a director of CERAI who was called (By order of the Court, these names have been extracted and filed under seal).  It is these people who attacked, but they were accompanied by civilians.
Q.	And can you tell us, Witness, if you can, any of the persons who were victims from that church?
A.	Our families were victims.  The members of our family were many.  I can give you some members of my family.  

(By order of the Court, this sentence has been extracted and filed under seal)
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I would be asking at the end of his evidence for a closed session and perhaps might I, first of all, apologise for the Court for asking that particular question.  I had envisaged that he would give numbers, but might that answer be moved to the closed session? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the names --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, I'm hearing, instead, the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll actually request that the names that were mentioned by the witness should be stricken off the record. 

Counsel Pognon, do you have any objections as to the closed session that has been requested by the Prosecutor?  No objection.  Fine.  So we're going to be in a closed session and we'll crave the indulgence of the gallery, but this is meant to protect the witness and to act in the interest of justice.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 19 to 20] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 17 to 18 by Roxane Lane)






	(Court resumed at 1625H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session and we are in open session. 

Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor and can proceed with the examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, can you --
A.	Yes, I am listening to you, Madam Prosecutor.
Q.	Can you describe Father Seromba?  I mean, his physical description; can you give it to us?
A.	From what I can remember, he was a man with a light complexion.  He was short with a rounded face.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, whether Father Seromba could or would have been able to do anything to prevent the refugees from being killed?
A.	It was possible.  He was capable of that.  He had the capacity to do that because he was -- he was an official of a church and if he had prevented the killing of those people in the parish that he used to head, especially if he had talked to the bourgmestre of that commune who was one of the killers, if he told him, the bourgmestre, to stop the civilians, members of the church, from killing the people, and if he had told them to take the people elsewhere, he would have been able to do that.  And, besides, he did not talk to those officials of the locality.  In a bid to rescue us, they probably might have refused obeying him, but at least he would have said something.  I realise that -- besides when people asked for food from him, he refused to give them the food; whereas, people had taken refuge in his church.  This shows, therefore, that it was within his power to feed the refugees, but he did not use such powers to do that.  What I can also say is that at the time when the authority -- the officials that I named, in particular, the communal authorities, when they came to his house they used to hold meetings, or they held a meeting, and it was said that it was a meeting that they were holding because when people sit together they definitely confer or discuss something.  He could have told us that assailants were coming to kill us and he could have advised the refugees to flee, and the refugees could even have left during the night and died on their way or probably died in another way.  So, as far as I'm concerned, the father -- the priest had powers, but he did not use them.
Q.	Witness, apart from Father Seromba, during the massacres at the church did you see any other priest?
A.	I saw other priests, but those priests were not living in that very parish; they only came there during that period, during the period of the massacres.
Q.	And if you are able to, Witness, would you able to tell us the names of those priests that you saw?
A.	On that Friday I saw Father Nturiye, Father Kayiranga.  Those were the priests who were present on that day.  It was said that they had come aboard a bus which was coming from Gisenyi.  It was said that on board that bus were also Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi to commit killings, but I did not see the bus.  I only saw the priests on that day.
Q.	Witness, if you were to see Father Seromba now, would you be able to recognise him?
A.	Yes, it is possible, but many years have gone by and it is possible that people can change, but I think I can recognise him even after those long years.  I believe I can recognise him.
Q.	Very well.  Witness, can you stand where you are and look around this court and tell us if you see Father Seromba?
A.	It is that man over there.  I can see him.  He is middle of two other men, sitting between two other men.
Q.	That man you speak of, Witness, can you point to him?
A.	He is wearing a jacket.  I believe he's wearing a dark shirt as well. 
Q.	Yes. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, might the record show that this witness has pointed to and has identified Father Seromba. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the records so reflect that the witness has identified Father Seromba. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Obliged, Madam President. 

Madam President, might the witness be allowed to leave the witness area and proceed to the overhead projector so that he may be shown certain photographs?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registrar, please draw the curtain. 

Witness, please move to the overhead projector. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Very well, Madam President.  I thank the Court.  

Now, can the witness be shown what was admitted as Prosecution Exhibit 3-21?
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, are you able to see clearly that photograph?
A.	Yes, I can very well see this photograph.  It is the photograph of Nyange church which we made reference to a while ago, but that church no longer exists today.  The part that we are looking at is, therefore, the front part of the church.  It is the external courtyard of the church because it had two entrances.  There was one door at the other end which we cannot see; so we can see only one of the church's doors.  Another reason why I say it is a photograph of the church is the fact that there was a stone -- a stone which was initially laid on which was engraved the fact that the church was founded in 1953.
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, may the record reflect that the witness pointed to a particular area on that photograph, an area on the right lower side, for purposes of the record, Madam President. 

Might the witness be shown what was admitted as Prosecution Exhibit 2-09.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, if you can clearly see this photograph, can you tell us what is depicted there?
A.	It is the fathers' house.  That was where the priests resided.  The church was, therefore, near it, to the left.  This house is still there.  It was the fathers' house.  When you went into the presbytery you could see this house to your right and, here, in the middle, there were passionfruit trees in the garden which is in front of the building. 
MS. ALEXIS:
And might the witness be shown what was admitted as Prosecution Exhibit 3-04. 
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, if you can clearly see this photograph, can you tell us what is depicted there?
A.	This photograph represents part of the house.  It's the first floor of the house we saw a while ago.  The house to the left is the kitchen.  This was the kitchen that was very close to the storey building.  It was a kitchen that the priests used.  That building is still there.  That house is still there -- I mean, the kitchen.
Q.	Witness, in your evidence today you spoke of a kitchen.  Can you tell us whether that is the kitchen you spoke of?
A.	Yes, that is indeed the kitchen I referred to a while ago.  So the picture was taken on the side, so what I'm saying is that there were two courtyards inside the presbytery.  One of the doors led into the -- overlooked the courtyard of the presbytery and another door which overlooked a cattle shed which was in the other courtyard on the other side, and what we're looking at is the kitchen used by the priests.  There was a kitchen here and there was another door on the external side of the building; that was where food was cooked.  There is another door on the other side which we cannot see and that door led to the storey building. 
Q.	You said, Witness, in your evidence, that you went to the kitchen.  Can you show us, if it is possible from this photograph, how you went into the kitchen, the access through which you went into that kitchen?
A.	I climbed the wall on the side of the kitchen, so I left the kitchen.  As a matter of fact, I went into the part where food is cooked because that house had two doors.  It was a big house.  So I went in through another door into the section where food is cooked.  So I'm still talking about the same building, the same house which I referred to.
Q.	Very well. 
MS. ALEXIS:
Might the witness now be shown what was admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 2-25. 
THE WITNESS:
On this photograph, we can see what used to be the office.  There was an office here.  You can see something that looks like a front door -- or a front entrance.  It is through this entrance that vehicles going to the presbytery entered.  Here, you have an iron gate and that is where the church that was destroyed used to be.  The area on which the church stood has been fenced all around and this road we have here leads to where the church used to be.  As a matter of fact, here, it is not visible on the photograph.  It is where the genocide memorial has been erected, right here, which is not visible, on the photograph.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	Witness, when you speak of the church, that is, that it was the gate to the church, can you tell us which church you're speaking of?
A.	What I mean, as a matter of fact, is that the place where the church used to be has been fenced all around.  It was fenced all around with barbed wire.  That is why you have a gate.  So that gate leads into that area which has been fenced all around.  That is where the main entrance into the church used to be.  That is right in front of what used to be the church.
Q.	Witness, which church might that be?  Which church might you be referring to?
A.	I am referring to the church that was destroyed.  So the area was fenced all around and a gate was erected so that people could not gain access to it.  In order to gain access to it, that gate had to be opened. 
Q.	Very well.
MS. ALEXIS:
Might the witness be shown what was admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 30. 
THE WITNESS:
What you see on this photograph is the inside of the church that used to exist, that is, the church that was destroyed.  So this is the inside of the church.  I recall that there was a corridor in the church.  There were two corridors.  In fact, there were two rows: one for women, where women used to sit, and another for men.  So each row was linked to another with a piece of wood such that you could not move it.  So this is the picture of the church prior to its destruction.
BY MS. ALEXIS:
Q.	And can you tell us, Witness, when you say "church", can you tell us exactly which church are you referring to?  And, I mean, what is the name of the church?
A.	This is Nyange parish.  The photograph we are looking at is the inside of the church, just like we are here inside of this Tribunal. 

MS. ALEXIS:
And can the witness be shown what was admitted as, I believe, P. 2-25.  

Very well, Madam President.  Those are all my questions with respect to the photographs and, therefore, it is possible that the witness return to his seat. 

Madam President, those are all my questions for this witness for examination-in-chief. 

Witness CBS, those are all my questions for you and I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Counsel Pognon, are you the one cross-examining the witness?  If so, you may take the floor. 
MR. POGNON:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness CBS.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	In what year were you born precisely? 
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, this very well might be a question for closed session.  It appears to me to be a personal question.  I don't know. 
MR. POGNON:
I believe this question is so personal.  I don't think it can allow the identification of the witness.  It is not that personal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you wish, we may go into closed session for your questions. 
MR. POGNON:
It is not necessary now -- for this question to be now.  I'll move on to another. 
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	How many times, Witness, were you heard or interviewed?  How many times did people come and see you to obtain information regarding the massacre we are referring to today?
A.	As a matter of fact, people have been coming to see me for a very long time since 1996, as a matter of fact, but I do not know whether all those people who came to interview me were necessarily from the Tribunal, but I believe I was interviewed on three occasions perhaps.  I remember meeting a group of people in Kibuye at the préfecture, on another occasion, as a matter of fact, on two occasions, at the communal office. 
Q.	Since you were interviewed on the 15th of November 1995, do you remember anything?  Does this date ring a bell?
A.	I don't remember the date.  Maybe you're right.  Perhaps they did interview me at the time because I don't remember the exact date. 
Q.	Can you also remember that you were questioned or interviewed on the 2nd of February 1996?
A.	I did not remember the dates because I did not have a notebook to take all of that down, but since you have a document where this is mentioned, it does mean that I was interviewed.  I didn't take it down anywhere, so I cannot remember all the dates.  I cannot remember quite simply because I didn't take that down and they never did leave me with any copy of my statements.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you.  But, believe me, it is indeed the date of 2nd February 1996, that is, on the date which you were interviewed.  I shall return to these dates afterwards.  

If I tell you that you were also interviewed on the 17th of August 2000, since this is a more recent date, would that ring a bell?
A.	Yes, I think I remember that.  I do not remember the details of all the questions that were put to me, but I remember that they did come to see me. 
Q.	If I remind you that you were interviewed on Wednesday, 12th March 2003, which is an even more recent date, would that ring a bell?
A.	In what year was that, Counsel?  Did you say 2003, Counsel?
Q.	Mr. Witness, 12th of March 2003.
A.	Yes, yes.  Perhaps they did interview me.  If you have the piece of paper there saying this, then it means it happened. 
Q.	I thank you for your trust.  Believe you me, I am not making a mistake.  They did interview you and it was on the 12th of March 2003 from ten o'clock a.m. to 2 p.m.  I observed that when you were interviewed on the 15th of November 1995, the transcript of the interview does not mention the name, address and -- address of a friend or relative or acquaintance that you could have indicated.  Habitually, investigators, once they have established identity, ask for the name of -- and address of a friend, relative or acquaintance.  The 1995 transcript mentions no such person.  What does this mean?  Does this mean that at that time you did not have any friends, relatives or acquaintances that you could have indicated in this space?
A.	What I can say is that in our commune -- all the persons who came to meet us were not known to us, but the main thing was that they went to the commune office.  They said what they needed, and our bourgmestre would send for us and would tell us that there were people who wished to see us.  So in regard to this address of a friend, relative or acquaintance, we had a bourgmestre who led us and every visitor who came to our commune would contact the bourgmestre who would send for us.  In my case, he would send people to come and tell me that people wished to see me, and I would come and meet these people.
Q.	Thank you.  By the way, could I have the name of this bourgmestre whom you say was your leader?
A.	Since 1996, the name of bourgmestre is Théoneste Nsanzabaganwa.
Q.	Is it for this reason that in similar circumstances as for those that obtained during the transcript of 2nd of February 1996 -- is it for these same reasons that this transcript does not indicate a friend, family member or acquaintance as a reference?  Is it also because it was under the same conditions where the bourgmestre directed or led and introduced people?  Is it for this reason that you did not introduce anybody?
A.	I have told you in response of this question that those who interviewed me did not -- all those who interviewed me did not give me their names.  Perhaps recently those who interviewed me gave me their names, but I told you the procedure that was followed.  And all these people who needed me would come and pass through the commune to be able to get to me.  And, as I said, they would go through the bourgmestre.  They would say what they wanted.  In his turn, the bourgmestre would send for us.  I do not see how such a question should be put to me because I did not give any address or receive any.  If somebody wanted to meet us, he would go to the commune office because these people who came to meet us used to go through the commune office and then they would express their needs.  And if I was needed, in my turn, I was called.  Sometimes I was available, and sometimes I was not. 
Q.	The times at which you gave no indication -- rather, I'll rephrase my question.  Rather, if this is the procedure used to reach you, if these are the circumstances, that is, if it is in this place in the commune that people come to interview you, why do you think that the transcripts do not indicate that you are in this commune and that you are under the cover of the bourgmestre?  Why -- do you understand why these transcripts do not indicate this?  These are details concerning you.  These are things that you, yourself, say.  You will say, this is such-and-such a person who is going to be my reference, relative or friend.  Why is it that -- the transcripts of 1995 and 1996, and the third one of 1996, why do they not include this in your information?
A.	You're saying this indication is not present in these transcripts.  I have told you that I am a citizen.  I didn't do law.  I'm telling you that these people used to come to a given commune and they would first talk to the figures of authority of the commune.  Is it I who failed in my duty here?  I don't know who failed in their duty.  It is the leader of the commune who told me that people needed me.  I do not see the fault or where I may have made a mistake.  So if you're asking me -- when they asked me about what was happening, I told them.  But regarding the information you referred to, these did not take place.  I did not give any address or any such thing through which they had to pass, but when they came, they went through a certain process and then somebody else came and told me that somebody was wanting to see me.  That is how the procedure was. 
(Pages 21 to 27 by Roxane Lane)


1710H
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I can assure you, I would like to reassure you that everything you have said is true.  I'm not saying that it is your fault; I am just noting that this indication does not exist and I am a bit surprised by it.  My surprise is due to the fact that your transcripts of the 17th of August 2000 and Wednesday, 12th of March 2003, contain the following information: name and address of a friend, relative or acquaintance.  You have Théoneste Nsanzabaganwa, Kivumu commune bourgmestre.  That is the transcript for 2000.  Transcript for 12th March 2003 reads as follows: name and address of friend, relative of acquaintance; Théoneste Nsanzabaganwa, Kivumu commune, deputy mayor.
A.	What I can tell you about this -- I have told you the circumstances under which people came to meet me.  This is what happens even now.  I did not take notes of all this and I'm not taking notes now.  For instance, if these people came through Nsanzabaganwa, I cannot say that Nsanzabaganwa is endorsing what I said.  I am saying that I did not fail in any duty.  And these people who put questions to me did not put any question to me regarding this address.  They did not tell me that I had to give this information.
Q.	Once more, I would like to reassure you that these are details that appear on transcripts.  It is because they do not appear that it raised my interest, which is why I put the questions to you.  And I also said the two last documents -- that is, of 2000 and 2003 -- contain this information.

Still in regard to these transcripts, you said -- just a minute.  In your 2000 transcript, that is, the last-but-one transcript, the investigators asked -- said or wrote down this, that you supposedly said: "I meet the investigators of the Tribunal -- of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda" -- that is, "I am meeting the investigators for the first time.  I am willing to cooperate with the Tribunal and, if required, I would agree to testify.  In 1996 I was met by another body that is not the Tribunal.  People had come.  They asked me to tell them about the events that occurred in 1994.  At that time" -- we are referring to 2000 -- that is what you said, yourself.  As a careful person, this is what you said in respect of your previous statements.

So my question is this: in 1995, on 15th of November, on the 2nd of February 1996, when on those two dates people came to meet you to put questions to you, to take statements from you, they did not identify themselves for you to say who they were, did they?
A.	These people did not introduce themselves to me.  I am referring to the people of 1995.  People came and they would say, "We come from such-and-such a place.  We are working for this or that organisation", and they would put questions to me.  I did not take down what they said.  That is what I'm telling you.  If there is something these people did not do, it should not be ascribed to me.  They came and put questions to me.  I answered these questions, and we parted ways.  Similarly, other people came to see me, put questions to me.  In short, I do not think that any blame should be ascribed to me for any situation that did not work well.

Perhaps, the person who was supposed to receive these people in the first place, the persons to whom these people speak and who used to come and fetch us is the one who made a mistake, if a mistake there was.  Whether it was the person who was serving as an intermediary or the investigators, you should look for the faults among these people.  I am not even aware that there were written statements.  I am here.  I am answering your questions.  This is the same situation as when these people came to interview me.
Q.	We are not blaming you in any way; absolutely not.  We are just seeking clarification.  So, on 15 November 1995, as you have said so well, the place where you were questioned is indicated here; Kivumu commune office, which is the office of the commune.  My question is as follows: when you received the summons from the commune office, I suppose from the bourgmestre, and when you arrived there, do you mean that the bourgmestre did not inform you about the persons who contacted him to tell you who they were and to give you some idea in a way as to the people who had come to interview you?
A.	He would say, for example, "There are people who work in this or that organisation and who are conducting investigations and who would like to meet you."  I am not telling you that I wrote what we said to each other down somewhere.  All these people came and questioned me so, in regard to the question that you are putting to me, I did not ask for copies of the statements that I had made so that I might even try to remember even the dates or even the content of my statements.  After putting questions to me and after writing them down, they would go with their statements.  They never left any copy with me.

Of course, the figure of authority in the district had told me that there were people who wished to meet me, but once we concluded our interview they would go away, but they would not leave me with any copy of the statement that they had taken.  These are the circumstances under which we met.
Q.	The Tribunal has taken due note of the fact that no copy of the statement was left with you and that those who interviewed you were -- left with their documents.  That is not the question here.  You have already answered the question.  The person -- that is, the bourgmestre -- offered his assistant, who contacted you, did not tell you who wished to question you at the time when he sent for you.  I think that is it.
A.	Let us come to an understanding here.  They would tell me: "There is such-and-such a person who has come or who have come, either that these are people from the Tribunal of Arusha who are conducting investigation", but he would have told me that that was the case.  Sometimes these people would introduce themselves and give their names.  What I am saying is that when we concluded the interview I would go away.  That is true.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"They would go away".  Sorry, interpreter's correction.  "That is true."
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So I think we may note that when you were sent for to come to the commune, the bourgmestre who summoned you or his assistant did not often tell you, did not give you details about what was going to happen.
A.	No, I told you that they would say such-and-such a person from such-and-such an organisation is looking for details about such-and-such a thing.  But this is years ago.  They came in several waves.  I cannot tell you that these were such-and-such a person from such-and-such an organisation because I did not write this down somewhere.  Each time there were people who wished to meet me, who came from one organisation or another, the bourgmestre would inform me and I would go.  I'm not saying that he did not inform me as to the identity of these persons; it's just that I don't remember.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS:
I am obliged, Madam President.  Madam President, I don't know how many times the Defence would ask the same question and get the same answer.  Question asked and answered, asked and answered, asked and answered.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, my question came from a statement made by the witness; that is, another body other than the Tribunal had come to ask him to recount the events of Nyange, another organisation, apart from the Tribunal.  And we have documents which all have the letterhead of the UNICTR, so I have every right to ask the question.  The witness himself extends the response because he goes beyond what I ask him, which is that he did not sign transcripts, and so on and so forth.  I have just noted that since another body, apart from the Tribunal, came to put questions to him, then he should have been told what organisation it was.  So my question is as follows.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	For these times, do you remember the body that came, that is, apart from this Tribunal -- that came to put questions to you; do you remember?  If you do not remember, you say you do not remember.  If you do remember, you say, "They told me that it was this organisation", and then we will be finished with this question.
A.	Regarding these dates and these years, in my country there is an organisation that came to our commune.  It is Africa something or other; I don't remember the rest.  And it is these people who came to interview us.  In any case, I was interviewed.  It is Africa something or other that follows.  I think it was in English, in English.  These people came and interviewed me.  That is why I said that there was another body.  You do understand that this is an organisation other than the Tribunal.  For all the employees of the Tribunal, they identified themselves as coming from here.  But for this organisation that is called Africa something or other, they came and they put questions to me.

What I can say is that regarding the dates '95, '96 up 'til 2000, I am well aware that these people from this other organisation sent people to us, to listen or to interview people.
Q.	And if I were to conclude, I could finish the name of this organisation -- if I were to suggest to you that it was African Rights, is it African Rights?
A.	Yes, that is the organisation.  That is the way it was called.
Q.	You see, we are coming to it.  I shall now take your statement of the 2nd of February.
A.	What year?
Q.	Second February 1996, I beg your pardon.
MR. POGNON:
I do not know whether it is the same thing for the Court, but we received disclosure of two statements dated 2 February 1996.  The first is numbered as follows, K0271022, and numbered from the Office of the Prosecutor from 1288 bis to 1283 bis.

The second statement which does not have a cover page, which is an identification page or a page to identify the witness, is numbered as follows, K002697, and numbered by the OTP 2348 to 2344.  So we have two statements dated 2 February 1996.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So my concern is as follows, Mr. Witness.  In the first statement, that which has a cover page, No. K271022, you began your statement by the following sentence, "As written down by the -- or reported by the investigators of African Rights."  You said -- it says, "The initial statement that I made on the 15th of November I would like to make the following clarifications."  That is the statement you made -- "I would like to make the following precisions", and in that statement -- or that statement ends on page K271027, 12983 bis, and it ends as follows, "I learnt that he is currently in prison."

The other statement, that is, the statement of the same date, bearing the numbers K0026097 and numbered in manuscript by the Prosecutor 2388 to 2384, it begins with the following: "I would like to add this to my initial declaration of 15 November 1995."  That is at page 2348 and it ends on page 2344, No. K0026101 by -- "I am ready to appear before the Tribunal."  But before that last sentence, on page 23 -- 2343, you stated the following, "As concerns Father Seromba, I don't have anything to add."  That is the last sentence of page 2343.

These are two identical statements which begin with different sentences concerning the same previous statement and which ends -- in the first case you don't talk about Father Seromba at all and, in the second case, you say, "I don't have anything to add to my statement insofar as Father Seromba is concerned."  Can you tell us if those who came to see you made you to sign two different statements or if you signed only one statement which is in two versions?
A.	Were you asking me that question, Counsel?
Q.	Yes, I asked you the question.  Can you answer it?
A.	You are talking about written statements that may be contradictory.  I don't know.  You say that on one statement my signature is on it, and on another my signature it isn't on it.  I don't quite understand your question.  Now, you have been showing statements; you have been talking about dates; and then you say that in some places there is a signature and in others there is no signatures.  I didn't quite understand the purport of your question.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.  Can counsel be requested to use his microphone or put it on.  Thank you.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	In the first statement that you gave, on the 2nd of February 1996, to confirm your statement of 5 November 1995, you merely ended your statement by not mentioning Father Seromba at all.  In the statements that you made, apparently, on the same date, because those are the documents that were disclosed to us, on that second one therefore, you end, your last-but-one sentence, as follows.  "As far as concerns Father Seromba, I don't have anything to add."   That is what was written down.

Furthermore, since you speak and understand French well, it is not with the same sentence that you began -- it's by the same sentence that you began those two statements which are identical in all respects, besides the difference I pointed out.  You said -- in the one in which you didn't mention Father Seromba, you said, "Besides my initial statement made on the 5th of November 1995, I would like to make the following precisions."  In the second same statement you said, "I would like to add the following to my statement of 5 November 1995."
MR. POGNON:
I wonder if the Tribunal is following me because I have the two statements here.  There are two statements.  I can produce the two documents that I have with me.
THE WITNESS:
You are talking of two statements produced on the same day.  Well, it would appear to me, in any case, one of the copies doesn't have a cover page.
THE WITNESS:
But where would the cover page have gone to?  If you mentioned a sentence somewhere where I said there is nothing to add, if I said that, the presupposes that I said something.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	Let us go step by step, Mr. Witness.
MR. POGNON:
Can I tender to the Tribunal these documents so that they can see exactly what I'm talking about?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. POGNON:
Mr. Court Assistant, this is the first statement.  And here is the last sentence where there's no mention of Father Seromba.  Now, this is the second statement.  This is the first sentence, which is poorly worded, and this is the last-but-one page.  Now, do you get me?  I think you will be my advocate before this Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have the first statement, and as for the second one, which mentions that they don't have anything to add in respect of Father Seromba, we don't have that one.  So can you give us that second statement?  We don't have it in our documents.
MR. POGNON:
The OTP will have to disclose that to the President.

Madam President, those documents are mine.  I will readily show them to the Bench, but I don't think it is fair to show them to the Prosecution.  They gave the documents to me, and they would be reading my notes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Apparently, there are certain comments on the documents.  So just look at the numbers and the dates because we would like to have those documents.
MS. ALEXIS:
Yes, please, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, but we are wondering whether there is no confusion between these transcripts of 2nd February and that of 5 November.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, counsel is not talking into the microphone and we just can't get him.
MR. POGNON:
I was explaining therefore that two transcripts that are supposed to be transcripts of the 2nd of February 1996 all -- make references to 15 November, that they are adding or confirming the statement of 15 November.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, on these transcripts of 15 November and of 2nd February -- 15 November 1995 and 2nd February 1996, and I read as follows.  The Kinyarwanda interpreter that was used to translate this was Yves Ndimurukundo; the 15th November 1995.  And for the 2nd February 1996 the interpreter was called Yves Ndimurukundo.  And in the transcript -- or in the cover page of the transcript, there was a name that was added, that is, Yves Florent Ndimurukundo.
Now, when this African Rights agency, Witness, came to interview you, did they introduce that person to you as their interpreter?  Did they tell you, it is Mr. Ndimurukundo who is going to interview you, and you knew his name; or they didn't say anything and somebody started interpreting for you without telling you anything before?
A.	When the staff of that agency came to interview us, and that's a long time ago, it is possible that they gave us names, but the question I am asking myself, just like you are asking yourself -- insofar as the dates that are different, you told me in Kinyarwanda that concerning Seromba I didn't ask anything.  I have heard that sentence.  If I say that I have nothing to add, it means that they had asked me questions concerning Seromba.  That is what, you know, I feel, but as concerns the names of the interpreter, well, I didn't retain any name.  In any case, however, when they came to interview us, just as you yourselves come to interview us, he introduced themselves to us, and they would say, "My name is this or that", but I didn't retain any name.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you.  I will appeal to you to answer your questions briefly.  I asked you only the question -- I asked you whether you retained those names as the names of those who interpreted for you or not, and I'm going to ask you the same question.  Did you -- do you remember their names; did you retain their names or not?  Now, all you need say is, "I retained the names", or "I did not retain the names."
A.	No, I did not retain his name.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, there are other names that I will call out to you.  They are the names of investigators.  On the 15th of March --
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, if I may.  What is the relevance of this line of questioning?  Need we have in court all the names of the investigators in court?  Madam President, I must object.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you want to respond to that question?
MR. POGNON:
Yes, Madam President, I will respond to the objection.  I think that when we came here, what we did which is a conventional principle and which is the usual courteous practice to introduce ourselves to each other, Madam President, the same with yourselves and you ask us to introduce yourselves (sic) to reveal our identities, and that is what we did.  This is the usual practice and this usual practice is all the more necessary here that we are dealing with the transcript, which is the work of a parallel organisation.  So we would like to know if those persons there, indeed, introduced themselves as interpreters.  I am referring to a certain Oven Olsen, Luc Rene Cote, and Sjouke Eekma.  Do you -- can you remember if the investigators, who interviewed you, bore the names Oven Olsen, Luc Rene Cote, Sjouke Eekma?  If you can remember, say you remember; if you don't remember, say you don't remember, and I will proceed.

THE WITNESS:
You have given names, just as you did a while ago but, you see, you are asking me questions.  Subsequently, I wouldn't be able to tell the identity of the person who interviewed me.  It is about the same situation.
BY MR. POGNON:
Q.	I am simply asking --
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, I objected to the relevance of this question and counsel was asked to respond.  Counsel responded and did not wait for the ruling of the Court but went on with his questioning.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, Madam President, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, can you answer or respond to the objection?
MR. POGNON:
I thought that since you let me ask the question you had felt that the objection was -- had no grounds.  And I am saying that these transcripts, which are not the product of the legal department or of Office of the Prosecutor, I think they should be identified through the agency.  I am talking about the documents that were discovered an agency that collaborated with the Prosecutor.  And now I'm trying to know about the investigators.  If the gentleman can remember the name, let him tell us.  If he doesn't, let him tell us; I will proceed.  I don't quite understand what the Prosecutor's problem is.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we don't quite see the relevance of those questions because we don't see African Rights anywhere.  We are seeing transcripts or reports and what we see on top is the "United Nations".  I do not think that this witness can be in a position to give answers concerning names that were mentioned in this transcript.  Will those questions lead us somewhere?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, with all the respect I owe to your Tribunal, the transcripts will show that the witness -- the records will show that the witness would have recognised that the names that -- of the agency that interviewed him were from African Rights.  What I can tell the Tribunal is that it has been a long time since we have been trying to go through these transcripts.  They have documents that we have received and, believe you me, the Defence is not trying to lead the Tribunal astray.  All we want to know is if he can remember these names because we need to mention these names so that they should feature in the transcripts.  We are at an official stage here and we want his name to feature in the transcripts.  Because these transcripts are somewhere, definitely, they will be tendered as Defence exhibits at a certain point.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I would like you to give me a brief while to respond to the Defence counsel.  I told him that those people used to come and make investigations, used to give their identity, after which they asked us questions.  If I tell you that I remember their names -- I must tell you that I don't remember their names.  They gave us their names, and I should add that even in here the counsel for the Defence, who is asking me questions, I don't know his name.  They gave us their names, but I don't remember their names.  And since he has those documents with him -- and besides he is better placed than myself, so he can seek information from those agencies and from those agents.  That is what I wanted to say, Madam President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel be reminded to use his lit microphone.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.  Counsel, we have a problem because the interpreters have been here since morning.  They have been working throughout the day and they are tired.  I think we will need to adjourn at this stage and I think it would be advisable for us to end today at 6 p.m.  Because of the morning session you had today with the interpreters, I would like to propose the following.  It would appear that the courtroom on the fourth floor will be free throughout the entire day of tomorrow so we can sit for the entire day of tomorrow, but then I think it would be necessary for us to adjourn so that the interpreters can have some rest.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I think indeed that the interpreters have been working hard, but I also think that we have a problem that we have to iron out because I'm afraid that our work is like a hurdle jump -- a hurdle race.  We had some documents.  We asked for documents, and we had a part of the documents, and Witness CBT has been scheduled.  We only have documents that are scheduled and now we are going to adjourn, but we don't have those documents with which we can work.  This problem keeps coming up, but we need to raise it because we don't see how we can come here and work effectively if we cannot utilise those documents.  So I'm saying that so the problem can be ironed out, otherwise, tomorrow we will be facing the same difficulties.  That is what I wanted to say before we adjourn.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Monthé.

Madam Prosecutor, what do you have to say regarding those statements which are redacted which you disclosed to the Defence and which are still redacted?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, as you know, I have told counsel and, in fact, as we have maintained from the first time this question was raised, and I sincerely hope that this is the last time that we are asked again for what we have done already -- Madam President, for the record, on the 24th day of September of Our Lord 2004 we disclosed unredacted witness statements of all the detainees, including that of CBT.  I do not know why my friend keeps on insisting that we have not disclosed unredacted statements.  Our records reflect that we did.  Our case manager is here, who recalls the incident, and that is as much assistance as I can offer my friends.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Gogo, did you attend a meeting between the parties?  Can you inform the Chamber what happened?
MR. GOGO:
Madam President, this morning the Prosecutor came to my office, but the Defence was absent, so the meeting we had to hold at eight o'clock did not hold.  I believe the Prosecutor waited in my office for more than 40 minutes.  That is all I can say regarding the meeting on disclosure on documents which you ordered during yesterday's session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you are, therefore, not in a position to enlighten us as to the situation -- whether those unredacted statements were disclosed or not?
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, I just want to clarify the matter for the purposes of this debate.  I received some document this afternoon -- some documents here in the Tribunal.  So I suppose that if the Prosecutor were fair, he would have disclosed unredacted documents to us.  I don't know why there is a polemic.  We are talking about disclosure of documents.  We give credit to the Prosecutor that that is done.  And we say, "This is what you brought to us."  And I give Mr. Gogo those documents and tell him, "This is what you brought.  It is redacted.  To enable us to continue to work ..." -- and the answer is, "This has been done and we are acting in good faith."

I would say that, Madam President, we have not received those documents.  We should understand this point.
MR. GOGO:
I must point out that Counsel Monthé saw me during the break and he talked about the redacted documents that were disclosed to him.  After, he acquainted himself with the document, and those documents are indeed redacted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you stated that you disclosed unredacted documents.  Do you have a document confirming that you submitted the document and the Defence signed a document to the effect that they did indeed receive those documents?  Can we see that signed document?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, we filed it and it was supposed to be given by the registry.  It was indeed filed by the Prosecutor.  We don't have a signed letter from the Defence stating that it was given to them, but we have a document stating on which day it was filed.  And had Defence counsel attended the meeting this morning, we would have sorted out these issues, Madam President.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I would expect some respect from the Prosecution.  We arrived a little late this morning and we craved Mr. Gogo's indulgence.  I think we should respect one another before a court.  You stated vehemently here, Madam Prosecutor, that you disclosed that document.  I think you should be a little humble.  Madam President, we come here with honour, with courtesy, and we have never stated anything false before this Chamber.  I think we should state this very clearly.  So, please, give us those documents to enable us to work.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So I invite parties to meet immediately after this session to sort out those problems.

Mr. Gogo, please look into these matters.  You could eventually meet Mr. Constant to find out what happened, to find out whether CMS received that document.
MR. POGNON:
Madam President, Madam President.  I would very humbly -- in view of what is happening on the side of our learned friends, we can no longer meet the Prosecutor.  He has to disclose -- fulfil his obligation under Rule 66.  We can no longer meet the Prosecutor, because here we are being treated in just any manner, and it is not proper; it is not proper.  We cannot.  So, please, do not ask us to meet the Prosecutor.  We will not meet them.  I do not wish to meet them personally, because in any case the obligation to disclose documents is fundamental.  We are in criminal proceedings.  Suppose that we even misplaced a document; courtesy requires that that document be disclosed to us.  This is the problem that we are encountering in the final analysis.

We meet and we always talk about the same thing.  It is this morning -- this afternoon that I received the translation of the document we are dealing with today, that is, the documents of CBS.  This is only this afternoon that I received this document.  The translation was done in the morning, and this document was only disclosed to me this afternoon.

So we have had many incidents with the Prosecutor, who has no courtesy and who treats us in just about any manner.  And I pray the Chamber to spare us the trouble of meeting the Prosecutor.  All they have do is to fulfil their obligations.  We have never been treated in this manner in any court, be it here in Africa or elsewhere.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, at the end of this meeting, as I stated, Mr. Gogo will meet the Prosecutor and Mr. Constant to ensure that you will receive those documents today.  So, please, wait and you will receive those documents.
MR. POGNON:
I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have anything to add?
MS. ALEXIS:
Madam President, not wishing to add fire to what has become a burgeoning blaze, Defence counsel has accused me, and I feel myself bound to stand and defend what, in fact, has been an attack on my honour.  It has been said that they have been treat without any courtesy.

Madam President, the Defence has not come to us and said that, "We don't have it; give it to us".  They have accused us of not disclosing the document, when in fact our records show that it has.  So to come here and insist that it is a matter of lack of courtesy because they did not get the document, because they don't have the document, Madam President, in our view, is unfair.

Secondly, Madam President, Madam President, the Defence speaks about the fact that they could not come to the meeting and it was a matter of courtesy on our part.  Madam President, how was it a matter of courtesy on our part when we were in fact there and we waited for 45 minutes?  For us to say so, is it rude, is it wrong?

Madam President, the Defence counsel speaks always about equality of arms.  I would remind counsel equality of arms means just that -- equality of arms -- and that we all have the right of audience before this Honourable Court.  And we don't have any discourtesy, but we have a right to speak, and we will.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now that both the parties have taken the floor and the interpreters have been working for ten more minutes, we want to adjourn this session and we meet tomorrow at 9 a.m. in the courtroom on the fourth floor.  We thank you all.  Good evening.

And Mr. Gogo will take care of everything else.

These proceedings stand adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1820H)
