P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The court is called to order.  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  Let me turn to the Defence team; which witness are you bringing this morning, Counsel Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Defence cannot present any witness this morning for very practical reasons beyond the control of the Defence team.  We have a witness, who finally decided not to appear -- PA1, had to arrive yesterday, unfortunately, due to tickets, he found himself at the Paris Airport.  He wasn't able to board.  I spent Easter Monday on the phone facing unpleasant problems, and believe me, Madam President, I am a bit tired, this morning, and all these matters connected with the conveyance of witnesses and managing their departures, create a lot of problems for us.  So it is our hope that PA1 will be here this evening as we were told by WVSS.  We had received a letter before going for the weekend from the WVSS that is in connection with PS2, and that PS2 can only be available in May.  Those are the details that I can provide to the Court, and I will urge the coordinator to get in touch with you and maybe in the course of the status conference, we could raise the problems we are facing -- recurrent problems which exhaust the Defence.  Those are my submissions, 
Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you have any comments? 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.  Before we started, my friend was good enough to outline to me the problems that he was facing.  Obviously, the Prosecution has no comments regarding PS1, who, I understand is no longer is willing to testify.  So far as PA1 is concerned, he arrives this evening, and would be the Prosecutor's submission that we commence -- recommence with that witness's testimony tomorrow morning.  The only issue I think that we are going to perhaps have some conflicts with, is in respect of Witness PS2.  PS2 must have been told, when he was approached, that he was going to be required to testify before this Tribunal during this session which ends during this month.  If he has chosen not to be available, for he has indicated his unavailability, then, with the greatest respect, the Prosecution's submissions must be that that is his decision and his decision is not to testify, in effect.  Having said that, Your Honours, we would not wish Your Honours to make a decision immediately, and after PA1 completes his testimony, it would be the Prosecution's mission that will commence with the testimony of the Accused.  If PS2 can be persuaded to travel in the next couple of days to testify before the Tribunal, before the evidence is concluded, then, obviously, that is the course which the Prosecution would submit, and should be taken, and that that way his evidence could be heard by Your Honours before the end of the Defence case.  If he, however, maintains his position that he is not willing to travel until May, then, it will be the Prosecution's submission that the Defence case should  close on the conclusion of the testimony of the Accused.  The Prosecution, I can indicate, are happy to accommodate the Defence and Witness PS2, if, for example, he is only able to be here for one day, and if, for example, we are in the middle of the evidence of the Accused, the Prosecution would not object to PS2's evidence being heard during -- we stop and hear the evidence of PS2 to accommodate him.  That is, of course, if that is the wish of the Defence, and I simply leave that to whatever my learned friend indicated to Your Honours as his preference.  But can I indicate, to Your Honours, that Prosecution would be opposing, and I can indicate to you, that if PS2 maintains his position that he is unavailable until May, that the Prosecution will be opposing an adjournment of the trial for that evidence to be heard for reasons which I can go into more detail if that becomes the situation, which perhaps we can leave at this stage until more information is obtained from WVSS regarding PS2 and his availability.  I think that is all I wish to make comment in respect of this matter at the moment.

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Counsel Monthé, you may address the Court. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  I think the Prosecutor has not fully grasped the reasons raised by PS2.  He has not said he is not available.  It is the rules of the WVSS that make it difficult for them to bring PS2 within the deadline.  And, I got some correspondence from WVSS; there is a certain absolute time frame of 21 days, allowing for that witness to appear here.  So, if there is an administrative or bureaucratic arrangement that makes it difficult -- now, Mr. Prosecutor, it's now about six months since we have had problems trying to get PS1 over here.  I knock on wood, and my hope is that he will be able to appear.  He is willing to fulfill that mission to which he committed himself willingly.  Of course, Defence cannot accept for the Accused to start testifying while there are witnesses still pending, and we have never witnessed that in the past.  Of course, whenever this matter is raised, we will ventilate our objections to it.  We have never been witness to a situation where an Accused testified before the witness has already -- have been exhausted.  And, once more, we are not responsible for any of the problems that are occurring this morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Very brief comment.  I accept what my learned friend says, I wasn't aware that it is WVSS who were saying that it requires 21 days.  Your Honours made the decision on 23rd of March to grant the addition of PS1 and PS2.   I would be interested to know from WVSS when they received advice that Your Honours had made such an order, and because, if they were advised on the 23rd of March, about the Defence team, WVSS having had already more than one month.  So, there should be no issue of them having had less than 21 days.  So, I would ask that perhaps we do hear from WVSS regarding that issue.  And the other final comment is, of course, there have been a number of occasions where Accused have testified before the conclusion of all other evidence.  In some cases they have testified first, in other occasions, I think, including in Butare, recently, the Judges indicated that one of the Accused was to testify the next day whether or not he had called or had called all his witnesses by that time.  So there is precedence for it, in my respectful submissions.  Those are the only comments I wish to make.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.

The Chamber has decided that we shall sit this afternoon at 2:30 and request that the representatives of WVSS be present, as well as the offices of the UNDF.  The Chamber would like to listen to these people before it gives a ruling on the matter.  So, we will expect to see the two mentioned people this afternoon at 2:30, and the parties may make submissions during that session if they deem it necessary.  However, we maintain that the testimony of Witness PA1 will be tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

Yes, Counsel Monthé?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, I do not think this will be feasible.  I would like to inform the Chamber that the witness will only be arriving this evening.  We do not know in what state he will be when he will arrive this evening.  If we decide that he should appear before the Chamber tomorrow morning, and the witness is not in a position to do so, I would not like to be reproached with this fact.  It happens that some times that witness are not in their top shape when they disembark the plane.

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The coordinator is requested to make contact with the registry to determine whether Witness PS2 could testify through video-link. But, of course, this would have to take place during the present session which will end on the 27th of April at the latest.

If there are no further matters we shall adjourn and resume this afternoon at 2:30.

Thank you to all of your.  Court is adjourned.

(Court resumed at 1435H) 
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  When we parted company this morning, we requested that certain officials be present this afternoon in order to brief us on certain issues that were raised.  Unless the parties would like to make representations before we obtain the said information from the officials, we will first of all give the floor to the Witness Protection Section, so that it may enlighten us on the arrival of Witness PA1, who had to appear this morning but was unable to appear.  And also on the position of Witness PS2, who appears to be experiencing problems coming to Arusha.  We, therefore, give the floor to Mr. Essombe.  
MR. ESSOMBE:
Madam President, Your Honours, Witness PA1 is expected to arrive here in Arusha, today.  In fact, if there have been any changes in the schedule regarding the arrival of this witness, it would only be a matter of hours.  It is the -- the scheduled date of arrival of this witness is the 18th.  The witness informs the Witness Protection Section of his schedule.  And that is what the Witness Protection Section is following:  If the witness had left his country of residence yesterday, he would only have arrived Arusha this morning, but at the time of his departure yesterday, there was some problems with the airline and those problems were resolved, and I spoke with the witness, and he will be arriving in a few hours.  Regarding Witness PS1, the problem in question has to do with delays. 

Madam President, you would recall that the decision amending the list of witnesses of Father Seromba was issued, if I remember correctly, on the 23rd of March.  We obtained a copy of that decision a few days after it was issued.  I believe it was either on the 30th or the 31st of March.  And when we obtained information regarding Witness PS2, we informed the Chamber that we were experiencing a certain number of administrative problems regarding the country of residence of Witness PS2.  Be that as it may, we contacted the administrative authorities of that country, including a very peculiar service in that country.  A very special service in that country which did everything to facilitate our work, but the ministry in charge told us they couldn't do much before the beginning of May.  That is where we are at now.  In the scenario we had two witnesses, PS2 and a witness who has to appear before another trial -- in another trial in this Tribunal.  That witness arrived here yesterday, but with regard to the PS2, the authorities informed us that they couldn't issue a travel document to that person before early May.  That is the problem we are experiencing, Madam President, I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Essombe.  We will now give the floor to Mr. Guindo regarding accused 
Athanase Seromba's passport.  We are talking of the Zairian passport.  Mr. Guindo, you have the floor.  
MR. GUINDO:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I have the honour to answer this question before your Chamber regarding the passport that was registered when Mr. Athanase Seromba was admitted to the detention facility on the 6th of February 2002.  It is a passport of the Rwandan republic, 
No. 0104684/94; which we received when the Accused was admitted.  We also have a national identity card No. 189902 -- sorry, 187902, dated 4th of January 1999 -- 1988.  These are the documents in our possession at the detention facility.  We also have a document that was established when the accused was admitted, as well as, the list of all items in his possession when he was admitted into the detention facility.  Madam President this is all the information we have in our possession.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Guindo.  

After receiving this information, we would like you to react, Counsel Monthé, in light of what has been said.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, good afternoon.  I will, of course, start with what is easier.  I am happy to see commandant Guindo giving us appropriate information, but I would request that the Chamber should direct that the photocopy of the passport should be provided to us so that we can do our work.  If it doesn't - this shouldn't pose any particular problems since we are only talking of the photocopy of the said passport.  This is the easiest of the issues.  We have another one which is more thorny, regarding Witness PS2's situation because there has been an incident, Madam President during -- regarding the continuation of these proceedings.  If the witness cannot be here before May, 
in spite of the efforts made by Mr. Essombe, I do not see how, we, the Defence of Father Seromba, can do our work.  I said this morning that it was contrary to what I have been doing in criminal proceedings.  The Accused cannot be heard before all the witnesses have been heard.  That is why I request, 
Madam President, that you take the necessary decision, taking into account the interest of justice and the interest of the Accused, because if Witness PS2 is not present, I don't see how Accused Seromba can give evidence.   I said it this morning, I repeat this afternoon.  I hope this doesn't pose any problem to the Chamber.  I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  I will now request the Prosecutor to make his presentations, if at all he has any, on those two points.  
MR. MOSES: 
May it please Your Honour.  Firstly regarding the passport, Your Honours have the Prosecutor's submissions on which we would concur with the application of the Defence and ask that copies of the Accused's passport be provided to the Defence, the Prosecution and the Chamber.  So far as PS2 is concerned, the last point that my learned friend raised, his submission was that the Accused should not have to go to his testimony prior to the evidence of PS2.  We would refer Your Honours to the decision of the Bureau of the Tribunal in the Butare case.  I don't have the date of that decision, but it was in the last month or two, which held that no such right existed; that the accused does not have a right to testify last.  And I regret as to respect particularly in this case, where Your Honours have before you the proposed subject matter of the evidence, that PS2 is to testify in respect to -- and there's nothing in the Prosecutor's submission, contained in that statement, which would prejudice in one iota the Defence in having the Accused testify before Witness PS2.  In respect to PS2 -- Your Honours, we would ask that steps be taken to either Your Honours raise the issue of the possibility of a video conference.  We would certainly support such a measure as it was to enable the Trial Chamber to hear the testimony of PS2 quickly and we would argue all steps to be taken to ensure that witnesses' testimony can be heard in the shortest possible time from now.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  The coordinator is in touch with registry and he will obtain clarifications regarding the possibility of having Witness PS2 depose by video link.  But I think we - we haven't given certain information to the registry, and the registry has to make the necessary contacts in order to enlighten us on whether it is possible or not to hear the evidence of Witness PS2 by video link.  

The Chamber directs the Witness Protection Section to provide the Defence counsel with a copy of the Rwandan passport of Father Seromba, so that it may do its - it may prepare its case.  Regarding Witness PS2, the Defence should also enlighten us on whether or not he is ready to appear by video link.  All the necessary contacts have been made.  According to the information we have received, we should obtain precise information tomorrow, but we still need to know whether that witness is ready to testify by video link, because from today's proceedings we understand that he cannot be physically present during the session -- present here in court during the session - this session.
 
If there are any other issues that the parties would like to raise, we will hear them.  But, of course, we cannot exclude the possibility of hearing the Accused, who would like to testify in his own case.  That is to hear him before a witness who is not coming forward in time.  But if PS2 arrives today, it will be possible for us to hear him tomorrow.  Excuse me, I referred to PS2, but I mean PS1.  If 
PS1 arrives today as expected, we could take his evidence tomorrow.  And if his testimony by video link, that is, the video conference of - the video testimony by video link, of PS2, if it is going to last a few days, we should start preparing for the testimony of Father Seromba, because there have been cases in which the witness has -- the Accused has testified before the end of the Defence case.  If there are any other issues to be raised, we give the floor to the parties. 
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Madam President, there are indeed some other issues that we would like to raise.  During the last session in December, before we parted company, we requested that an investigation be carried out on Rwandan witnesses.  We do not know what decision was taken when we parted company, as you know the date of the 27th of April is the deadline for these proceedings.  And we would like to know what the Chamber's position is regarding submission of briefs, closing briefs, because we would like to have an idea as to the dates for this.  Unless the Prosecution corrects me, we believe that the Prosecution has to first file his brief before the Defence can respond.  These issues are indispensable, 
Madam President, for the continuance of these proceedings, because we have scheduling problems.  The coordinator should inform us accordingly so that we can find ways and means of making progress.  Madam President, these are practical issues I would like to raise regarding our proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.  Prosecutor you have the floor.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  Clearly the filing of closing briefs is a matter for 
Your Honours to decide as to how it is to be done in various, -- it is done in various ways, and my submission, some Trial Chambers do as my learned friend has submitted, ask the Prosecution to file first and then the Defence to respond.  Other Trial Chambers require both the Prosecution and Defence to file on the same day.  And then for the oral hearing, it is usually scheduled for a subsequent time to be used to -- for both parties to respond to the matters raised in each others' closing briefs.  That, certainly, seems to be the way in which matters can be done more promptly, because it serves - it tends to serve the court time.  But it's a matter for Your Honours, and I don't make any submissions at this stage in respect of all that; but clearly, there are two ways in which Trial Chambers can deal with the issue.  

The only other issue the Prosecution wishes to raise, Your Honours have asked WVSS to provide the Defence with a copy of the Accused's passport.  I simply remind Your Honours that the Prosecution has asked that copies be provided not only to the Defence, but also to the Prosecution and Your Honours as well.  And I don't know if your ruling is decided on that issue or whether it is an oversight and we would certainly be maintaining our request that a copy be provided to the Prosecution as well.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, regarding the Prosecutor's concerns, if we said so to the Defence, it's because it is the Defence that filed a written motion.  And it goes without saying that a copy of the passport will similarly be given to the Bench and to the Prosecutor.  

Now, regarding the filing of briefs, clearly an order will be issued in that regard.  And let me, however, point out right from now to the parties that the Chamber is considering the date of say; for the closing statements by both parties, more or less on or before the 27th of June.  27th of June.  We, therefore, would allow the parties a period of two months.  Clearly it is a session that will be held at the time.  The briefs will be filed -- definitely be filed prior to that.  There will be an order issued in that regard.  I believe, I have answered all your questions.  Are there any further issues one would want to raise?  

Counsel Monthé, you also spoke about some pending motions.  We think we will be able to hand down our decision tomorrow.  We have made lots of progress in that respect.  It is better to schedule it for the end of the week.  Maybe we might need to extend our deliberations further, no later than Friday.  Clearly, if we will finish before then, we will issue the decision.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
On some minor matter in which I didn't follow you, that is in connection with the filling of briefs, I didn't quite understand if your ruling or order will also determine the circumstances under which those briefs whether it will be first of all the Prosecutor, or both parties at the same time, and because this is a crucial point for us and we need to organise ourselves.  If we have to answer the questions from the accusing party, clearly as the traditional, we will have to speak last.  That is after the accusing or the Prosecutor's brief is filed then we will answer.  This is customary and it's our hope that this will be the case here.  And when you would have determined the date, please we would need to be informed so that we can organise ourselves.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The order to determine the dates for the filing of briefs by parties; that is that it should be filed before the 27th of June.  This, of course, will be determined well beforehand and that will be done by an order.  It will therein be specified whether the parties will file simultaneously and in those circumstances, parties will then make their views known in the course of the hearing, and in answer to any matters that might be raised by the other party.  It might be possible that we might ask the Prosecutor to file his briefs slightly before the Defence, but it goes without saying that the Defence would need to file the briefs on the date schedule within the order.  So, parties should be prepared to proceed with the exchange of briefs.  

Have I been more or less clear to both parties?  Very well then, we thank you.  Can we then adjourn?  In view of the fact that there are no further matters, we adjourn and we resume tomorrow at 9 a.m. 

Court stands adjourned.
