MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

Could the registry read out the case that appears on the cause list this morning?
MS. NTILATWA:
Introduction by the registrar, represented by Stephania Ntilatwa.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 23 March 2006, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Athanase Seromba, Case No. ICTR-2001-66-T.

Please, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, registry.

We now ask the parties to enter their appearance.  We start with the Office of the Prosecutor.
MS. ARBIA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  For the Office of the Prosecutor, that's myself, Silvana Arbia, Jonathan Moses, Althea Alexis, Gregory Townsend and Tolulope Olowoye.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.

We now turn to the Defence counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  I would like, all the same, Madam President -- acquit myself of some longstanding tradition.  We separated, I think, in December and the Defence didn't have the opportunity to extend its best wishes to the Chamber and to all those contributing to the manifestation of truth.  With respect to the trial team, my name is Patrice Monthé, a former president of the Bar of Cameroon, and, by me, Mr. Nekuie, who is counsel based in the Douala, and, then, our legal assistant, Ngo Bihegue Sanah, who is based in Yaoundé.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.

It is our understanding, Madam Prosecutor -- it is our understanding that you intend to file a motion before this Court.  You may now address the Court.
MS. ARBIA:
Thank you, Madam President.

The Prosecutor, with the leave of the Court, would like to file a motion requesting the Chamber to undertake a visit to the site, as described either in the indictment or as stated by the witness, that is, both witnesses for the Prosecutor and for the Defence.  It is the view of the Prosecutor that that site inspection would assist the Trial Chamber in identifying more specifically -- or, more precisely the sites (sic) that are of concern to us in the instant matter.

In some other matters before this Tribunal, the Trial Chamber had deemed it necessary to undertake an inspection of the site.  It, therefore, lies with you to carry out an appraisal of that motion being filed before you; however, the Prosecutor respectfully submits that such a visit to the site would be a necessary addition -- or, supplement to an understanding of the matters that will be brought before the Court and for an appraisal of the testimonies that will be brought before you.  The Prosecutor will reserve the right to provide -- or, make specific reference to the sites for which it seeks an inspection by the Trial Chamber, and, of course, to comply with any other instructions, directives or orders that the Chamber might issue with respect to this motion.

This is an all-embracing motion for now, and if the Trial Chamber is of the view that there is further need to be more specific, that is, with respect to the names of the sites, that can be done by the Prosecutor.  For now, I confine myself to requesting, in general terms, that there be a trip -- or, a visit to the site without going into the details.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.

Can I now ask the Defence to address the Court?
MR. MONTHÉ:
Most obliged, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, Defence holds as a matter of principle that when motions filed by the Prosecution are founded -- are necessary, objections should not be raised on our part.  We are contributing to the achievement -- the realisation of justice, and I think it is useful that the Court needs to have all the necessary means in order to -- for truth to emerge.  And, so, while the Prosecutor made known what she had wanted to have this Trial Chamber deal with, well, we subscribe to it.  Visiting the site or inspecting the site is an absolute necessity that is in my own legal tradition.  In my humble view, it would enable your Trial Chamber to have an idea and, as it were, to anchor its convictions, so we are prepared also to specify these sites of interest to us, and -- well, I'm in your hands, and my hopes lie in your wisdom.  Thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Monthé.

The Trial Chamber has duly noted the motion filed by the Prosecutor and also the views expressed by the Defence.  We would, all the same, want the parties to be specific as to the sites they would want us to visit.  We might then decide, after obtaining further details.  We are going to see whether it would be possible to go there during the week and, there again, it would be possible, maybe, to go and return on the same day, and this would all depend on arrangements by the registry.  All those clarifications would be provided in the order which we will be issuing immediately we get the information or details we expect from the parties.

We are still waiting for the witness who should appear this morning.  We are told that he will be here in five minutes.  Let us, all the same, remind the Defence team that it should inform the WVSS -- inform the WVSS of the witnesses who should appear so that they are here in time and so that we can start our session at nine o'clock, as scheduled.

Now, unfortunately, we are bound to adjourn briefly while waiting for the witness to get here and so that we can actually start dealing with his testimony.  I think he is FE27, I believe.  Mr. Nekuie or Mr. Monthé?
MR. NEKUIE:
Indeed.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Nekuie says.
MR. NEKUIE:
Indeed, FE27.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, let's adjourn briefly, a couple of minutes, time for the witness to get here.  It would appear is not too far from these premises, so we adjourn briefly.
(Court recessed from 0945H to 0955H)
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We now resume our session.

Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, madam.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you able to follow the proceedings?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you clearly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you are appearing as a witness for the Defence.  Your pseudonym is FE27.  You will be led in evidence by the Defence team.  You will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  Before answering any questions, or giving your evidence, we will ask you -- well, you need to be sworn in and this will be done by the registry. 
(Declaration made by Witness FE27 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness, and the registry.  

Mr. Nekuie, will you be the one leading the witness?
MR. NEKUIE:
Absolutely, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can now proceed.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, now that I am about to the start the examination-in-chief of Witness FE27, let me perform a duty as an officer of the court, first of all, by extending my regards to you, the Honourable Judges of this Court, and my greetings to the Prosecution, and let me also express my thanks to those assisting us in ensuring that the proceedings go smoothly in this Court.

That having been done, Your Honours, let me now turn to witness FE27 and to say to him:
WITNESS FE27,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Witness FE27, Father Seromba, whose counsel we are, has asked us to extend his thanks to you for having accepted to come and enlighten the Trial Chamber here with respect to what you know on this matter.  We will, Witness FE27, lead you in your evidence in-chief, and before we embark on that, I would like for you to look at that sheet before you, check it, and tell the Court whether the particulars appearing therein actually represent your identity.
A.	All the particulars therein are correct.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, since the witness has ascertained (sic) the authenticity of his PIS, that's personal identification sheet, that has been distributed to all the parties in this Chamber, I would like to pray the Court to admit this document as defence exhibit under reference No. D. 66.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nekuie.

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objection to that?
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
No, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  So, the personal identification sheet of Witness FE27 is hereby admitted as Defence exhibit, reference D. 66, and this will be put under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 66 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Nekuie.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	We are now going to begin with your examination-in-chief and I'd like to start by asking you if you are ready to carry on with me.  Are you ready?
A.	Thank you.  I am ready to answer the questions you will be putting to me.
THE WITNESS:
But, before that, Madam President, Your Honours, before I start giving my testimony before this Trial Chamber, I would like to seek to be given protection by this Trial Chamber.  I will also like to request for protection for my family in the event that I may have problems because of my testimony before this Trial Chamber.  I am doing so because I'm aware that somebody came and gave testimony before this Trial Chamber and that that person, normally, was living freely at his or her place, but after having testified before this Trial Chamber, she (sic) was arrested and put in prison.  I would, therefore, like to tell the Court that when we give testimony before the Court, we put our security in danger because of that, as we have come to realise.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this Trial Chamber has heard what you have said.  You are a protected witness, of course, of the Tribunal.  Probably, the witness you are talking about was prosecuted in other courts before he (sic) appeared here to give testimony, so there may be a problem of proceedings here.  So -- but we are not aware of that problem, but we are going to see -- to look into what happened.  You should know, however, that you are a protected witness and that your family is also protected.  And I will take this opportunity to advise you not to give any information -- or, reveal any information that may disclose your identity during the cross -- during the examination-in-chief as well as the cross-examination, and if you feel that a question is likely to reveal your identity.  Mr. Nekuie, you may proceed.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.

Madam President, Your Honours, on account of the fears that the witness has just voiced and given the nature of the first questions I'll be putting to him, which may require that he gives out names of places that may end up revealing his identity, I would like to pray that this Court order, at least, the first stage of this examination-in-chief be done in closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, do you think that this portion which will be done in closed session -- how long will it take?
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I can't say for sure, but I think this could take about an hour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nekuie.

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any objections to the request made by the Defence?
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Madam President, we do not have any objections to beginning in closed session if that would protect the identity of the witness; however, we reserve the right to ask this Honourable Court to revert to open session when we are of the view that the danger has passed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  The Trial Chamber will now be sitting in closed session in order to ensure the protection of the witness and in the interests of justice.  We, therefore, crave the indulgence of those in the gallery.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 7 to 20] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 6 by Verna Butler)


MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are trying to catch up with the time we lost at the beginning.  If you want us to take a brief recess, we can, but if you don't mind, we can continue for another one hour in this morning's session.  
THE WITNESS:
I have not yet tired, and if it's possible, we may carry on.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  

So, Mr. Nekuie, you may proceed.  We are in open court right now.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE27, you were edifying the Trial Chamber as to the person who asked the préfet to send gendarmes.  Are you going to say that Father Seromba didn't say that he already had at his disposal six gendarmes at that meeting?  Did you really confirm that?  
A.	I confirm that and would like to state that at that time there were no gendarmes.  The gendarmes came in the evening and it was the bourgmestre who had requested the préfet to send the gendarmes.  The préfet, therefore, sent the gendarmes, and the commune accepted to be responsible for their upkeep.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Now, talking about those refugees, you say that at that meeting the decision was taken that food from Caritas be distributed to them as well as food from the nutrition centre.  Is that indeed what you said?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is what I told you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, the food supplies from Caritas and from the nutrition centre, do you know whether the food was actually distributed to the refugees following the decision that was taken at that meeting? 
A.	Yes, the foodstuff was distributed.  The food was distributed because on that day the bourgmestre who had decided to distribute the food was aware that the food items were available and he said he was going to apprise the director of Caritas.  And as for the director of the nutrition centre, he was present at the meeting.  His name was Charles Mugenzi.  And the decision was taken, therefore, that the food supplies be distributed to the refugees.  That decision was taken in the course of that meeting. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Now, the director of the nutrition centre, what was his ethnicity, did you know? 
A.	I have already said it.  The person in charge of the nutrition centre, Charles Mugenzi, was Tutsi.  He, therefore, was the director of the Nyange health centre. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  At what point in time did the refugees that were at the communal office transfer to the Nyange parish?  Can you recall that? 
A.	The refugees that were at the communal office, even if I didn't remain there to say exact -- to say the exact day on which they left the communal office, all I can say is that the 13th of April, I transported or carried two girls or -- two girls to that location, one of whom was the god-daughter of my wife.  They were both Tutsis and had come to my place.  They asked me to take them to the parish, because those who had people to accompany them had taken them to that location, so I accepted to do so because they were my wife's god-daughters.  I therefore left them very early.  That's about five a.m., 5:30 a.m.  And by that time we'd already gotten to the communal office, and once we got there, I found a policeman called Aloys Nishyirimbere, N-I-S-H-Y-I-R-I-M-B-E-R-E, Aloys Nishyirimbere, and his colleague, Munyantarama, M-U-N-Y-A-N-T-A-R-A-M-A. 
Q.	Can you please tell us -- can you just mention their titles, if you can remember them?  Otherwise, you may run the risk of revealing your identity.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I therefore found two policemen and they promised that they were going to take them to the parish where the others were already.  I therefore left them there, and I was given the promise that they would be taken to the parish, along with the others, and ensure their protection. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, but that procedure which consisted in taking refugees towards the parish, wasn't this done by coercion?  Wasn't -- were the refugees not forced to go there?
A.	No, the refugees were not taken to the parish forcibly by whoever.  They came to the parish of their own volition, by their own free will -- on their own free will, because they knew that they were going to be protected there.  And as I have told you, this wasn't the first time that they were taking refuge at the parish.  In 1959 they sought refuge in that church.  In 1964, 1973, as well as in 1990, they sought refuge there.  So in 1994, they felt that they would be safe at the parish.  Nobody, therefore, compelled them to go to the church.  They went there willingly, of their own will. 
Q.	Witness FE27, once they got to the church, would you know whether these refugees were deprived of their free movement; that is, to be able to leave the church or not? 
A.	Nobody stripped them of their freedom.  Nobody stopped them from going out.  They went there freely, willingly, and even though they provided protection from gendarmes at the church, this didn't stop those who wanted to bring them food to bring them food.  Nobody, therefore, stopped them from going out.  Just as once some people came to the church, they went out again to look for their other family members to bring to the church.  Nobody, therefore, forced them to remain at the church.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Now, Witness, you stated that you went to the communal office on the 13th of April in the company of your wife's god-daughter.  Is that what you stated? 
A.	Yes.  There were two of them, by the way.  I am referring to those -- well, one of them was my wife's god-daughter, and the other was her neighbour.  I therefore took those two girls to the communal office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  While you were taking those two girls to the communal office, didn't you realise that the refugees that were at the parish were being attacked by their assailants on that 13th day of April 1994? 
A.	It was very early in the morning, at about 5:30.  It was about 5:30, and at that hour the church had not yet been attacked.  When the policeman that I found at the communal office took those girls to the parish, the refugees there -- or the parish hadn't been attacked yet. 
Q.	Do you know whether the church was attacked anyways on that 13th April 1994?  Did you get to learn that?  
A.	No, I did not learn that information.  But I heard that the initial attackers went to the church on Thursday, the 14th.  So there were no attacks on Wednesday, the 13th.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Is it your evidence before this Trial Chamber that up until the 14th of April 1994, the refugees were calm and serene at the Nyange parish?  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Up until the 14th -- up until the 13th of April, the refugees were living safely, but from what I heard, the initial attacks began on the 14th of April and continued on the days following the 14th, up until when the church was destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  While you were taking your god-daughters on that 13th of April 1994 towards the parish, did you learn or was it reported to you in one way or the other that a list of persons that were being sought after and that was drawn up by Father Seromba was being circulated in the commune?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
Madam President, I don't know if I heard correctly, but I seem to understand that the question was asking "when you took those girls to the parish," when the witness, in fact, said he took the girls to the commune.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's also what we heard.  You took the girls to the communal office and the policemen were those who took them to the parish.  

Yes, Mr. Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I don't remember what I said exactly, Madam President, but in any case I'd like to thank the Prosecutor for having corrected me.  My intention was not to say that he took them to the parish.  My question was, while he took the girls to the commune, for them to be taken to the parish, did he learn that there was a list of persons drawn up by Father Seromba that was being circulated in the commune.  
THE WITNESS:
Such a list was never drawn up.  If such a list had been drawn up, I would have been apprised of it.  *********************************************************************************************************** or other persons would have given me information in respect of such a list.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Did you get to realise yourself that Father Seromba at that time, and we are referring to the date of the 13th of April while refugees were going to the parish, did you notice yourself that Father Seromba was crossing the commune, wearing his cassock, and that he was inviting the Tutsis and the refugees to go to the parish. 
A.	No, I never saw him doing that.  At that time I did not see him and I did not hear anyone say that he used a megaphone to invite Tutsis to go to the parish.  I would have heard such information.  If he had moved about in the village, the members of the population would have given me such information, but I never had any such information.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Some moments ago you talked about attacks that were carried out on the 14th and the 15th and that you got to learn about.  Did you personally witness any of such attacks, or did you at any point witness any attack whatsoever that occurred at the Nyange parish church?  
A.	Yes, it was accepted that initial attacks were launched at the church on the 14th of April.  It would appear that on the 15th of April, as well, an attack was launched.  I did not witness -- or, I didn't take part in any of those attacks, but I went to the church on Saturday, since the girls that I talked to you about who were at the parish -- well, I had given some victuals to the girls and I had promised them that I would bring them food on Saturday.  Now, while I was on my way I was told that the church had been attacked the previous day, so I went through the communal office and I found communal policemen there.  But while I was at the communal office, I saw a smoke of dust that had risen above the church, and I was hearing people shouting.  I heard people scream.  So I changed my programme.  I could no longer go to see the girls.  And since the attack was on the way, I told myself I wouldn't be able to find the girls.  I therefore -- I changed, you know, my decision and I went to the parish just to see what was happening and no longer to take food to them.  That is how I found myself at the parish.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  So when you thus found yourself at the parish and learned that the parish had been attacked the previous day, were you able to know who were the assailants who attacked the parish the previous day? 
A.	The previous day?  You mean Thursday?  Well, even if many people are talking about this attack, it is being said that the authors or the leaders of the attack were Ndungutse, the IPG, (sic) and many other persons who had come from different and various corners of the commune, various secteurs of the commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were you able to know whether Father Seromba was mentioned as being one of the assailants of the previous day?  
A.	No, Father Seromba's name was never mentioned.  If his name were mentioned, I would have had the information.  Since I knew Father Seromba, if his name had been mentioned, I would have known that. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Now, while you were at the parish that was under attack, who were those assailants that were attacking the church on that day?  
A.	On the 16th of April, that was a Saturday.  I indeed got to the church at about midday.  There, I found a big crowd, a crowd of people that had come from various corners of the commune, as well as from our commune.  There I also saw people that had come from neighbouring communes.  The church was being demolished by a bulldozer, and that bulldozer was driven by a driver.  That is the driver who was trying to demolish the church.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Now, that driver on that day, was he acting alone, or was he acting in tandem or in conjunction with other persons? 
A.	He was the only person who was driving that bulldozer.  As for the huge crowd that was looking on, they were only looking -- or observing what was happening.  The driver was the only person who was driving the bulldozer.  As far as anybody is concerned who might have ordered him to demolish the church, he alone will know the identity of those people who had -- who ordered or obliged him to destroy the church.  I can't know - or, there is no way for me to know the identity of those people because I didn't ask him to give me the names of those people who had asked him to act in such a way. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  As he was destroying the church, what were the refugees doing at the time?  Because you were on location.  Or were they no longer there?  
A.	The refugees were still inside the church.  But on the Thursday and the Friday, those people who had gone to the church informed me that the refugees had come out of the church in order to try and counterattack or face their assailants face on.  And they had pushed them back to the statue of the Blessed Virgin.  I was also told that on the Friday some of those refugees had died in the church.  In fact, on the Saturday, when I reached the church, I found a number of bodies lying in the church.  

On the Saturday, some refugees were still inside the church and they were trying to move towards the part of the church that had not yet been destroyed. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  And when they tried to move in such a manner, were they still being - or, were they still under attack on that very day, from what you could see?  
A.	Yes, they were still under attack because the bulldozer had already started demolishing part of the church structure and the actual structure had already been destroyed.  So the refugees were trying to hide themselves in that part of the church that had not yet been demolished by the bulldozer.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Who are those people who were attacking the refugees whilst the church was being demolished?  Could you see who those people were? 
A.	They were Hutu, and the Tutsis were inside the church, but I didn't - or, I couldn't get their names.  They were people who had come from other communes, from neighbouring communes of the Kivumu commune. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Those people who were attacking the refugees, were they under the orders of anybody whom you could identify, or did you notice that there were any leaders to this attack?  
A.	There were lots of assailants at the church, so it was impossible to know whether they had a leader.  There was a large crowd. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Did you manage to notice within this large crowd of assailants whether Father Athanase Seromba was actually there whilst you were there? 
A.	No, I did not see Father Seromba.  Had Father Seromba been present or been amongst the crowd, I would have seen him and I would have recognised him because I knew him.  So he was not amongst those people, and I don't even believe he went there.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Exactly where were you when the demolishing and also the attacks were being launched? 
A.	I reached the parish at approximately midday, but on arriving at the parish, I didn't stand in any particular place.  I was moving around.  And, afterwards, when I realised what was going on, and it wasn't a very nice situation, I decided to leave because it was actually rather horrible.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  From those places where you were, could you see anybody in particular attacking the refugees from the presbytery of the church? 
A.	Yes, I could easily see.  In fact, there were many people there and I could see and distinguish those people. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Were you able to see on that day the bourgmestre, ************************? 
A.	No, I didn't see the bourgmestre on that day.  And he might have arrived in the morning.  He might have left by the time I arrived, or he could even have come by after my departure.  But I did not see him on that occasion. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Witness, why do you say that if Father Seromba had been present and had been amongst the assailants on that day, you would have known so, in view of the fact that they were so numerous? 
A.	It was somebody that I knew and had known him in the past so I would not have confused him with other people who were present at the time.  I would have easily recognised him.  
Q.	So, after that date, did you not then find out that Father Seromba was at the first floor of the presbytery and with a rifle in hand, actually firing gunshots at the refugees?  Did you learn this at a later date?  
A.	No.  This piece of information was never given to me, and had this taken place, I might have been informed of it.  I might have heard other people talking about the incident.  So this piece of information did not reach me.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  How long did you stay there on that day during the destruction of the church? 
A.	I arrived at approximately midday and I left the place at approximately 1:00 or 1:30 in the afternoon, which is when I went home.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did it come to your knowledge that there were any survivors amongst the refugees who had come under attack in the church on that day?  
A.	Yes, I was informed that there had been some survivors.  Even if I didn't see them personally, I was told that there were survivors and that the church had, afterwards, sent them to the communal office, and that the authorities had then sent them to the hospital.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Do you know whether it is on the orders of Father Seromba that the survivors that you mentioned were transferred to the communal office?  
A.	It is impossible for me to know who asked for those people to be taken to the communal office, but I do know that they were taken from the church to the communal office and that they were then, afterwards, transferred or sent to the hospital.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know exactly what fate they came to as a result?  
A.	Afterwards, I heard that those people who had survived the killings were then transferred to the health centre and they were provided with medical care, and afterwards they were killed.  I don't know their names, or I don't know the number of people who were killed, but I was told that they were attacked there, where they were receiving medical care, and they were killed.  I don't know who their assailants were.  I don't know the people who killed them.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  But when they were at the communal office and under the protection -- were they not under the protection of the bourgmestre?  
A.	There were police, communal police officers, who were at the communal office and they spent the night there in order to protect the survivors.  I was informed that those people who killed the survivors did it despite the presence of these communal police officers, in the sense that they were only there at night-time and they were not there during the daytime, so the assailants made the most of the fact that those communal police officers were absent during the day. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Who had assigned those communal police officers, and on what date did they do so in order to provide the security or protection of those survivors? 
A.	It is the bourgmestre of the commune who had assigned them or deployed those communal police officers.  As far as the date when they were actually sent to the commune office is concerned, I was told that they were sent there on the Monday, the 18th.  Yes, that's right, the 18th.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Those survivors who were there on the 18th, can you tell me whether it was the survivors who were there on the 18th or whether it was actually the police officers?  Could you enlighten me on that fact, please?  
A.	No, I was talking about the survivors.  It was the survivors who arrived on the 18th.  Anyway, that was what I was told by the communal police officers. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And at what time did the bourgmestre ask the communal police officers to provide them with protection from this date of the 18th? 
A.	The police officers were deployed on that very same day, in order to go and provide the survivors with security. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Do you know exactly when they came under attack again, on which date exactly?  
A.	I don't remember the exact date because I wasn't present at that location, but I think it must have been approximately the 25th or the 26th.  So, it is around that period that the assailants went to kill the survivors who were under the protection of the police - or, the communal police officers who were only on duty at night-time and not during the day. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness 27 -- FE27.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would like in my following question to ask the witness to talk to me about a meeting, and I am concerned that he might reveal some names in so doing.  I don't know if you would allow me to go into a closed session in order to do so.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you not have talked about this meeting at an earlier time during our closed session?  Because we've already gone into closed session.  
MR. NEKUIE:
That is true, Madam President.  But I don't think that that would have allowed me to follow the logical steps of my examination-in-chief, and that's why I have reserved this question for the end.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we only have approximately ten minutes left.  Would it be possible for the witness to provide in writing those names, and in so doing, that would not reveal his identity?  
MR. NEKUIE:
That's fine, Madam President.  I just wanted to enlighten you on this question because I'm sure that he's going to mention some names and I think that the Chamber might be -- it might be in the interest of the Chamber to know exactly what's coming.  And if he could do so by writing, that would be fine by me.  The only problem remaining would be the record, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the document will be annexed to the record, and if he gives us those names in writing, then that document will be filed and placed under seal.  I think that we could attempt the experience, and if it doesn't work, then we can go into closed session.  

Mr. Witness, Counsel Nekuie would like to ask you a last question and this might reveal your identity, but if you note down in writing the names of those people who took part or assisted -- attended that meeting, then this would make sure that you did not provide information that would reveal your identity.  If you think, however, that this question is dangerous, then you should tell us so, and then we will go into a closed session.  

Counsel, you may proceed and ask this last question.  
THE WITNESS:
I think that -- in response or in replying to this question, I think I will write those names down on a piece of paper.  That's no problem at all for me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness, for your cooperation.  

Counsel Nekuie, would you like to ask the question?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness FE27, you said in response to my last question that the survivors that you mentioned were taken to the communal office on the 18th, on Monday, the 18th of April 1994.  And then you said that they came under attack on the 25th of April, you said.  Do you know whether, before this attack, a meeting was convened in the communal office on the 20th of April 1994, specifically, on the subject of those survivors?  
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  Indeed, on the 20th of April a meeting was held at the communal office.  I took part in this meeting.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), in fact.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What the witness just said about -- there is for the record, the fact that he was (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) should be taken off the record, please.  
THE WITNESS:
So, during this meeting that was held on the 25th, after the meeting the communal conseillers then went to the health centre where the survivors were, but I did not go with them myself.  When they arrived at the health centre, they found the survivors there.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	In your account and for your protection, -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He didn't finish his question.
  
THE WITNESS:
I can't remember the question that was asked of me by Counsel.  I don't know whether he asked me whether he wanted me to give him the issues that were actually covered in the meeting, and if so -- 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, indeed, Witness FE27, my question aimed at asking you whether on the 18th and 25th of April a meeting was held at the communal office on the subject of the survivors who had come under attack on the 25th of April.  You have already answered that question, so we're going to proceed.  

I wanted you to tell me whether you knew, yes or no, whether Father Seromba had convened and chaired that meeting of the 20th of April 1994.  
A.	No, it was not Father Seromba who convened the meeting on the 20th of April.  This was convened by the bourgmestre who was at the head of the commune, and the meeting was chaired by the bourgmestre.  That had nothing to do with the meetings that were held at a commune level - or, the level of the commune.  In fact, he was not invited to this meeting.  **********************************************************************.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  Can you now tell us of the precise purpose of this meeting?  And could you also give us any names of people who attended those meetings, and in so doing, could you write them down on the piece of paper that we've just given you?  
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  You are asking me to write down the names of those people who took part in the meeting?  I'm going to start by talking to you about the purpose of this meeting.  It was a meeting covering issues of security, notably, security issues within the secteur.  

The second item on the agenda was with reference to a tour that the bourgmestre was organising throughout the different secteurs in order to inform the members of the population.  

The third item on the agenda was the survivors or those Tutsis who had managed to escape, and we had to know how to manage the situation.  

So the conclusions of that meeting -- and as a conclusion to that meeting it was decided that, as far as security was concerned within the secteur, that each conseiller and communal police officer were then assigned to each secteur in order to take responsibility for the security of the inhabitants.  And, also, we talked about the tour that the bourgmestre was going to undertake throughout the different secteurs of the commune.  

The bourgmestre told us and told the communal conseillers the date on which he planned to go to each and every secteur.  As far as the third item on the agenda is concerned, i.e., how to manage the survivors, we decided that as far as their property was concerned, nobody was supposed to take it on - or, to take possession of their property.  Any person who would seize those plots belonging to the Tutsis had to pay a sum of money that would then be handed over to the conseiller, the conseiller in charge of the area where the plot was located, and this money was to be paid to the commune.  A receipt was then to be issued.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness FE27.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I think that in view of the hour, Madam President, I think that I could carry on with this point once we come back, unless you are of a differing opinion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do you have many further questions for the witness?  
MR. NEKUIE:
I think I will be leading him for a further 30 minutes, at least, Your Honour, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We will adjourn and we will reconvene at half past 2:00 this afternoon.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed at 1229H) 
(Pages 21 to 31 by Karen Holm)



















(Court resumed at 1442H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

Mr. Nekuie, you are to continue now or proceed with the evidence-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before proceeding with that examination-in-chief, and I can assure you I will conclude this afternoon.  I wish to (unintelligible) my approach to this witness.  The witness tends to refer to himself because of the duties he performed, so I was wondering instead of asking him to put these names on paper all of the time, wouldn't it be more convenient or suitable that we continue with these proceedings, or this examination-in-chief in closed session so as to avoid any moving away from the closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, have you followed the point being made by Mr. Nekuie?  
MS. ALEXIS-WINDSOR:
I have, indeed, Madam President.  And we are in your hands, Madam President.  If the Court decides to have the following proceedings in closed session, then we will not object. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Very well, then, we will continue with this examination-in-chief of the witness in closed session for purposes of protecting the witness himself and in the interest of justice because we have noticed that, indeed, he tends to refer to the duties that he performed at the time and that is rather risky, of course.  

Too bad and we're sorry but for those in the public gallery because they will have to leave because we will continue in closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 33 to 59] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
