MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like to begin by saying good morning to Mr. Seromba and his counsel, and to counsel for the Prosecution, to the registry staff, and to the interpreters and all others in the courtroom.  

I have to apologise on behalf of the panel for the short delay which was due to good reasons.  

Madam Registrar, would you please call the case.  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen, presiding, Patrick Robinson, Liu Daqun, Theodor Meron, and Wolfgang Schomburg, are sitting this morning, the 26th of November 2007, in open session in order to hear the arguments of the Appellants and the Respondent on the matter on the roll, that is, number ICTR-2001-66-A, the Prosecutor versus Athanase Seromba.  

I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Seromba, can you clearly hear and understand the translation?  Thank you.  

Now, I ask for all the appearances of the parties following the sequence in which the notices of appeal have been filed.  First, counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. JALLOW:
Good morning, Your Lordships, and welcome back to Arusha.  The Prosecutor appears in person; and, with me, Madam Dior Fall, senior appeals counsel; Alfred Orono, appeals counsel; Gregory Townsend and Abdoulaye Seye, appeals counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now counsel for Mr. Seromba.  
MR. MONTHÉ.
Mr. President, Your Lordships, the members of the Appeals Chamber, I am assisted by my co-counsel, Ms. Sarah Bihegué, who is a lawyer in the Cameroon bar association, with residence in Yaoundé, and yours truly, Patrice Monthé, an advocator in the Cameroon bar association and the former bar president.  

I'm obliged to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, in accordance with the scheduling order issued on 26 October 2007, the Appeals Chamber will now hear the oral arguments of the parties in the case just announced.  I will briefly summarise the appeals which are pending before the Appeals Chamber in this case and the manner in which we will proceed today. 

The Prosecution and Mr. Seromba appeal from a judgement rendered 13th December 2006 by Trial Chamber III, composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, and Judges Hökborg and Kam.  

The appeals concern certain events which took place at the Nyange parish, Kivumu commune, 
Kibuye préfecture, between 6 and 20th April 1994.  In connection with those events, the Trial Chamber found Mr. Seromba guilty of aiding and abetting genocide, Count 1, and aiding and abetting extermination as a crime against humanity, Count 4.  The Trial Chamber dismissed the alternative charge of complicity in genocide, Count 2, in the light of Mr. Seromba's conviction for genocide, and acquitted him on the charge of conspiracy to commit genocide, Count 3.  The Trial Chamber sentenced Mr. Seromba to a single sentence of 15 years' imprisonment.  The Prosecution filed its notice of appeal on the 11th January 2007.  Mr. Seromba filed his notice of appeal on 19 January 2007. 

I will now briefly summarise the grounds of appeal of the parties, giving an impression only.  

The Prosecution presents three grounds of appeal.  In ground one, the Prosecution submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law and in fact in concluding that Mr. Seromba had not committed, ordered and planned the crimes of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity through his participation in the massacres at the Nyange parish in April 1994.  In ground two, the Prosecution submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law and in fact in finding Mr. Seromba not guilty of conspiracy to commit genocide.  In ground three, independently from the first two grounds, the Prosecution requests that the Appeals Chamber increase Mr. Seromba's sentence of 15 years for aiding and abetting genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and impose a sentence between 30 years and life imprisonment. 

Turning now to Mr. Seromba's appeal, ground one alleges a violation of his right to a fair trial, resulting from the closing of his Defence case, while a motion for disqualification was still pending, and a violation of his right to appear as a witness.  Ground two alleges the existence of defects in the indictment and said claims that they violated Mr. Seromba's right to properly conduct his defence.  Grounds three to seven challenge the factual findings upon which the Trial Chamber based its convictions pursuant to Article 6(1) of the statute for aiding and abetting genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity; namely, the findings that Mr. Seromba prevented refugees from taking food from the parish plantation, banana plantation, ground three; that he refused to celebrate Mass for the Tutsi refugees, ground four; that he dismissed four Tutsi employees, one of whom was subsequently killed, ground five; that he expelled or refused entry into the parish and presbytery of Tutsi refugees who were subsequently killed, ground six; and he played a role in the distribution of the Nyange church, ground seven.  Ground eight challenges Mr. Seromba's conviction for aiding and abetting genocide, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the statute.  Ground nine challenges his conviction for aiding and abetting extermination as a crime against humanity, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the statute.  Finally, in ground 10, Mr. Seromba appeals against the sentence of 15 years' imprisonment. 

Now, counsel may argue the grounds of appeal in the order they consider most suitable.  I would now briefly recall that, as it has been previously said, an appeal is a not trial de novo.  The Appellants must not merely repeat their cases advanced at trial.  Rather, in accordance with Article 24 of the statute of the Tribunal, the Appellants must limit their arguments to alleged errors of law, which invalidate the decision, or alleged errors of fact occasioning a miscarriage of justice.  Additionally, the Appellants have an obligation to provide precise references to materials supporting their arguments on appeal. 

Counsel for the Prosecution will first have one hour to present submissions in his appeal.  Counsel for Mr. Seromba will then have one hour to respond.  Following a 20-minute pause, which we might well reduce to 15 minutes, the Prosecution will have 30 minutes to reply.  The Chamber will then rise until 
2 p.m.  Counsel for Mr. Seromba will then present submissions in support of his appeal from 2 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.  Following a 15 to 20 minutes' break, the Prosecution will respond from 3:50 p.m. until 4:50 p.m.  Counsel for Mr. Seromba will have time to reply from 4:50 p.m. until 5:20 p.m. 
At the end of the proceedings, Mr. Seromba will have an opportunity to address the Appeals Chamber for 15 minutes should he so desire.  Let me add that the Judges may interrupt the submissions at any time to ask questions, or they may ask questions following each party's submissions or at the end of the hearing. 

We will do the appeal by the Prosecution first and then the appeal by Mr. Seromba, in accordance with the sequence in which the notices of appeal have been filed.  

I now invite counsel for the Prosecution to present submissions in support of his appeal.  
MR. ORONO:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I'm Alfred Orono for the Prosecutor.  These are our submissions in the Prosecutor's appeal. 
Your Honour, in ground one of our appeal, we submit that the Trial Chamber erred in law and in fact when it failed to find, based on the fact that it had found -- it failed to conclude in law that not only had the Accused aided and abetted genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity, but he also planned, ordered and committed genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity.  That is our first ground of appeal.  And this is to give you the road map.  Implicit in that, we acknowledge that there are elements of aiding and abetting.  Our basic understanding of aiding and abetting is that the aider and abetter have the knowledge of the intent of the principal perpetrators.  That is there.  The Accused had that knowledge.  But when you look at the Trial Chamber's findings, it goes beyond that.  You look at the Accused's participation, his utterances, you look at all the circumstances of the case, and the facts that were found by the Trial Chamber, the only reasonable conclusion would be that the Accused planned, ordered and, as well, committed commission in the context of paragraph 60 of the Gacumbitsi; that is, direct participation -- that's -- now, those who were tried by the Trial Chamber to aiding and abetting, that's how we have that -- our appeal on sentencing.  That is, yes, it is true he had that knowledge of intent.  But when you look at the findings of the Trial Chamber, the gravity of the offenses, genocide and extermination, there are aggravating factors.  The priest in charge of Nyange parish, the person of authority, his role, his utterances, the horrific way the Tutsi refugees died, Mr. President, this aiding and abetting is of a very high order.  It is not the case that every aider and abetter must get a sentence lower than that of the principal perpetrator.  

This Appeals Chamber has said in Gacumbitsi and it has said in Rutaganda that the aider and abetter usually receives a lower sentence than that of the principal perpetrator.  That is in recognition of the fact that Rule 101 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, read together with Article 23(2) of the statute of the Tribunal, require the Trial Chamber, among other things, to consider the individual circumstances of the Accused, to consider the gravity of the offense.  It follows that -- not -- since every case has its own individual circumstances and since every accused has their own individual circumstances, not all aiders and abetters will have, will be, will receive the penalty lower than that of the principal perpetrator, especially in this case where you have the Accused present, you have the Accused making utterances, you have the Accused person of authority in charge and substantially contributing to the death -- and, Mr. President, this is important:  There were 1,500 Tutsis that were killed -- that was an act of genocide -- in a population of 53,000, including 6,000 Tutsi.  By the 16th of April 1994, that population had reduced further in Kibuye commune.  So let's kick off with our first ground of appeal with that background in mind. 

Mr. President, when you look at paragraph 311 and paragraph 312 of the trial judgement, the Trial Chamber said that the Accused couldn't have ordered -- in those words, "couldn't have 
ordered" -- because he lacked effective control.  That is an error of law, Your Honour.  That is an invitation for you to overturn the decision of the Trial Chamber.  It affects its determination of law, because this Tribunal -- this Chamber, has said in Semanza, in Gacumbitsi, in Kamuhanda, that ordering, pursuant to Article 6(1), does not require effective control.  We have never charged the Accused for ordering pursuant to Article 6(3).  It's not in our notice of appeal; it's not in the pre-trial brief; it's not in the indictment.  We charged him for individual criminal responsibility.  The question then is, did he have the authority to order?  And if he had the authority to order, did he order?  And if our answers to those two questions are yes, as they are, that means the Trial Chamber erred.  

Okay, let's deal with whether he had the authority to order.  Mr. President, the Trial Chamber's own findings show that the Accused was the priest in charge of Nyange parish.  He was at all times present.  That's paragraph 214 for his presence and paragraph 38 and paragraph 341 of the judgement.  Those are the findings of the Trial Chamber:  He was the priest in charge.  And when you look at the evidence accepted by the Trial Chamber, Witness CDL said that there is nothing that was done without the consent of the father.  The Trial Chamber itself found that the Accused ordered -- he ordered -- look at the word, ordered -- he ordered the gendarmes to shoot at the refugees who were trying to get food from the banana plantation.  That shows -- that's a finding that shows that he had the ability to order.  

Secondly, the Accused expelled Tutsi employees.  That's his own authority.  He had the authority to order.  

Thirdly, on the 15th of April 1994, after failing -- after several attempts to destroy the church using explosives, using dynamite, using attackers, using petrol, when the attackers attempted to 
proceed -- to proceed to the courtyard of the presbytery, the Trial Chamber found that the Appellant ordered -- ordered the attackers to stop killing and to remove the dead bodies first.  That is at paragraph 191 of the judgement, Your Honour.  Implicit in that is the fact that the Appellant had the authority.  He could order and he did order.  And, Mr. President, on that fateful day, on the 
16th of April 1994, having accepted the decision of the authorities to destroy the church -- that's paragraph 239, paragraph 238 and paragraph 269 -- the driver of the bulldozer, having been ordered by the authorities -- that's according to the Trial Chamber -- to destroy the church turned to Seromba and said, "Father, should I really destroy this church?"  He did not say yes once, not even twice, three times, and he compelled that reluctant driver of the bulldozer to go and destroy the church.  That, Your Honour, is an order by someone who had authority, an order that was complied with, and the consequence was the destruction of Nyange church, with over 1,500 Tutsi refugees, unarmed refugees, died on that day by that order.  That, Your Honour, is sufficient for you to overturn the decision of the Trial Chamber.  And the Trial Chamber goes on to say that the Appellant -- I mean, the Respondent did not have the specific intent to commit genocide. 

Your Honours, intent, as you said in Gacumbitsi, an established principle of the Tribunal, that it's not subject to direct proof.  It's only the accused who can tell you that he had the intent.  What are we left with?  We -- as you have established in the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, we have to glean the intent of the accused from the circumstances of the offence, from the context, from the utterances of the accused, from the number of victims, 1,500 here.  You have to glean that from the actions of the accused.  What context do we have here?  We have the context of genocide, accepted by the Trial Chamber, that between April 6th and 20th, there were acts of genocide and extermination.  Refugees were fleeing from their homes for the safety of Nyange parish, where they knew they had this young, well-respected priest who was going to provide them with protection.  And then you see this priest, well-respected priest, when the refugees are trying to get food, because they are hungry, they tried to venture into the banana plantation; what does he do?  He orders the gendarmes to shoot them.  That shows the intent.  You look at the Accused's actions specifically directed at the Tutsis.  There were many Tutsi employees and Hutu employees at Nyange parish, by the evidence.  But he picked out Félicien, Alex, Gasore and Patrice.  He left Papias, who was the cook; he left Witness CBK, who was a goatherd.  He specifically expelled the Tutsi, and he left the Hutu.  And he expelled them at a time when he knew that Tutsis were being killed, killed, and they had come to -- for safety in his place.  And when Patrice tried to come back, little CBK went upstairs to Father Seromba -- that's the finding of the Trial Chamber -- and told him that Patrice was outside; he was wounded on the hand and the leg.  Father Seromba said, "No, let him go."  He did not stay there.  He came downstairs; physically chased away Patrice who was resisting.  When he was resisting, he ordered the gendarmes to chase him away.  They did not take him two kilometres away.  Just behind the courtyard, behind the courtyard of the presbytery, that is where they killed him.  That shows genocidal intent.  

Mr. President, the Accused accepted the decision of the authorities to destroy the church.  That has to be seen in the context of the 15th of April where the authorities had attempted to destroy the church using dynamite, gasoline and throwing grenades.  He says -- I just want to give you the correct paragraph because this is important.  He says at paragraph 239, "If you have no other means of doing it, bring these bulldozers."  Now, the only inference from that statement is that he had sanctioned the other attempts on the 15th.  Now that those attempts had failed, the only solution available was to use the bulldozers.  And what were those bulldozers going to do?  They were going to destroy the church in which over 1,500 Tutsi refugees were seeking refuge.  That, Mr. President, shows the intent, the specific intent, for genocide and the requisite intent for extermination as a crime against humanity. 

Mr. President, on the 16th of April, having compelled the driver of the bulldozer to destroy the church, the Respondent did not stop there.  He went and directed him to the weak side of the church.  That is intent; that is genocidal intent.  He was targeting specifically the Tutsis.  And that is the requisite intent for extermination as a crime against humanity because he intended, as part of a systematic attack against a civilian population, to cause maximum damage, and over 1,500 Tutsis were killed on that day.  That is an error.  That is a finding that opens the door for intervention to revise this position of the Trial Chamber and find that the Accused had the genocidal intent to commit genocide and the requisite intent for extermination as a crime against humanity. 

Let's move on to committing.  Mr. President, committing, as we understand at paragraph 60 of the Gacumbitsi judgement -- I notice there has been a lot of talk about that, but our position is, and we have charged the Accused for direct participation in genocide.  Now, the Accused was at all times present in Nyange parish.  He was there.  He was either in the presbytery or at the secretariat; always within close proximity.  He was meeting with officials, the communal authorities.  The Trial Chamber said that the Prosecutor has not proved that those meetings were to discuss extermination.  Okay.  He meets these people and thereafter they go out and supervise attacks.  He accepts their decision to destroy the church.  He is physically on the ground.  And on the 16th of April, he was standing with the guy in charge of criminal investigations, he was standing with the bourgmestre, he was standing with 
CDL -- that's the testimony of Witness CBK -- who said that Witness CDL, who has got a very special relationship with the bourgmestre -- I wouldn't like to mention that relationship because it too will expose whom CDL is, but it is there.  When you look at the form, the personal information form, it tells you what special role CDL had to the bourgmestre.  He was standing there with them.  At that time when he accepted that decision, Your Honour, he was at peace with the attackers.  He was an attacker at that time; he was not an outsider.  He was not in Kigali; he was there on the ground.  When they are making decisions to attack the church using a bulldozer that resulted in the killing of over 1,500 Tutsis, he was there on the ground.  He gave the consent that was required; he gave the authority.  He was the moral leader; he was a priest, don't forget that.  Whatever is said, he is the guy who had the most interest in that church.  That was his church where he preached.  That was his -- part of his congregation.  Who would have more interest in that church remaining standing than him?  He personally accepted that decision part, and that, according to Gacumbitsi, makes him a direct participant in the acts that led in the actus reus of genocide, in the actus reus of extermination, and that failure of the Trial Chamber to give sufficient regard to the actions, to his role, to his utterances, to his expelling Tutsi refugees at that time when he knew that the situation outside the parish was precarious, Mr. President, that is committing genocide.  

In terms of planning, the Trial Chamber had provided a definition of planning, and if we go by that definition, it utterly failed to apply the facts that it had found to the law.  Mr. President, the Trial Chamber said, in the legal definition of the acts, it said where two or more people contemplate and design the commission of a plan at the preparatory and execution stage.  That is what he said, or words to that effect -- I'm not reading it verbatim, but you have the opportunity to look at it.  Now, two or more people -- Seromba, Kayishima and all these other authorities -- were with him, so we have two or more people.  Now, "Bring in the bulldozers -- if you have nothing else, bring in the bulldozers."  They are preparing -- they are preparing to destroy the church in which over 1,500 Tutsi refugees are in.  They accept that decision.  He instructs the driver of the bulldozer to do that, to destroy the church, and that's the execution.  The plan has been executed.  He directs the bulldozer driver to hit the church at the weak side.  The consequence of that is this massive church -- you have all this timber, bricks falling onto these civilians.  What a horrific way to die.  That's the plan.  It's executed, carried out by the Accused, together with other authorities.  That's all we can say about the plan, and we rely on our submissions in the trial brief for that -- I mean, not the trial brief -- in our Appellant's brief for that in that regard. 

Your Honour, I will move into sentencing.  Because in the road map I provided you, I think sentencing is joint -- is an independent ground on its own.  But the first ground provides you an idea, the flavor, of the error of the Trial Chamber.  We say, yes, there were elements of aiding and abetting.  The Accused knew the intent of these people.  But a 15-year prison term for the murder, the atrocious murder, killing of over 1,500 Tutsi refugees?  Now, there is that number that died in the church, but how about those who were wounded?  Look at all those others who were killed between the 6th, the 7th of April up to the 20th.  In the circumstances, given the role -- the individual circumstances of Athanase Seromba, as the priest in charge of Nyange parish, he was also the member of the security committee by virtue of his role as the priest, and that gives him, if he'd lacked it, the added impetus to give protection, to provide security to all his parishioners, and he breached that level of trust.  That is an aggravating fact.  

These refugees, these Tutsis, left their homes, and though the Trial Chamber said they voluntarily went to the parish for safety, yes, voluntarily, but does someone voluntarily leave his home?  They were being killed, they were being targeted, and they went to the church where they knew they had this 31-year-old, educated, good-mannered priest who was going to provide them protection, and he had built that trust.  The Trial Chamber did not give the sufficient weight to that fact.  When they arrived there, they were denied food.  They got hunger, they got killed, they got manipulated, they got treated like they were not human beings simply because they were Tutsi. 

Mr. President, the breach of trust.  You see this, you know, small children, men and women going to the church, and when this church starts collapsing down, the feeling of betrayal running through from the father to the children, children feel betrayed by their parents who took them to a place of safety and parents feeling to have betrayed their own children and all of them having been betrayed by the person whom they trusted, that makes this offence so grave.  Genocide is of gravest offence.  The gravity of genocide, as you said in Krstic, is reflected in the requirement that the Prosecutor establish the genocidal intent, the specific intent.  

We ought not forget the reason for the establishment of this Tribunal:  To punish perpetrators of genocide.  There was one genocide committed in Rwanda.  And genocide committed by a person of authority demands nothing other than specific, as well as general, deterrence.  A 15-year sentence does not deter, does not serve the purpose of deterring for the murder of over 1,500 people by a person of authority.  We are here to prosecute people who are in a position of authority.  Seromba was a person in the position of authority, and he committed genocide.  Even if by aiding and abetting, he had the intelligence and the knowledge that his acts were criminal.  That is an aggravating fact.  The number of victims, 1,500 -- in fact, it's over 1,500 -- that cannot be reasonably sanctioned by a 15-year sentence. 

Mr. President, when you look at the Trial Chamber's way of the mitigating factors in this case, our submission is that it utterly failed in the weighing process.  What the Trial Chamber found as mitigating factors, a reasonable chamber should have found that to be aggravating factors.  For instance, the Trial Chamber said, "He is 31 years old; his chances of rehabilitation are great."  Yes, the age of an accused is a factor that is taken into consideration in sentencing.  However, the fact that the Accused was not a minor, neither was he an elder person so senile that he did not know the implications of his actions; the fact that he was 31 years old, vibrant, educated -- he had just graduated from Nyakibanda seminary, ordained a priest -- that should count as an aggravating factor in this case, not mitigation. 

Mr. President, the other matter that the Trial Chamber took into consideration was the prior good character.  Yes, prior good character is taken into account.  Before I go any further, I must mention that the Trial Chamber did not specifically indicate what weight it gave to those mitigating factors.  But our submission is this:  When you look at a 15-year sentence for genocide, for extermination, in the circumstances of this case, the only inference is that the Trial Chamber must have put so much weight on to these factors, to these mitigating factors, that we argue are aggravating factors.  So, prior good character, that is a factor that is taken into consideration in sentencing.  But in the circumstances of this case, it ought to be taken into consideration as an aggravating factor, because it is that prior good character that allowed -- that allowed the Tutsi to leave their home, to go to the place where they thought they were going to be safe.  It is that prior good character that provided the Accused an opportunity to carry out the crime that he intended.  If they knew he was some criminal or a guy with bad morals, they would have gone elsewhere.  So that ought to have been taken as an aggravating factor. 

The other issue, the matter that the Trial Chamber put so much weight into, we say -- we believe they put so much weight into it because of the 15-year sentence -- is voluntary surrender.  Yes, voluntary surrender has been taken into account in sentencing.  Voluntary surrender, we submit, in isolation, without more, should not and cannot be given so much weight.  And this is why we don't punish people who do not surrender voluntarily; that's number one.  Number two, when you look at the cases that were referred to by the Trial Chamber -- Plavsic and Babic -- in support of voluntary surrender as a consideration, there is one thing in common with those cases; that is, the accused in those cases gave substantial cooperation with the Prosecutor.  They pleaded guilty; they expressed remorse; they own up to their crimes; and they arrived as soon as they were aware of the request by the Tribunal.  Here, there is no expression of remorse; there's no cooperation with the Prosecutor; there is no guilty plea -- not that we -- the Accused doesn't have a right not -- to plead not guilty, but thereby denies the Trial Chamber an opportunity to consider that as a mitigating factor.  In this case, the Accused, as we argued even in the pre-trial brief, that the Accused knew -- knew of his criminal acts.  He was in Italy known as Sumba Bura, not as Athanase Seromba.  There was a lot of information.  He knew.  He had an interview with a newspaper at that time about the request of the Tribunal.  It's not -- only when he knew that he had no other choice, the Italian government was going to act on the request by the Tribunal, that the Accused voluntarily surrendered.  That's okay because he resisted the course of justice, but that alone should not give him the amount of reduction in sentence that we believe was given to him.  Because, when you look at the crimes he committed, the way he committed them, his level of aiding and abetting is so high, his level of aiding and abetting, that requires the punishment meted to those people who principal -- who are principal co-perpetrators. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have 10 minutes more on the schedule which we originally issued, but because we started late, I will give you another five minutes.  
MR. ORONO:
Another five minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphones, Counsel, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be 15 minutes from now on. 
MR. ORONO:
In fact, I went at a very high pace.  But let me consult with my colleagues here.  

Yes, thanks for your indulgence.  Can you hear me?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ORONO:
Oh, good.  Thanks for your indulgence, Your Honour.  I was looking at my watch and I was behind, but this is what -- before I sum up, this is what has to be clear, that our sentencing appeal is independent of the other two. 
Now, I didn't think I would have time for the conspiracy -- I was going to ask you to -- I was going to say that we are going to rely on our conspiracy submissions in our appeal brief.  Now I have the time to do that.  
JUDGE ROBINSON:
Before you move on to that, you said that the Trial Chamber attached too much weight to the voluntary surrender and this resulted in a reduction in the sentence.  Are you able to give us an idea of what you think that reduction was? 
MR. ORONO:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Thank you very much, Your Honour. 

As I indicated in my submissions, that the Trial Chamber has not specifically indicated as to how much weight it has attached to any of these mitigating circumstances.  But, when you look at the 15-year sentence for genocide and extermination, in the circumstances of this case, given the Trial Chamber's own factual findings on -- of the role of the Accused, his utterances, his behaviour, his actions at that time, we submit that it must have put so much weight to these mitigating circumstances so that it would come up with that sentence, the 15-year sentence.  That's what we submit.  
JUDGE ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
MR. ORONO:
Your Honour, conspiracy, as we understand, it is the agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful act, in this case genocide.  The actus reus of conspiracy -- and I must admit, the Appeals Chamber has not dealt with the conspiracy, to my knowledge, in other Appeals Chamber 
level -- at this level.  So what we have is the definitions of this crime by the Trial Chambers, and we rely on the Bagosora Trial Chamber decision, on motions for judgement, for acquittal, at paragraph 12, and the Musema trial judgement at paragraph 193.  

So you have an agreement between two or more people.  With the conspiracy, you don't go any further.  We have the Trial Chamber making specific findings that the Accused accepted the decision of the authorities to use the bulldozers to destroy the church.  And there was a meeting on the 16th of April.  You have Seromba and the authorities meeting, are coming to an agreement that Seromba accepts, to destroy the church.  And then you have the intent.  And as I said before, that intent can only be gleaned from the actions -- from the circumstances of the case, from the actions of the Accused, from his utterances.  So if you take the mens rea that we have submitted exists, his specific intent to commit genocide, you put that here, you have Seromba agreeing with the authorities to destroy the church, he compels -- he instructs the driver of the bulldozer to destroy the church, the action is done; the intent is there; conspiracy is met up.  

That's our position in terms of conspiracy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Schomburg wishes to ask a question. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

I could fully understand what your submission was until now, but when it comes to conspiracy, does it really suffice to only agree with something or to only accept something?  Isn't the proper definition of conspiracy that two or more people are acting on the same level together and not only accept and agree?  
MR. ORONO:
Your Honour, I agree.  And the facts show, as found by the Trial Chamber, that Seromba was with these people.  He was in meetings with them.  He was always with these people.  So whatever he was doing, they were doing together.  When these guys ordered the driver of the bulldozer to destroy the church and he refused, he asked Father Seromba, he said, "Father, should I do it?"  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
That is something different. 
MR. ORONO:
What?  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
I think this is a totally different argument.  This relates to committing.  But conspiracy, in my view, seems to be something different than committing.  
MR. ORONO:
Well -- 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
The conspiracy -- in its definition, you referred only to trial judgments, but the general notion of conspiracy demands that there is a premeditated plan to do something together and not only agreeing and not only accepting.  I ask this question on purpose in order to provoke you.  
MR. ORONO:
Yes.  The only thing that we have here is the Trial Chamber's findings, and, you know, the inference you can draw from him accepting that decision is that he was at peace.  He knew exactly what they wanted and they did it together.  Because if you look at the previous day, on the 15th of April, they had made attempts to destroy the church using gasoline, using dynamite and using grenades, and they had failed.  So his statement that, "If you have nothing else, bring these bulldozers," it means he, in his inference -- that he had sanctioned that other behaviour before, those other criminal acts, and he had been working with these people.  

That's all I can say. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you.  
MR. ORONO:
I would only say now, by reiterating, that the errors that I have for the last hour tried to point out to you are sufficient for you to reverse the decision of the Trial Chamber.  You have the power to increase the sentence.  You have it.  You did it in Vasiljevic; you did it in Gacumbitsi.  You have the power.  Once you have found that the Trial Chamber erred, you have the power to do that, and that's all we are asking you to do.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Meron will ask a question, and then that is to be followed by a question put by Judge Liu.  
JUDGE MERON:
Prosecutor, I have a question to you which relates to the issue of sentencing.  Could you explain to us -- you mentioned Ndindabahizi.  How does Seromba's participation in the crime of extermination 
compare to the crime of Ndindabahizi?  
MR. ORONO:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  I remember the last time we argued Ndindabahizi, you were not here -- you were in The Hague and I had trouble hearing you -- and today I have an opportunity to hear you in person. 

Yes, as you said in Ndindabahizi, Ndindabahizi was physically present on the ground.  He instigated attackers; he supplied weapons to people who cordoned the hill.  That's Gitwe hill.  The facts are getting out of my mind a little bit.  So he was physically present on the ground.  His acts were such that he was one with those people.  He had the intent.  Here you have Seromba on the ground.  If you look at the sketches of the photographs given in evidence here, the presbytery, the secretariat are not so far away from the church.  Seromba was there; he was standing with the authorities.  His words is what the driver of the bulldozer accepted when he went to destroy the church.  He had refused what the communal authorities had said.  These communal authorities were policemen, these communal authorities were the bourgmestre, these communal -- there was a brigade there, standing there, and these are all people who have some quasi order about them.  But he only moved to destroy the church after Seromba put something in his pocket, handed from his pocket and gave it to him, and told him, "You know what?  We Hutu are many.  We will rebuild this church."  And that's a significant point, that he was there, he was moving events, and the events happened, and that makes him a direct perpetrator.  He committed genocide, he committed extermination, because a large number of people were killed in the context of a systematic attack against the Tutsi in Rwanda.  
JUDGE MERON:
May I, Mr. President, follow this up?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, of course. 
JUDGE MERON:
Prosecutor, Ndindabahizi did things with his own hands, as it were -- if I could use that expression -- two things.  If I remember correctly, and correct me if I am mistaken, he distributed weapons and he transported attackers.  Bearing in mind these aspects, could you again, in terms of sentencing, compare that case to the personal involvement of Mr. Seromba in things that have been attributed to him of which he has been convicted?  
MR. ORONO:
Your Honour, there is no exhaustive list of acts that can constitute committing.  You have to look at the actions of the accused in the context.  Here, Seromba did not have weapons to distribute, but he had the authority to compel the driver of the bulldozer to destroy the church; he had the authority to do that.  Every -- all the authorities had requested -- they had to get his consent before they did anything.  That is only -- it's the specific circumstances of Seromba.  That put him on the ground.  He was on the ground all the time.  In fact, even when he was not there, he would write a letter to the meeting, and say, "I'm not going to be available, but I accept all the decisions that you make in that meeting."  So the circumstances of this case are such that he is involved.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Judge Liu now. 
JUDGE DAQUN:
Thank you, Mr. President.

And I think the Prosecutor reminded me of the Gacumbitsi case, and, so far as I remember, that Gacumbitsi was present at the crime scene to supervise and to direct the massacre, and the Appeals Chamber found him to play a very central role in the crimes for which he committed.  And is that your position, that this case has no substantial difference in the nature and degree of the involvement of the two accused in the different cases?  
MR. ORONO:
(Microphone not activated)
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.
MR. ORONO:
In Gacumbitsi, as stated, the facts in this case also show that Seromba was always present.  And we say he played a central role, because his words to the driver of the bulldozer, the reluctant driver of the bulldozer, he said, "Go, destroy it.  Destroy it.  We Hutus will rebuild."  That is an act that was pivotal.  

That's our submission.
JUDGE DAQUN:
Thank you, Counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Counsel.  Will that be the end of your submission?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will that be the end of the submissions for the Prosecution?  
MR. ORONO:
Yes, Your Honour, that's the end of our submissions, unless you have any further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, we will now invite counsel for the Defence to raise up.  
MR. MONTHÉ.
Thank you, Mr. President, and honourable members of the Appeals Chamber. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, when I was listening attentively to the Prosecutor as he spoke and he presented his grounds of appeal in this case, which is of interest to all of us, I noted, once again, his wish to obtain from you the increase of the sentence already handed down on Father Seromba.  To defend a priest reminds me somewhat of the episode in Jericho, where Joshua, who was in command of the Hebrews, was hearing the trumpets which wanted to bring down the walls.  I'm hearing the trumpets, but I don't see the wall crumbling. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I wish now, as is done in Rome antiques, I would like to respond, in turn, to the submissions developed by the Prosecutor.  I would like to do so, Your Honours, by bearing in mind a constant factor:  The desire of the camp opposite to obtain from you, without the submissions made being without challenge, that you issue -- that you order a maximum sentence to the prejudice -- or, to the detriment of Father Seromba, this zeal is not new.  We have known it throughout the proceedings of this case.  I seem to have the impression that, for the Prosecutor, he wants this sentence spoken by Nicci to be believed, that all priests are liars, and this is because he is speaking with authority of something which he has spoken of.  But here we are not in the area of philosophy; we are in a trial. 

Mr. President, what happened in Rwanda is very serious, and you and we agree to that.  The Prosecutor told you that the Tribunal was set up in order to prosecute, but we can also say that it was also set up in order to establish reconciliation.  I do agree that people be convicted, but I do not agree that innocent persons be convicted.  And that is the objective of our appeal.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I have hesitated a great deal when I lodged an appeal, because some people were telling us that he only had a few years; in the final analysis, it's not very long.  My reflection is that Father Seromba does not recognise any participation on his part in the alleged facts, and that is why he voluntarily surrendered.  And I will say something about that later. 

Now, with regard to the submissions made by  the adversarial party, the first ground of appeal developed by the Prosecutor is that the first judges, the Trial Chamber judges, convicted on the basis of aiding and abetting, and that this was not enough.  There was need to add the notion of planning, because Seromba, allegedly, individually committed genocide, together with others.  That is what he says -- what he has told you a few minutes ago.  And I would like to concentrate on the submissions which I have heard, but I would like to say that we went about things too fast, because one may, in fact, be disturbed in having to present arguments before your Bench.  

Before the beginning of these proceedings, a lot has been said about authority, the extraordinary and supreme authority, of Father Seromba.  But never -- and please look at the briefs submitted -- never was there any definition made about the authority that Father Athanase Seromba had -- a rural priest in Rwanda had -- in Nyange.  

And let me stop here for just a moment just to reason and to say to you that -- Gentlemen, I say with humility the following:  When the 6th of April events in Rwanda began, Seromba, who was a priest in Nyange, had already been assigned to another parish, which was known as the Crete Congo Nil parish.  So, because of the events, he was -- he couldn't leave Nyange and he could not go to the other parish where he was -- he had been assigned. 

Now, with regard to the issue of authority, Your Honours, what could be the possible authority a priest could have in a rural parish?  Does he have authority in the meaning that we understand?  In other words, the possibility to give orders and to punish persons with whom he's involved, or is it authority in terms of the forces of law and order in a commune?  Does he have municipal authority?  Does he have authority over the gendarme?  Over the whole population?  The Prosecutor doesn't specify what kind of authority he had.  And that's the first contradiction.  And I would like this matter to be responded to.  You are being told that he is a man of authority, but nobody gives us a definition of that authority.  

And it's on that kind of posturing, Your Honours, that this trial began, and that was how it was required that Father Seromba be convicted.  You are told about authority, but there is no definition of that word.  From this point of view, I would like to remind Your Honours -- and this is important, because when we look at the issue of authority without looking at the merits of the case, you are told, as a moment ago it was done, that one was making submissions on saying that in real -- in reality, the -- Father Seromba was a planner of the events in Nyange.  And I'm going to inform you that he had stopped the refugees from going to the banana plantation by giving instructions to the gendarmes for anyone who didn't listen to that order.  But no one tells you, Your Honours of the Appeals Chamber, who made those gendarmes come there.  Was it Seromba?  How could he have given them orders?  Can it be 
imagined -- in Africa, some people say that we walk on our heads, but can one really see a priest giving orders to gendarmes?  And did this happen in Rwanda?  How can one reasonably look at this?  Can any reasonable person admit that a priest has the qualities and the powers to give orders to the gendarmes?  

Now, I would like to invite you, Your Honours, to consider this matter:  How can he be accused for having given orders to soldiers?  It is also said that he refused -- that he expelled employees from the parish:  Félicien, Gasore, Patrice, and others.  And apparently this was because they were Tutsis.  But I would like the Prosecutor to tell us that; that Seromba, having from his own very will, welcomed the refugees, the Tutsi refugees at the parish -- beginning from the 6th of April, he welcomed them, he gave them shelter, he gave them food, and then suddenly, without there being any reason which could be understood by your common mortals, he expels them, and this situation is not comprehensible.  He welcomes them, he places them in the presbytery, others go to the church, and all of this is done in the first few days, and suddenly he decides that he wants to kill them.  I cannot understand that.  You were also told -- and that's another ground, the third -- that Seromba refused to say Mass for the refugees, the Tutsi refugees.  This is the first surprise that the Tribunal has told us, but at no point in time did the Trial Chamber say what could have been the incidence of the fact that Seromba refused to say Mass for the Tutsi refugees on the definition of genocide which is attributed to him.  This is not our point of view because this cannot constitute a constituent element of the crime of genocide.  And I am saying to those who believe in God and who go to Mass that it is not normal to say Mass in a church which is occupied.  And you can see this in the brief; I'm not going to repeat it.  But you will see from his brief that refugees had assaulted the Nyange church, together with the families who had brought their chickens, and the church could not any more be used as a place for saying Mass.  

So these are the facts that I'm presenting to you.  And today you are being told that Seromba organised everything; he organised meetings; he committed the crimes that he's been accused of; and he's apparently accused of having given orders.  It comes from this trial and the judgement that the attacks that were perpetrated by militiamen, by the Interahamwe, and the church was surrounded by gendarmes.  Now, the same Prosecution witnesses established that those who were attacking didn't have Seromba as their leader.  Seromba was neither the leader of the militia, nor the Interahamwe, nor was he in charge of the gendarmerie.  Consequently, he was unable to commit the crimes alleged.  

Now, if the first ground submitted by the Prosecutor -- now, I don't want to plead for the Prosecution.  We are looking at the amendment of the judgement issued by the Trial Chamber.  We wish to say that there's a lot of jurisprudence cited by the Prosecution.  I'll make mention of this in the afternoon, but I would like to say now that all of this jurisprudence has been mistakenly cited, because none of these cases, be it Gacumbitsi, be it Ndindabahizi, be it Bagosora, does not fit with the Athanase Seromba case.  There is an amalgamation and confusion of facts on the other side of the floor. 

Now, in order to establish that Seromba was a genocide planner over and above the actus reus, and that there were the material acts which have been cited -- but there has been no proof brought by the Prosecutor -- and there is also mens rea for the atrocious crime of genocide, the Prosecutor satisfied himself by saying -- and I'm not challenging him -- but that a public authority in Rwanda -- in 1994 there was a genocide; I'm not challenging this.  Your Chamber said this in the Karemera case, and this is not to be challenged, but this -- you also said that this does not remove the burden from the Prosecutor to provide proof of the charges alleged so that individual criminal responsibility can be prosecuted. 

Now, if in Rwanda and in Nyange, specifically, we were in a genocide situation, would it be so 
much so that Seromba, who was there just because he was a priest who was going to the 
Crete Congo Nil parish, was it just by his mere presence that he was going to be guilty of genocide?  

You are being told the following:  There is a manifest error on the part of the Trial Chamber.  
The Trial Chamber said the following:  The order to destroy the church was not issued by 
Athanase Seromba; the order was given by the authorities and Seromba accepted that order.  This is pure speculation on the part of the Trial Chamber; pure speculation for a simple reason. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Leslie Todd)















MR. MONTHÉ (continued):
Neither in the indictment, nor in the pre-trial brief, nor in the closing arguments, does the Prosecutor ever look at this specific submission.  

And I want to go further.  Never was ever this matter considered by the Prosecutor.  It was also -- it was always the view of the Prosecutor that Seromba had ordered and planned these events.  

Therefore, over and above what has been requested, the Trial Chamber was being -- considered to have erred in law.  And what we are saying is, how could he have issued these orders?  

Let me recall that when we were dealing with these proceedings, Seromba was in Nyange for only a maximum of six months.  So, he was not a native of the place; he did not know the authorities - and, to the extent that he could socialise with them.  So, what use would he have in having his church destroyed?  

The Trial Chamber doesn't tell us this and nor does the Prosecutor either.  I thought that when you are accusing somebody of genocide, you do so with more rigour and seriousness.  

Now, coming to the notion of direct participation -- or, in the alleged charges against Seromba, we, of the Defence, for Father Seromba, recognise one thing that is constant -- that is, he was in Nyange at the time of the events.  And I will -- and I've told you why he was there -- this is, because he couldn't go to where he had been transferred.  

Now, does the fact that because he was in Nyange at the parish at the time that the attackers had gone crazy, does this justify, or does this mean that Seromba should be accused of all the evils and all the crimes to the effect that he's the one who organised the events?  And that he expelled his staff, and that he sent out refugees, and that he asked gendarmes to kill?  All of this does not reflect the truth.  

I can't restate with you, it's -- it's far be it for me to dwell on the issues.  But, let's look at 
Witness CBN who says one thing and then the opposite.  

Now, Your Lordships, I believe that the Prosecutor would have made justice to you by recalling to this Appeals Chamber that this case -- this matter had been raised -- had been dealt with by a 
Rwandan court -- that is, what Father Seromba and the others did.  And I'd like to say that 
Father Seromba was not alone in Nyange at the time of the events.  He was not the only religious person there.  There were five of them at the time.  And amongst those five, there's one of them who is living in Europe and who has never been prosecuted.  There is another who also lives in Europe, but who was prosecuted in Rwanda.  

There is a second one -- who also is in Rwanda -- and those two priests were prosecuted in the court of first instance of Kibuye, and this was a court that was presided over by Tutsi Rwandans.  And in the court of first instance, Kibuye, those two were sentenced to death.  

They lodged an appeal.  And, in the court of appeal in Ruhengeri north, Rwanda, the appeal court of Ruhengeri rendered a judgement acquitting those two religious persons who were on the scene with Father Seromba.  And, besides, you will see the reasons, therefore, in the file -- in the case files.  

And they said that these religious persons cannot be convicted, because they had no power, no possibility of stopping what was happening at the time in Nyange -- since the civil authorities themselves and even the soldiers couldn't do that; they had been overwhelmed.  That is the truth in this case.  

Now, Seromba is being prosecuted -- and he's being prosecuted simply because he was unfortunate to have been in Nyange at the time of the events.  And besides, he wasn't in charge of the parish.  This is what -- not what you are told because he had been the -- he had never been the parish priest of Nyange parish.  And I would like to say that he never had any authority over anybody, as is being alleged.  

It is true that Rwanda is a very religious country; it's a very Catholic country.  But, at the time of the genocide, the values had disappeared and there were no longer any beacons, any reference points.  People had become crazy and started killing people.  

Now, what could Father Seromba do in -- under such circumstances?  Nothing.  

Now, you are being told that he acted with the authorities or that he acted with authority directly, 
and -- but you're not being told clearly what he did.  

Your Honour, when you said, sir, when you talked about Ndindabahizi and Gacumbitsi, Your Honour, you said that, unlike these two, Seromba never distributed weapons.  He didn't carry attackers to go and perpetrate the killings; that is -- I do agree with you.  

And besides, if you look at the situation in Nyange, you will see that most of the assailants or attackers came from Kivumu.  So, these were people that Seromba did not know; they came from outside the commune.  So, what kind of authority could he have over people that he did not know?  
Thank you.  And my apologies -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am going to repeat what I've just said for the interpretation.  
JUDGE MERON:
Counsel, I have been intrigued by your argument suggesting that Mr. Seromba, as the parish priest, had no authority or very limited authority.  My own knowledge of the situation suggests that in the rural areas, priests, historically, have a great deal of authority.  

Two specific questions:  Could the church have been destroyed without Seromba's agreement or if Seromba would have strongly opposed it?  

The second question:  Could not Seromba have allowed the refugees, who took refuge in the church, to take bananas from the adjoining plantation?  He, apparently, denied that agreement.  

I want to tell you a little story which may, or may not have some legal significance for you.  But, there was a famous Polish case resulting from the Second World War.  

Let me tell you this story.  There was a village.  There was a very small -- it was during the German occupation; it was a very small German contingent, two or three soldiers only, who did not take an active role in the extermination of the Jews there.  

There was a large Jewish population in the village, and the majority of the population, the Poles, wanted -- most of the neighbours wanted to get rid of the Jews.  Let me make it clear that many Poles stood heroically, and Polish Catholics protected Jews very heroically.  

But, in this context, the real authority in the place was the priest.  And the population asked him, can they get actively rid of the Jews?  And, apparently, in this case, the priest said yes.  

Then, they pushed -- they collected all the Jews, pushed them into a big barn, not a church, but a barn, locked the gate and set the barn on fire.  It was one of the greatest atrocities which has been tried, with great delay, many years later.  

But, again, just to draw your attention to the central role of the priest:  For good, in many cases, I'm sure -- for bad, in many cases.  

Now, I would like you to explicitly answer the questions I asked you regarding the possibility of the destruction of the church, and the possibility of the refugees eating bananas, and the role of -- of 
Father Seromba in that context?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

I am going to address your question by making a clarification.  Probably, I didn't make myself to be quite understood.  But, I said that Father Athanase Seromba was never the parish priest of Nyange parish.  He was the vicar, but was never the parish priest, because there was no parish priest at the time of the events in Nyange.  This is a clarification that I wanted to make before trying to answer your two questions.  

Your Honour, you're asking me whether the church would have been destroyed if Father Seromba hadn't allowed it to be destroyed.  I think I've understood your question perfectly.  

For starters -- well, I'll begin by setting out the principle.  When you choose to be a pastor, you'll find it difficult to understand that while you are in a church with attackers, over whom you have no authority, you are asked to destroy this church.  And Father Seromba, since I've met him, he's always been very steadfast and firm in his contention that he never authorised the destruction of his church.  

You're also asking me whether this church could have been destroyed if he had vehemently stood up against the destruction thereof.  

Your Honour, I pointed out to you a short while ago that at the presbytery of the Nyange church and parish, there were many clergymen.  There were many who were there because they had had a seminar with the bishop in Nyundo.  

But, there are two of them who came and gave testimony here -- that is, PA1 and NA1, and I'll refer you to their testimonies.  There were thousands of attackers outside.  Seromba did all he could.  
He requested that the bourgmestre send forces of law and order to the parish, and that is why some gendarmes came, but they didn't do their work.  

He asked the attackers to stop.  He asked the attackers to stop brutalizing and causing harm to the refugees that were at the parish.  But, he -- his requests were never heeded.  On the contrary, they did something else, and, I think, there is Witness FE23 -- who came and said that he even risked his own safety.  

So, Your Honours, these are the answers that I have for your two initial questions.  I was moved by your anecdote concerning this small Polish village.  I know that the fine line between good and evil is very thin indeed.  

You -- you may wake up one day and say that you're going to rob a bank, but you don't do that.  But then, you are only liable to punishment if either you actually carried out the intention -- that is, by robbing the bank.  

It is certain that a certain priest and many priests in Poland protected Jews, just as was the case in Rwanda, where many priests protected Tutsis, and this wasn't anything new.  

And insofar as the instant case is concerned, we are submitting that, following the way events unfolded, and the allegations that were given to the lower court judges, there was nothing that was said to prove that Seromba did anything that would harm the lives or the bodies of the refugees.  

Now, if you'll allow me, Your Honours, I'll address the question concerning Seromba's refusal that the refugees go and have bananas.  I'll tell you what I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...first point, because Judge Schomburg would like to present to you a question.
MR. MONTHÉ:
Mr. President, I hadn't addressed the issue of the banana plantation.  May I answer the question that concerned the banana plantation, Mr. President? 

Thank you.  

I would like to conclude very briefly on the issue of the banana plantation by telling the 
Appeals Chamber that, with the Trial Chamber, we went down to visit the scene in Nyange -- and my learned friend, Bihegue, was present and, I think, Mr. Constant was also present.  

And when we look at the configuration of the scene, the banana plantation, in question, is found behind the presbytery.  And that you'll see on the sketch that if Father Seromba was in the presbytery, there was no way that he could see refugees going to the banana plantation.  

So, this issue of his refusing refugees from going to the banana plantation has always been something that I haven't been able to understand in these proceedings.  

This would be my answer, and I would like to say, as he himself has said, that he never issued such orders to the gendarmes.  So, this is my answer to that issue, and I'm awaiting the question that 
Judge Schomburg will wish to put to me.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor.  

Two questions:  You said he was not -- Mr. Seromba was not the priest, but only the vicar.  But isn't it true that in church, the vicar, when there is no priest, fills in fully the post of the priest, and has all the powers of the priest, who is not present?  

And my second question is:  Do you -- and if so, how do you challenge the findings at paragraph 239, often quoted already today, that Mr. Seromba approved the decision to destroy the church by saying, "If you have no other means of doing it, bring these bulldozers and destroy the church"?  And secondly, the advice that Seromba gave to the drivers concerning the fragile side of the church?  

This would be a separate question to the question of authority.  This is only the question of committing a crime independently from the authority.  Thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Your Honour.  And I'd like to answer your very pertinent question clearly.  And your first question concerns the power of the vicar in the absence of -- or where there is no parish priest.  

I think it is the provisions of the canon law that deal with the matter, but common sense would require that the -- far and beyond the common -- the canon law, the parish priest has attributions -- some privileges that do not devolve upon the vicar.  

Now, this cannot be contested, but what is clear, that in such -- in -- in that case, there was a priest that was in Nyange, wasn't -- was Father Seromba.  This has never been challenged, and this cannot be seriously challenged.  

Now, that said, what were the powers of that priest -- Seromba?  What were his powers -- of 
Father Seromba in that Nyange parish at the time of the events?  

I have told you that since he had the capacity to do so, he welcomed refugees at the beginning of the events.  And I'd like to add, and as I said earlier on, that he was not the only priest at the time of the events, because there were five of them.  Some joined him at the parish, and he did all that he 
could -- that is, he welcomed them, provided them with shelter and food that was available in the parish at the time -- at the time of the events, that is.  
Consequently, from that perspective, Your Honours, he acted like somebody who was in the parish and who had certain prerogatives.  But, the prerogatives of a vicar, now, do they go -- do they extend beyond the parish?  

Now, this is the question that is of interest to our case.  When you say that he gave orders to gendarmes to shoot, and that he stopped people from going into the banana plantation, now, are those still prerogatives that -- that devolve upon the vicar or the vicar?  

Now, the vicar replaces the parish priest in the absence of the parish priest -- and we know what his powers are.  We know that he takes care of the parish.  He says Mass and he carries out certain pastoral duties.  That's it. 

Now, Your Honours, I would like to move on to your second question that has to do with paragraph 339 of the impugned judgement -- that's paragraph 239 of the impugned judgement.  

Now, you see that Father Seromba gave the order to destroy -- that he accepted that -- or, he agreed with the order for the church to be destroyed.  

Now, this is the key issue of this trial.  I told you a short while ago that the proposition recorded by the Trial Chamber to the effect that Seromba had accepted the order to destroy the church is a new proposition that was never substantiated by the Prosecutor throughout the proceedings.  

Besides, Witness CDL -- Prosecution Witness CDL never said that it was Seromba who gave the order for the church to be destroyed.  The bulldozers -- the bulldozer that was used to destroy the Nyange church -- well, he's not the one who caused it to be brought to the scene; it was Rushema who asked for the bulldozer to be brought.  

And what is more, the bulldozer driver, the one who destroyed the church, who gave testimony before this Tribunal -- and whom I examined, and that the Prosecution cross-examined, and then we re-examined -- said, in clear terms, after four days of giving testimony, that he never received any order from Seromba to destroy the Nyange church.  And I'm saying this under the control of your Court, and I'm relying on the transcript of the Trial Chamber.  

Now, you asked me another question concerning the fact that Father Seromba might -- was the one who allegedly pointed out which part of the church was the weakest and pointed -- and showed it to the bulldozer driver.  

Now, if the driver himself came and said that Seromba never gave me the order to destroy the church, this means that this second issue is no longer of any interest.  But in any case, I'll try to address it.  

I'm rather taken aback by such a grotesque issue, because how could -- how could Seromba have pointed out the weakest part of the church, when he wasn't there when the church was being built?  

He is neither an architect -- and I'll repeat:  He did not have any intrinsic or professional capacity that would enable him to say that, "Now, if you look at -- if you try to attack this building from this end, you'll more easily destroy it."  And you should say that -- that we should point out that, at the time, the church was built 50 years before the time -- Seromba was not even born yet.  

So, there has been speculation here, where it is alleged that he showed which was the weakest part of the church to the bulldozer driver -- all of this is not realistic.  

This, Your Honours, is what I wish to give as an answer and, I hope, that I have addressed your questions.  

In the absence of any other question, I will try to deal with another ground of appeal that was recorded by the Prosecutor. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
JUDGE DAQUN:
Well, I don't know whether you are going to deal with this question or not later on, but I have a question concerning the status as a priest.  

The issues -- in the submissions of the Prosecution, the Prosecution claimed that the Trial Chamber should have given sufficient weight to Mr. Seromba's position as a priest, and his abuse of the trust and the position -- and there was your response to this issue.  And would you please be kind enough to substantiate your position on this issue? 

You may do it later on or you may do it now -- if you were going to deal with this issue later on.  
Thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Your Lordship.  Since you've put that question to me now, I will not be very at ease if I don't answer it.  

Now, the question you are raising is a very important one.  
I recall a short while ago -- because in order to understand this case and Father Seromba's position, you need to know how Rwanda operated at the time.  

I told you a short while ago that Rwanda is a very Christian country.  About 80 to 85 per cent of the population is Christian.  Consequently, it is true that in time of peace and throughout their history, the church had a very respectable and respected status in that country.  And so priests in Rwanda were people who, insofar as the population was concerned, enjoyed lots of esteem.  

This cannot be challenged, but what the Prosecution doesn't tell you is that with effect from the 
6th of April, the values changed -- the references changed.  

Now, you've just heard about the exactions in Croatia and Bosnia.  And you know that the references are no longer respected during times of crisis.  The Judge gave the example of that church in Poland.  That is it.  What could Seromba do in the situation of a very serious crisis, where the authorities had given up?  Where gendarmes were no longer obeying orders?  Where the army had disappeared?  Where neighbours were killing each other when they were no longer friends?  

What could Father Seromba do in spite of his status as a priest?  That is the question that we continue to -- to -- to ask.  Now, is Seromba going to prosecute -- to be prosecuted simply because he was a priest?  This is the question.  

So, Your Honours, in addressing your question, I have in mind this -- this statement by Stalin:  How many divisions did the Vatican have?  And, in order to copy from him, I would say, how many divisions did Seromba have?  He was in Nyange alone.  Did he have an army?  Did he have a minister?  Did he have any militiamen?  He had nothing.  

He did all that was practicable by trying to welcome the refugees, by sheltering them in the parish, and by feeding them to the best of his ability.  And, I think, that in -- under the circumstances, he performed his duty.  

He could not be anywhere else than there because he couldn't go anywhere else at the time.  If he had been able to go elsewhere, he would never have been found in Nyange on that 6th of April.  

I believe, Your Honour, that I have addressed your question.  If you have any others to put to me, I am prepared to answer them.  Otherwise, I will deal with other grounds of appeal of the Prosecutor in substantiating his -- the issue of getting food.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I am the one to thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Robinson wants to ask a question. 
JUDGE ROBINSON:
At the beginning of your submission, you said that the statute speaks not only of punishment, but also reconciliation.  

It wasn't clear to me whether you were suggesting that reconciliation was a -- a proper factor of which account could be taken in sentencing.  Would you clarify that? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Your Honour.  

In responding to the premise by the Prosecutor, who quoted the statute, he said that genocide -- crimes of genocide should be heavily punished; this is irrefutable.  And I added that in so doing, he would, indeed, have to be convicted as such.  

And I said that in the statute, as you said, we were seeking reconciliation between Rwandans.  And to my mind, reconciliation between Rwandans presupposes that justice is done; that is to say that decisions rendered should be just, fair.  They should not be decisions that are full of inconsistencies and constantly erring in fact and law, because to my mind, the charges against Father Athanase Seromba have never been proved in an irrefutable, unimputable manner on the part of the Prosecution.  That is our viewpoint; this is what we have said, and this is why I speak of reconciliation.  Because how can we say that we feel concerned -- that we feel that justice is done, if we feel that, however, they are condemning innocents -- innocent people?  

It is the nation -- the United Nations that has established the statute and, I believe, from this point of view, they are right in so doing.  

Now, in responding to your question, Your Honour, I would like to talk about the sentence.  

The question raised by the Prosecutor -- he covered these two issues before talking about conspiracy.  Now, without -- if we -- if we don't see any objection, I would like to talk about the issue of sentencing and also that of conspiracy.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître, there's a little question which is perplexing me.  I gather that it is an essential part of 
Mr. Seromba's case that an order to commit genocide was issued by some other authority.  

Now, what occurs to my mind -- and here, I would be grateful to be enlightened by you -- is this:  If an order is, indeed, issued by another authority, is it possible that Mr. Seromba can legitimate the order,  can he issue the order on his own authority, and effectively convey the instructions to his following to commit genocide? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to reply to your question by beginning from the end.  And by saying, Mr. President, that to my knowledge, Father Seromba did not have any subordinates as such, because as the Prosecutor said at an earlier stage, he talked about the definition of responsibility under 6(3) and 6(1) of the statute -- and, I believe, that responsibility is sought on an individual basis for Father Seromba.  

So, he was the priest; he was on his way out of Nyange, and he did not have anybody else, apart from the staff of the parish to who we referred to before -- beforehand, and I do not believe that those people who were domestics, as such, were involved.  

Now, as concerns the order given, this is the central question or the pivotal question of this case.  
Your Honours, you will have noted that there is nowhere within the proceedings and nowhere has the Prosecutor been able to show irrefutable proof that order was given -- that an order was given.  And, if so, who gave that order?  

It was said that authorities gave the order, and that Seromba transmitted it.  Well, this does not actually figure in the pre-trial -- the brief, the -- the appeal brief or in his closing arguments, indeed.  

Now, what power exactly did Seromba have?  He was in the presbytery.  Now, what power did he have to legitimize an order that had had been given by the "authorities", in inverted commas?  

Now, Seromba, as I said earlier, and this was noted in the judgement by the court of first instance, he had no right over the assailants.  They were Interahamwe; they were militiamen; they were gendarmes.  And what is more, they came from neighbouring communes to which Seromba was a stranger.  

So, this idea that an order was accepted -- well, this is contradicted by the reality of the facts, by the testimony given here by the Prosecution, and by the testimony for which the credibility does not seem to be challenged -- for the person who he, himself, demolished the church, Anastase Nkinamubanzi, who appeared before this Trial Chamber.  

Now, I would like, Mr. President -- I do not know whether I have provided a complete response.  I would like now to respond to the Prosecutor on two grounds of appeal that he notified us of.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Schomburg would like to ask a question. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
A very short follow-up question in order to be certain -- that I can make up my mind.  

Of course, we have to find out whether your challenge to the finding at paragraph 239 is true, in that the bulldozer driver has never said this.  But, if so, only to be on the safe side -- for you, if it would be, how would you qualify the role, then, of a person endorsing the order of another person?  And even, in addition, facilitating the commission of the crime by giving a hint to (inaudible)...the church's most vulnerable.  Would you call it a kind of a consecutive perpetrator or a joinder to those authorities having acted as perpetrators?  Unfortunately, not defined in the judgement -- I agree with you.  

What would be your legal qualification of such an act? 
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Your Honour.  

I would, firstly, in line with your question -- in view of the fact that we are before a criminal tribunal, I would like us to, once again, bring back the definition of the word "perpetrator".  

Was he a perpetrator or a co-perpetrator?  A perpetrator of a crime -- is he or the people who have a purpose or common purpose of creating or committing a crime?  They might not come up with the result if they do not have the requisite intent to do so.  

However, we are here before a hypothesis that for the Prosecution they are required to define a specific or requisite intent.  This mens rea, which is the elaboration of a genocidal plan or intent -- we're talking here about an order and we were saying that this was endorsed by Father Seromba.  

We do not say how it was endorsed, and at an earlier stage I heard the Prosecutor say to you that Seromba talked to the bulldozer driver on three occasions saying, "Destroy, destroy, destroy.  The Hutus are numerous and we will construct another church."  And that then he was allegedly seen to give something from his pocket to the driver.  

Now, I would not like to repeat myself, but I would like to clearly point out that the driver came here to testify, and he challenged the fact that he refused the -- that he received the order from 
Father Seromba.  

Now, in responding to your question:  Did Father Seromba, in fact, receive an order?  Seromba said, 
"I never received such an order, and whatever the case may be, I do not see why I would have wanted to destroy my church, and the order was not given to me in any case."  And this was confirmed by PA1, a witness who was in the presbytery with Seromba; and also NA1 and many other witnesses.  

Now, I hope I have provided you with a complete response on this question, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître, Judge Meron wants to ask a question. 
JUDGE MERON:
Defence, I have a real continuing problem with the question we are now discussing.  Looking at the trial judgement, I would like to draw your attention to three paragraphs in the trial judgement.  

The first is paragraph 268.  

"The Chamber finds that the Prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Seromba was informed by the authorities of their decision to destroy the church and that he accepted that decision." 

That was 268.  

Now, 334:  

"The Chamber finds that Seromba held discussions with the communal authorities and accepted their decision to destroy the church.  The Chamber also concludes that Seromba spoke with the bulldozer driver, and said certain words to him, which encouraged him to destroy the church."  

He finds -- "The Chamber finds that Seromba gave even advice to the bulldozer driver."

And, finally, paragraph 364, where these facts are repeated by the Trial Chamber, with the conclusion that Seromba substantially contributed to the destruction of the church, and you asked about the type of offence that this would involve -- and, of course, the trial judgement speaks of aiding and abetting the crime of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity.  

To give us the impression that the vicar in charge of a church had absolutely no authority to protect that church from destruction, is something -- which is really asking us to believe something which is quite difficult to accept.  Thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Your Honour, you put three questions to me that I shall make sure that I respond to.  

Now, relying upon the judgement itself, and also providing you with my opinion -- now, the first of your questions on the interpretation of the first judge saying that the order was given by the authorities and that Father Seromba accepted this order.  

Now, I think that I have come back to this question on a number of occasions, and the question I asked myself is where the Trial Chamber went to find this argument or submission, because it was never submitted by either of the adversarial parties.  It is an entirely new proposition.  And if you look at the proceedings, you will see that the Prosecutor never said the order was given by the -- by the communal authorities and accepted or endorsed by Seromba.  It was, in fact, said that Seromba was the instigator of all the facts that took place in Nyange, because he was the supreme authority.  

Now, the Chamber did not find on this because it said that the authorities gave an order and that Seromba endorsed it.  

Now, Seromba allegedly talked to the communal authorities.  Firstly, I would like to point out that never did the Prosecutor show in a formal manner which meetings Seromba took part in.  At an earlier stage, it was said that Seromba sent a letter to the commune saying that any conclusions that would be drawn from meetings would be acceptable to him.  However, he did not say which conclusions were drawn from the said meetings.  

Now, if we called what was said into question, we should admit that when the refugees were welcomed to the parish, Seromba then would have known that he was going to exterminate them, and the Prosecutor would then bear the burden of this proof.  

Now, he said that the refugees -- the refugees came to the church of their own volition.  Now, for this proposal to be concrete and in conformity with your proposition, then, Seromba would have known or would have had to have known that he was going to exterminate them before they came, and that he had already planned extermination.  

However, how could he have done this?  He did not invite them to the church; they came of their own volition.  He did not go and get the bulldozer; he was not the one who destroyed the church.  And I say that in this instant case, the judgement was rendered by inflicting upon Father Seromba the responsibility that has not been substantiated by reasonable proof.  

Now, the bulldozer driver allegedly was taken in by Seromba, and was even given a present.  And I would repeat that I was not in Nyange at the time of the events, and neither were you.  What can we do?  All we can do is examine precisely what was said and what was written in the documents.  

Now, the bulldozer driver, whom we examined here for four days, told us that he had never received the order from Father Seromba to destroy the church.  He said that Kayishema and Rushema were the ones who gave him the order; that's what he said.  

And as a result, if we are, indeed, seeking somebody who is responsible for what happened in 
Nyange -- well, because it's a logical course to follow, saying that genocide was, in fact, the result of what the authorities decided.  So the only person who was a figure of authority at that time in that place, then, of course, Seromba is going to become the scapegoat.  And this proposal does not convince me.  And I say this with great humility, but with great conviction, because I believe that you, like myself, are here with a view to finding the truth.  

Mr. President, if I, for one reason, thought that Father Seromba was guilty, I wouldn't be able to go home and find sleep; however, if I was not convinced of this, well, it would be a different situation altogether, and I will say this, with gravity, with sincerity because I believe that the Prosecutor's case does not deserve the conviction of Father Seromba.  

Now, on the question of sentencing, because I would like to address this issue -- of course, I will talk about it this afternoon, but I would like to respond to what the Prosecutor said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I take it that you have completed your answer to Judge Meron's question.  While we have already exceeded the time allotted to you, but recognising that the Judges did ask you questions, I will give you two or three minutes more to conclude.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Mr. President -- I am much obliged, Mr. President, and I will not go over the three minutes.  I will have enough time here to conclude.  

Mr. President, I would like to say how I was amazed by the submission made by the Prosecution on the question of sentencing.  And now throughout these proceedings, we have noted that Father Seromba is certainly somebody that they do not have much patience for.  

Now, the mitigating circumstances that they referred to have become aggravating circumstances, they say, such as, his age, his good conduct, the work that he accomplished and even up to his voluntary rendition.  

Now, I would like to talk about this question of voluntary rendition or surrender with a view to say that we should be a little bit more serious when we raise such issues or submissions.  

Now, if you look at this closely, you will see that Father Seromba left Rwanda right in the middle of the crisis in a war situation, and it was a situation where everyone was fleeing as best they could.  

Now, he didn't have any passport to his name.  And he, like many Rwandans, took refuge in a camp in Zaire.  Now, in order to leave Zaire, because they were dislodged from there by the RPF, he had to then take a passport with an assumed name.  And, as we saw, throughout the Second World War, the resistance -- the members of the resistance also had assumed names.  

Now, he went to Italy where he there took on the post of a clergyman or a priest, and under his own initiative he came -- he requested to come to Arusha, and he sent a letter to the Registrar.  

He did not receive a response to this letter; he sent a second letter.  Then, he approached the Italian authorities to request that they organise for him to go to Arusha for him to be prosecuted and tried in view to retrieving his honour.  

Now, when he heard that an international warrant of arrest had been issued in his name, he left -- he was found in Italy, and then he left Italy.  And I would like to say that the Prosecutor did issue a number of different warrants of arrest, and there were many fugitives who were out -- at large, and I wonder why they do not surrender themselves of their own volition?  He came here under his own steam.  I don't think that this is very reasonable, and I thank you very much, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, indeed, Maître.  We will now pause for about 20 minutes and return here to hear the reply. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now have a pause of about 20 minutes, and then we shall return to hear the reply of the Prosecution. 
(Court recessed from 1129H to 1145H)  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. ORONO:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  

This is our reply.  And in commencing our reply, I would like to deal with the issue that was raised by the appellant in response to Judge Liu's question -- that is, the status of Father Athanase Seromba at Nyange parish during the events of April 1994.  

Counsel is very correct when he said that Seromba did what was practicable, practicable under the circumstances -- under the circumstances in the context of genocide and extermination happening in Rwanda.  With the intent of the Accused to commit these offences, the best that he could do was to subject the Tutsi refugees to conditions of living that led to their death:  To deprive them of food and to order the driver of a bulldozer to destroy the church.  He was not under duress at any point; he did this with his own volition.  

Look at paragraph 382.  The Trial Chamber said it considered that the Accused did not act under duress when he approved that the church be destroyed using the bulldozer.  

Whatever actions he was doing, these are the findings of the Trial Chamber:  He was acting 
under -- voluntarily.  The witnesses -- Witness CDL -- say that before they did anything, they had to contact Father Seromba.  He gave orders.  And, in response to the question by Judge Shahabuddeen as well as Judge Schomburg -- the question in relation to the issue of ordering:  Yes, the authorities gave an order to the driver of the bulldozer to destroy the church.  

But he did not comply.  It's only after the exchange, which is reflected at paragraph 213 of the judgement -- please, Your Honours, if you can look at paragraph 213 of the judgement.  Look at that exchange; that the Witness CDK, a witness -- a credible witness who was on the ground, given his special relationship with Seromba and his duties at that time, he was only a few metres away when this was said.  

In fact, in his testimony, which the Trial Chamber accepted, when they started destroying the church, he was afraid, and the Accused told him not to worry.  It was only -- the attack was only aimed at the Tutsi.  

Now, let's look at the exchange -- that's the testimony of this witness when he says, "Father Seromba told me to say" -- he -- he -- the driver who came to destroy the church, I'm looking at the -- the third quotation.  The driver who came to destroy the church, asked him on three occasions, three times, if they should destroy the church now?  He said, "Destroy it."

That statement -- that paragraph can be -- that excerpt can be looked at in different ways.  But the only inference is that it was an order.  Because it was an order to destroy a church full of refugees -- 1,500.  It was not a request to commit a petty offence.  This was something huge to the effect that the driver himself could not believe his ears that he was being told to destroy the church.  Unless it was with some compulsion, especially given that you had these other authorities around -- around Seromba, with Seromba, authority figures.  

Seromba did not only have his authority as the priest of the church, but he had his secular authority -- the moral authority.  He's seen as -- you know, his level in society is -- is high.  He is telling this guy to destroy a church where he has the most interest in.  It can't be anything else other than an order.  Those are our submissions regarding that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Schomburg wishes to put a question. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

I also want to put the same question to you as I did the Defence.  

From your point of view, how best to categorize, if -- if true, because it's contested that there 
was -- there was this testimony by the bulldozer driver.  But if true, what would be your categorization?  Would it be parallel perpetratorship?  Because he was not part of those authorities having apparently ordered this or a kind of consecutive perpetratorship?  Thank you.  
MR. ORONO:
Your Honour, let's, first of all, deal with the issue of the driver of the bulldozer.  

The respondent keeps bringing this driver of the bulldozer.  The findings of the Trial Chamber, is that he was not credible because he kept going back and forth, back and forth.  He was found not credible by the Trial Chamber.  

What can be helpful here, if we were to consider him at all, look at the statement that he provided in 1995 --  that's a few months after the genocide, in which he says that it was Seromba.  It was the respondent who -- who ordered him to do that.  But we have left that because the Trial Chamber found this guy not credible.  So we even don't want to waste time with that guy.  He was found not credible because of the way he was telling.  

Now, let's move on to how to characterise that.  Our position is, given his presence on the ground, given that the order was issued by the authorities who, we submit, were at peace with 
Seromba -- because Seromba at that time was an attacker too.  But this guy did not obey the authorities of the -- did not obey the order of the authorities.  And he looked to someone whom he knew is an authority over the church, the person with a vested interest in the church, and that's Seromba.  The guy who had been acting with authority as the priest in charge of Nyange parish, making specific decisions, and that is the guy, that's the fellow, that's the Accused, Seromba.  He's the one who made the order.  

Now, in terms of characterizing as a parallel, I think that's a determination you have to make, because we say he ordered.  It's for you to determine -- you -- I've given you the paragraphs, 213, that exchange, look at it.  But remember our submission is that Seromba personally ordered, given those facts there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Liu. 
JUDGE DAQUN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. Prosecutor, I'd be very grateful if you could enlighten me by your interpretation and your understanding of the participation by ordering.  

It seems to me you allege there are those errors of law and errors of facts in the findings of the 
Trial Chamber's judgement, concerning this word "ordering".  As for the error of law, it seems to me that you claim that the Trial Chamber confused the requirement of the Article 6(1) and Article 6(3), which requires the effective control of the subordinate.  

As for the error of facts, I want to know -- there must be, at least, a distinguishing between the ordering of the genocide itself and the ordering of particular acts.  For instance, the -- the bulldozing of the church itself.  Am I on the right understanding of your position? 
MR. ORONO:
Mr. President, Your Honour, when you look at the acts of the Accused throughout the period, he made specific orders.  He ordered -- he ordered the gendarmes to shoot at the refugees.  He expelled Patrice and others from the church.  And when Patrice attempted to come back, he ordered, once -- once Patrice had refused to leave, he ordered the gendarmes to chase him away, and later, killed.  

Those are specific acts of the Accused that show his intent and his ability -- his intent for genocide because he was -- he was -- Patrice was a Tutsi.  And when you come to the major event of the 
16th April, that action of his that I've asked you to categorize, we -- we say that was an order, because he was in a position of authority.  

And very high, indeed, because this guy refused -- the driver of the bulldozer had refused the order given by the authorities but he accepted, because it was only when Seromba told him, "You know what, destroy it.  We, the Hutu, are many.  We'll rebuild it."  That's when he did it; that's when he destroyed the church.  

And he followed Father by direct (sic) him -- directing or instructing.  That is an element of ordering -- telling him that, "Start from here, from this side."  And that goes to intent.  

Whether he's not an architect or anything, the fact that he pointed to a specific part, doesn't -- don't -- it's not -- we know he's a reverend.  He's -- he's a priest.  We -- we have no information whether he's done archeology or architecture, but he pointed at a specific part of the church; that's important.  Why he did that, let him tell us.  

I hope I've answered your question.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
How about the error of law you claimed?  
MR. ORONO:
The error of law -- 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
I mean, the differences between the ordering in the Article 6(1) and the commander's responsibility in the Article 6(3)?
MR. ORONO:
Your Honour, Article 6(1) requires just having the element of authority.  You don't have to be able to prevent or to punish.  Just that's what you said in the decision in Semanza.  You just simply have to 
be -- have that authority, which he had, to compel someone, which he did; that's all you need for 
actus reus.  That's the difference.  Under 6(3), we're not touching it.  We're not accusing him of being a commander.  He's -- he's a priest.  

You know, whether he had the ability to punish or whatever, that's not an issue here.  Our issue here is that he had the authority to compel, and he was perceived as someone in authority, just by stature being a priest and by his actions, which he showed that he kept -- he ordered, he made several orders.  That's all you need to prove.  

So the Trial Chamber erred when it -- it requested us to prove that he had control and he could punish.  No.  He doesn't have to punish anyone.  Under 6(1), that's my understanding of 6(1), and that's consistent with what you -- the Appeals Chamber says in Semanza and Gacumbitsi. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you very much.  I believe that your answer to my question -- my question is mainly related on the paragraph 305 of the judgement of the Trial Chamber.  I believe you have answered my question.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Judge Robinson. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone.  
JUDGE ROBINSON:
Your submissions, if I understand them, are as follows:  An order was given by the authorities to the driver of the truck -- of the bulldozer to bulldoze the church.  That order, you say, was not accepted by the driver of the bulldozer.  Instead, the driver of the bulldozer sought -- sought an instruction and did, in fact, receive an instruction from Mr. Seromba.  And, therefore, you characterise that as an order from Mr. Seromba, which is totally independent of the first order that came from the authorities?  
(Pages 19 to 39 by Jean Baigent)





















1200H 
MR. ORONO: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  I must admit it goes two ways.  There's a relationship between a first order given to the authorities, with the order given by Seromba, because the intent was, one, the objective was one that is to destroy the church, that is how related they are.  And, secondly, they are related because it was all coming from two people of authority.  Only that.  

The driver of the bulldozer seems to perceive, and he was not wrong to perceive, Seromba as the priest in charge, the person who had more authority, because they're not asking him to bulldoze the communal office, no.  They are asking him to bulldoze the church.  And who is in charge of the church?  It's Seromba.  So, Seromba's order becomes the counting one.  Whether he paraphrased the words that the authorities said or not, but they all had one objective.  And it is after Seromba had told him -- put some hand in the pocket, gave him something, and told him, "We, the Tutsi (sic) are many.  We'll build another one."  That's when he did it.  So that's our position.  
JUDGE ROBINSON: 
And you say that whatever authority may be required as a matter of law in your -- in your submission, Seromba had sufficient authority to give that order. 
MR. ORONO: 
Indeed he did.  He had been giving orders before.  He was the priest in charge.  He was viewed as the person of authority, he acted so.  And pursuant to 6(1), he will really need to have the authority to be perceived as someone of authority and be able to compel someone, and that's exactly what Seromba did, and he fits squarely into Article 6(1).  We are not talking about 6(3).  It's not effective control.
JUDGE ROBINSON: 
And on that basis, you say he should have been convicted of committing -- 
MR. ORONO: 
Crime of committing and for ordering. 
JUDGE ROBINSON: 
And not just aiding and abetting.  
MR. ORONO:
Not just aiding and abetting.  There are elements there.  He knew the -- he knew the intention.  He knew the intent of the perpetrators.  But we're not denying that, that there are those elements, but to fully capture his culpability, because the Trial Chamber and you all have a duty to consider the implications of evidence and arrive at a judgement to succeed in justice, like my colleague has said, that here will come the justice, you have to fully capture the conduct of the Accused and to sentence him accordingly.  

And that brings me to the question of rehabilitation.  Yes, one of the requirements here is rehabilitation.  But, Your Honours, rehabilitation is not a one-way process.  It is a two-way process.  The Accused has to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, before you proceed, I wish to draw your attention to the clock and say to you that we are aiming to finish by 15 minutes past the hour.  

But I have a question to ask you.  I hope you will oblige.  It is this.  Judge Robinson has quite rightly moved you away from the concept of ordering to the concept of committing.  Now, what I want to know from you is this:  Assuming that there was an order issued by some other authorities, and assume that a person -- an assailant was executing the order, does that prevent the assailant from being regarded as also committing genocide?  

If I may repeat it:  Does the fact that an assailant in genocide is executing an order given by another authority prevent that assailant from being regarded as also committing the crime in question?  
MR. ORONO: 
Thank you very much for that question.  

Now, I must point out that we still stand in our submissions for committing.  But as regards to the order by somebody, and whether the person on the ground who perpetrates the offence should or should not be convicted for committing, this is my answer:  One, you have to look at the intent of that person, whether that person who was ordered to -- to -- who was ordered had the intent himself as well.  That's important.  

Secondly, how far away, how far removed is the person giving the order from the person who is being ordered?  Because if the person who is ordering is in close proximity with the person who he's ordering, then he has committed, and the other perpetrator, as well, has committed, if we find that he has got the intent, because he has committed the offence himself that he has ordered.  Those are my submissions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed with your arguments.  
MR. ORONO: 
I was talking -- I was making submissions in relation to rehabilitation, because one of the objectives of the Tribunal is to bring about reconciliation in Rwanda.  But you cannot bring about reconciliation if the crime does not fit -- the -- the sentence does not fit the crime.  There will be no reconciliation.  The sentence has to fit the crime for there to be reconciliation.  

In terms of rehab -- reconciliation, the people who are accused, we expect them to go back to Rwanda.  And when they go back, for the process of reconciliation to happen, there has to have been acceptance of responsibility for the acts.  There has to have been expression of remorse, especially where the accused has been convicted of the offence.  But when those thoughts are not there, how can there be rehabilitation -- reconciliation, when the victims feel that there's no -- has been no justice?  You will be encouraging a state of lawlessness where people are taking the law in his hands, because there's been no justice.  So there has to be a sentence that fits the crime. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Liu wants to ask you a question.  
JUDGE DAQUN: 
Now, speaking of the rehabilitation, I would like to draw your attention to the paragraph 399 of the judgement in which the Chamber, seemed to me, connected the age of the Accused and the possibility of his rehabilitation.  What's your comments on that?  
MR. ORONO: 
My comment is this:  31 years old, convicted of genocide, convicted of extermination, does not accept responsibility, does not express remorse, those are not signs of someone who is going to be rehabilitated.  

For rehabilitation to occur, you have to own to your -- to your crime.  This does not exist here.  There's no evidence at all that the Accused will have a chance of rehabilitation.  In fact, the Accused's previous actions of fleeing, fleeing Rwanda in an assumed name shows a person who repeatedly -- 
JUDGE DAQUN: 
Well, I quite understand your position.  You don't have to repeat it.  My question is that, you know, whether the factor of age has anything to do with the possibility of the rehabilitation as stated in paragraph 399 of the judgement.  What's your position on that?  
MR. ORONO: 
Your Honour, for a -- for a petty crime, yes.  We don't hope that there's going to be another genocide, so he's rehabilitated from -- from it that he won't do it again.  For a minor offence, yes, but for this offence?  When the Accused has not shown any, any signs of owning to his, it's not possible.  If it is, if at all, a mitigating circumstance, it has very little weight, because there are so many accused who are young.  But when they commit heinous crimes like this in these circumstances, rehabilitation should be something to be looked at, but not be given any weight.  Or if any weight is given at all, it must be minimal.  
JUDGE DAQUN: 
Well, I don't think you understand my question, but I am not going to utter further questions on that.  Yes.  
MR. ORONO: 
You know why I don't understand your question, Your Honour?  Because -- is it because he's young that he couldn't understand what he was doing?  Is it because -- what's important here is the criminal act, what he has done.  I think that's something we should not forget.  What he has done is -- is huge.  It's horrific.  The age, there are a lot of people who were -- who make offences, but this is genocide we're talking about here.  That has got to be a significant factor to be considered to our submissions is (inaudible). 
JUDGE DAQUN: 
Thank you very much.  I understand that your position is the age has little to do with the rehabilitation.  
MR. ORONO: 
You know, someone of an age of majority, Your Honour, yes, but as I told you, there are certain elements that have to be taken into account as well, not just the age.  
JUDGE DAQUN: 
Thank you very much.  I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  You have two minutes more to close your address and then we will break for lunch, and when we come back at 2:00, we will hear Mr. Seromba's appeal.  
MR. ORONO: 
Your Honour, to the best of our ability, we have advanced our case and responded to the questions and the issues raised by the Appellant, and we still firmly believe that the Trial Chamber's errors of fact and law justify your intervention and convict the Accused, find him culpable, capture his responsibility as best as the evidence showed as found by the Trial Chamber, and convict him accordingly.  And we submit sentence appropriate in these circumstances is that of life imprisonment, given the gravity of these offences, his role, his participation and the aggravating factors.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will break now for lunch, and we will come back at 2:00 to hear Mr. Seromba's appeal.  
(Court recessed from 1215H to 1400H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Seromba's appeal with counsel for the Appellant, please make your submissions.  

I think I should take the opportunity of explaining that for official reasons, one member of the panel will have to leave a few minutes early this afternoon.  And we are prepared to excuse him in the circumstances.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, good afternoon.  And I would like, in compliance with the schedule that you announced to us this morning, to take the floor again -- once again in the defence of 
Father Athanase Seromba. 

Mr. President, I would also like to apologise to the interpreters for this morning, where sometimes it would seem that I was rather rapid, but it was due to the circumstances.  And I would like to apologise for that, and I believe they have understood what I have just said. 

Mr. President, before we enter the second part of the proceedings -- the appeals proceedings, I would like for us to respectfully submit that on the basis of the brief that I submitted to you in compliance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, I do not intend this afternoon to repeat the grounds of appeal that I submitted in my filings.  I would like, however, to highlight some elements that I shall outline with you this afternoon through my line of reasoning. 

I would like to start off where I left off this morning.  One of you put a question to me, a very central pivotal question to this case, that is, as to the status of Father Seromba, the priest, and if, with his help, one could have put a stop -- whether one could have put a stop to the events.  I think it was 
Judge Meron who put this question to me. 

Now, to be complete, because I want to provide precise facts, I reminded you that Rwanda was an extremely Christian country.  Now, to be specific, Your Honour, I will give, but in not an exhaustive manner, the activities of the clergymen conducted during the year 1994 during the events. 

Now, the status of priest -- and I might have said this rather rapidly earlier.  The status of a priest evolved from a very religious country where clergymen were highly respected, where before the events of 1994, every time there was intertribal warfare, the population would seek refuge in the churches, which they saw as a sanctuary.  

But in the year 1990, this changed.  As soon as the Rwandese heard of the death of 
President Habyarimana, they started getting their machetes out.  Now, why was that?  There was no more sanctuary.  And in order to complete my response, those who found themselves in churches -- because, as we said this morning, they went to Nyange church of their own volition, under their own steam, spontaneously, without Father Seromba being involved in any manner.  For them, it was a place of sanctuary.  However, they were to live the events that you know. 

Now, in order to complete my response, Your Honours, in front of the lycée technique in Kigali, where the UNAMIR forces were located, General Dallaire, Tutsis were massacred.  At the 
Sainte Famille church in Kigali where refugees were located, the clergymen and the refugees were massacred.  In Kibuye, the préfecture that we are interested in here, the clergymen -- some clergymen were massacred.  In Nyundo, where the two clergymen whom I referred to earlier left and went to Nyange, that is to say, archbishop -- the archbishop was kidnapped and the priests were killed. 
In Muhororo -- Amuhoro -- for the booth M-U-H-U-R-O-R-O (sic), that is the neighbouring commune of Nyange, Muhororo, the clergymen there were also massacred.  In Birambo, B-I-R-A-M-B-O, the priests were also massacred. 

Now, if this is of interest to you, I might also mention the case of the French priest, Father Maindron, who had tried to put up resistance but was not able to. 

Now, Honourable Appeals Chamber, this is an illustration of the status of the clergymen.  Your Honours, what is particularly striking in this case, and you mentioned it in the relevance notably of your questions, and the answers provided at an earlier stage today by the Prosecution's show, the embarrassing situation that the Prosecution finds itself in.  A question was put by one of the members of the Bench, notably -- and I put this in inverted commas -- I think it was Judge Schomburg, as to know -- as to find out whether there were orders that were given to destroy the church.  Were such orders given by authorities, were there two orders, or were there orders given by Father Seromba?  And the Prosecutor responded by saying, yes, there were, in fact, two sets of orders.  There was a general order and there was an order given by Seromba.  And then finally he said, well, it doesn't really matter.  For them, the Prosecution, it is Seromba who committed the acts. 

Now, this line of reasoning, which instills an un -- undeniable doubt here is entirely new, because throughout the proceedings in this case never was there question of two different sets of orders given.  

So, this brought me to the following conclusion, that over the last two decades that I have been practicing as a lawyer, I know that in order to establish the truth, there is but one means to do so; that is, to always cast doubt.  And when one believes that one has, in fact, found the truth, one should still continue to doubt.  We are, in this instant case, in a case where there is, as you have understood, no certainty.  So that is the difficulty of the first of the -- of the Trial Chamber, who does not manage to endorse specific crimes or facts to Father Seromba. 

How can we legally call somebody who has given an order -- an order, how can we establish his responsibility -- his criminal responsibility?  And I see that the answer has not been given to this. 

So, Your Honours, I would like to recall and remind you of what I was saying earlier this morning -- what I began to say.  I said that in its appreciation or assessment of the facts, the Trial Chamber had conducted an erroneous assessment of the following on a factual basis but also on a legal basis.  And I would like to highlight here a number of submissions.  

Mr. President, I shall rapidly, as I said at an earlier stage, go over what is considered to be problems of form, because I do not believe that -- with respect for your work, I know that you will look at these questions -- formal questions before deliberating in your chambers.  However, I would like to address more specific issues that are relative to the role that Father Athanase Seromba might have played in the events or crimes that have -- he is charged with and, we believe, inappropriately.  

I shall not come back on the question with -- to the question of forbidding people to seek food in the banana plantation, because we addressed this issue at length this morning.  However, I would say that you will probably recall that those refugees left their own homes of their own volition.  They went to Nyange and were welcomed there by Father Seromba.  He offered them accommodation.  He also offered them Caritas supplies to feed them, and every time, he tried to help them as best he could.  This is what you should retain. 

Now, with reference to this question of the banana plantation, I should recall that this fact cannot be charged to Father Seromba because at no moment in time did he give orders to any gendarme at all to stop the refugees from going to the banana plantation or to even fire on them. 

Your Honours, if you refer to the question of the gendarmes, you will remember that in the presbytery, there were only four gendarmes present in the parish itself in order to provide security.  And if we think that there were thousands of assailants, it is difficult to imagine how four gendarmes in such circumstances could have stopped anybody from gaining access to the banana plantation, whereas it has been established that Father Seromba was to be found in the presbytery. 

Another submission was recorded by the Trial Chamber, notably, that Father Seromba refused to say mass for the Tutsi refugees by -- and also called then Inyenzi, that is to say, cockroaches in the Kinyarwanda language, which is a form of -- a means of despising those parishioners, and I believe that I responded to your question by respectfully submitting to the Bench that, in view of the fact that the church was occupied, it was not possible for Mass to be said, and it was for this reason alone that Father Seromba took away the religious artifacts. 

I seem to recall that a number of years ago when I was still working at the Bar in France, one of the churches in Paris had been besieged by a number of demonstrators who occupied the church for months until the police actually sorted -- or attacked the parish church.  Now, in that parish church, of course, nobody could say Mass.  There is a sacred part of the church that exists, and when people besiege such a location, then Mass cannot be said.  So, I shall not dwell on this question. 

It was also submitted that Father Seromba allegedly turned back employees -- or turned away employees from the parish, that is to say, Tutsi employees.  I've already said what I think on the subject, that he had no reason to expel them, in view of the fact they had been working at his side for quite some time, and that until that moment -- or, until this moment in time, the Prosecution has not established that Father Seromba ever killed anybody or ever injured anybody.  So, nothing has been proved. 

You were told that Father Seromba allegedly was responsible for the -- for some refugees leaving the church on his request.  I would like to recall to the Appeals Chamber that those amongst us who have followed this case from the outset have been constantly surprised by the fragile and very tenuous nature of Prosecution evidence.  

I seem to remember that Prosecution witnesses, with the exception of CBN, Prosecution witness, those witnesses who came to testify for the Prosecution in this -- in the Trial Chamber, at the end of their testimony, and according to the ritual organised by the Trial Chamber, in asking that they look at and identify the Accused that they had just accused, were not in a position to identify Father Seromba sitting between his two counsel.  We had two further Prosecution witnesses who also submitted to the same fate.  Now, this is the nature of the credibility of the witnesses or people that you are requested to consider when upholding your -- upholding the conviction. 

Now, in this case, I am not afraid of the submissions.  I am not afraid of the submissions because in searching for the truth and in the interests of justice, there are rules to be followed, one of which -- one of which is that justice be done in order to designate a culpable individual, and this is why we come here full of hope, because we know that we can provide proof of the contrary. And were we to do so, it would also be a reversal of the burden of proof, because, of course, it is the job of the Prosecution to show that Seromba was guilty.  

You were told -- and this gave me shivers in my back this morning -- that the guilty intent or requisite intent and all specialists of doctrine, notably Marie La Rosa, who wrote an incredible book on the subject, in order to convict somebody of the charge of genocide, you have to prove specific or -- specific intent to destroy, as such, a member of the targeted group. 

The Prosecutor submits with a rather -- with a great ease, that I found disconcerting, that he refers to this in context.  I heard some quite unbelievable things in the sense that he says to you that in order to establish intention, you also have to talk about distance, that is to say, the distance at which the Accused was to be found.  And I must say that this is entirely new for me in terms of criminal law, because I believed that genocide had a very precise definition.  And in order for you to be able to convict somebody, this has to be established a priori, of course.  In Rwanda, genocide is a question of public awareness; but, of course, the Prosecution has the burden of proof with respect to the Accused. 
Now, the question of the destruction of the church is pivotal to my mind.  Firstly, one needs to ask one's self the question as to implicate -- in order to implicate Father Seromba in this.  Father Seromba, was he aware of the fact that if he welcomed or received Tutsi refugees, he was, in fact, programming the destruction of the church in so doing?  That's the first question.  This does not give rise to genocide. 

Second question:  At the time when bulldozers were requested, Athanase Seromba, question, was he one of the people who made those bulldozers comes to the location?  No.  And this is borne out of the judgement, that the bulldozer was not brought to the parish by Father Seromba, however, on the request of Mr. Rushema, a certain Rushema.  And what you were not told, Your Honours, and allow me to respectfully remind you of this, is that the original idea justifying the arrival of the bulldozer or bulldozers -- because there is also the question as to how many there were -- at the -- after the first massive attack of the 15th of April, there were an enormous number of victims around the parish and the presbytery.  And the bourgmestre requested of one of the -- a head of one of the Astaldi companies to -- to lend them a bulldozer in order to bury the victims.  And that's how the bulldozer came on to the scene.  And it is subsequently that the idea was born to use the bulldozers to destroy the church and subsequently conduct the execution of the refugees who were to be found there.  But at no point was this an initiative taken by Father Seromba. 

Now, since this morning, we have all been asking ourselves the question as to who gave the order, and you noted that the answer is not an easy one.  The Trial Chamber told you that the order was not given by Father Seromba, that is a constant, but that the authorities gave the order and that he accepted it.  This is what the Prosecution bases its submissions on.  And he said that the bulldozer driver asked him on three occasions whether he should destroy the church, to which he responded yes, and he said it would be rebuilt, and he also even put his hand in his pocket.  

This -- and I'm not challenging this.  I'm told that the Trial Chamber did not deem that the testimony of Anastase Nkinamubanzi, the driver of the bulldozer, was credible -- that his testimony was credible.  I never challenged that, and I would have held it against myself to contest it.  

Name:  Nkinamubanzi.  

And I believe that the Trial Chamber made a mistake or erred in its assessment of this witness.  And this is the reason why we are before you today, not only the Prosecution, but also the Defence.  We are at least in agreement on one point, that is, that the Trial Chamber erred.  

The Prosecutor says that the Trial Chamber erred in the sense that Seromba was the perpetrator of genocide, which he committed.  He also says that the Trial Chamber erred in the sense that there was an element of intent that was not validated, and he says also that the sentence of 15 years of imprisonment was ridiculous.  We respond:  We say that the first Judge -- in fact, the first -- the 
Trial Chamber was, in fact, wrong in the sense that he misassessed the case. 

And from this moment on, a witness's testimony was validated that this should not have been.  And this is the pivotal element of our brief.  The Prosecution witness was not able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the order to destroy the church was give by Father Seromba, and that is where, to our mind, the trial came to an end, in the sense that Prosecution did not adduce evidence to the effect that Father Seromba was the person to have given such an evil order. 

Now, in examining, the burden of proof was not actually brought by the Prosecution.  I am not going to go through the first instant case once again, but I would say, quite simply, that we want to indicate or recall to you today that Nkinamubanzi was not -- was not deemed to be credible.  However, this witness who was called by the Prosecution did not actually appear as a Prosecution witness.  He appeared as a Defence witness, and I believe that what he said before the Trial Chamber, in analysing the credibility of a witness, whether it be a statement given to an investigator or whether it be a statement given to the prosecution or -- in Rwanda, and when one comes of one's own volition to testify before a 
Trial Chamber and one is examined and cross-examined, and you have said yourself in more than one of your decisions the testimony -- such testimony is far more important than the type of statement that is taken before the investigators. 

Now, with regard to Nkinamubanzi, who is the central witness in this trial, because we cannot sort out the problem of this trial without taking into account what the destroyer of the church said.  How are you going to explain what the responsibility for that -- the person responsible for that massacre -- massacre in Nyange, if we do not know what the destroyer of the church said?  

And by your leave, Mr. President, I will stop here for some moments only to say -- because this is the background to the case and it's very important -- to say that in setting aside some time for the assessment of this case, I was struck -- well, I was told by -- that the national decisions -- decisions taken by national jurisdiction are not to be taken into account here. 

I have gone to Rwanda on several occasions, and I know what tension there exists between Rwanda's Hutus and Tutsis, and it's not easy.  I would like to remind you also that the decision that I saw rendered by the court of appeal in Ruhengeri would not be seen in the same light today.  It was rendered exactly six years after the genocide.  And there is something which I would like to say, which is not a detail, although I don't like that term, "detail".  And that is the court of appeal of Ruhengeri at the time was composed of Rwandan judges, of course, but there were Tutsi judges and who were prosecuting Hutu priests.  And these priests who were in Nyange at the time of the events with Seromba, I mentioned Jean Françoise Kayiranga, I mentioned Edouard Nturiye -- and I do not want to lengthen the proceedings now by reading the ruling which was made; although, it is necessary to mention it.  I'll mention it from memory.  And the judges said that the trial judges in Kibuye misinterpreted and misanalysed the position -- or the statements of the witnesses, including three of whom were from the civil parties.  And it came from the record that the priests could not do anything; they didn't have any means at their disposal.  And the proof is that the municipal authorities or even the army authorities did nothing.  Therefore, the religious authorities were guilty of nothing. 

Now, the question that one might put to one's self, we who are here who are not Rwandans. who are looking for the rule of law, those who will follow this case in the public gallery will wonder whether there was proper judgement rendered.  We should not ignore the fact that when history judges, it judges the judges first.  

Now, I'm asking the question, and this question can be asked by anyone of good sense.  How are we going to explain that Rwandan judges in Rwanda in Ruhengeri acquit clergymen present in Nyange at the time of the massacres and that we, in an international jurisdiction, who have all the modern mechanisms for justice, we decide that this man is guilty?  Now, I'm asking the question, and I'm asking the question with a great deal of humility, because I earlier said that your jurisdiction is not linked to what happens in national jurisdiction, but we are just looking at what has happened in this case. 

So, the Trial Chamber Judges, in their difficult situation, took -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do we have on record any evidence of the attitude of the Rwandan courts to these matters?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Mr. President, I can look for the reference of the document, but we have discussed -- in response to your question discussed at length before the Trial Chambers, and we have heard several witnesses mentioned by the Prosecution, and the document -- the exhibit whose reference I've found is D. 21, 
D delta 21, which -- and we also indicate the witnesses which were referred to by the Prosecution as having been heard in Ruhengeri, especially YAU, and these allegations were not challenged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
You're most welcome. 

Mr. President, I would simply -- because of my seeking clarity, to speak about certain aspects of this case, because I believe that I do not have any given standing position, because we will all be happy when you will have done your work of justice, and we will indeed be able to say whether justice has been done for Athanase Seromba, and this is what is remaining. 

I have been a lawyer for 27 years, and I have rarely seen, in those 27 years, many people speak -- surrender and become prisoners.  That is something which is unusual.  But I can say that something which was said -- what remains is that the evidence has not been proven.  There has not been any evidence adduced in regard to the allegations.  

The Prosecutor feels that it has to say that Seromba did not collaborate or cooperate with the Prosecution, but it is not always the case that accused persons have to cooperate with the Prosecution.  There's no obligation for an accused person to express remorse.  He did not make a guilty plea.  But if he doesn't feel guilty because he considered -- considers that he is not guilty, why should he plead guilty?  All of this is not very serious.  

I know how to plead my case, Mr. President, and I'm pleading this case in your -- under your control, and I'm saying that I would have been disturbed -- I would have been disturbed, I repeat -- if a witness came here and said, "We saw Seromba with a machete and he chopped of so-and-so's head.  I was there.  And he -- Seromba was there, and he had a club and he beat up so-and-so."  Nothing like this was said, so this is pure speculation.  So, we do not win a case through speculation.  We win a case through evidence.  And this is what we are expecting of the Prosecution. 

Now, as for the offence of genocide and the crime of crimes against humanity are defined in the statutes, you know them well, and you know the events that are required by law so that the offences be defined thus.  We have actus reus, we need the intent, which is mens rea, and from that point of view, Mr. President, Your Honours, I have seen no evidence coming from the Prosecution to support any such allegations. 

With regard to the matter of genocide, through aiding and abetting, I have said that the facts alleged and retained by the Trial Chamber were not proved beyond any reasonable doubt in conformity with your rules and statute.  Over and above that, I have seen, in the exchange of briefs, there has been a lot of jurisprudence mentioned by the Prosecution.  But every time we are looking for the appropriate research, and in this particular case we're dealing with Seromba, none of the jurisprudence can be applied to him.  I'm sure your Tribunal has realised this.  Mention was made of Ndindabahizi.  He didn't do -- Seromba didn't do what Ndindabahizi did.  There was mention of Semanza.  Semanza had a position of authority which was not the same as that of Seromba.  And there are many others. 

You have been told at each time that such jurisprudence or case law applies to Seromba, but this is wrong.  It's not correct, because what I have just mentioned cannot be received as they stand without any further evidence.  I, therefore, wish, at this point in time, to consider the matter of the commission of an offence which has been mentioned by the Prosecutor and alleged by the Prosecutor against 
Father Athanase Seromba. 

The notion of commission would suppose, Your Honours, that there would be planning right up to the execution stage of the crime.  But one of the things about which the Trial Chamber Judges did not err was that they were never in Nyange during the events that are of interest to us today, that there was no planning whatsoever.  There was no planning in Nyange.  That is what we glean from the record.  If there was no planning, Seromba could not have committed the crime of genocide as a planner or a mastermind.  Can he be accused for having to -- having aided and abetted the crime?  

This brings us, Your Honours, back to the issue where we were saying that you were responsible -- were -- that you were a bit perplexed.  Now, the mere fact of being a priest, can that justify, in normal circumstances, the events which took place in Nyange?  What could a mere priest do?  He could be a good father of a family and a respectable man under such circumstances.  

When Jean Paul Akayesu came before this Tribunal, it was not for the first time -- I think it was for the first time that General Dallaire was brought as a witness.  He was the head of UNAMIR, and he came to tell you -- he's come back several times.  He said, "I could have done nothing.  I could have done nothing."  General Dallaire, I remind you, was a career soldier, and he was the head of a UN mission, and he could do nothing. 

Now, let me come back to the question:  What could Seromba have done, who was not even a préfet?  He was a normal, ordinary man.  This is what the civil code of 1804 says:  What could a father of a family do?  So on the basis of theory, are we going to maintain such a serious allegation in the life of a man for him to go to prison -- and we're now being told he should go into prison for life -- are we going to allow that to happen on the basis of theory?  

Your Honours, I wish to say a quick word on the planning that was referred to by the Prosecutor -- Prosecution, and here Article 6(1) is very clear.  And we can look at the Akayesu judgement.  We can also look at the Bagilishema judgement.  But we can have it clearly said that planning would imply that whoever personally participates -- and I quote:  "A person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation - " and so on and so forth, of the crime referred to has to actually participate in person.  Never did the Prosecutor say here that Seromba personally was involved in anything whatsoever concerning the massacres. 

Now, the Trial Chamber convicted on the basis of aiding and abetting.  Mr. President, Your Honours, aiding and abetting -- and I'm recalling the jurisprudence, and I can quote the Prosecutor versus 
Jean Paul Akayesu -- the support which is given to someone within the framework of an act which one intends to commit or undertake.  One can say that it could be the fact of aiding the person in question by helping that person in his commission or acts.  You can also provide material support.  And this aiding should be done knowingly; in other words, you need to know that the person is preparing to commit genocide. 

I would like to repeat, and I apologise, therefore, that never did the Prosecutor establish that Seromba was one of the members of these militia who perpetrated the massacres and killings in Nyange, nor was he linked to them in any way.  There was no master/servant relationship between him and them, and, therefore, we can set this aside.  

Was Seromba an administrative authority?  No.  So what were his prerogatives?  What were his attributes?  And I said earlier that he was a vicar at the Nyange parish and with the attributes of a vicar, and these attributes are very limited.  He could receive people in confessions.  He could say Mass.  He could deal with all the tasks that befall a man of God in his pastoral mission.  

When we read the documents from the Prosecution that he had supreme authority, that he was the most well-placed -- highly-placed authority in the region, we see that this is totally different.  But, quickly, in order to keep to the time frame allotted to me, I would like to say the following in regard to this phase of the proceedings. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I am now coming to an aspect which is important, in my view.  For you to be appropriately convinced, you need, together with us, to find out whether the analysis, the factual and legal analysis, made of the facts, as included or reflected in the decisions of the Trial Chamber Judges, is in conformity with the submissions that we have developed before you.  And it's only on that condition that you should confirm or deny or set aside the decisions taken earlier, as I have done on the 
3rd of August, before I lodged the appeal. 

Well, at that time, I was saying to myself, how were the Trial Chamber Judges able to make such a serious error?  But when I look at my documents, my case file, I said to myself that we were right in presenting ourselves to you.  We were correct in lodging an appeal, not because of a light issue, but because you will have seen today that at no point in time did the work already done, the questions that you were asked -- the questions that you asked were not put before the Trial Chamber Judges.  And it would appear that if it had been determined what were the responsibilities of a vicar, what were the attributes of a vicar, maybe we could have avoided some of the errors and mistakes.  If, indeed, we had seen the circumstances under which the events took place, what were the acts that materially, directly and personally Seromba was able to act, we may have made a great deal of headway, especially given the fact that he was a Hutu.  But we are doing all this work now, and we're doing it so that the truth can be found. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, for the truth to come out and illuminate our horizon, we, as lawyers, and experienced Judges that you are, we need to find definitions or qualifiers.  

Judge Meron, this morning, shared with me a little anecdote about a village in Poland.  I wish to tell him about an anecdote for -- concerning the emperor of China.  When he saw the security of the empire vacillating because his empire was being attacked, he said to his people that, "The security situation is of concern to me, and we need to put everything in order."  And the general said to the emperor that, "We are going -- all the heads that are going to pass by, and order will be re-established, Emperor."  When the emperor listened to this question, he brought the sages to advise him, and he asked them -- he told -- he told them, "This is the situation that I'm finding myself in.  I called the generals, and this -- I asked him the question -- I asked them the questions, and this is what they said.  And what did -- what do you think about it?"  And the sages said, "You need to look at the aspect of the characterisation."  

So, for you to go along the way of conviction, you need to look at the definition of the crime of genocide.  We need to look at the definition of the crime of genocide.  How is it characterised?  Before -- what we can ask now is:  Have we looked at the issue of characterisation or qualification, definition of the crime of genocide?  I don't believe the Trial Chamber Judges did so.  

No matter what the jurisdiction may be, such serious errors which have such serious consequences should not go without a word being said.  

Further, this unfortunate Seromba who one wants to bring down so forcefully, I said about him this morning that I was not in Rwanda, and neither were you, at the time of the events, but what is of import is that when one finds one's self in such a situation, nothing is ever easy. 

Your Honours of the Appeals Chamber, I have borne in mind one statement made by someone whom you well know, whose clairvoyance and foresight we all praise, and I'm referring to Kofi Annan, who, during the 60th anniversary of the Auschwitz camp said the following -- this was in October 2005:  "We were unable to stop the genocide in Rwanda.  There was a genocide in Rwanda -- in Rwanda, and there was a genocide of the Armenians and the Turks, the Cambodians by Pol Pot.  Very soon we'll be told there was genocide in Darfur, and we did nothing."  

Well, what could Seromba do?  The United Nations is responsible for the destiny of this Tribunal.  The civil servants of the highest order at the time made this statement in the year 2005:  "We were able to do nothing."  Now, the question which should be of import to us now is:  Seromba, in Nyange, what could he have done?  

Now, Mr. President, Your Honours, what more do I need to say on this case?  We have allegations.  Are we dealing with speculation?  Are we dealing with theory, hypotheses?  And did the Trial Judges consider conviction pursuant to Article 3(a)?  

When we look at this case, we have the feeling which you get when you want to go into judicial background.  You find what is commonly known in all countries of the world what are known as judicial errors, because the judges allowed themselves -- maybe in good faith or maybe they were taken by the submissions, and, therefore, failed to take into account the real issues of the case.  There's a witness who says one thing today and the contrary tomorrow.  But since they are witnesses, we gave them all the credibility due.  We had this in the Dreyfus case in France.  Closer, still remaining with France, we had the Outreau case.  And this happened because the judges were in error.  And we have seen magistrates asking that the decisions rendered be annulled because the errors committed were so serious, that it was necessary for reparation to be made in the interests of justice. 

Now, how would this happen?  For me, I believe that Seromba, contrary to what has been said by the Prosecutor, does not merit 15 years of imprisonment.  I think that Seromba, who has already spent time in Arusha, some years, he is experiencing this with a great deal of pain, and he is feeling this in his very flesh.  His Italian friends are wondering what has become of him and what will become of him.  

I believe that Seromba, who, contrary to what you have been told, is a man of faith and a man with a good heart.  I think that Seromba would wish that you assess his case with the wisdom, with the fairness of an Appeals Chamber.  This is what he is calling for through me, and he is doing so with a great deal of sincerity.  He wants to say this with great heaviness in his heart, and he wants to say this because, in the final analysis, what did happen in Rwanda, what took place in Rwanda, no normal human being can tolerate or accept any such happenings.  No normal, ordinary human being can imagine these things.  

Consequently, you need, in the privacy of your chambers, when you are coming to a decision, you will find out whether the Defence or the Prosecution has told you the truth concerning the case.  I believe that the time has come, gentlemen, Your Honours, and when we look at what is left, I would wish to say that when you go back home, and when the question will have been put to you, have you rendered proper judgement, that you will be in a position to say yes, because justice is not to favour anyone.  It is made so that judgements can be rendered.  

And since we are dealing with a bit of history, Your Honours, I want to conclude with what happened in the parliament in parish -- in Paris when the court was rendering an -- a decision. 

The king of France made the president of the court to come, and he said, "In this case, I want you to render such-and-such a decision."  And the president of the court bowed, and I said -- and said, "Yes, sir."  And once the court sat, the decision which came down -- was handed down was in line with what the king had requested.  And it was said that the court does not render favours.  It renders judgement.  And I am saying this with confidence that Father Seromba will no longer remain in the detention facility of the United Nations.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Maître.  If I may say so, I have personally been delighted by your presentation, and I will give it careful consideration, as I'm sure my colleagues will. 

Now, you have finished a little early, and, therefore, I turn to the Prosecution to ask whether perhaps they are in a position to begin now.  
MS. FALL: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I'm also sending my greetings to those on the Defence side.  

Mr. President, if you allow me, I would like to make it clear that we are prepared to start, if this were possible.  But we would like to know -- since we received the appeals brief of the Accused person, Athanase Seromba, I would like to know if the first ground of appeal that was raised was -- is maintained by the Appellant or not, and this will enable us to organise ourselves in addressing the issues, without having to waste the Court's time. 

Throughout his statement, we did not hear, at any moment, the respondent -- or, rather, the Appellant make reference to the first ground of appeal, that is, the violation of the rights of the Accused by the Trial Chamber.  So we would like to know this, in order to organise ourselves well.  So, we'd like to know if he's dropping that ground of appeal or if he's only content with what is in his brief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître, have you heard the question, and are you prepared to respond?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Indeed, I heard the question, but I believe the Prosecutor did not follow me when I started making my statement.  I pointed out to your Honourable Chamber that I had recorded a number of grounds of appeal, and in order not to waste time, I put my grounds of appeals in my briefs, and -- but then those grounds of appeal, you know, stand.  And I believe this is what I said.  I have not waived any grounds of appeal, as I'm talking now.  All I did was refrain from wasting time under issues of form so -- while waiting for the Trial Chamber to ask any questions to me on the substantive matters.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Madam Prosecutor, I take it that you appreciate that this Appeals Chamber judges appeals not only by reference to what is said orally, but what has been said in writing.  And that is the position of your learned colleague.  So, can you please proceed on the basis that he has not abandoned anything in writing?  
MR. SEYE: 
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  I will start the response of the Prosecutor, and I will be very brief, at least as brief as my learned friend. 

Your Honours, we are here this afternoon to examine the alleged error regarding the finding of the 
Trial Chamber that Athanase Seromba aided and abetted genocide and extermination as crime against humanity.  And we agree with our learned friend that there are rules, and the rules -- in particular, the rules regarding standards of appellate review are clearly set forth in Article 24 of the statute.  They are also well established by this Appeals Chamber and that of ICTY.  And our position is that in his brief, in his submission today, this standard are not met. 

And that is the reason why we submitted in our brief that, because of the deficiency, we indicated this apparent appeal should be summarily dismissed.  And we refer in our brief to the -- to the ICTY 
Appeals Chamber holding in Brdanin whereby the Chamber identified categories of deficiencies related to error of fact or law, pursuant to which it will dismiss the pertinent alleged error or argument in a summary way. 

So now, for the purpose of this hearing and -- except maybe for ground one, which will be dealt with by my learned colleague, Dior Fall, we are -- so, what I mean is subject to any clarification or issue of concern of this Chamber, we will -- we would like to rely on the arguments set out in detail in the Respondent's brief for all the other grounds, as I say, except ground one.  

So -- but I may, with your permission, just bring one clarification regarding the Ruhengeri case the Appellant mentioned this afternoon.  Indeed, two priests were convicted at first instance but acquitted on appeal, as I recall, for technical reason.  And the main reason was because witnesses who testified against him were also civil parties in the lawsuit against those priests.  

But there are many differences between Seromba and those priests.  One -- the first difference I would mention is the fact that those two priests only came at Nyange parish around 15 April 1994.  Second difference is neither of them were charged for ordering what happened at that location, and they, in particular, Witness NA1, one of the priests, did not fled after the event. 

And I should also indicate that the Appeals Court made no adverse finding in respect of any of the Prosecution witnesses -- I believe there were seven or so -- who were called in the Appellant case in Seromba -- in the Seromba case before this Tribunal.  

Now, I'm sure that my learned friend is not arguing that because those priests were found not guilty, for whatever reason, and I submit it was for personal reasons, Seromba is also not guilty of genocide and crime against humanity. 

And another clarification -- or another precision, he's one of the priests, NA1, who came to testify in favour of the Appellant was not found credible, had said, at the time, during that Ruhengeri case, that Seromba was the only priest which was involved in the killing.  

So, the second clarification I may give is in relation to Witness FE32, the bulldozer driver.  That driver, as I recall, did not choose to come but was called by the Defence.  He was called by the Defence after the Prosecutor decided not to call him.  And the only reason why the Prosecutor did not call that witness is the very reason why the Trial Chamber did not find him credible, is that that witness compromised himself blatantly, if I may say.  And the reason is this:  FE32 gave, as early as 1995, something like -- something seven witness statements incriminating the Appellant Seromba.  He even wrote, on his own volition, a letter to the supreme court of Rwanda in which he indicated that he only destroyed the church after Father Seromba told him to do so. 

So, in summary -- 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Could you please indicate the exhibit number, for ease of reference?  Thank you.  
MR. SEYE: 
Yes.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Yes, this would be, in particular, Exhibit P. 57.  This is the letter to the supreme court of Rwanda, where FE32 had said -- and I will quote him in French because -- from the judgement -- 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
When we are just talking about exhibits, I think they are all available.  However, I tried to find out -- what about the part of the cross-examination that was extracted and sealed under separate cover?  Is it part of the -- does it form part of the trial record or not?  Page 5 during cross-examination -- at the end of cross-examination?  Because -- 
MR. SEYE: 
Page 5 of which witness -- page 5 of what document?  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
The witness you referred us to, the driver -- 
MR. SEYE: 
FE32.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Yeah.  Because I can't see any exhibit number.  Maybe you can come back to this later, after the break.  
MR. SEYE: 
I'm not sure I gather what was under seal, because -- because FE32 ended up testifying openly with his name, so I'm not very sure what was kept under seal after his testimony.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
As I said, maybe you can explain later, after the break.  Thank you.  
MR. SEYE: 
So I was talking about Exhibit P. 57 at page 2, FE32's letter to the supreme court of Rwanda, where he said as follow -- he wrote as follow:  "The fact is that I acknowledged before the Tribunal, and I continue to acknowledge this today, the fact that I destroyed the church using a bulldozer under the orders of the communal and church authorities at the time." (Microphones overlapping)...religious authority at the time was Father Seromba.  

He also said in the same letter to the supreme court of Rwanda that he refused to comply until the arrival of Father Seromba.  And after that, the church was destroyed. 

Your Honour, that letter is dated 7 November 2001.  And it's because of those seven statement -- consistent statement incriminating the Accused and the Appellant Seromba for a period of ten years that FE32 was not found credible. 

So now, as I submitted earlier, we would prefer, for the purpose of this hearing, to respond to any question or any clarification this Chamber may have; and, otherwise, we simply refer to our brief where the argument are put in detail.  We will not deem it necessary to repeat those argument here.  But I will look, of course, into the question put by Judge Schomburg right away.  

And, Your Honours, while I'm looking into that point about part of the testimony which was under seal, I will let my learned colleague, Dior Fall, to continue in relation to ground one.  But I must admit, I'm not quite sure about the part of the exhibit which was under seal.  I will look into that.  Thank you.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am going to address ground one raised by the Appellant.  And we would like to recall this, because this wasn't said earlier on, and which we find under paragraphs 12 and 14 of his brief.  And the Appellant is complaining to the trial -- to the Appeals Chamber that the Trial Chamber violated his age-old right by not allowing him to give testimony as the last witness.  And he complained that the Trial Chamber violated the rules of 85(A) and 20 -- of the rules of procedure, under 20 - 
Article 20 of the statute, and that he was not given all the facilities with which to come and make his defence. 

Mr. President, the Respondent is contending that the Appellant did not bring any proof as to the violation of the rights of the Accused person of any prejudices that he might have suffered.  

Now, concerning the first point, that is, the alleged sacrosanct and age-old right to give testimony as the last witness, that which right -- and which right was violated by the Trial Chamber, our contention here is that the Trial Chamber couldn't have violated such a right because such a right does not exist.  

Mr. President, if it is true that the Trial Chamber, in practice, allows certain local practices or domestic practices insofar as the order of appearance of witnesses or an accused is concerned and allows the accused to choose the best moment at which he would like to appear to testify, there cannot be -- and this results from the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, so these -- and these are not practices that should tell this Tribunal which rule to follow.  And I would like to say that we find this in the Bagosora decision of January 2004. 

And in the first paragraph, Article 14 of the statute and of the rules, these are -- nothing in the statute or in the rule expressly gives the right to an accused to give testimony for his own defence as a last witness.  And I would like to add that the case law that interprets those provisions of statute and of the rules, in our knowledge, did not expressly grant any right to an accused to give testimony as a last witness in his own defence. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, on the contrary, if we scrutinise the provisions of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, as we have said, which govern the proceedings of this Tribunal, we will realise that some provisions -- and we mention those provisions in our brief in paragraphs 54 to 62, and those provisions of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence which do not make it possible for an accused to be the last witness for his defence.  And we're talking about -- we'll refer you to Rule 90(F) which does not only empower the Trial Chamber, but gives it the obligation to control the good conduct of proceedings, in particular, by defining the manner and the order of appearance of witnesses.  In the -- there are examples in the case law that confirm this position, and those provisions are for Rule 90(F).  In our response, we gave examples of decisions that were even taken by the Trial Chamber in this case, acting under Rule 90, which made the Appellant to appear before a Prosecution witness.  We have the example of the Krajisnik case. 

So, he was asked to appear at a certain point and -- but that ultimatum was not made use of, but it was -- he clearly said that that ultimatum -- or that he could do this under Rule 90.  This also is the case with the Bagosora decision, which also confirms the same finding in the sense that the accused does not have the right to appear as a last witness, because neither does Article 19 or 20 of the statute say anywhere that the accused should appear as the last witness for his defence.  

Mr. President, in order for us to expedite matters, in our brief, that is, on pages 84 to 62, thereof, we have demonstrated that Rule 48, which deals with the joinders of trials, gives the possibility -- or does not give room for a witness to appear as the last witness, because if he had to appear after the witnesses of another accused person, then it wouldn't be possible for him to -- for the other accused persons to appear as the last person.  I refer you to the examples of case law that we have given in the various paragraphs that I have mentioned. 

Article -- it is Article 85 that lays down the procedure to follow, insofar as the giving of testimony is concerned and which begins with the Prosecution evidence and then the Defence evidence, the rebuttal and the rejoinders.  So, if you look at that rule, it will be interesting to see that in the brief of the Appellant, he reproduces that Rule 85 but forgets to mention that possibility of referring to Rule 90.  And it is only -- and I'm saying this to show that the provisions of Rule 98 does not make it possible for the accused person to appear as the last witness, because a witness can be -- the Court has the possibility of calling in a witness for further evidence, even after an accused has already given testimony.  

So, Mr. President, it's not enough to make allegations.  These allegations need to be substantiated and proven.  And, once again, Mr. President, the Appellant did not adduce any proof of any violation.  It was difficult for him to do so, because this right, as we have pointed out and as we see from the analysis that we have exposed in our brief, such a right does not exist in this Tribunal. 

Mr. President, we are now going to quickly move on to the second argument -- or, rather, to the second allegation raised by the Appellant to the effect that the Trial Chamber violated the rights of the Accused, on the one hand, by not making a fair application of Article 20 of the statute.  Mr. President, 
Your Honours, we are not going to give general allegations, but it is surprising to see that in his contentions -- or, rather, allegations, the Appellant did not give any reference -- did not make any reference to any action undertaken by the Trial Chamber in violation of Article 20.  He cited no case as to how the proceedings were run, nor did he make any reference to the transcripts which have a record of the proceedings of the case, nor were the transcripts ever challenged by the Appellant. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, talking about the violation of Article 20 of the statute, we are going to demonstrate that far from having violated the provisions of that Article 20, the Trial Chamber rightly, appropriately applied the provisions of that article. 

Mr. President, accordingly, upon the request -- or application of the Appellant, the Trial Chamber on the 19th of May 2005 took all the necessary steps to have a new counsel appointed for that Defence team after the lead counsel had withdrawn from the case.  So, Mr. President, Your Honours, the provisions of Article 20 of the statute were properly applied.  

And then, Mr. President, and you'll find this in our brief, the Trial Chamber, in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the statute, allowed the Appellant to vary, on two occasions, his witness list, thus, making things easy for him, as he wished, and this was at his request.  All of this was meant to make it easy for him to present their case. 

So, Mr. President, Your Honours, still in facilitating the hearing of the witness, I will come later to this in discussing Witness PS2, who could not give testimony on an appropriate date, arrangements were made for a video conference to be organised.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, in our brief we have all the references to the decisions taken by the 
Trial Chamber, and also in our brief we have given all the references to the transcripts that come to substantiate and confirm clearly all that we have submitted to your Honourable Trial Chamber today. 

Mr. President, the Trial Chamber complied with the provisions of rules, and we have demonstrated this.  We don't need to give the details, because we find this in our brief, that there's no violation of Article 20.  Therefore, does the Appellant have to do -- the Appellant is of the opinion that the Trial Chamber violated the rights of the Appellant, since it took certain measures that prevented him from continuing to present his evidence.  

I think we should have a small background here and not get into details, because in our brief, that is on pages 13 and 14, we give a chronology and a sequence of events as they unfolded.  We only want to revisit the facts that were the subject of this first ground of appeal.  It should be pointed out that, because of the various requests for adjournment, the Trial Chamber, on four occasions, had to adjourn the presentation of the Defence evidence.  And they were supposed to have started making their case on the 1st of March 2005, as planned, but they only started presenting their case on the 
21st of October 2005. 

Mr. President, you will find this on footnote number 65 and 67, which give references -- which make references to all the transcripts of the proceedings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do forgive me.  We have (microphone not activated) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have it on the schedule to take a little pause at this stage.  Will counsel find it awkward to terminate at this stage and to resume afterwards?  Very well.  We will -- 
MS. FALL: 
I have no objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a pause at this stage, and we will come back in 20 minutes.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed at 1530H) 
(Pages 40 to 63 by Sherri Knox)
























(Court resumed at 1552H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MS. FALL:
Obliged, Mr. President.  I was coming to the second ground of appeals on the part of the Appellant, who was accusing the Trial Chamber of having taken measures that made the trial unfair.  Because, on one part they had reversed the order of appearance of the Witness PS2 and the Appellant and, secondly, they had put an end to the Defence case. 
And in so doing, they had rid him of the benefit of being able to examine both Witness PS2 and the Appellant. 

Mr. President, we should refer to the events just as they occurred.  And we should not merely make allegations willy-nilly.  Mr. President, we should note that the Trial Chamber, with the power provided by Article 90 for the good conduct of proceedings, and also as to the presentation of evidence, did so in compliance.  And I would say that the presentation of the Defence case that was due to commence on the 1st of March 2005, as a result of the repeated requests on the part of the Appellant, could only commence on the 30th of October -- 31st of October 2005.  We refer to this in our brief in the 
footnotes 65 and 66.  So the Trial Chamber found itself obliged under the provisions of Article 97 to move forward in order not to lose time.  So, they had then to reverse the order of appearance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it may help you in any way, you can, if you choose, rely on your written briefs.  You have referred to certain footnotes in them.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  The footnotes refer to paragraphs 74 to 85 of our brief.  We would, therefore, 
like to specify, Mr. President, that we should also note that the Apellant had requested that the Trial Chamber -- and this results not only of the order of appearance that was filed before the 
Chamber on the 22nd of March 2006 but also, as I said, the order of appearance that was filed on the 26th of March 2006
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
     And also the transcript of a date the interpreter did not catch because it was too fast.  
MS. FALL:
And he also wanted to testify in his own defence.  The Trial Chamber accepted this.  And we should underline at this point that appearing as a witness in his own defence as the Trial Chamber concluded in Galic does not affect the power of the Trial Chamber to properly control the conduction of proceedings and the order of appearance of the witnesses. 

Now, if the Trial Chamber did reverse the order of appearance of PS2 and the Appellant himself, the Trial Chamber did so with a view to properly managing the conduct of proceedings, and also with a view to avoiding any unforeseen delay.  

The Appellant -- and this comes out of the transcript of the 18th of April 2006.  The counsel for the Appellant said that PS2 -- Witness PS2 -- could not appear before the 20th of May 2006.  Now, in view of the fact that the trial had been adjourned on a number of occasions, the parties and the Chamber agreed that the Defence would rest its case on the 27th of April 2006.  

Mr. President, this is the reason why the Trial Chamber, with a view to avoiding any further delay, and also for reasons of prudence and because it had the power to do so, decided to reverse the order of appearance of witnesses, that is, PS2 and the Appellant. 

From that point on, Mr. President, Your Honours, the facts, and nothing but the facts, do not prove that it was not the Trial Chamber which refused to hear Witness PSD (sic), but that it was rather the Appellant who was totally and entirely responsible for that situation that occurred.  In fact, it would be necessary to recall that following the measures taken by the Trial Chamber of reversing the 
appearance of Witness PS2 and the Appellant, the Appellant seized the bureau of the Tribunal on the 24th of April 2006 requesting the disqualification of the Chamber -- the judges composing the Trial Chamber in question.  Following the decision of the bureau dismissing that motion, the Appellant appealed that decision on the 26th of April 2006.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, you will recall that on that date the video conference of Witness PS2 had been arranged for on that date because the Chamber had authorized that video conference and measures had been taken; counsel representatives went to South Africa for the videoconferencing, and everything was ready.  And it was only then that the Appellant, when the videoconferencing was due, his lead counsel did not appear; the Appellant did not come to court either.  It was co-counsel who appeared in court to inform the Chamber that he had received instructions from his client to the effect that he was no longer going to attend the proceedings until the Appeals Chamber had ruled on his appeal regarding the decision made by the bureau of the Tribunal. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, the Trial Chamber decided to continue with the proceedings because it believed -- and this comes from the record of the 25th of April 2006 -- that the appeal lodged did not warrant any adjournment.  So it asked on two occasions whether lead counsel was ready to examine PS2, and co-counsel responded that he was not ready and that lead counsel was not present to proceed with the examination-in-chief of Witness PS2. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, the Trial Chamber was still proving to be very patient.  And it reiterated its question, and it was to receive the response that Defence was not ready to examine PS2.  And that is why it was decided that the Appellant had set aside his right to call any further witnesses.  

And it was due to the desire of the Appellant that the Trial Chamber found itself in that situation.  And the appeal did not warrant an adjournment of the proceedings, and the Defence case should have proceeded.  And the Trial Chamber asked the Appellant, who had asked to appear as a witness in his own defence, to appear in that capacity.  Co-counsel said that he was there only due to his respect for the Chamber, and that he was not there in order to act -- and once again, the Trial Chamber having a great deal of patience, adjourned on two occasions, the proceedings.  And you can find this at paragraphs 83, 84 and 85 of our brief.  And it will give you the exact references according to how the proceedings were conducted.  

And the Appellant, unfortunately, did not respond favorably, and the proceedings were adjourned on two occasions.  The Chamber asked counsel to convince the Appellant to appear, and it reiterated that he was the one responsible for the order of appearance of the witnesses.  The Chamber asked that he be convinced to attend the proceedings, and twice the proceedings were adjourned.  The Appellant persisted in his attitude, that of refraining from appearing before the Chamber unless there was a decision concerning the appeal against the bureau decision. 

Mr. President, despite all the efforts made by the Trial Chamber, it had to adjourn the proceedings to the 27th; in other words, the last day of the session for the presentation of the case of the Defence.  And this is a date which had been agreed on by the two parties.  And there was nothing new in that particular date of the 27th April 2006.  

Mr. President, lead counsel, once again, appeared and said that this was due to his respect for the Chamber, but that instructions from his client were the same.  In other words, that he was not appearing before the Chamber until the decision was made on the appeal.  Once again, Mr. President, 
Your Honours, the Trial Chamber was very patient and solicitous of the Appellant, and asked that the Appellant appear, and he refused once again.  Given that refusal, the Chamber asked the registry, pursuant to Rule 54, to notify the Appellant that his presence was required for trial.  This was done and duly complied with.  And you can refer to Rule 54 and 82 regarding the measures taken by the registry.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, given the obstinate nature or attitude of the Appellant and his persistence in refusing to appear before the Trial Chamber, the latter could have even -- pursuant to Rule 82 -- discontinued to sit in the absence of the Appellant, but it was unable to do so because the Appellant, who had expressed the desire to be the last witness to appear, was indeed the last witness to appear.  But he refused, purely and simply to present himself for trial.  
Given that state of affairs, the Trial Chamber had no choice but to note that there were no other Defence witnesses and it, thus, declared the presentation of the Defence case closed.  Could the Chamber be blamed for that action, Mr. President, Your Honours?  In our brief we provided all the information which demonstrate that the Trial Chamber, by complying with the provisions of the statute and the rules, and in particular in determining the order of appearance of witnesses, did not violate any provision or any right of the Accused.  We have fully demonstrated that the Trial Chamber throughout the trial took the measures necessary in compliance with Article 20 of the statute and Rule 85(A) of the rules.  

The Appellant at no point in time demonstrated contrary evidence to what we are saying here.  He provided no concrete examples for the alleged violation by the Trial Chamber of the rights of the Accused.  And he has shown no prejudice that he has suffered.  And this is why we respectfully submit that the first ground of appeal of the Appellant be set aside purely and simply.  The Respondent wishes to thank the Chamber for the time accorded.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any further submissions from the Prosecution?  
MR. SEYE:
Yes, Mr. President, I had promised to come back to Your Honourable Judge Schomburg's question.  In relation to a portion of the testimony, or the transcript which was put under seal -- I think the correct word -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have until 4:20 on my estimate. 
MR. SEYE:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I hope to do it in one minute.  

Because, what was put under seal -- and I think we agree is -- sorry.  To be clear, the word, under seal, may not be the correct word.  It was a portion of the transcript of 28th March 2006 which was put as if it was given -- as if the testimony was given in a closed session.  As I understand it, it's page 6 to 16 of the testimony of -- not Witness FE32, which I was talking about -- and I believe they'll have a different number from that -- but the testimony of Witness FE6.  

So what I was saying earlier is that nothing as I understand it in relation to Witness FE32, the bulldozer driver, was put under seal.  So it's only a portion of Witness FE6 that was put as if it was given in closed session because of some names and so on.  

I hope that clarified the matter.

JUDGE DAQUN:
Thank you so much.
MR. SEYE:
And subject to any question or clarification these gentlemen may seek, that will be our submission.  
As I said earlier, we rely on our brief for the remaining part of the Appellant's argument.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the response from the Prosecution?  
MR. SEYE:
It is, Your Honour.  Most obliged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we will hear now the reply of Mr. Seromba, 30 minutes allocated.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, briefly, I would like to say a few words following what has been said by the Prosecutor.  Now, these few words of mine will deal with the testimony of this important witness in the trial whom we had somewhat set aside.  And I'm referring to 
Mr. Anastase Nkinamubanzi.  And we know he testified here under his own name.  

I'm coming back to this issue, Mr. President, Your Honours, because I say that the pre-emptory words expressed by the Prosecutor are false.  And there has been mention of Exhibit 55, which would correspond to a letter written by Anastase Nkinamubanzi addressed to the Rwandan supreme court and through which the witness would say that he had destroyed Nyange church at the instigation of the local and ecclesiastical or church authorities.  And the Prosecutor is claiming that it is for this reason that the Trial Chamber did not find his testimony credible, if I am not mistaken, from what I heard from the Prosecutor concerning the testimony of Mr. Nkinamubanzi. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I wish to state here and now that if you are taking the trouble to look at the transcripts -- and I know you will do so -- of the four hearings which we participated in, in the presence of that witness, you will observe that the latter was quite confused, and he was quite prolific, and he spoke of his trial from one end to the other.  He referred to what he had experienced while under incarceration.  And he also said why he had refused to come and testify for the Prosecution.  This is in the record.  

He said he will not come to testify for the Prosecutor because he thought that Seromba did not do anything in the facts alleged in the trial.  And saying this, that we have taken this from the transcripts, but I have been mentioning this from memory.  It would also be appropriate to say because, after all, Nkinamubanzi said that he had been sought after by the Prosecutor's office.  And he was even brought here to Arusha, but he refused to come to testify.  And that is the truth from the record.  
But now you're being told that his testimony was not credible.  That is a point of view, may I say.  But I repeat for your benefit, Your Honours -- but I'm doing this with trembling hands.  Because, when you're facing justice, you always have your hands shaking.  He explained-- and this is quite undeniable -- that at no point and time did he receive orders from Athanase Seromba to destroy -- orders to destroy the church in Nyange.  This is what comes out of the record.  And this is from the transcripts of the 
5th of April 2006, when the Chamber was listening to the testimony of Anastase Nkinamubanzi.  

What we have learned in light of the testimony of Nkinamubanzi is this.  For those who are used to Rwandans, and this is not something which will be denied by the Prosecution, that Rwandan witnesses are witnesses of a particular nature.  You just have to attend the examination-in-chief or cross-examination of Rwandan witnesses.  It's a real work of art to be able to get them to speak the truth.  

Now, with Nkinamubanzi, when an accused person is absent, you are told that, well, if the accused is absent, accuse such and such, and then you will have a comfortable stay in prison.  And this is what transpired.  And I'm indicating this because the key witness of this trial -- this driver of the bulldozer who was convicted in Rwanda -- has always said that Seromba did not give orders.  And he came here to tell us this.  

So, are we not being faced with the real doubt as to who, indeed, issued those orders?  At least it wasn't Seromba, in any case, because the person who destroyed the church came here and said that it wasn't Seromba.  That is the reality of the case, Your Honours.  

As for me, I am -- yes, Your Honor?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Schomburg wishes to ask you a question. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

In the beginning of your speech you referred to the letter of 7 November 2001, which is Exhibit -- not as you said 55, but P. 57 and signed as Exhibit C1. There it clearly reads, "Kayishema, when he brought me and forced me to demolish the church, I refused to comply until the arrival of Father Seromba.  After that, the church was destroyed."  

Do you contest the authenticity of this letter, or did you ever contest this?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Your Honour, let me answer by saying that here with the Trial Chamber we had a lot of discussion concerning this letter or -- where the same author, Anastase Nkinamubanzi, came and challenged certain documents which were attributed to him.  You will see that there are some letters which were not signed.  I don't have all the references in mind.  And this letter which was addressed to the 
supreme court, we also have a letter which was addressed to the supreme court, but the reference numbers are different and that letter is not signed.  And Nkinamubanzi told the Chamber that each time that he wrote any letter to such an important authority as the supreme court, he would sign documents. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
That's exactly my point.  At Footnote 525 of the trial judgment, it reads, "The signed version of this letter was filed with the Trial Chamber as Exhibit C1." The signed version. 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Your Honour, still in that issue I'm not going to be categorical regarding this specific exhibit because I don't have all the reference numbers.  But what I can say, because I was there myself and I was the one conducting the examination, we did have an extremely heated discussion on the quality and authenticity of this document.  So Nkinamubanzi was challenging the authenticity of the document and the fact that he signed it.  

But what I can say is that he came back systematically to the certain number of documents which the Prosecutor claimed to be exhibits.  So I wish to inform you that this was an important piece of information for you to come to a determination.  Because, you need to see all the parameters before you come to focusing on a specific issue.  

And let me say that Nkinamubanzi has been in prison for more than ten years.  And he has been under the influence of things that happened to him while he was there in prison.  I know that I -- that there were many documents which were contested or challenged by the witness himself -- and the Prosecution has refused this -- and he refused to testify in closed session, and he wanted to testify under his own name because he was speaking the truth.  And this is a truth which was not necessary for us to repeat.  

I don't know whether I've been clear in my answer.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
I thank you.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you too, Your Honour.  

So this is what I wanted to say with regard to Nkinamubanzi.  I also wish to say a word or two very quickly about the personality of Seromba.  To a question that was put -- I believe it was Judge Liu who was asking what we should understand about rehabilitation given the age of the Accused.  And I think that was a central point.  And the Prosecutor said that, well, in fact, rehabilitation can only take place if there was remorse expressed, and furthermore why, in fact, go about rehabilitation given the serious nature of the crimes, and that could be understood if another genocide was being prepared or was going to take place.  

I'm somewhat surprised, Your Honours, because by definition alone -- and it's not to you that I need to explain this.  But for a very long time, there's an interesting book from the French philosopher Fuko.  And we know that prison is a place where one doesn't come out as having been better rehabilitated because of the sentence.  And there's a science of penology, which deals with sentencing.  If we are to say that there has been a wrong done to society, he as a prisoner needs to be rehabilitated.  

Now, if we are saying that Seromba, because he did not plead guilty, because his age is of no import because his good contact was going against him, that he should be convicted, we are no longer dealing with criminal justice.  We're doing something else, but not criminal justice, I would submit. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I can see the hands of the clock moving and I believe I've spoken a great deal this afternoon.  I would wish to say to you that I'm being very modest and I have the honour -- and this is for the first time in my career that I am defending a priest.  And this is an honour for me, believe me.  I am defending him and I'm submitting to you that it does not appear to me neither morally nor legally possible that you maintain the conviction of Father Athanase Seromba.  My objective is to make this demonstration.  I'm here to defend and not to prosecute.  And my demonstration will consist in telling you that if you are not categorically convicted that Seromba was guilty of the disastrous facts that took place in Nyange, you should acquit him.  That would be rendering justice.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, you see, what led to the trials of Nuremberg, its moral power and its historical value was not the conviction of criminals, but it was rather the respect of their rights.  That was the fundamental issue.  All Rwandans who come before you must have the feeling that their rights will be respected scrupulously, and that if they were to be found innocent, their rights would still be respected.  That is my objective.  

So, Your Honours, what is it that remains for you to do?  It has been said, and we, who were looking at what was happening in Nuremberg with a great deal of interest, some claimed that it was the justice of the victors.  But you are not a Tribunal of the victors.  You have come from many countries; you are many in number.  You are the incarnation of the flag behind you.  And this is why I am very -- I have a lot of trust in justice when I speak to you.  

And it is on this note of hope that I would wish to conclude.  Because at the time when I'm coming to an end, I am aware that the rights of this man have been violated.  His family have been killed.  And it is a problem for him to bear this burden.  But then he still continues to believe in you.  And that is why he came here.  He continues to believe in you, because one must believe in justice.  Today he believes in two things:  In God and in your justice.  You shouldn't disappoint him.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Liu wants to ask you a question, Counsel.  
JUDGE DAQUN:
Since you mentioned a question of age, I'll ask a question in this respect.  At paragraph 30 -- 394 -- under 399 of the judgment, the Trial Chamber took into account the Appellant's age as a mitigating factor.  The Prosecution submits that it was an error and that it should have been taken into account as an aggravating factor because the Accused was sufficiently immature to know his actions were criminal.  

I would like to ask you:  Would the Appellant's age have been taken into account in assessment of the mitigating factors?  If so, why?  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Your Honour, allow me, first of all, to make a clarification.  In the judgment that I have, the paragraph is paragraph at 399.  Is that correct?  Because I thought I heard 394.  Very well.
JUDGE DAQUN:
I think both places.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Very well.  Now my answer will be as follows, Your Honours:  It is not to you that I will explain the circumstances in which a judicial decision is taken.  You know there are aggravating factors that can be considered as mitigating factors as well.  

I come from a legal tradition that is Roman or German, where before sentencing you need to look for the circumstances that are favorable for the accused.  It is true that it is difficult to say here, which is the level -- or the wit -- that the age of the accused person, Father Seromba, had in his judgment.  But what is certain is that the age of an accused person is always a factor that is taken into account by the judges at the time that they are making their determination.  

It is obvious that if he had been a minor, he would be dealt with as a minor.  But this is not the case.  The Trial Chamber judge said that he is 31 years of age.  But I am not only looking at his age.  I am looking at all the other factors.  It is true that if we had to consider only the age, it would be difficult to answer you.  But we look at age when we say in the event that his conviction is final, there's the possibility for him to be rehabilitated.  Because at the time that the ruling was taken, he was young.  And I think the judges have to consider whether he can be rehabilitated in consideration because of his age.  I think this is where the age factor comes in.  I hope, Your Honour, that I have answered your question.  
JUDGE DAQUN:
Thank you very much.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
I thank you, Your Honour.  

If there is no other question, Mr. President -- well, I am still ready to answer any questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We come now to the last item on today's agenda, which reads as:  Optional personal address by Athanase Seromba, 15 minutes.  You need not use all the time at your disposal.  
THE APPELLANT:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, Judges of this Appeals Chamber.  It is a very sad thing for me.  When I chose to become a priest, it is because I wanted to devote my entire life to the Christian population and to everyone in order to save the human being, not only physically, but also spiritually.  But here I am being prosecuted like Jesus.  Now, when Jesus was on the cross, what did he say?  He said, "Forgive them because they know not what they are doing or what they have done."  And that is the reason wherefore I am also pardoning those who are -- forgiving those who are accusing me.  

I am happy with this occasion that I have been given to address this Appeals Chamber.  I wasn't given such an opportunity with the Trial Chamber.  I had the difficulties with the Trial Chamber that my counsel has set out.  But today I am happy because you have actually accepted to listen to me for me to say exactly what happened.  

I was ordained on the 18th of July 1993.  And I was appointed the parish vicar of Nyange in 
September ending 1993.  And I held that position up until the 17th of March 1994 when I was transferred to the Crete Zaire-Nil parish.  But I never had the opportunity of getting there because the situation was really difficult.  

I was saying therefore that I was ordained on the 18th of July, 1993 and appointed the vicar of 
Nyange parish in September ending 1993.  But I was transferred on the 17th of March 1994 to the Crete Zaire-Nil parish.  I wasn't able to take up my new position at my new station because of the difficult circumstances.  And how were the circumstances difficult?  The war was raging at the time.  

So I arrived in Nyange because the war began in Rwanda in 1990, not in 1994.  So when I arrived in Nyange in September 1993, the security situation was shaky.  There was mistrust between the Hutu and Tutsi members of the population.  Hutu families were accusing Tutsi families of sending their children to the RPF which was at war with the country.  The population felt that the priests were helping the young Tutsis morally and materially by helping them to join the RPF.  In February ending 1994, the accusations levied against the priesthood became more serious.  And that is why the bishop made new appointments.  

On the 6th of April 1994, we held a Presbyterian meeting that brought together all the priests of the Nyundo diocese.  At that meeting, I agreed with Father Habimana, Balthazar, the one who had replaced me, that I had to hand over duty to him on the 7th of April so that I could leave on the 8th of April.  After the meeting, I returned to Nyange hurriedly in the evening of the 6th of April in order to prepare for the handing over ceremony that had to take place the following day on the 7th of April 1994.  

Unfortunately, in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994, President Habyarimana's plane was shot down, and a curfew was decreed, and this affected the entire Rwandan territory.  So the acting parish priest was marooned in Nyundo, and Seli, who had to replace me, was marooned in Muhororo.  So I found myself in Nyange with Hakizimana, Appollinaire, a seminarian who was doing his internship there.  

On Sunday the 10th of April of 1994, Father Habimana, Balthazar, who was to replace me, arrived.  And after he arrived, I wanted to leave to take up my new position.  The new vicar asked me not to leave because there were a good number of refugees in the parish, and he needed assistance to manage the affairs as they were.  I accepted to help him while waiting for things to return to normal.

On Monday, the 11th of April 1994 in the morning, together -- that is Habimana, Balthazar, and 
myself -- wrote a letter to the bourgmestre asking him to come and visit the refugees and bring them assistance and ensure their security.  We explained our concerns to him as well as the concerns of the refugees that were under flight.  At around 5:00 p.m., the bourgmestre came with four gendarmes.  They requisitioned the buildings that hosted the secretariat of the parish and they set up shop there.  The number of refugees kept mounting on a daily basis.  And during that entire period, we gave food from Caritas to the refugees up until when the food was exhausted.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, contrary to the allegations of the Prosecutor, according to who I left the refugees hungry, I think it difficult and almost impossible to refuse to give food to somebody to whom you've provided shelter.  It is rather logical not to welcome such a person if you don't want to give him something.  As for the two priests and the one seminarian, we welcomed those refugees with open hands and did everything that we could do to enable them to live while hoping for better.  Unfortunately, things got worse.  

The first major attack took place on the 15th of April 1994 at 1:00 p.m. at the time that we were welcoming our brothers:  Fathers Nturiye, Édouard, and Kayiranga, Emmanuel.  They had just escaped from the massacres of the priest in the Nyundo cathedral, and they chose to come to Nyange -- they chose to come to Nyange because they were -- they hailed from that parish.  So there were now 
four reserve priests and a seminarian at that parish.  

During that attack, close to 200 people were killed.  The attackers left their bodies lying about in the courtyard of the church.  At around 5 p.m., we conferred to see what we should do in order to bury those corpses and have the remaining refugees protected.  So we took the position to go and see the bourgmestre.  And since I'm the one who had a motorbike, my colleagues entrusted me with this task.  I accepted to sacrifice myself alone in the event that I was attacked on my way.  I went and saw the bourgmestre of the commune, but he was not present.  

I asked the communal policeman to tell him that we had been attacked and that the attackers had killed many people, and that we were afraid, and that we really needed his help as a matter of urgency.  I returned to the parish, and I gave an account of what I had done to my colleagues. 

It was at about 8:00 p.m. that the bourgmestre arrived.  He found all of us at the presbytery and told us that he was going to see how to provide for protection for the refugees.  He also told us that he was going to see how he was going to bury the corpses using the bulldozer.  On the 16th of April, the caterpillar or the bulldozer was there.  But instead of burying the corpses, as the bourgemestre had promised us, the bulldozer was used to destroy the church and to kill other persons.  

Mr. President, I see that time is passing by very fast.  I don't know if you will give me enough time so that I can wrap up my statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would five minutes more do you?  
THE APPELLANT:
Ten. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Have ten.  
THE APPELLANT:
Mr. President, I am greatly obliged.

Your Honours, so after that despicable tragedy, we were confused.  We were shocked.  Unfortunately, we did not know where to go because the entire country was in flames.  We remained in Nyange up until June.  And it was around June ending that we fled.  We fled following the advance of the RPF that had just massacred four bishops and eight priests Gakurazo in the Kabgayi neighbouring diocese.  When we arrived in Zaire -- well, the archbishop advised us to leave Zaire.  And we went to Nairobi.  And when we got to Nairobi, we did all that we could to go to Italy.  

Unfortunately, we didn't have the necessary travel documents that would enable us to travel.  And that is the reason, wherefore, we took our Zairian passports.  And we informed our bishops about this, and they consented to our doing that.  Among the four bishops that were with me, I am the only one who is here today.  The others are living peacefully in Italy.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, in 1996 four people were arrested, people who were accused of 
having played a role in the killings of Nyange.  And as the -- and as the Defence said, there were two priests who were with me, Mr. Nturiye, Edouard, and Kayiranga, Jean-Francois Emmanuel, and 
André Labo, alias Kasongo, who was the chief mechanic, and Nkinamubanzi, Anastase, who was the caterpillar driver.
(Pages 64 to 76 by Lisa Smith)
























1645H 
THE APPELLANT (continued):
The court of first instance in Kibuye condemned the two priests for -- to death.  The caterpillar driver pleaded guilty and was condemned to a prison term -- a life prison term.  Well, these two priests were acquitted by the appeals court of Ruhengeri, as the Defence counsel said.  And I would like to quote from their ruling.  "The court of appeal of Ruhengeri establishes that those who died at the Nyange church were killed due to the negligence of the authorities, that is, the bourgmestre of Kivumu commune where Nyange church is located.  This bourgmestre was asked by the priest on the 15th of April 1994 to bring assistance to the people, and he saw 200 corpses of refugees that had been killed by the Interahamwe, but the bourgmestre left the location without having taken the measures that would have been likely to protect the refugees that had found sanctuary in the church so that they, too, shouldn't be killed.  Quite on the contrary, he went and looked for a bulldozer with which to come and bury the corpse.  The court also takes note of the fact that the priest did not have any power to stop the massacres, since the civilian and military authorities had been unable to do so, because these authorities were putting forth the argument that the events had overwhelmed them.  Consequently, it wasn't the priest who could have found a solution to this problem, in particular, by stopping the massacres."  End of quote.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I am innocent.  I am really innocent.  And my innocence was established by the 24 witnesses that are called here against those of the Prosecution.  I called 24 witnesses, including Athanase Nkinamubanzi, who was the driver of the bulldozer, and he says the following:  That on account of the situation, he was forced to accuse me, because he was forced to do so, and the transcripts of the 7th of -- the transcripts of March 2006 do say so.  He was compelled to bear false testimony against me.  He said he was tortured.  And look at the transcripts of the 6th of April 2006, which bear testimony to this.  He was forced to bear testimony against me so that the guilt of the church should be established.  The transcripts of the 10th of -- the 6th of April 2006 proved this.  The two priests who were with me gave testimony and have already demonstrated my innocence.  The ruling of the Ruhengeri court of appeal demonstrated that we, the priests, did all that we could practicably do because I did not act alone.  

I will conclude, Mr. President, Your Honours, by reminding you that in the Gospel, according to Matthew, while Jesus was being prosecuted by the -- by the -- by Caiphus two witnesses -- two false witnesses said that he declared that "I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days."  And Jesus was crucified.  And similarly, ironically, there's a witness who came here and said that I asked the -- that I asked the priest three times and he answered three times that the priests should -- that the church should be destroyed and that it will be rebuilt.  So, this is a false testimony.  This is the same thing that happened to Jesus.  He was asked three times.  He was said to have said thrice that the church should be destroyed, and this is what I'm being accused of.  

Mr. President, I would like that you use your wisdom to make sure that I am free so that the world should know that I am really innocent and that I had nothing to do with the death of all those people.  I am the one who suffered.  I saw all that you have -- you never saw.  I did all that I could do.  I suffered.  I actually feel afflicted and aggrieved and I do regret.  I am saddened.  May God guide you and may his will be done.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Seromba.  Because of the progress made by counsel on both sides, we fortunately find it unnecessary to make an order under Rule 15 bis of the rules excusing a member of the panel.  

I want to thank counsel on both sides for interesting and vigorous arguments which they have presented.  

You are not hearing, Counsel?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
I was not receiving the interpretation, Mr. President, but I can now get it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Well, then, I shall repeat on your benefit what I have just said because it is quite important.  And that is to say, on behalf of the panel, I want to thank counsel on both sides for interesting and vigorous arguments.  We shall consider them in due course.  

Meanwhile, I also want to thank the parties, and the registry staff, and the interpreters, and others who have assisted with this hearing.  

Judgement is reserved and will be given on a date to be announced in due course.  

The hearing is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1655H)
