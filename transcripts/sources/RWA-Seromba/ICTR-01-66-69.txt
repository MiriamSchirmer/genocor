MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Good morning, Witness.  

Counsel Monthé, we have planned to have a testimony of the present witness this morning.  It seems that a few problems have come up.  Would you be so kind just to tell us what the problems are since Witness PA1 arrived yesterday, and since he was supposed to start his testimony this morning?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Thank you, Madam President.  But for my explanations to be exhaustive, perhaps we should go into a closed session.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, any objection to the request made by counsel?
MR. MOSES: 
(Microphone not activated)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objection.  Thank you.  We shall now sit in closed session following a request made by 
Counsel Monthé.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 8] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
