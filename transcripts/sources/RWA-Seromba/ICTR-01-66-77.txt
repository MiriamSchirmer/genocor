MS. ARBIA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  For the Prosecutor, we have James Stewart, Jonathan Moses, Gregory, Tolulope Olowoyo and I, myself, Silvana Arbia.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Now, may we ask the Defence team to introduce its members?  
MR. MONTHÉ: 
Madam President, Your Honours, good day.  I have the honour to lead the Defence team this morning.  I am Patrice Monthé of the Canadian Bar Association, lead counsel, and my co-counsel is 
Barnadé -- Barnabé Nekuie, and the assistants, Sarah Ngo Bihegue, who is not here this morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Monthé.  

The Chamber will read its summary judgement.  This summary is not an integral part of the judgement whose written text will be provided to the parties and the public subsequently.  We believe this will be done by Friday at the very latest.  

The Accused, Athanase Seromba was born in Rutsiro commune, Kibuye préfecture in Rwanda.  He was a Roman Catholic priest and parish priest of Nyange parish.  At the time of the events referred to in the indictment, Nyange parish was situated in Nyange secteur, Kivumu commune, in Kibuye préfecture.  
The events referred to here occurred between the 6th and the 20th of April 1994.  
Accused Athanase Seromba who went into exile in Florence, Italy, handed himself into the Tribunal authorities on the 6th of February 2002, without the arrest warrant issued by the Tribunal against him having been executed by the Italian authorities, upon whom this said warrant of arrest have been served on the 10th of July 2001.  

He had his initial appearance before Judge Navanathan Pillay on the 8th of February 2002, and pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.  His trial commenced on the 20th of September 2004, and ended on the 27th of June 2006.  In the indictment of the 8th of June 2001, the Prosecutor retained four counts against Athanase Seromba:  genocide; complicity in genocide; conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity, extermination. 

The Prosecutor pleaded the criminal responsibility of the Accused pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute of the Tribunal, alleging mainly that by his positive acts, the Accused planned, incited to commit, ordered to commit, committed or in any other manner aided and abetted, the planning, preparation or execution of the offences he is charged with.  

The Chamber will, first of all, presents its factual findings in regard to the allegations contained in the indictment.  It will then present its legal findings with regard to each of the counts.  Then, the Chamber will render its verdict and determine, if need be, the sentence to be served by 
Accused  Athanase Seromba.  We shall now deal with factual findings.  

First of all, the events of the 8th to the 11th of April 1994, firstly, the search for refuge by Tutsis in public and church premises, including Nyange parish church.  In paragraph 7 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that Tutsis from the various secteurs of Kivumu commune left their homes to seek refuge in public premises and in churches, including Nyange church, in order to elude the massacres that they were targets of.  The bourgmestre and communal policemen assembled Tutsis from the various secteurs in Kivumu commune and transported them to Nyange parish.  

The Chamber finds that all witness statements, be it Prosecution or Defence witnesses, are consistent on the fact that Tutsis from Kivumu commune voluntarily sought refuge in public premises, such as the communal office or churches including Nyange church.  It, therefore, finds that it is proper to consider that this fact has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  

Regarding the allegation that Athanase Seromba handed to the bourgmestre a list of Tutsis who had to be led to the church, it is alleged in paragraphs 8, 9 and 39 of the indictment that Athanase Seromba gave the bourgmestre a list of names of persons of Tutsi origin who were not present in the church, and he did so in order that they could seek out and lead them to the parish.  And it was on the basis of that list that a Tutsi called Alexis Karake, his wife and children were led from Gakoma cellule to Nyange church.  

The Chamber notes that CBI is the only Prosecution witness who alleges that Athanase Seromba drew up and handed to the bourgmestre a list of persons of Tutsis origin to be sought out and led to the parish.  The Chamber is not convinced by the assertions of Witness CBI with regard to the possibilities he had upon his arrival at Nyange parish on the 12th of April 1994, to immediately observe the absence of the ten or so persons whose names he claims to have given to Seromba.  Indeed, Witness CBI, merely states that he observes the absence of those persons because he knew them.  He does not specify any observations he made or the means he used to take stock of the absence of those persons at Nyange church.  The Chamber is, therefore, of the view that Witness CBI is not credible with regard to the allegation that Seromba draw up a list of Tutsis.  Consequently, it is of the opinion that this allegation has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Prosecutor.  

Meeting of the 10th of April 1994, in paragraph 10 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that on or about the 10th of April 1994, several important meetings were held at Nyange parish and in the commune office, at which Athanase Seromba, Fulgence Kayishema, Gaspard Kanyarukiga and other persons unknown to the Prosecution attended.  

The Chamber notes that Prosecution Witness YAT asserted that a meeting of the parish council was held in Nyange on the 10th of April 1994 at the parish, of course.  Defence Witness FE27 does not in anyway contradict the evidence of Witness YAT, when he states that he heard the bourgmestre informing participants at the meeting of the 11th of April 1994, of the meeting that he had had with Athanase Seromba, that is, on the 10th of April 1994.  

The Chamber is of the opinion that such an encounter was, indeed, held as part of the parish council meeting held on the 10th of April 1994 referred to by Witness YAT, who was a member of the said council.  Furthermore, it is of the opinion that the details provided by Witness YAT regarding the holding of such a meeting are coherent.  Consequently, the Chamber finds that this witness is credible with regard to the holding of the parish council meeting of the 10th of April 1994.  The Chamber, nevertheless, finds that Witness YAT cannot be considered credible with regard to the holding of a second meeting on the 10th of April 1994 in Nyange church, insofar as such information which was reported is not borne by any other testimony.  

Regarding the testimony of Witness FE27, this witness did not specifically testify on the holding of the parish council meeting on the 10th of April 1994.  The Chamber finds that he is, nevertheless -- more or less, credible regarding the holding of a meeting at the parish on the 10th of April 1994, to the extent that his testimony is corroborated by the account given by Witness YAT.  

In view of the foregoing, the Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that a meeting of the parish council was held on the 10th of April 1994 at Nyange church, and that this meeting was attended by Witness YAT, Athanase Seromba, and other persons, including members of the parish council.  

Meeting of the 11th of April 1994 held at the commune office and referred to as the security meeting.  In paragraph 11 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that during that meeting or during those meetings, it was decided that gendarmes be requisitioned from Kibuye préfecture in order that they may assemble in Nyange church all Tutsis civilians from Kivumu with a view to exterminating them.  

The Prosecutor called two witnesses to testify in support of the allegation that Athanase Seromba allegedly attended the meetings of the 11th of April 1994.  These witnesses are CNJ and CDL. 
Witness CNJ gave hearsay evidence, whereas Witness CDI (sic) does not establish in his testimony that he, himself, attend the meetings of the 11th of April 1994. The Chamber does not consider him as a credible witness on this score.  

The Defence called three witnesses who testified to the fact that Seromba was not present at the meeting of the 11th of April 1994.  These are witnesses, FE13, FE27 and CF23.  Witnesses FE27 and CF23 cannot be considered as credible on this point in view of the inconsistencies between their testimonies and their prior statements.  As for Witness FE13, the Chamber considers him credible on this point on account of the positions he held in the commune, his presence at the meeting and the details he provides regarding the convening and the contents of the meeting, particularly, with regard to the reading of a letter written by Seromba.  These allegations were corroborated by Witnesses FE27 and CF23.  

In view of the foregoing, the Chamber finds that it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that a meeting referred to as security meeting was held in the commune office on the 11th of April 1994.  However, it is of the opinion that it is not established that Athanase Seromba attended that meeting.  

Regarding the arrival at Nyange church of gendarmes from Kibuye préfecture, in paragraph 37 of the indictment, it is alleged that during meetings held at Nyange parish and in the commune office as of the 10th of April 1994, the decision had been taken by the commune authorities in concert with 
Athanase Seromba to request the dispatch of gendarmes from Kibuye préfecture.  The Chamber finds that Prosecution Witness CDL and Defence Witnesses FE55, BZ1 and PA1, gave consistent testimony as to presence of gendarmes at Nyange parish at the time of the events of April 1994, even if their testimonies differ slightly as to the date of the arrival of these persons.  It, furthermore, observed that Witness FE55 testified that apart from the arrival of gendarmes and the implementation -- there was an implementation of a decision taken on the 11th of April 1994, and this was the meeting referred to as the security meeting.  The Chamber finds that such evidence is corroborated by Witnesses FE13 and CF23 in their respective testimonies.  In view of the foregoing, the Chamber finds that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that on the 11th of April 1994, gendarmes arrived at Nyange church from Kibuye préfecture.  

Events of 12th April 1994, including refugees surrounded by militiamen and Interahamwe armed with traditional and conventional weapons:  in paragraphs 12, 40 and 41 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that from the 12th of April 1994, on or about that date, the refugees were surrounded by militiamen and Interahamwe armed with traditional and conventional weapons.  The second phase of the plan consisted in keeping the refugees within the church and having it surrounded by Interahamwes and militiamen.  To this end, on or about the 12th of April 1994, the gendarmes confined the refugees in Nyange church which was surrounded by the Interahamwe and the militiamen.  

The Chamber notes that Prosecution witnesses differed in their identification of the perpetrators of the surrounding of Nyange church.  The differences noted on the identity of those who surrounded Nyange church can be explained by the fact that different vantage points may have been used by the witnesses which does not have a bearing on the substance of the events.  

The Chamber also finds that testimony by Prosecution witnesses indicates that the refugees were surrounded by militiamen and Interahamwe, which surrounding is corroborated by several Defence witnesses.  The Chamber finds that the refugees at Nyange parish were surrounded from the 
12th of April 1994.

Seromba's ban on refugees feeding from the parish banana plantation and the order he allegedly gave to gendarmes to fire at any Inyenzi who tried to obtain bananas from the parish banana plantation.  The Prosecutor alleges at paragraph 12 of the indictment, that from the 12th of April 1994, or about that date, Athanase Seromba effectively prevented witnesses from feeding themselves and order the gendarmes to shoot at any Inyenzi, that is, Tutsi trying to obtain food from the presbytery or in the parish banana plantation.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor did not present evidence in support of the allegation that Athanase Seromba forbade the Tutsi refugees from sourcing (sic) food from the presbytery.  The Chamber finds, therefore, that this event has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  

With regard to the ban on access to banana plantation, the Chamber deems Witnesss CBS a credible witness based on the description he gave of the layout and location of the banana plantaions.  Moreover, the witness' statement in cross-examination tallied with those he made in examination-in-chief.  There is also no significant contradiction between the previous statements of the witness and his testimony in Court.  To this end, the Chamber considers that the allegation of this event is not mentioned in the witness's statement of 14th February 1999.  But, however, this cannot be perceived as a contradiction to the extent that no question on this event had been put to him when he made that statement.  Moreover, the Chamber observes that this as an educated witness and that there is no reason to doubt his presence at the site as the events in question unfolded.  

Based on the forementioned, the Chamber considers that Witness CBS is credible, both on the allegation of the ban and the order issued by Seromba to the gendarmes.  The Chamber finds that Witness CBJ is equally credible on these two points.  As a matter of fact, the Chamber does not note a contradiction between prior statements by the witness and his testimony in Court.  To this -- in this regard, it finds that, although it is true that this event does not appear in the witness's 
statements -- statement of 24th June 1997 and that of the 23rd of March 1997, this can be explained by the fact no question with a bearing on this event was put to the witness when he was making his statements.  The Chamber observes the only minor contradictions were raised in relation to the number of Tutsi -- or, Hutu assailants, the number of Tutsi refugees in the church and the number of Tutsis in Kivumu commune, which were not -- or, did not tend to compromise the credibility of Witness CBJ.  

The Chamber further considers that the contradictory testimony offered by Witness FE36 does not encroach on the credibility of Witness CBJ.  No question was put to Witness CBJ on the version of events recounted by FE36.  The Chamber also notes that Witness FE36 is not a credible witness because by his own admission, he lied to the Court.  The Chamber notes that Witness FE36 asserted that CBJ said that all his family had been killed, whereas CBJ actually asserted that several members of his family died.  

With regard to Defence Witness CF23, the Chamber notes that he was not present at the site -- on the scene, rather, on the 14th of April 1994.  Moreover, it finds very unlikely the assertions of the witness that refugees had freedom of movement between the church and the banana plantation, whereas by 13th April 1994, when he claims he observed this event, the church had already been surrounded by a number of militiamen and other Interahamwe whose violent attacks in preceding days had led to the choice of the church by the refugees as a refuge from the said attacks.  From the above, the Chamber considers that Witness CF23 cannot be considered credible.  

From the aforementioned, the Chamber considers that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that on the 13th and the 14th of April 1994, Athanase Seromba prevented refugees from feeding from the banana plantation in the parish, and that, on the other hand, he ordered the gendarmes to fire at the refugees. 

Seromba's refusal to celebrate Mass for the Inyenzi:  The Prosecutor also alleges in paragraph 12 of the indictment that Athanase Seromba refused to celebrate mass for the refugees and stated that he would not say mass for the Inyenzi.  Witness CDL links this event to the 14th of April 1994.  However, he also cited this as having taking place shortly before the refugees had asked Athanase Seromba for food and before the latter refused the refugees from feeding from the banana plantation, which event, the witness places on the 14th of April 1994.  CDL's testimony tallies with that of Defence Witness PA1 which indicates that following the removal of sacred objects from the church, the refugees expressed their complaints to the priest, and asked them inter alia to give them food.  The Chamber recalls that Witnesses CBI, CBJ, CBK and PA1 report that Athanase Seromba withdrew the objects required for celebrating mass between the 10th and 13th of April 1994.  In this regard, Witness PA1 explains that the removal of the said objects took place with a view to respecting the holy sacrament.  Moreover, Witness PA1 asserts that Mass was then celebrated in one of the rooms of the presbytery.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba refused to celebrate the Mass in Nyange church during the events.  The Prosecutor has, however, fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba described the Tutsi refugees as Inyenzi when he expressed his refusal.  

Four Tutsi refugees driven away by Athanase Seromba, namely, Alex, Felécian, Gasore and Patrice from the parish, and death of one Patrice who had been refused access to the presbytery by 
Athanase Seromba.  At paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that on the 
12th of April 1994, or about that date, Athanase Seromba chased away from the parish four Tutsi employees named, Alex, Felicien, Gasore and Patrice.  Patrice was seriously wounded a few days later and attempted to return to the church, but Athanase Seromba denied him access to the presbytery.  He was killed by the Interahamwe and the militiamen.  The Prosecutor only called Witness CBK in support of this allegation.  Witness CBK reports that after the death of the president of Rwanda, four Tutsi employees of the parish, Alex, Felécien, Gasore and Patrice told him they had been suspended by Athanase Seromba and then left the church.  He explains that the four returned to the church on the 13th of April 1994 seeking refuge, but Athanase Seromba drove them away arguing that there was no refuge in the church.  Witness CBK indicates that at the time the situation was precarious.  Indeed, Witness CBK may be considered a credible witness on this score insofar as no contradiction exists between statements he made in his testimony and those he made in his prior statements.  

To counter this allegation, the Defence called Witness NA1 to testify.  The Chamber notes that 
Witness NA1 only arrived in Nyange -- or, at Nyange on the 15th of April 1994 and can, therefore, not speak to the allegations of events that took place prior to his arrival.  Then Witness NA1 expressed himself in general terms and his testimony only truly bears witness to the issue of the changes that took place in the staffing between his arrival in Nyange in 1993 and his arrival in 1994.  By his own admission, he is not in a position to identify the employees who were present upon arrival at the church.  This is, all the more, evident given that the witness says that he found militiamen and refugees and thousands of assailants at the scene.  The Chamber considers that the testimony of NA1 cannot bring into question the testimony of Witness CBK.  The Chamber finds that the Athanase Seromba chased away the four employees, including Patrice who was at the time wounded, and that the security situation in Kivumu commune was precarious.  

The meeting held at the parish office on the 12th of April 1994.  At paragraphs 38 and 43 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that on or about the 12th of April 1994, Athanase Seromba chaired a meeting held in the office of his parish which was attended inter alia by commune leaders who were to be found and taken to the church.  And, immediately after this meeting, one of them declared that Kayiranga should be found and taken to the church.  On or about the 12th of April 1994, 
Athanase Seromba chaired in the afternoon a meeting which was held with other leaders, 
Grégoire Ndahimana and Fulgence Kayishema.  

The Chamber recalls that the allegation in question is that of the holding of a meeting which was chaired by Athanase Seromba at the parish church on the 12th of April 1994.  The Chamber notes that CBJ's testimony did not bring proof that a meeting chaired by Athanase Seromba took place at the communal office on the 12th of April 1994.  It, therefore, does not consider that this event was established beyond a reasonable doubt.  

The events of the 14th to the 15th of April 1994, the attack on the Nyange church to which the Tutsi refugees put up a short-lived resistance followed by grenades held by the attackers.  In paragraph 15 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that on or about the 13th of April 1994, Interahamwe and militiamen surrounded the church and attacked the refugees who were within it.  The refugees defended themselves by driving the attackers outside the church and making them retreat up to the stature of the Blessed Virgin.  The attackers launched a grenade which resulted in several casualties amongst the refugees.  

The Chamber notes that the Prosecution witness and those of the Defence confirms that in the morning of the 15th of April 1994, an attack was launched against the Tutsi refugees, to which the refugees put up a fierce resistance, and that, subsequently, the attackers used grenades which resulted in the death of several refugees.  It, therefore, finds that this fact has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  
The order issued by Athanase Seromba to lock all doors of the church, leaving outside about 30 refugees at the mercy of the assailants, the Prosecutor also alleges in paragraph 15 of the indictment, that the survivors quickly tried to return to the church, but Athanase Seromba ordered that all doors be locked leaving outside several refugees, about 30, in order that they be killed.  The Prosecutor stated that these events occurred on or about the 13th of April 1994, in the indictment and on the date of the 14th of April and his pretrial brief.  

Witness CBJ testified that Athanase Seromba locked the doors of the church in the evening of the 
14th of April 1994 and that he opened the doors on the 15th of April 1994.  There is no mention made of refugees who died because of that act.  Furthermore, he states that the attack occurred on the 
15th of April 1994, the refugees locked themselves up in the church.  Witness CNJ, CBK BZ14, FE34, FE36, BZ4 and BZ14, all testified that the refugees had locked themselves up in the church.  No witness testified that Athanase Seromba locked the church -- the church doors following the attack by the assailants.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused Athanase Seromba locked the doors of the church in order to cause the death of the refugees. 

Meetings held between Athanase Seromba, Kayiranga, Fulgence, Kayishema, 
Gaspard Kanyarukiga and other persons unknown to the Prosecutor:  The Chamber notes that the Prosecutor called Witnesses CBI, CBJ, CBR and CBK to support this allegation contained in paragraph 18, according to which there were conversations between Athanase Seromba, Kayiranga,
 Fulgence Kayishemama, Gaspard Kanyarukiga, and other persons unknown to the Prosecutor, the Chamber finds that the testimonies are -- that their testimonies are credible in that they contained consistent evidence.  

The Defence calls Witnesses PA1, BZ3 to refute the Prosecution's evidence.  In his testimony before the Chamber, Witness PAI (sic) insisted on the fact that no meeting was held at the presbytery between 
Athanase Seromba and some communal authorities.  The Chambers notes that Witness PA1 testified in his country of origin with regard to events at Nyange church and the role of Athanase Seromba in the Rogatory -- during the Rogatory commission on the 8th of October 2003.  

Witness PAY (sic) stated explicitly that he was not always with Athanase Seromba, in answer to the question whether those persons never came to the presbytery without his knowledge, Witness PA1 answered that, "It was possible that they came without my knowledge because I was in hiding, and I was not always outside the room to see what was happening."  The Chambers notes that Witness PA1 was not always in the company of Athanase Seromba, and that he, himself, admits that no one could have come to the presbytery without his being aware of it.  The Chamber is of the opinion that the assertions of Witness PA1 on the holding of the meeting was vague and unreliable.  The Chamber finds that there were meetings between Seromba and some commune authorities.  It also finds that the Prosecutor neither presented evidence regarding any consultation between the persons present at that location and Seromba, nor does the Prosecution adduce any evidence with regard to the purpose of the that meeting.  

Meeting of the 15th of April 1994 in paragraph 16 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that on or about the 14th of April 1994, in the afternoon, Father Seromba met with Fulgence Kayishema and Gaspard Kanyarukiga in the parish office.  Shortly, thereafter, Fulgence Kayishema went to fetch fuel on board one of the official vehicles of Kivumu commune.  This fuel was used by the Interahamwe and militiamen to burn down the church, while the gendarmes and communal policemen were throwing grenades.  

The Chamber finds that the testimonies of Witnesses CBJ, CBK, CBN and CBS are consistent as to the presence of certain authorities who came to meet Athanase Seromba at Nyange parish on the 
14th of April 1994.  It, however, finds that the Prosecutor has not proven that this was a meeting convened by Athanase Seromba and the said authorities.  The Chamber is of the opinion that it is rather with regard to an informal meeting whose link with the fact that Kayishema had gone to fetch fuel has not been established.  The Chamber -- the Prosecutor did not lead evidence with regard to the subject of the said meeting.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that a meeting was held between certain communal authorities and 
Athanase Seromba on the 14th of April 1994, regarding the order issued by Athanase Seromba to Interahamwe and militiamen to attack refugees.  

It is stated in paragraph 19 of the indictment that the Prosecutor wanted to establish that 
Athanase Seromba issued orders to Interahamwe and militiamen to attack the refugees.  The Chamber finds that all evidence adduced by the Prosecution, in support of such an allegation, save for the statements of Witness YAU, incriminates other communal authorities and not Athanase Seromba who was not in a position to issue orders to Interahamwe and militiamen.  The Chamber is of the opinion that Witness YAU is the only witness who corroborated such allegations on -- with regard to the attack, and that no other witness gave such evidence.  The Chamber notes that there were no circumstances under which that witness could have heard Athanase Seromba uttering the words attributed to him.  The Chamber is of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt regarding the truthfulness of the allegations made by Witness YAU.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba ordered Interahamwe and militiamen to attack the refugees, attacks launched against refugees by Interahamwe and militiamen assisted by gendarmes and communal policemen and the attempt to burn down Nyange church by the Interahamwe and militiamen.  

The Chamber respectively finds that in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that attacks were made against refugees by Interahamwe and militiamen, assisted by gendarmes and communal policemen, and that they tried to burn down Nyange church on the 15th of April 1994.  The Chamber finds that the testimonies of Prosecution witnesses are consistent and credible on this point.  The Chambers finds that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that on the 
15th of April 1994, the Interahamwe and militiamen assisted by gendarmes and communal policemen attacked Tutsis refugees and tried to burn down Nyange church.  

Supervision of attacks by Athanase Seromba and commune authorities.  The Prosecutor submits in paragraphs 25 and 46 of the indictment that Athanase Seromba supervised the attacks of the 
15th of April 1994.  The Chamber is of the opinion that only the testimonies of CDL can be considered as having corroborated the Prosecution's allegation that Athanase Seromba supervised the attacks of the 15th of April 1994.  However, the Chamber finds that this testimony is hearsay and, therefore, his -- the witnesses's assertions that Seromba advised the assailants to attack the refugees in the church and allegedly told them to pick up the bodies and to resume the killings cannot be considered as credible.  

In view of the foregoing, the Chamber is of the view that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba supervised the attacks of the 15th of April 1994 at Nyange parish.  The Chamber finds that it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that on the 
15th of April 1994, Athanase Seromba asked the assailants who were preparing to attack the refugees who had sought refuge in the courtyard of the presbytery to stop the killings and to pick up the bodies that littered the church premises.  The Chamber also finds that the attacks against the Tutsi refugees resumed after the bodies had been picked up.  

Regarding the deaths of several Tutsis, including the teacher called Gatare, as well as the death of Alexia Meriam, two Tutsi refugee women.  In paragraphs 21 and 22 of the indictment, the Prosecutor charges Athanase Seromba with having handed over to the gendarmes, Gatare, who had sought refuge in the church, that he was killed immediately.  This fact allegedly spurred on the assailants.  During those attacks the refugees left the church to go to the presbytery, Athanase Seromba found them and went to inform the gendarmes of their places of hiding, and they were subsequently attacked and killed.  The victims included Alexia and Meriam, two Tutsi women.  

The Chamber observed that Witnesses CBT, CBJ, BJ2 and CB55 confirm the death of the Tutsi women and Anicet Gatare.  Witness FE -- BZ1 and 31 confirm the death of Gatare.  The Chamber finds that no witness testified to the death of Alexia.  The Chamber, therefore, is of the view that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that Meriam and Anicet Gatare were murdered.  Regarding the murder of Anicet Gatare, the Chamber finds that CBT and CBJ's testimonies are not consistent with regard to the death of the latter.  The Chamber, therefore, finds that the witness -- the testimonies of CBK, BZ1 and SE31 are credible.  These testimonies were to the effect that Anicet Gatare were killed by a gendarme who received money in order to kill him by gunshots, not allowed him to be hacked to death by machetes.  

As regard the death of Meriam, the Chamber is of the opinion that CBJ's testimony is credible, that 
Athanase Seromba turned back several refugees and that they were subsequently killed by the assailants.  The Chamber finds CBJ's testimony credible.  It observed that Witness CBK gave consistent details regarding the circumstances surrounding Meriam's death.  

In view of the foregoing, the Chambers finds that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba handed over Anicet Gatare to the gendarmes.  The Chamber, however, find that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Seromba turned back several refugees from the presbytery, including Meriam.   

The events of the 16th April 1994 at Nyange parish, the presence of a bulldozer in the church courtyard:  The Prosecutor alleges in paragraph 23 of the indictment that several refugees were killed during those attacks.  A bulldozer was used by three employees of Astaldi Company, Mitima, Maurice and Flambeau, to remove the numerous bodies of victims that lay in the church.  The Chamber recalls that 13 witnesses testified that they saw a bulldozer in -- on the premises of Nyange church, whereas several others talked about the presence of two bulldozers.  The Chamber is of the view that the disparities in the testimonies of the various witnesses is due to the difficulties they had in making the distinction between the nature of the vehicles on the church premises.  It, however, finds that none of the parties disputed the presence of a bulldozer on the church premises.  The Chamber is of the opinion that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that a bulldozer was present at Nyange church for purposes of picking up bodies.  

The order given by Athanase Seromba to destroy the church in paragraphs 26 and 27 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that Athanase Seromba ordered the driver, Athanase, alias 2000, to demolish the Nyange church.  He refused to destroy the church.  Immediately after, Védaste Mupende, 
Fulgence Kayishema and Grégoire Ndahimana asked Athanase Seromba to intervene and he came and ordered Athanase, alias 2000, to destroy the church by saying that the Hutus were many and they could rebuild another.  

From the aforementioned elements, the Chamber finds that the witnesses called by the Prosecutor in support of his allegations, namely, CBJ, CBK, CNJ, CDL and CBR, that none of them directly accuses Athanase Seromba of ordering the destruction of Nyange church.  Witness CBJ of the Prosecution made mentioned of a meeting held on the 16th of April 1994 between Athanase Seromba, Kanyarukiga, Kayishema, Ndungutse, Habyambere, Gashugi and other persons.  Witness CBK recounts that a meeting was held in the morning of the 16th of April 1994, and that it was attended by 
Athanase Seromba, Kayishema, Ndahimana, Kanyarukiga and other persons.  During this meeting, Kayishema allegedly said there was a need to destroy the church tower in order to kill Tutsi intellectuals who were within it.  Witness CDL maintains that a conversation took place between Athanase Seromba, Kayishema, Ndahimana, Kanyarukiga, Habarugira and other persons, during which meeting 
Athanase Seromba apparently accepted the decision to destroy the church.  The Chamber finds that the testimonies of these witnesses is credible.  

Witness CBK stated that FE32 who received the order from the authorities to destroy the church, asked 
Athanase Seromba to confirm the order.  He maintains that Athanase Seromba said to FE32 that the church should be destroyed.  Athanase Seromba answered in the affirmative and indicated that -- to Witness FE32, that there were demons in the church and that the Hutus were in a position to rebuild it.  The Chamber finds this testimony to credible.  Moreover, Witness CDL recounts that 
Athanase Seromba gave instructions -- or, information to the bulldozer driver on the weak side of the church.  This conversation also constitutes a form of moral support that the Accused brought to the attackers.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba met with some communal authorities, that he spoke to the bulldozer driver and encouraged him to destroy the church, and that he gave instructions to the bulldozer driver on the weak points of Nyange church.  

Destruction of Nyange church with a bulldozer leading to the deaths of more than a thousand people inside it.  In paragraph 28 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that using a bulldozer, Athanase demolished the church and that its roof collapsed, thus killing more than 2000 Tutsis who were gathered within it.  The few survivors left were attacked by the Interahamwe who sought to finish them off.  The Chamber finds that the testimony of Prosecution and Defence witnesses is consistent to the effect that the Nyange church was destroyed on the 16th of April 1994. The Chamber, therefore, also finds that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Nyange church was destroyed on that day.  In its conclusions, the Chamber would like to recall its finding that Nyange church could hold up to -- or, at least, 1,500 persons.  Several pieces of evidence have demonstrated that about 1,500 people were killed following the demolition of the church and the collapse of its tower.  The Chamber concludes that the demolition of Nyange church led to the death of at least 1,500 persons.  

The order issued by Athanase Seromba to bury the corpses in the mass graves.  In paragraph 29 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that on or about the 15th of April 1994, following the destruction of the church, the authorities held a meeting in the parish.  Shortly after, Father Seromba ordered the Interahamwe to clear out the field.  The corpses of the victims were buried in mass graves. 

It appears from Witness FE35 testimony that Kayishema was in the company of Ndahimana when he gave that order.  Witness FE32, who was the driver of one of the church bulldozers, stated 
Athanase Rushema, Ndungutse and Védaste Murangwabugabo allegedly gave him that instruction.  The Chamber finds that the bodies of the victims were buried in mass graves after the destruction of Nyange church, but that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Athanase Seromba gave the order to bury them.  

Seromba united with the authorities after the destruction of the church.  In paragraph 47 of the indictment, it is alleged that after the destruction -- complete destruction of the church, 
Father Athanase Seromba met Fulgence Kayisheman, Gregoire Ndahimana, Gaspard Kanyarukiga and the drivers of the bulldozer, and that he sat to take beer with them.  

Witness FE32, one of the bulldozer drivers of the bulldozer that destroyed the Nyange church, declared that he did not see Athanase Seromba drinking and rejoicing after the destruction of the church.  He considers this to be impossible.  He also considered it impossible that he received beer from 
Father Seromba.  

Witness PA1 said it was impossible that Father Seromba rewarded those who destroyed the church with beer.  Witness PA1 added that he had seen no one thanked Seromba for destroying the church and he found this unthinkable.  The Chambers feels that CBK's testimony is not reliable on this score.  The witness is the only witness to assert that Father Seromba displayed such conduct after the church was destroyed.  And, therefore, the Chamber considers there is reasonable doubt as to the veracity of CBK's account.  From the aforementioned, the Chamber finds that the Prosecutor (sic) has, indeed, 
not -- did not meet certain communal authorities and the bulldozer drivers to drink beer with him.  

We are now coming to the legal findings.  With regard to the mode of participation of 
Accused Athanase Seromba in crimes with which he is charged, the Chamber considers on the basis of factual findings that criminal responsibility of Athanase Seromba can only be envisaged for his participation in aiding and abetting the offences he may be found guilty of.  The Chamber finds the Prosecutor did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Seromba planned or committed the crimes he is charged with.  

With regard to the participation by inciting or giving orders, the Prosecutor has not established that Seromba had the genocidal intent required to establish this allegation.  More specifically, with regard to the facts and orders, the Chambers finds that the Prosecutor has not established that 
Athanase Seromba exercised effective control over the main perpetrators of the crimes.  

On Count 1, genocide, with regard to its factual findings, the Chamber considers that the Chamber has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba planned or ordered the massacres against the Tutsi refugees in Nyange.  However, the Chambers finds that he, by his acts and gestures on the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th of April 1994, aided and abetted the commission -- perpetration of murders against Tutsis who had taken refuge in Nyange church as referred to in the indictment.   

Serious bodily or mental harm caused to members of the Tutsi ethnic group.  With regard to the serious bodily or mental harm caused to Tutsi, the Chamber finds that Father Athanase Seromba's refusal to allow the Tutsis to take food from the banana plantation and the presbytery helped and encouraged the perpetration of actions that caused serious bodily and mental harm to Tutsis who had sought refuge in Nyange church.  The Tutsis were vulnerable given that previously they had been the targets of numerous attacks.  To this, must be added the fact that the place of refuge at Nyange church was to be considered one, and that they were supposed to be protected from these attacks, once they have been surrounded by the militiamen and Interahamwe from the 12th of April 1994.  It is, therefore, apparent that the refugees in Nyange church lived in constant anguish knowing their lives and those of their loved ones were in danger at any moment.

The Chamber also finds that the ban imposed by Athanase Seromba on refugees in order for them to take food from the banana plantation caused physical -- bodily harm to the refugees.  As a matter of fact, on the 14th of April the refugees lacked food and have very limited access to foodstuff outside the area of the church surrounded.  In such circumstances, the refusal by Athanase Seromba to grant them food from the banana plantation led to the refugees being weakened physically and deprived of food.  The Chamber finds that Athanase Seromba must have been known that banning the refugees from getting food from the banana plantation, his refusal to celebrate Mass for them and driving away of Tutsis refugees would have a negative impact on the morale of the refugees who face a difficult situation in relation to the persecutions that they have been a target of since the start of the events in April 1994.  The Chamber is also convinced that Athanase Seromba knew that the refugees needed food.  It, therefore, finds that he was fully aware that his refusal to allow the refugees to take food from the banana plantation would substantially contribute to physically weakening them.  From the aforementioned, the Chamber finds that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt the 
mens rea of the assistance in committing serious bodily and mental harm to the refugees in Nyange church.  
Murders of a group of Tutsis:  The Chamber finds that Athanase Seromba drove away Tutsi employees of Nyange parish which then led to the murders of Patrice and Meriam who had sought refuge in that church.  The Chamber finds that Athanase Seromba asked the attackers who were getting ready to attack the Tutsis who were in the courtyard of the presbytery to stop the killings and to gather the bodies that were strewn about the courtyard.  The Chamber also finds that Seromba in relation to these attacks, that these attacks took place after the bodies had been gathered.  And it finds that it has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that this request constituted encouragement of murders of Tutsis.  

The Chamber also concludes that Athanase Seromba spoke to communal authorities and accepted the decision taken by those authorities to destroy the church.  It also finds that Seromba also spoke to the bulldozer drivers and encouraged them to destroy the church.  Finally, the Chamber finds that Seromba gave instructions on which points of the church were weak.  The Chambers finds that by his conduct, Athanase Seromba contributed to the destruction of the church, which destruction led to the deaths of more than 1,500 refugees, given the security situation prevailing in the commune at that time and, in particular, Patrice's wounds.  Athanase Seromba could not have been ignorant of the fact that by driving away the refugees he was contributing to their deaths.  The Chamber finds that these remarks or comments must have reinforced the communal authorities and the bulldozer drivers in their intent.  

With regard to the decision taken by the authorities to destroy the Nyange church, it is found that such a decision substantially contributed to destroying the church and killing the refugees who had gathered there.  

Elements of genocide:  The Chamber also considers that it cannot be disputed that during the events of April 1994 at Nyange church, attackers and other Interahamwe militiamen committed murders against Tutsi refugees in Nyange church and caused serious bodily and mental harm to them, based on their ethnicity, with the intent of destroying them in whole or in part as an ethnic group.  

The Chamber finds that in his capacity as the parish priest of Nyange, during the events of April 1994 based on the situation prevailing throughout the territory of Rwanda and the words he had spoken himself, the Accused Athanase Seromba must have been known of the intent of the attackers and Interahamwe militiamen to commit acts of genocide against the Tutsi refugees in the parish.  

Therefore, the Chamber considers it has been established that Athanase Seromba was involved in the crime of genocide in Count 1.  Count 2, which is alternative to count 1, having found the Accused guilty of genocide of the first count, the Chamber will not retain the count of complicity in genocide and, therefore, dismisses it as such.  
Count 3, conspiracy to commit genocide.  In the indictment, the Prosecutor's plea starts, "There was a plan in three phases to exterminate the Tutsis in Kivumu commune."  Seromba is also charged with drawing up a list of Tutsis to be sought out.  He is also charged with forbidding the refugees to forage for food in the presbytery and in the banana plantation and the refusal to say Mass and supervise -- with supervision of massacres of refugees.  

Conspiracy is defined as "A resolve to act agreed to by, at least, two persons with a view to committing genocide."  Thus the essential ingredient of the offence of conspiracy with a view to commit genocide, consists of the conspiracy in itself and the process of conspiracy and not its result.  

In its factual findings the Chamber found that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba did not participate in the meetings at -- with the communal authorities on the 11th and 12th of April 1994.  The Chamber has also found that it is established -- it has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused Athanase Seromba did not hold meetings with communal authorities on the 10th, 15th and 16th of April 1994.  The Chamber, therefore, finds that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that Athanase Seromba drew up a list of Tutsis to be sought out.  

And, lastly, he supervised the attacks against the refugees on the 15th of april 1994.  And, lastly, he ordered the destruction of Nyange church on the 16th of April 1994.  With regard to the charges against 
Athanase Seromba, that he forbid the refugees to forage for food in the banana plantation.  That he refused to say mass, the Chamber considers that -- that it do not -- they do not, in themselves, suffice to establish the existence of a conspiracy to commit genocide.  The Chamber finds that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a conspiracy between persons to commit genocide as pleaded in Count 3 of the indictment.  

Count 4, crimes against humanity, extermination.  The Chambers finds that it has not been established -- the Chamber finds that it's established that a large number of Tutsis sought refuge at the church and that it was surrounded on the 12th of April 1994.  The Chamber has also found that the refugees -- the Tutsi refugees at the church of Nyange repelled the attack launched on the 15th of April 1994, subsequently, grenades were used against the refugees in the church.  However, the Chamber found that the Prosecutor has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the -- Father Seromba ordered the locking of the church in order that the Tutsi refugees should be killed.  Thus the Chamber does not find the Accused Athanase Seromba individually responsible for shutting doors of the church and thereby causing the deaths of the Tutsis.  

Furthermore, the Chamber finds that Seromba met Kanyarukiga, Kayishema, Ndungutse, Habyambere, Ndahimana, Gashugi and others during discussions.  The Chamber also finds that Athanase Seromba spoke to the driver of the bulldozer, FE32, and verbally encouraged him to destroy the church.  

Lastly, the Chamber finds that Athanase Seromba even issued instructions to the driver of the bulldozer indicating the part of the church to be demolished and when the demolition should start.  The Chamber is of the opinion that the destruction of the church, having caused the deaths of 1,500 Tutsi refugees, constitutes a crime of extermination under Article 3 of the Statute.  

The Chamber concludes that Athanase Seromba aided and abetted orally the assailants in obtaining the bulldozer and that he assisted in the destruction of the church, and that such aiding and abetting contributed, substantially, to the commission of the crime of extermination.  Consequently, it considers it has been established that the actus reus for aiding and abetting in the destruction of the church and causing the killing of the Tutsis.  

The mens rea.  The Chamber is of the opinion that Anastase -- Athanase Seromba was aware that the support he gave, the decision to demolish the church by the communal authorities and the words of encouragement to the driver of the bulldozer contributed substantially to the destruction of the church and the killing of the Tutsi refugees.  

In his capacity as parish priest during the events of April 1994, Athanase Seromba could not have been unaware that his words and acts would lend moral support and approval for the attitude of the assailants.  Thus, by adopting such an attitude and having been perfectly aware of the consequence on the refugees, Athanase Seromba should have aided -- aided and abetted the destruction of Nyange church.  

The Chamber is of the opinion that the conditions obtained for the commission of the crime -- crimes against humanity, the Chamber has -- has established that in April 1994, in Kivumu commune, attacks were committed against Tutsis, the attack ended with the destruction of the church of Nyange on the 
16th of April 1994, and there was generalised and widespread attack against the Tutsis.  The Chamber finds that the Accused Athanase Seromba committed the crimes against humanity, extermination, as pleaded in count 4 of the indictment.  

We would request Father Athanase Seromba to rise and to stand opposite the Bench, and the Chamber will now hand down its verdict. 

The Chamber finds Athanase Seromba on Count 1, genocide under Article 2(A) and (B) of the Statute guilty.  
On Count 2, complicity in genocide under Article 2(3)(E) of the Statute, charge dismissed.  

On Count 3, conspiracy to commit genocide, Article 2(3)(B) of the Statute, not guilty.  

On Count 4, crime against humanity, extermination, under Article 3(B) of the Statute, guilty.  

And having concluded that Athanase Seromba is guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity by aiding and abetting, the Chamber finds the following sentence appropriate for him.  

The Prosecutor exhorted the Chamber to hand down a verdict against Athanase Seromba concurrently, asking for life imprisonment for each of the counts for which he has been found guilty.  It is also important that various aggravating circumstances be taken into account in determining the sentence.  

The Defence, on the other hand, finds that he was respected by parishioners, both Hutus and Tutsis, in Nyange prior to the events from the 6th of April 1994.  It calls that the Accused be acquitted of all the counts against him.  

The Chamber has considered the general practice in the Tribunal and Rwanda in determining sentences.  It finds that life imprisonment is usually reserved for those who held positions of authority and planned and ordered atrocities to be committed -- or, for crimes to be committed with particular zeal and sadism.  The Chamber has retained as an aggravating circumstance, first of all, the status of the Accused as a Catholic priest who was a parish priest in Nyange at the time of the events referred to in the indictment.  The Accused was known and respected in the Catholic community of Nyange.  

It recalls that it has been established that several Tutsis in Kuvumu commune sought refuge in 
Nyange church so as to elude attacks.  The Chamber considers it an aggravating circumstance that the Accused did absolutely nothing apparently to deserve the trust of the persons who felt their lives would be save by seeking refuge at Nyange parish.  Thereafter, the Accused's flight under false identity following the destruction of the church, whereas other priests who were present at Nyange parish during April 1994, did not adopt such a strategy, is also noted.  

As a mitigating circumstance, the Chamber has noted that Athanase Seromba had a good reputation prior to the events of April 1994, and the fact that he voluntarily handed himself into the 
Tribunal authorities on the 6th of February 2002.  It is also noted he was relatively young at the time of the events and the possibility for rehabilitation.  

In assessing the sentence to be imposed on Athanase Seromba, the Chamber has taken note of the general scale for imprisonment sentences as applied in Rwandan courts.  The Chamber also recalls that pursuant to Rule 101(C) of the Rules, it does have discretionary power to determine whether the sentences it hands down are to be served consecutively or concurrently.  

Now, we will hand down the sentence, and we ask you to kindly rise, Father Seromba.  

For these reasons, the Chamber in public hearing, having heard both parties at first instance, pursuant to the statute and Rules of Procedure and Evidence, having considered all the evidence and submissions of the parties, having found you guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, extermination, sentences you to a single term of 15 years imprisonment, and determines that this sentence should immediately be put into effect pursuant to Rule 101(D) of the Rules.  

You are entitled to calculate this custody as from the date of your surrender on the 6th of February 2002, as well as any other periods spent in detention whilst awaiting an appeals judgement, and that this be deducted from the length of the sentence.  

Rules that -- pursuant to Rule 103 of the Rules, you shall remain in the custody of the Tribunal until measures necessary for your transfer to the state where you will serve your sentence are taken.  

Thank you, all.  We may now rise.  
(Court adjourned at 1341H)
