P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is called to order.  

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 

This morning, we have to hear Witness PA1.  

Good morning, Witness PA1.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you state if you want to testify in open session.  
THE WITNESS:
No, I will be testifying in closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, closed session is something different.  We will subsequently be asking Defence counsel to speak, whether you will be testifying in closed session, because normal procedure requires that we meet in open session.  It would necessarily need justification for us to sit in closed session.  You will be testifying without being seen by the public.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So, Witness, you are a Defence witness.  And since you have decided to testify in the open, you will be Witness PA1.  So you need to be careful in your answering of questions so that your identity is not disclosed.  You should also not give any information that might reveal your identity.  Before giving your evidence-in-chief, we will ask you, first, to make a formal -- or, a solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness PA1 in French) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness PA1, for making that solemn declaration.  

Defence is now allowed to proceed with the examination-in-chief if the other party has nothing -- or, objection to it at this juncture.  I see no problem on the part of the Prosecutor.  

Counsel Monthé, please proceed.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before raising the problem I might have, already referred to by the witness, I need to deal with his identity before proceeding.  Can I ask your Trial Chamber, Madam President, to ask the registry to come up to me so that I can show to Witness PA1, here present, documents in my possession.  
WITNESS PA1,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MONTHÉ:
Q.	Good morning, Witness PA1.  
A.	Good morning, sir.  
Q.	Witness PA1, do you have a document before you entitled "personal identification sheet" and bearing particulars connected with your identity?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Witness PA1, could you tell the Court whether the information appearing on the sheet are reflective of your identity?
A.	What appears on the identification sheet is accurate. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MONTHÉ:
Madam President, Your Honours, Witness PA1 has just confirmed his identity as they appear in the personal identification sheet.  I, therefore, request that the sheet be admitted, if there is no objection, as Defence Exhibit D. 89, if we are correct.  I am told by the registry that I am in order there.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, any objection?  I see none from the Prosecutor.  

The document entitled "personal identification sheet" of Witness PA1 is admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 89, placed under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 89 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MONTHÉ:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Before I start with my discussions this morning with PA1, as he, himself, did say since yesterday -- he would prefer that we work in closed session.  And he has made that request again.  I don't want to engage in polemics because there has been enough of it.  I believe the criteria for closed session are connected with the protection of the identity of the witness and in the interest of justice.  If the witness comes here of his own volition to work for the demonstration of the truth and proves to -- and here has expressed enormous fear for his security, I think there should be -- there should not be any endless debate on this matter.  And, on our side, we say it free of any polemics.  And we wanted to say so before the Court this morning.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, any objection?  Thank you.  

Now, we'll sit in closed session to ensure the protection of the witness in the interest of justice.  Sorry, I had said public -- "open", sorry, and I intended to say "closed session". 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 71] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
