MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We note that the parties are present; however, the Accused and Counsel Monthé are not in this courtroom.  In view of the fact we have received the decision of the bureau dismissing the motion for the disqualification of the Judges of this Trial Chamber, we've decided to resume proceedings and, in particular, to hear Witness PS2 from South Africa.

All arrangements have been made and it would be possible for him to be heard this morning, so we expect, and he is expecting us, to proceed with this hearing.  I shall now ask mister -- Counsel Nekuie, for the Defence, to speak.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.

Madam President, I am here now, not to proceed with the examination of Witness PS2, but out of respect, as dictated by law, that the Defence owes your Court, and in compliance with that, I would like to make the statement that the Defence wishes to submit to you -- the intention, Madam President, is to inform you -- the latest instructions I have received from my client were that I had to meet with him, consult with him, to consider what action to take - or, reaction to adopt with respect to the decision of the bureau.

The Defence thought that the decision was going to be handed yesterday, and it noted that that was not the case, and it was this morning, while I was trying to go meet my client, that I heard, less than 20 minutes ago, that we have been served the said decision.  So I rushed up here because I was also told that the Trial Chamber was waiting for the Defence to proceed with examination of Witness PS2.

But the Trial Chamber had not formally convened this meeting prior to the decision of the bureau.  Since that decision was served on us this morning, less than 20 minutes ago, the decision (sic) is of the view, Madam President, that it is but proper that after the submission of that decision a notice would be served on all the parties by your Trial Chamber, that there would be this meeting -- this session because -- you will recall, Madam President, that while adjourning, after the motion for disqualification of this Bench was filed by the Defence, it was stated, indeed, that the Trial Chamber session was postponed sine die, indefinitely.  So no summons had been issued, as it were, for a proper resumption of the Trial Chamber.

Clearly, we are assigned by the instant Court to guarantee the defence of the Accused.  We derive our assignment from the mandate assigned to us -- or, given to us by the client, and the most recent instructions I have received from my client is to meet with him, consult with him, so I stress to him what our reaction would be with respect to the decision that has been handed down, whether it is subject to appeal, even if not expressly stated.  So, Madam President, the position of the Defence this morning is to inform your hallowed precinct or Court, respectfully, that is cannot go beyond the mandate conferred on it by the Accused.  It has to consult with the Accused so as to obtain his final position with respect to the notice the bureau just served on us.  That is what I had to say this morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the Prosecution intend to respond to that statement by Mr. Nekuie?
MR. MOSES:
Only to say, Your Honours, that we have no objection with counsel meeting to briefly discuss and advise the Accused of the decision of the bureau.  However, the Prosecution's submission is that any adjournment should be an extremely brief one till later this morning.

The only decision for the Accused to take is whether he wishes to have this next witness heard.  He has been, apparently, made -- advised by fax of the decision.  It's been sent to UNDF.  He has chosen not to turn up this morning.  If he was here this morning, he could have met with the counsel at court to discuss; but having said that, Your Honours, in principle, we don't oppose a brief adjournment for counsel to discuss.

It should be clear that our position will be, and it should come as no surprise to my learned friend, that if the Accused decides that he does not wish to have this witness heard today, later this morning, and he chooses to play no further part in the trial, we will be submitting that the Defence have in fact closed their case and we will simply be asking Your Honours to set a date for closing submissions.  That will be our position should the Accused make the decision not to have this witness heard today, and if he chooses of his own free will not to play any further part in the trial.  So our submission, Your Honours, once again, is a brief adjournment for counsel to discuss with his client the decision and the consequences of any decision he takes, flowing from the bureau's decision.

Thank you, Your Honours.
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I would like to provide a slight rejoinder to what the Prosecutor just said.  I would request that your Court inform the Prosecutor that the schedule -- or, work schedule or the time required for such work should not be assigned or determined by our friends on the other side.  That's the slight comment I wanted to make.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Even though the decision of the bureau was rendered since yesterday, because it is dated 25th of April 2006, and there was an attempt, futile it turned out to be since then, we shall grant some time to the Defence to enable Counsel Nekuie to consult with the Accused.

We will, therefore, resume this session at 11:30 a.m. so as to be informed of the position of the Defence and the Accused.  We adjourn until 11:30 a.m.

We ask that contact be made with South Africa to ask them to be patient for some moments.
(Court recessed at 0950H)

(Court resumed at 1156H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court now resumes.  

Counsel Nekuie, I assume that you have consulted your client counsel (sic) Seromba, so you may now speak.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Now, thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, Your Honours, indeed, I did discuss the decision of the bureau with the client, Athanase Seromba, and he gave me instructions.  And he directed me to lodge an appeal against the decision of the bureau and to refrain from engaging in any further proceedings until a decision is made with respect to the appeal.  I immediately implemented that -- those instructions.  I did file an appeal and I have a copy, an unofficial one.  And the official document will be served on all the parties without further delay.  And that's the submission I wanted to make before your Court in connection with the problem between the Bench -- or, the Trial Chamber and our client.  That is all I had to say.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you may speak.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, the fact that the Accused has chosen to appeal the bureau's decision has no reason whatsoever to delay these proceedings.  Your Honours, it is the Prosecutor's submission that we're all here.  We're ready to proceed.  The Defence have, in fact, two representatives present in South Africa.  They were, in fact, there at nine o'clock this morning and they are there now.  

In terms of the directives for counsel, I would refer Your Honours to Article 20 of the directives.  We don't appear to have and we've had no comment from Mr. Nekuie where lead counsel is.  We don't know where he is.  But, in any event, Article 20 makes it quite clear that E(1), that if counsel is not available, co-counsel shall assume responsibility of carrying on the proceedings.  That's Article 20 of the directives for counsel.  

Article 15(E), which is headed "Scope of the assignment" says, "Under the authority of lead counsel who has primary responsibility for the defence, co-counsel may deal with all stages of the procedure in all matters arising out of representation of the Accused or of the conduct of his defence."  

And, in fact, we've heard, haven't we, Your Honours, just now that co-counsel has, in fact, lodged an appeal on behalf of his client.  

So, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's submission that the Accused is represented by counsel.  The Accused doesn't have to be present for the continuation for the trial.  And there are many occasions Your Honours will be aware of where Accused have boycotted their trials.  In fact, in a couple of occasions they have boycotted the entire trial, which is their right to do so, and they have been continued to be represented by counsel.  It is the Prosecution's submission that co-counsel is present.  We have a witness waiting to testify.  Your Honours will, of course, be aware that the reason for -- of the application on Monday was that the Accused wanted to testify after having -- the Trial Chamber has heard Witness PS2.  Through one way or another, that desire has now been achieved.  We have PS2 here ready and waiting to have their (sic) evidence heard.  We have counsel here able to represent the Accused in his absence.  And in the Prosecution's submission, the matter should proceed with the hearing of the evidence of Witness PS2 now in the absence of the Accused.  

The fact of lodging an appeal does not amount to a stay of proceedings.  And the Prosecution's submission is that we simply proceed with the evidence of Witness PS2.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, thank you.  

Do you have any further comments to make, Counsel Nekuie, or you just stand by what you just said?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Obviously, I have a number of comments with respect to the reply of the Prosecutor.  He could have refrained from referring to all those instruments known to everyone.  

The co-counsel for Father Seromba, that I am -- I am fully aware of my responsibility.  That is what I am doing this morning.  I don't expect to be directed by the Prosecutor in that regard.  I quite respectfully, Madam President, report to you on what the Defence intends to do this morning.  Fully aware of its responsibility.  I think we don't need to speculate on whether the proceedings should be stayed or not.  All legal traditions across the world do say that when a motion or disqualification is initiated or instituted against a judge, at the very least, until a decision is made, the said Bench should refrain from proceeding with the proceedings, I may say so.  I do not intend to educate the Bench on how to proceed.  But in this specific case, the Defence will only apply those instructions it has received from its client, that is, we shall refrain from proceeding until a decision is made with respect to the appeal that we have lodged.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may wish to comment.  Did you?
MR. MOSES:
Briefly, Your Honour.  It has just been brought to my attention that Rule 15, regarding disqualification of judges, provides no grounds for an appeal from the bureau's decision.  If counsel is able to indicate under what Rule or provision he has indicated that he has appealed, because Rule 15 makes no provision for an appeal of the bureau's decision.  And, clearly, it is the Prosecution's submission the reason for that is that if there are matters which the Accused wishes to raise regarding bias, which are matters which the bureau have ruled against, they are perfectly entitled to do so if they need to do so in appeal of the final decision of -- in judgement, that is, if it is necessary for them to do so.  So they do have -- the only right of appeal, it would appear, Your Honours, is an appeal against judgement, if that is necessary for them to do so.  But, in terms of Rule 15, there is a right to go to the bureau, but there is no right under Rule 15 to appeal the bureau's decision.  And it indicates nowhere that such an appeal should be heard.  

So with the greatest of respect to my friend, any appeal that he has lodged, in the Prosecution's submission, is without any jurisdiction and should be no bar to these proceedings and continued.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Nekuie, could you provide a legal basis on which you rely in making your appeal.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I don't think we're sitting here on appeal.  Prosecutor wishes to seek the grounds for my appeal.  He only needs to refer to the motion I've filed.  I don't intend to discuss this matter here.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  We wanted you to be able to clarify your position.  And that's all.  Thank you.  

The Trial Chamber is of the opinion that the appeal lodged by the Defence does not amount to a stay of proceedings and does not prevent us from continuing with the trial.  We are here today to hear Witness PS2, and we, therefore, ask you Counsel Nekuie whether you're prepared to examine this witness who is in South Africa and, in a case, where arrangements have been made to ensure he is heard today?
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, with the utmost respect, I am not ready.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you be more specific?  Are you waiving your right to examine this witness?  It is today.  And, as I told you, all arrangements have been made for the hearing of this witness today.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I am complying with the instructions of my client, that is, that I should lodge an appeal and refrain from any further submissions in connection with the proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is of the opinion that the Defence and the witness (sic) have waived their right to hear Witness PS2.  Now, the question is -- at no time did the Trial Chamber compel the witness to testify.  It was the Accused, himself, who wanted to appear as a witness in his own defence.  And he, himself, decided to appear before this Trial Chamber after the last witness.  Does the Accused intend to appear before the Trial Chamber in his own defence?  Could the Court be informed as to his stand, Counsel Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, Your Honours, I am compelled to repeat myself.  My presence here is mainly due to the respect and courtesy that we have for your Court.  My presence here is for what I've already told you; namely, that my client has asked me to lodge an appeal against the decision of the bureau and to refrain from any further action.  I cannot make any further comment beyond that.  I can only submit on what the instructions -- on the instructions issued to me by my client. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, would you want to speak?  Yes, you may.  
MR. MOSES:
Just briefly, Your Honour.  We are now at the stage of the trial where all Defence witnesses, bar the Accused, have been given the opportunity to give evidence before Your Honours and have either -- and have done so.  

So that the Accused can be under no illusion whatsoever as to his position, it would be our respectful submission that Your Honours advise counsel to advise his client that we have reached the point in the trial where he is expected to testify, if he wishes to do so.  

If he maintains his position, then, clearly, that is an indication for the Trial Chamber that he has waived his right to testify.  But before we reach that conclusion, perhaps, it is a safer course for counsel to have advised him directly and that the record can show that Your Honours have advised counsel and the Accused of the situation that we have now reached.  

So it would be -- bearing in mind, we are not -- don't have the constraints of the South African link now, it would be my submission that we adjourn until 2:30, that the Defence counsel is able to go and see his client again, he's able to advise the Accused the situation that we have now reached, where he is expected, if he wishes to do so, and wishes to testify, that he will be expected to do so today.  And that if he indicates -- or, maintains his position, which has been advised to us by his counsel, that that will be -- well, it will certainly be the Prosecution's submission that that is deemed to be a waiver of his right in refusal of him to testify, and that the case for the Defence will be closed.  I just think it is safe, Your Honour, for -- now that Your Honours have made the decisions that you have, that the Accused -- in an attempt to show that all are trying to be extremely fair to him, that he is provided with the information that Your Honours -- and the rulings that Your Honours have just made, rather than we close the case immediately, which, whilst the temptation may be there to do so, he should be given one final opportunity to reflect and make the choices that he wishes to make, and for us to be advised of those -- that decision.  That would be my submission.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber would prefer to give more time to the Accused, time for him to think, so we shall adjourn and resume at 3 p.m., and in the event the Accused intends to appear, we will be here to hear him.  So that's what we have to say.  

Counsel Nekuie, you are counsel for the Accused.  You should not only enforce what he says -- what he directs, you should also advise him so that all his rights are protected.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Madam President, I want to be clear with respect to what the Prosecutor said.  I want to show the utmost respect for your Court.  I wish to say to the Prosecutor that he will never see Defence for Father Seromba associating itself with this masquerade, as he describes it, he's engaged in.  And I want to very clearly say to your distinguished honourable Bench that my client considers himself as being before the Court -- before the Bench of this Court in proceedings that he has been involved in and he stands by.  My client is of the view that the only mission or assignment to his counsel was to just come and tell you what he thinks.  Defence is bound to stand by those instructions.  And, most respectfully, I wish to point out to your august Court, I will not be coming back upon the resumption of your proceedings.  That's what I have to say.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor.  
MR. MOSES:
Also -- an abundance of caution, Your Honour.  Rule 82 (bis), which refers to trial in the absence of the Accused -- to safeguard everyone's position, we would ask that the Registrar notify the Accused that he is required to be present at three o'clock.  If Your Honour orders counsel to be present and counsel does not comply with Your Honour's order, then I can indicate that the Prosecution will be making further submissions at three o'clock, when the trial resumes, regarding Rule 77, which is in relation to contempt of court, which carries serious penalties for those who act in contempt of Trial Chambers' orders.  I simply wish to put that -- our position on the record.  Your Honours have made an order, and Your Honour has ordered, as I understand it, counsel to be back here to make representation at three o'clock.  So that everyone is clear of the position, if that is an order of Your Honours, then officers of the court are bound by those orders.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber instructs the registry to inform, again -- or, once more the Accused that his presence is required for the trial.  We've said that we shall resume at 3 p.m.  It is our hope -- still our hope that the Accused will be here to tell us, with his own voice, that he -- whether he intends to testify before this Court, or if he does not intend to do so.  

We also wish to convey to Mr. Nekuie our concerns; namely, that he should act in such a manner as to ensure that the Accused contributes to compliance with the proceedings because he's the one who is on trial here.  So we shall resume at 3 p.m.  And we urge Counsel Nekuie and the Accused to appear before the Court out of respect for the said Court, at the very least.  

We adjourn, therefore, and resume at 3 p.m.  Thank you.  
(Court resumed at 1230H)
(Pages 4 to 9 by Roxane Meena)






























(Court resumed at 1505H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

We have assembled to determine whether the Accused, Seromba, has made a decision different from the one that was announced this morning.  We provided additional time to the Accused for reflection, and we would now give the floor -- like to give the floor to Counsel Nekuie for him to address the Chamber. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, I am taking the floor not in order to answer your query, but, rather, to indicate what course the Defence intends to take.  And before doing so, I would like, Madam President, for the record to provide clarification on the statements made through you by this Chamber this morning.  

When we adjourned this morning, Madam President, I thought I heard you say that the Defence had waived the -- or, rather, had decided to withdraw the testimony of Witness PS2.  If this is the statement the Chamber is making without taking into account what the Defence said on that, well, it is your sovereign power to do so, Madam President.  However, the Defence would like to state that it never said before this Chamber that it wishes to withdraw Witness PS2.  The Defence would like to specify that the testimony by Witness PS2 is a crucial import for the conclusion of this case.  

Furthermore, the Defence would like to add that this testimony, from its view point, would have to take place before Father Athanase Serombe -- Seromba, sorry, testify on his behalf.  And the Defence would like to conclude, on that matter, Madam President, by indicating that Father Athanase Seromba, regarding the decision made by the Chamber, has been the subject of an appeal, and Father Seromba is waiting for the ruling on this appeal before we decide on the sequence of appearance of the two witnesses which we mentioned.  These were the clarifications I wish to provide.  

Madam President, I believe it should be stated that the Defence has not waived the right of the two witnesses to testify, and it has not either decided to change the sequence of appearance of the two aforementioned witnesses.  

May I say, at this point, Madam President, that I am here this afternoon not in order to endorse the decision you made, and the invitation made to come before this Court this morning, but, mostly, 
Madam President, Your Honours, because of the respect that is imposed on me, vis-à-vis your institution and also because of my duties, vis-à-vis my client.  That is the reason for which I am before this Chamber, Madam President, and also to tell you, Madam President, Your Honours, that you have made a number of rulings this morning -- you have rendered a number of oral decisions on the oral motion filed by the Prosecution.  

The first motion by the Prosecutor was to request from you, Madam President, that you maintain the testimony of PS2 and the sequence of appearance this morning by video link and this, in spite of the appeal which the Defence has appealed, following the decision rendered by this Court.  You acceded to this request.  

The second motion that was made by the Prosecutor, and it also led to a ruling on your part, consisted of saying that the Defence had not indicated that it wish to question Witness PS2, forthwith, and as a consequence, it was waiving -- it was waiving this testimony.  The second ruling by the President was to indicate to the Defence that the Chamber expected Father Athanase Seromba to state whether he intended to testify before this Chamber in his own defence.  And, once again, this was an oral motion by the Prosecutor which you acceded to.  

And the fourth motion -- or, rather, the fourth decision was to direct the registry to serve notice to 
Father Seromba that he would have to appear before this Chamber this afternoon and was also aimed at inviting Father Seromba as well as his co-counsel to be present before the Court this afternoon.  
Madam President, Your Honours, such decisions come under your jurisdiction, but these are decisions that can also be subjected to appeal as provided for by Article 73bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Those are decisions which were rendered following motions filed by one of the parties, even though those were oral motions, and that the decisions were also rendered orally.  

The Defence is indicating to you, Madam President, that Article 73bis of the Rules of Procedure grants to each of the parties to the proceeding the possibility to appeal decisions made under such circumstances.  And it provides as follows, Madam President, and I would like, with your leave, to read this Rule.

"Decisions concerning such motions, or with that of interlocutory appeal on the condition that the Trial Chamber will have certify the appeal unless the decision might have a negative impact on the fairness of the trial or its conclusion."

And paragraph C states, Madam President, "Motions for certification of appeal must be filed within seven days following the filing of the impugned decision.  When such a decision is rendered orally, the motion must be filed within seven days following the decision.  And I am not going to read what follows because that is not the most important aspect.  
The most important aspect, Madam President, and this is the submission of the Defence, is that it deems that all the decisions which I have just mentioned and which were rendered this morning, are decisions that might have an impact on the fairness of the trial or its conclusion and these are matters which could be solved immediately by the Appeals Chamber and which could help expedite the proceedings.  The party is making a request for certification of appeal, and this is the reason for which we deem, Madam President, Your Honours, that, in fairness, the Chamber should leave it to the Defence, which is an equal party in the proceedings, according to the Rules of this Tribunal, that it be in a position to file before the Chamber, within the seven days provided for in Article 73(C) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, request for certification of appeal against the decisions I have just listed.  This is a minimum level of fairness which we are requesting for, especially since, in the instant case, there are decisions which were not notified in written form to the parties, which means, Madam President, that in order to be able to file for appeal within the seven days as provided by the rules, the Defence has to wait for the drafts of these decisions in order to be able to request for certification of appeal.  

Madam President, at the time I am making such submissions in support of my request which will enable Father Seromba to appeal your decisions, and this in keeping with the Rules of Procedure, I wish to indicate to your Chamber, Madam President, as well as to the Prosecution, that in the instant case the public is observing us and law schools are also waiting for the results of our proceedings.  The Defence is requesting that there be a minimum level of fairness regarding your decision as rendered this morning as indicated in Article 19 of the Statute of this Tribunal, which reads as follows:

"The Trial Chamber ensures that the trial is fair and expeditious and proceedings are conducted in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence with full respect for the right of the Accused. 

Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence is requesting that you let it enjoy its rights to exercise within the time allotted by the Rules of Procedure and by virtue of the provisions of Article 73C, which I have just mentioned, the possibility to appeal your decision.  History will speak for itself, 
Madam President, for I imagine that the Prosecutor who, through his method, has, in fact, become a legend of this jurisdiction, will probably find a way to ask this Court to go one step further following the decisions made this morning.  Nevertheless, Madam President, the Defence would comply with its obligations.  And the Defence would like history to tell us whether within the trial of Father Athanase Seromba, the rights of the Accused have been fully observed.  Does Father Seromba have the right, according to Article 73 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to appeal against the decisions which you rendered this morning and which I mentioned earlier on?  This is what history will tell us in the future, Madam President.  

And, in my capacity as counsel, I would like to remind you of the history of our history of our profession by telling you, Madam President, Your Honours, that Romain de Seze intervening for Louis XVI who had already been sacrificed on the alter of a convention, suggest to the judges by saying the following things:  "I am bringing to you the defence of my client as well as my own head." 

Father Athanase Seromba is not a king.  Father Athanase Seromba is a rural priest, and this is why the Defence for Father Seromba will merely say that we will bring to you the trust of Father Seromba as well as our professional future, and this -- before the ICTR.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution has the floor. 
MR. MOSES: 
One thing I think I can agree with my learned friend is that the public is watching, and I think it would be clear to anyone, who observed and has observed these proceedings, that this is the latest in a long line of attempts by the Defence and the Accused to derail these proceedings.  This is a poorly disguised attempt by the Defence, on this occasion, to try, once again, to delay the end of this trial.  

For my learned friend to suggest that the Prosecution made oral motions this morning in respect of the Accused being asked whether or not he wanted to testify, is almost beyond belief.  In the Court record, it is quite clear as to what Your Honours had asked of the Defence.  

Your Honours, the Defence had indicated at an earlier stage that the Accused wish to give evidence.  
Your Honours made a clear decision, based on the choice that this Accused and his counsel made this morning, that they had waived their right to call Witness PS2.  It then was, obviously, left as to whether or not the Accused wished to testify, to submit as has been done this afternoon, that for Your Honours to make such an inquiry amount to an appellable decision, is complete travesty of the truth.  

Similarly, for my learned friend to characterise the other matters in terms of procedure that 
Your Honours ordered, namely, that the Accused be given the right to be served -- to be advised of the hearing this afternoon, for that to be characterised as a motion and an order which is appellable is also beyond belief.  

This, as I have submitted, Your Honour, is the very latest attempt by this Accused and his counsel to try and derail these proceedings.  History will be, no doubt show, and the record makes it very clear the link that this Trial Chamber has gone to, to enable a fair trial for this Accused.  

His decision, at this stage, not to appear -- I understand that he has refused to come this afternoon, is, in the light of Your Honours' invitation for him to do so, is his decision.  The Prosecution's submission that his actions today amounts to a waiver of his right to testify.  Whether in the Prosecution's submissions in terms of Rule 85, the evidence for the Prosecution has been heard, and in accordance with the list of witnesses provided to the Prosecution by the Defence, bearing in mind the attitude of this Accused, the evidence of the Defence, in terms of oral evidence has been concluded.  Now, whether or not the Accused wishes to file any other written documents is a matter for him.  Whether Your Honours wish to reach the conclusion this afternoon that the evidence for the Defence has been concluded, or whether you want to provide a final opportunity at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, for the Accused to file any other further statements or other evidence -- documentary evidence that he wishes to, before his case is formally closed, is a matter that I leave for Your Honours.

The record is extremely clear.  The Accused has chosen his cause in his actions in defiance of 
Your Honours' invitation amounts, in the Prosecution's submission, to his refusal or unwillingness to testify in his own Defence.  

Accordingly, we'll submit to Your Honours, that subject to comments as to whether or not Your Honours wish to formally close the Defence case and provide a date for filing of closing submissions to be done this afternoon, or whether you would prefer to give one final opportunity tomorrow morning at nine o'clock for the Accused to provide any other information or documents or submissions that he wishes to in this respect, is a matter for Your Honour.  

Clearly, none of -- no -- there have been no orders made today that are subject to appeal.  In any event, none of them are such that would be certifiable in any event.  Those are our submissions, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Nekuie, you may wish to speak. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I will be brief.  I merely wish to say that it is unfortunate that the Prosecutor does not demonstrate minimum loyalty, at least, in standing by the statements he has made or the request or application he made to this Court, unless he is trying to say that he is confining himself to presenting argument.   And maybe it would refresh everyone's mind, just to take one of your decisions rendered this morning, for instance, that of setting aside the testimony by PS2, that was a decision you rendered following an application by the Prosecutor, and it was rendered following a deliberation from the Bench this morning.  That's what will be reflected in the record.  It will also be referring to other decisions that I had alluded to earlier.  

Be that as it may, Madam President, I didn't hear from the Prosecutor that the Defence didn't have the right to refer to Rule 73(C) bis -- B and C of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Whether you did deliver a decision this morning, I am rather surprised to note or hear the Prosecutor say that this Chamber can pronounce itself in any other manner than through a decision.  Maybe you were making or making some administrative - or, issuing some administrative orders.  Anyway, be that as it may, it is only the record that will show.  

That stated, the Defence request remains as is, in other words, that you have issued or handed down decisions this morning which are appellable, and there are certain time limits that are set as a result of those decisions.  And in all fairness, we shall expect from this Court, at least, so that the appeals can be properly lodged, it is not some waste -- an attempt to waste time.  That is what I have to say, sir -- madam.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor, you wish to add some. 
MR. MOSES: 
Just a brief matters, Your Honour.  Firstly, there have been no motions towards your Chamber to certify under Rule 73.  So any such argument is simply speculative.  

Secondly, Rule 73 does not provide for the stay of proceedings whilst any such appeal is being lodged or determined.  Hence the argument of my learned friend is without any merit in terms of trying to delay the trial and delaying the proceedings.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Madam President.  I have a feeling that the Prosecutor had another unique reading of these instruments, rather peculiar interpretation of what the Defence is saying.  We are not seeking yet the certification of the appeal.  The Defence is saying that 73(B) and C does allow it to go and appeal through a certification, that is formally filed before you within a seven-day time limit, subsequent to the decision that you rendered this morning.  And Defence wishes to inform you that such a request for certification will be filed with you within the confines of the instruments.  So, I don't know about that reading of the regulations by the Prosecutor.  It is rather unique, rather different.  Indeed, there was some dismissal or a request for certification which was not submitted by the Defence, any way.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, first, let us commend the fact or welcome the fact that you were here this afternoon.  You came here this afternoon, even though, as you say, it wasn't to respond to an invitation from this Trial Chamber, but, rather, to tell us what the thinking of the Accused was and to comply with the procedure.  So, first of all, let's commend you for being here.  

Secondly, we have done everything.  The Trial Chamber has been of extraordinary - or, exercised extraordinary patience, you will grant us that.  Because this witness whom we had intended to hear this morning was not one of the Defence witnesses per se.  There was a further motion and that motion by yourself was granted and -- to allow for that witness to be heard.  And, as we told you, all arrangements were made to ensure that that witness was heard.  Accordingly, therefore, what we said earlier could be viewed as an interpretation.  

We can further state, we want, a second time around, serve notice on the Accused, Seromba, that this Trial Chamber is still willing to hear him until tomorrow.  If he changes his mind; namely, not to appear, we can even go further.  You told us earlier that we were taken or adopting decisions in connection with the Prosecution motion.  That's not the case here.  We just wish to move these proceedings forward.  And, in so doing, we are bound to inform you as to what would need to be done and ensure that the parties are aware of the role that the Bench has to play so as not to impede or obstruct the proceedings or work of the Trial Chamber.  So, that's why we allowed that witness -- additional witness by the Defence.  And there are -- in a lot of cases, you would know that the Accused does not testify, but we allowed that.  And you do know that it is Defence itself, by not having this witness appear, we are prepared to hear the Accused right up to any hearing before the closing statements are made, and -- if that is necessary.  Just to tell you, once more, that the Trial Chamber has spared no efforts to ensure that the proceedings move in the fairest manner possible.  And now, all is in the court of the Accused.  

As for the record, it is your right, of course, to pick up copies of the said record and to appeal accordingly.  That is your right.  But you are fully aware that such appeal -- such an appeal does not prepaid or trigger a stay of proceedings.  

So, let me repeat.  The registry should give or inform the Accused of this new request by the 
Trial Chamber, namely, that he appears tomorrow morning -- appear here tomorrow morning.  

Very well.  Then we shall adjourn for today.  We are here tomorrow at 9 a.m., and the Accused is urged to appear before the Court.  I thank everyone.  
(Court adjourned at 1538H)
