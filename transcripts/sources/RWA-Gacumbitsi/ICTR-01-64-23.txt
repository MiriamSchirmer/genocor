P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. 

Counsel Kouengoua, will you tell us how many witnesses you have in Arusha?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
(Microphone not on)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there a problem?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
No, we can hear now. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think it was my earphones.  The question, if I correctly understood madam, is how many witnesses I have to be heard today.  Today, the Defence currently has four witnesses in Arusha.  The Defence prays that the four witnesses be heard today, the 21st - Tuesday, the 21st of October, year of Our Lord 2003.  Madam, should the four witnesses not be heard today, the Trial Chamber could not hear them in view of the provisions of Rule 15(C).  I therefore pray the Trial Chamber to hear the four witnesses today. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, any comments, please?
MR. KAREGYESA:
The only comments we wish to make, Your Honours, is -- the comment we wish to make is that counsel's calculation of the five days under Rule 15bis appears erroneous --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think there must be an earphone open near Counsel for the Prosecution's microphone.  There is feedback because there are earphones open somewhere near Counsel for the Prosecution's microphone. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is the problem settled?  You try and say something, Counsel for the Prosecution, please, we'll see  --
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, the problem appears to be coming from the French translation, which we can hear overhead.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, that appears to be the case.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Technician, can you help us please?  Why is the French booth coming into the PA system?  

We thank you.  It would appear the problem is now solved.  Mr. Prosecutor, pray proceed. 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Thank you.  

Counsel's calculation is erroneous.  We had three days of hearing last week, which means technically we have two days left.  Even in our submissions yesterday we made reference to the fact that we had two days left and we sought that the hearing continues both today, Tuesday, and tomorrow, Wednesday.  Now, if Counsel is including yesterday's session, Your Honours, we submit that that wasn't a hearing within the provisions of Rule 15bis(A), but rather it was a session clearly provided for under Rule 15bis paragraph (b) (ii)(a), i.e., Your Lordships were in session to dispose of the applications for an adjournment, which did not constitute -- or which do not constitute a hearing within the provisions of 15A.  We submit that hearing refers to hearing testimony of witnesses, be they Defence or Prosecution.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Counsel for the Prosecution's argument does not differ very much from his argument yesterday.  However, one is forced to observe that this argument is no longer valid because the Trial Chamber did hold a hearing yesterday in the matter of the Prosecution versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  The Trial Chamber held a hearing in the presence of the Accused and all the parties.  The Trial Chamber held a hearing during which all the Defence witnesses due to appear were named.  The Trial Chamber held a hearing in the course of which a decision was rendered.  

Now, Article 15 talks of five working days.  Yesterday we felt that the Prosecution was in good faith, but that led everyone into error.  We cannot consider that yesterday was not a day of hearing in the matter, the Prosecution versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  We cannot ignore the fact or discard the fact that the names of factual witnesses and expert witnesses were named and a decision handed down in order to have a better knowledge of the facts in the matter, and the Trial Chamber invited the person in charge in the witness and victims services section.  If we followed that argument, the question put to you would be what were you doing yesterday in the hearing, what case you were working on?  If it was to dispense with administrative matters, did you need to call the Accused -- summon the Accused?  Why did you also deal with all those other matters?  

Madam, time is moving.  It is already nine o'clock.  Let us call the four witnesses so that everyone can respect the legality of the procedure before the Chamber.  Yesterday I wanted to hear two of the witnesses.  The Prosecutor made a mistake and we all followed in error.  What does it matter today?  It is still early.  Let us proceed with hearing the witnesses.  It is better to hear them than not to hear them, and if we don't do so, we will no longer be respecting the five working days time limit, and what the Counsel for the Prosecution has always had as a major concern is the economy of justice within the Tribunal.  Can we bring these witnesses back, send them home to bring them back?  No, I think we should take -- grab the bull by the horns and hear the witnesses today.  Even if we have to work until midnight, we wouldn't be breaking the -- we wouldn't be in violation of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  I hope it won't come to that.  

Did you want to add something, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Very briefly, Your Honours, with your leave.  All I want to underscore is that there is a difference between Rule 15bis(A) and Rule 15bis(B) and counsel has just referred to Rule 15bis without laying the basis upon which his submission is made.  Just to reiterate my earlier submission, Your Honours, to put yesterday's hearing in its proper context under Rule 15bis(B), we submit that when the Court sat yesterday, the question was whether we should proceed with the hearing or not.  Counsel wanted to proceed, and I objected.  At the end of the day the session was adjourned to today.  

Basically, what we are submitting, Your Honours, is that yesterday was not a hearing within Rule 15bis(A), but rather it was a session during which you adjourned the hearing under Rule 15bis(B)(ii) para. (a), and counsel should not bog us down by submissions that are not based on any known rule.  Most obliged. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Listen, please, if we go on like that we're going to waste a lot of time.  You yourself pointed that out, Counsel for the Defence.  I think we can now deliberate and tell you what our ruling will be. 

Yesterday we all thought that we could sit today and tomorrow on the basis of 15bis.  According to CMS, Court Management Section, yesterday is considered as a day of hearing.  There can be interpretations; the proof of the pudding is that Counsel for the Defence and Counsel for the Prosecution do not have the same position.  So as not to expose ourselves to a -- grounds for appeal, we prefer to sit all day, try and hear the four Defence witnesses while requesting, of course, Defence to proceed expeditiously and deal especially with essentials, and we shall ask Counsel for the Prosecution to do their utmost to help us here with the four witnesses.  As things stand, we cannot say either the one or the other is right.  There is -- there are -- it is subject to interpretation.  Let us at least avoid falling into a trap, and without further ado let us tackle the first witness, and we shall sit with small breaks in order to do all that is necessary in hearing the four witnesses due to be heard today.  If that is agreeable to you, let us proceed forthwith with the first witness. 

Counsel Kouengoua, please call your first witness. 
MS. MBATTANG:
We are calling NG4.  

Registry, please, for the interpreters, the four witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you wanted to say something before Counsel Kouengoua presented his examination-in-chief of the first witness. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, you asked whether it was agreeable, and however disagreeable we find that we are obliged to proceed under your direction, and all we want is a clarification whether we are operating under the dictates of the Court Management Section, or whether this Chamber has made a positive finding of fact that yesterday was a hearing day within Rule 15bis.  Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will be known under the pseudonym of NG4.  You will be examined by the Defence, cross-examined by the Prosecution and the Judges might ask you questions -- put questions to you, and the Defence might undertake re-examination.  You will first of all make a solemn declaration, and the registry will help you to do that. 
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me. 
(Declaration made by Witness NG4 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Mbattang, you have the floor.  You may proceed.
MS. MBATTANG:
Thank you, Madam President; thank you, Your Lordship.  

Good morning, the Prosecution, good morning interpreters, good morning the registry, good morning the court stenographers; Witness NG4, good morning.  

Madam President, I should like the examination to take place in two parts; firstly, in closed session, because I am going to ask questions pertaining to the identity of the witness, and we can then proceed into open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall move into closed session for the protection of the witness.  But if you could perhaps prepare for the other witnesses a document comprising the elements of their personal information that they could peruse and approve; put all the confidential information in a document that can be shown to the witnesses, and with the assistance of interpreters the witness can say it is all correct and sign the document, or we shall note that the document is entirely correct, and then we can do all of that in open session.

You seem to be surprised.  But this document remains confidential, a document that would be shown to the witness, so only the witness and the parties and the Bench see the document.  The witness checks that all the information is correct with the assistance of an interpreter; we place the document under seal, and we proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Agreed, Madam President.  The only difficulty is that it might not apply to all the witnesses that have to appear today. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that's why I said if you could do so for some of the witnesses. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Agreed.  Thank you, Madam President.

0915H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in open session; please proceed.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness NG4, you have stated that in April 1994 you were in Rwanda.  Where and when did you hear of the assassination of President Habyarimana?
A.	On the morning of the 7th of April at about 5 a.m. I heard a communiqué over Radio Rwanda stating that the presidential plane had been shot down.  There was a communiqué announcement repeated several times asking people to stay at home and to avoid gatherings of more than two people.  We respected those instructions; we complied with those instructions.  

The Tuesday of the week following the week when the president's plane was shot down, a man came from the place called Gatore, and he said that there was a man by the name of Karuyonza (phonetic), who had been called, so the Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi came to hold a meeting to deliberate on security problems, questions of public safety, and the man who came with information took part in the meeting.  At that meeting there were also policemen who --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please slow down so that the interpreters have enough time to interpret and the court stenographers, court reporters have time to write down, note what you are saying. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  Thank you, Madam President. 

Can I repeat what I have already said or can I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.
THE WITNESS:
During the meeting, the man told us that policemen were present and they had arrested the murderers to go and put them in prison.  So on that Tuesday around eleven or between eleven and twelve, a man came to my house.  The man's name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal.).  He had come to borrow my bicycle so that he could go and see his wife in Nyakarambi, where she had gone the night before.  I gave him the bicycle, and he left and went to his house first to prepare himself for the trip.  

Some time later he was informed that his father had also been killed.  He was frightened and he left running, or he ran away, rather, and abandoned the bicycle behind.  I found this -- I was informed of this subsequently, and I followed the road that he had taken to try and find the bicycle.  I found the bicycle at his neighbours.  And during that same year, during 1994, we fled to Tanzania, and we returned to Rwanda in 1996.  I was able to see (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal.), and we talked because he was a friend.  He told me of the difficulties he had to face in his travels on the day that he fled.  He told me that on that day when he left the bicycle behind to flee on foot, he first went to the house of Gacumbitsi in Nyakarambi or, rather to --
MR. KAREGYESA:
We object to this line of questioning.
THE WITNESS:
-- or rather it was Gacumbitsi's house that he rented.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
We object to this line of questioning, first, on the ground that it is of a level of hearsay that is not acceptable in this Chamber in light of the fact that the witness is reporting what he was told by a Prosecution witness in circumstances where such propositions were never put to the Prosecution witness to allow the Prosecution witness to confirm or deny this version of events.  In the event that they did not cross-examine the Prosecution witness on what this witness is reporting, they are stopped from leading such evidence, which is hearsay and of no relevance.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Counsel Mbattang, do you wish to reply to the objection raised by the Prosecutor? 
MS. MBATTANG:
Yes, I shall, Madam President.  

(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted, and filed under seal)
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, if counsel could have been more discreet, I pray that this portion of her submission be struck from the record and placed under seal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Mbattang?
MS. MBATTANG:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall sustain the objection raised by the Prosecutor.  Please continue with other questions, but please do not proceed with this line of questioning, thank you.  

The witness should not speak to us of what another -- what the other witness allegedly told him.  The witness should tell us what he has personally seen or lived through.  In view of the fact that the other witness was not heard on what this witness is now testifying about, we would rather not go down that line of questioning. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness NG4, aside from what you were told, did you personally live through any specific event during the month of April 1994?
A.	If I looked at things closely, that is the date we were prohibited from moving about.  I did not have any opportunity to leave my house to be an eyewitness of any specific event, but I can tell you that I did not hear anything about Gacumbitsi and I did not see him participate in anything.
Q.	Witness NG4, were there any rapes in your community?
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, the witness by his own admission  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am raising an objection, Your Honours.  The witness, by his own admission, stayed in his house and did not witness anything; he didn't see anything.  So how then can we justify his continuing presence in this Court to testify, Your Honours?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness told us that he remained at home during the first few days. Counsel, do you wish to proceed?  
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness NG4, did you hear that Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi incited the people of your locality or the people of your commune to rape Tutsi women?
A.	Personally, I never heard anything in that vein.
Q.	Witness NG4, did you see any Tutsi women being raped?
A.	No, I personally was not an eyewitness to any such event, moreover I never heard of any such fact. 
Q.	Witness NG4, did you see Gacumbitsi distributing weapons?
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Asked and answered, Your Honours.  The witness earlier said he did not see Gacumbitsi at all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

You know, you put the same questions to each and every witness.  Are you doing this on purpose?
MS. MBATTANG:
No, Madam President.  Each witness is coming here to testify about the events they have lived through.  If those points were raised with the other witnesses, it is because those are the points that are raised in the indictment.  Therefore, Madam President, I have to put that question to the witnesses who come to testify before the Trial Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, and the Trial Chamber shall make its own determination. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Were there any killings made under the incitement of Mr. Gacumbitsi?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you wanted to say something?  But, please, ask for the floor before proceeding.  Moreover, I would like to tell you that we shall also review and determine what we shall accept in the evidence led before us.  We are not going to take anything -- we are not just going to take everything.  We shall review everything subsequently and determine what shall be taken into consideration and what shall not, because if we continue to have constant interruptions, we shall never be able to accomplish what we have set out for ourselves today.  So I should like to draw both parties' attention to this matter so that we may proceed.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, I am most obliged for your direction, and all the Prosecutor intends to underscore, given the time constraints we have, is that this witness is not here so much as to testify about what he lived through, he is supposed to be here to testify to matters relevant to the indictment, and the allegations against the Accused.  Clearly, this witness, Your Honours, has said he was in hiding, he never saw the Accused at all, he was at his home.  Of what relevance is, is, is -- you know, the evidence of hearsay, in light of the fact that he has, by his own admission, conceded he never saw the Accused, never witnessed any incitement?  Why should we suffer -- continue suffering his presence here, Your Honours, given the time constraints we have, Rule 89C aside? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please proceed. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, it seems that my learned friend on the other side of the courtroom continues and seems to have changed his behaviour compared to usual.  Madam President, I think that we shall stop our examination of this witness because we have already put all of the questions that we wished to put to this witness.  We have now completed, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you may now proceed with your cross-examination of the witness. 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
I have no questions for this witness, Your Honours. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

The Trial Chamber has no questions for this witness.  

Mr. Pros -- Mr. Witness, you have now come to the end of your examination.  We thank you for your testimony and we wish you a safe return home. 
THE WITNESS:
May I ask a question, with your permission, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may ask your question. 
THE WITNESS:
Actually, I have two questions.  The first question deals with my security.  In view of the fact that I have come to testify before the Trial Chamber, this may cause problems for my safety; and I have another problem with respect to my family.  If you could assist me to -- with me being relocated so that I could live in another country far from Rwanda; if that is possible, Madam President.  If you could also allow me to say hello to Mr. Gacumbitsi, I would also be most grateful to be allowed to do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness.  I think that the Defence who brought you here will be able to provide you with all necessary information and you will thus understand that we have taken all necessary measures to ensure your safety.  The Defence will also see if they are in a position to speak with the competent authorities so that you may meet with the Accused.  

And as to your question about being relocated, these are all matters that you should raise with the Defence who has brought you here.  We thank you, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President.  
(Witness excused) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, which shall be your next witness? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
NG2, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please bring in Witness NG2.  

Good day, Witness. 

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness.  We -- your pseudonym will be NG2.  You are to be led by the Defence, perhaps cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and the Judges may have questions to put to you, and the Defence may re-examine you, if they so wish.  We would like to ask you to make a solemn declaration before that, and the registry shall assist you with this. 
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me. 
(Declaration made by Witness NG2 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness.  We thank the registry.

Counsel Kouengoua, will you now examine your witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may now proceed, Counsel.
WITNESS NG2,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Good day, Witness NG2.
A.	Good day, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness NG2, please state your first and last name for the record. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said he could not state his name for the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are in open session, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am sorry, Madam President.  I have gone too fast.  I will now move that the first few minutes of this hearing be held in closed session, if you please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we order that there shall be a closed session for the first part of the examination of Witness NG2.  

I would also like to request that any information that might allow the identification of the two witnesses be struck from the record.  I am referring to the witness we have just heard and the witness that Counsel Mbattang mentioned.  If there is any information that might allow for the identification of the witness, I order that they be struck from the record.

0948H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are now in open session.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
With your indulgence, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed, Counsel for the Defence. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness NG2, when did you learn of President Juvénal Habyarimana's assassination?
A.	As a matter of fact, I learnt of his assassination on the night of the 6th of April, and it was announced by RTLM Radio at about 8 p.m.  The announcement said that the president's plane had been shot down.  At about 10 p.m., it was said that the president had been assassinated.  Subsequently, the next day, news was still being announced.  It was said that the president had died and members of the population were forbidden to leave their homes, and all gatherings were forbidden. 
Q.	What happened in your area on the 8th, on the 8th of April?
A.	On the 8th of April, as a matter of fact, I would rather start with the 7th.  At night the inhabitants of Kigama (phonetic), a neighbouring commune, started torching houses; and we observed that on the 8th.  My parents asked me to go and visit my maternal aunt.  On my way, I saw a group of people.  I went to look closely and Gacumbitsi met me there.  

To sum up what I am saying, I would say that in my area nothing special happened on the 9th.  The inhabitants of Kig -- Gitarama commune launched an attack.  They killed one person and looted his cattle.  We asked for help and were able to recover all the cows that had been looted.  On that same day, that is the 9th, we saw refugees coming from Birenga commune and passing through Rukira commune on their way to Rusumo in order to cross the border into Tanzania. 
Q.	And on the 10th, did anything peculiar happen?  I was asking whether any particular event happened on the 10th of April.
A.	On the 10th of April nothing happened, apart from the fact that the refugees continued to flee.  Even up to the 12th, refugees were moving about looking for refuge.  On the 12th, the inhabitants of Rukira commune launched an attack against the parish.  The people who had sought refuge in the church continued fleeing.  Some of these people were killed.  In our commune, Rukira, many people were killed, and people who were now living next to the communal office fled into Rusumo commune.  I am referring to the events that occurred on the 13th of April. 
Q.	How did you know that they were heading for Rusumo?
A.	In view of the fact that our secteur was a neighbouring secteur to Rusumo commune, we said that they were going in that direction because they did not stop in our secteur to seek refuge.
Q.	And you said that all this happened on the 13th.  What happened then? 
A.	On the 13th, as I said, the inhabitants of Rukira commune invaded the communal office, killed people, others survived and continued their journey towards Rusumo commune. 
Q.	And on the 14th, what happened?
A.	On the 14th, as had been the case in Rukira communal office, the attackers continued to pursue the survivors who had fled.  

The assailants went to flush them out where they had sought refuge, and when they got to Birenga on their way to Nyarutunga, the refugees who were on Rutunga hill saw the attackers coming and they thought they were going to attack them once again, and the attackers started firing at the refugees.  Two people were killed and the others were taken hostage or taken as prisoners. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you reading a document, Witness?  What are you doing?
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't have any documents before me.  I am not reading any documents.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could you go a little slower because you are going too fast.
THE WITNESS:
Right.  The attackers opened fire on the refugees; two people were killed, others were taken hostage.  Some of the attackers went to get reinforcements among the Mulindi police.  People were forcefully enlisted and a vehicle was requisitioned.  There was another vehicle belonging to these police officers.  We were forced to get on board that vehicle. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you should try to lead your witness a bit and ask him to answer the questions put to him concisely.  Ask him concise questions and ask him to answer those questions with concision.  Witness, try to answer the questions as concisely as possible. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I believe he is also going too fast.  I heard the interpreters refer to "police officers", whereas in Kinyarwanda he was talking of gendarmes.  I think I heard "police" from the interpreters.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
I object to counsel correcting the record; it is for interpreters to correct the record or for the witness.
THE WITNESS:
We went to look for gendarmes.  It was gendarmes who were based in Mulindi camp.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the interpreter clarify the matter?  What did the witness say?

THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
To the best of my recollection, Madam President, I heard "police officers" in my first -- in his first version, but I would like to consult my colleague, because I heard "police officer." 

After conferring with my colleague, I now know that the witness referred to gendarmes and police officers and then subsequently he referred to gendarmes.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q. So it is indeed the witness who spoke of gendarmes and police officers?
A.	No, there were no police officers in Mulindi, there were only gendarmes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well then, Counsel, please follow my instructions so that we can follow what the witness is saying. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President.  I have heard what you have said. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness NG2, on the 14th of April, that is when all this happened, right?
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	You told this Court that the attackers from Rukira pursued the refugees who had headed for Rusumo commune. 
A.	And when they got to the Birembo hill, I don't know what happened, but the refugees thought they had arrived in Birembo but they were going to Nyarutunga. 
Q.	Where were you on the 14th?
A.	I was in Mulindi.  That is where I had been sheltered.  Schools were opening on the 18th.  I spent the night there, but I was going to school. 
Q.	And what happened in Mulindi on the 14th?
A.	When the gendarmes heard what was happening from the people who were caught -- coming to seek reinforcements, the gendarmes forcefully took us to Nyarutunga, and when we got close to Nyarutunga, the gendarmes alighted from the vehicle, others went out to encircle Nyarutunga.  The two gendarmes who were leading the group spoke with people, but I didn't hear what they were saying.  But all of a sudden, I heard them open fire and I saw somebody collapse, and they were able to capture two people, whom they tied up.  After that we left.  

I would like to point out that at the time when you are in refugees' company, you could be killed; let me give an example:  If somebody said at the time that he was sick, on our return from that area we observed that that person had been killed instantly. 
Q.	The events you are relating, Witness NG2, occurred at what hour of the day?
A.	We got to Nyarutunga at about 4 p.m.  As for the person who was shot dead in Mulindi, he was killed at about 6 p.m. or shortly before 6 p.m.
Q.	Were the prisoners from Nyarutunga that you referred to earlier on, released?
A.	The gendarmes asked them to get on board the vehicle and they subsequently released them.
Q.	We are referring to events that occurred on the 14th.  Did anything else happen on the 15th?
A.	On the 15th, people came from Rukira and forced members of the population to arm themselves.  They were put on board a vehicle and led towards an area called Nyarubuye.  

As we drew close to Nyarubuye at the level of the dispensary, we came out of the vehicle, but before we got there the -- all the people we met were forced to accompany us on foot to get to Nyarubuye.  Once we got to the health centre, the vehicles that had brought us there left, went back and brought back other people.  When we got out of the vehicle we were asked to move in the direction of Nyarubuye.  When we got to Nyarubuye, we were ordered to encircle the parish so that nobody could escape from the parish premises from inside the parish. 
Q.	Witness NG2, you have just said that when you got to Nyarubuye you were asked to encircle the parish; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  We were ordered to encircle the parish so that nobody could get out of the parish.  As a matter of fact, at that time the attackers were ordered to wear banana leaves or leaves in general.  As far as I am concerned, I was close to the entrance and I heard the lieutenant say, "Those who are innocent should get out of there."  And at that time roughly four or five people came out of the building.
Q.	Witness NG2, please pause a bit to enable us to follow what you are saying; you are going a little too fast and I am having difficulty following what you are saying. 

So you left Rukira and headed for Nyarubuye on the 15th; is that correct?
A.	On the 15th, I did not come from Rukira.  As I said, I was in Mulindi on my way to school, but at the time I was in Mulindi in Rukira commune, of course. 
Q.	And according to you, what is approximately the distance from Mulindi to Nyarubuye?
A.	From Mulindi to Nyarubuye?  First of all, you can get there by road or you can take a shortcut.  When you take the main road, it is about six kilometres, but if you take a shortcut across the hills, it is more (sic) than six kilometres. 
Q.	And you were picked up from Mulindi at what time of the day, roughly?
A.	It was at about one, 1:30 p.m., 2 p.m.  I say so because when we got to the Nyarubuye health centre it was about 2:30 p.m. 
Q.	Prior to your arrival in Nyarubuye parish, did you see other people present there?
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Your Honours, I object to that question.  How can the witness answer what he didn't see?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I didn't hear what she said. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could counsel for the Prosecution repeat the question, please?
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
The question counsel asked was, "Prior to your arrival, did you see people there?"
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel for the Prosecution again repeat her question, please, because we lost track of what she was saying? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President. 

The witness said that when they got to Nyarubuye parish they were ordered to encircle the parish and the question was, "Did they meet other people on the spot when they got there?"  That is the question I put to the witness, Madam President.  I don't know whether there is an objection to that question.  
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
The translation we got was, "Prior to your arrival, did you see people there?"  So my objection was on the basis of that question, which of course was impossible for the witness to answer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the Prosecutor has no objection to the question you have put to the witness.  

So, Witness, could you please answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I didn't meet anybody there.  We were the first people who arrived there with the exception, of course, of the refugees who were in the parish.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness NG2, when you encircled the parish, what happened?
A.	The lieutenant ordered those in the centre to come out.  Four or five people came out, and the refugees started hurling spears and arrows at the attackers, and the attackers, in turn, opened fire on the refugees, and those who were inside the building started shouting.  The attackers did the same, and some of the attackers were saying that, "You shouldn't shoot at the refugees.  Allow us to get into the building and bring out some members of our families."  There were children in the building, but the gendarmes continued to shoot at the refugees.  There was gunfire, and grenades were exploding.  And after that the attackers were ordered to enter the building and collect some property.  At that time, some of the property was transported on the vehicles that the gendarmes had travelled in, as well as other people.  

And during this mad rush a vehicle belonging to the parish, which was a Suzuki, was also looted.
Q.	Witness NG2, when you got to the parish were there any refugees outside the building?
A.	There was no refugee outside the church.  Those who were outside were rather the attackers.
Q.	Prior -- before the gendarmes and the attackers started shooting were any people killed outside the building?
A.	Nobody was killed outside the parish compound.  Furthermore, when they opened fire the people who were passing and who had been wounded returned to their homes.
Q.	Before the lieutenant ordered people to open fire, were there any discussions with the people?
A.	When we got to the parish, apart from the statement made by the lieutenant who ordered the innocent people to come out, there were no other discussions in the parish.
Q.	And when the lieutenant asked those who were innocent to come out, you said that four or five people came out; is that correct, four or five people?  Were those people, in your opinion, children, men or women?
A.	As they left - as they came out hastily, I observed that there was an old man among them.  I also saw a young woman.  As for the others, I didn't quite observe them, but I saw that there was an old man and a girl.

	1015H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness NG2, was your man you saw killed before the general attack?
A.	He was not killed because the lieutenant had asked innocent people to come out and he had come out under those circumstances.  Many people went in the direction of the road.  I don't know whether they were sheltered somewhere or they continued their journey.
Q.	Witness NG2, can you tell the Chamber, roughly how many people were outside the parish compound?
A.	There were very many of us.  I could not quite count the number of people because there were very many of them.
Q.	To your knowledge, did many people die in Nyarubuye on that day?
A.	Many people died.
Q.	Did you have the opportunity to personally enter the building?
A.	I told you that we were forced to get into the compound to loot property and it was loaded on vehicles, so I got into the complex.
Q.	Witness NG2, how much time did you spend in that parish, roughly, to the best of your recollection?
A.	About an hour and a half or two hours.
Q.	Witness NG2, were weapons distributed to you before the beginning of the attack?
A.	No, we did not receive any weapons, because before we got to Nyarubuye we were instructed to take any arms and machete or club before we were forced to get to Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness NG2, during the two hours, did you yourself kill anybody?
A.	No.
Q.	When did you leave the parish: before the gendarmes arrived, after the gendarmes arrived, or after everybody arrived?
A.	I left the parish before the gendarmes left.
Q.	To your knowledge, when you left, the gendarmes remained there for a long time.  Did they remain there for a long time?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That question is speculation, Counsel.  How do you expect him to know?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I beg your pardon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am saying that that question is speculated before he left before the gendarmes, so if you ask him that question, it is speculative.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I didn't bear that in mind, Madam President.  It is, indeed, speculative and I withdraw it.

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, when you remained at the parish, did you see any girls or women being raped?
A.	No, I never saw anything of that sort take place, and that could not have taken place because of the shots being fired.  There was a lot of noise and there was a lot of blood flowing, so it would have been impossible.
Q.	Witness NG2, you said that you were amongst the first to arrive at that location.  During the whole time that you were there, did you see the bourgmestre, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	No, I never saw him on that location.
Q.	Did you see any communal policemen at the parish that day?
A.	There were no communal policemen.  The only armed persons who were there were the gendarmes who had come from Mulindi.
Q.	Witness NG2, when you left the parish, did you leave it on foot or in a vehicle?
(By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted, and filed under seal)
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I should like that to be struck from the record.  In the heat of the action I commented an oversight. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like that to be struck from the record, and Counsel, I think you should be more cautious in the questions you ask because of being so hard driven.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Since that date, have you participated in other attacks?
A.	No, I have not participated in any further attacks.
Q.	Witness NG2, when you were at the parish, where were you; at the entrance at the back or on the side?
A.	Personally, I was at the front, very near the door or the gate.
Q.	And did you see anyone killed before the beginning of the assault, it being understood that you were one of the first people on the spot?
A.	No, before the assault no one had been killed, but when the lieutenant ordered the innocent to leave, that is when we began shooting at people.
Q.	Witness NG2, before leaving the parish that day, did you see any bodies outside the parish enclosure?
A.	I could see only one corpse, a young girl from my area who was shot when she tried to get out.
Q.	In 1994, did you leave Rwanda?
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	I was asking whether in 1994 you left Rwanda.
A.	In xxxx 1994, I sought exile.  I went into exile in xxxxxxxx.
Q.	Since that date, did you return to Rwanda?
A.	Yes, I returned to Rwanda on the xxx  of xxxxxxxxx 2003.
Q.	Do you still reside there today?
A.	Yes, I came here from Rwanda.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordship, I have finished the examination-in-chief.  Thank you for your attention.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.  Madam Prosecutor, or is it Mr. Prosecutor?  Counsel for the Prosecution, do you wish to undertake cross-examination of the witness?
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness, on the 8th of April as Rukira commune was burning, you were able to wander freely, weren't you, all the way to Rusumo commune?
A.	I said that on the 8th, I went to visit my maternal aunt, when they were beginning to set fire to houses on the 7th in Kigarama commune.  It wasn't in Rukira that houses were being set afire on that date.
Q.	It's correct, isn't it, Witness, that on the 8th of April, houses were burning in the Rukira commune?
A.	No, it was in Kigarama commune houses were being set afire.
Q.	On the 12th of April 1994, there were an attack at Rukira commune, wasn't there?
A.	Yes, an attack was launched against the parish.
Q.	During that attack people were killed, weren't they?
A.	Yes, people were killed.
Q.	You've told us about their attack because you were present, weren't you?
A.	No, I wasn't part of the attack, but people came to us from the vicinity and they told us that people had been killed in the course of that attack.
Q.	So you have no first-hand knowledge, do you, of that attack?
A.	Personally, I did not witness that attack.
Q.	On the 13th of April, when people were killed at Rukira communal office, you told us about that attack and you were present, weren't you?
A.	I did not say that the people were killed on the 13th, but it was on the 13th that the Rukira communal office was attacked.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I should like the Prosecution to change the line of questioning.  This is the third question put.  He's never said he was put in prison.  He never said he was in Rusumo on the 8th. 
These are questions asked that have nothing to do with what happened.  The way the question is being asked, the witness is forced to answer, no.  I should like that line of questioning to be pursued unless we have any direct questions for the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I already told you once that in the course of cross-examination, matters can be raised and the witness questioned in relation to those matters that maybe the Prosecution wants to elucidate.  Just let the witness answer.  

Please, continue.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	On the 13th of April you were present, weren't you, during the attack on the Rukira commune?
A.	No, I was not present, but the answer -- the information is given to me by the prisoners from my area who were present  in the course of attack and who told me that the communal office had been attacked and the prisoners had escaped and people had been killed in the course of that attack.
Q.	You've told us that at Nyarubuye parish attackers were required to wear banana leaves and you wore banana leaves too, didn't you?
A.	Personally, I was not wearing banana leaves.  As much as the gendarme who were based very near to where I was working, I asked them not to wear banana leaves.
Q.	What weapon were you carrying at the attack on Nyarubuye parish?
A.	I did not wear a weapon.  I only went there so as not to meet the same fate as someone who was killed on the pretext he was an Inkotanyi accomplice.
Q.	When you got to the parish, you say that someone addressed the refugees and said, "Those who are innocent, come out"; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, someone called lieutenant who asked those inside -- addressed those inside, saying that the innocent should come out.
Q.	Of the large number of people at the parish that day who were murdered, only five came out and you saw only two, didn't you?
A.	Subsequently, other people emerged from the corpses.  People emerged or had been victims of the attack, and some of those people are still alive.
Q.	So, who were the innocent people that came out?
A.	You want to know their names?
Q.	Do you know their names?
A.	No, I do not know their names.
Q.	What crime had all of the other people in the parish who you were attacking, what crime had they committed?
A.	To my knowledge, they had committed no crime.  It is perhaps the gendarme who knew what crimes they had committed because they were the ones who planned the attack.
Q.	You were involved weren't you, Witness, in planning that attack?
A.	No, I was never implicated -- involved in planning the attack because all the people who came to Nyarubuye had been forced to follow the gendarme -- had been forced by the gendarme to follow the gendarme.
Q.	But you weren't (inaudible,) were you, Witness, because one of the gendarmes had even given you permission not to wear banana leaves that day?
A.	I was afraid even if I didn't wear banana leaves.  Imagine for the first time, firing and explosions.  It is frightening, it is fearsome.
Q.	Why is it that you alone were excused from wearing banana leaves when all of the other attackers wore them?  What special relationship did you have with the people that planned this massacre?
A.	I told you that people were ordered to wear banana leaves.  I didn't wear any.  That is not to say that everybody wore banana leaves.  There were others that didn't wear them, but since I was very close to the gendarme and they were my neighbours in Mulindi, I did not wear banana leaves.
Q.	So not only were you given special permission not to wear banana leaves, Witness, but you didn't have a weapon either, did you?
A.	Yes, I did not wear a weapon.  You know, the people were ordered to wear banana leaves as a way of frightening people, but when you look at it closely, it wasn't really a problem because banana leaves are not a weapon, but, rather, a way of frightening people.  And the gendarme were leading the attack, and when they ordered people to wear banana leaves they couldn't refuse, but nonetheless if someone asked them permission not to wear the banana leaves, they were given permission not to.
Q.	So, you would have us believe that in the middle of this extremely threatening situation, you had the liberty to turn to a gendarme and say, "I don't want to wear banana leaves.  Please don't let me wear banana leaves", when you were in the front row of the attack.  Is that what you want us to believe, Witness?
A.	No, I told you the gendarme found us in Mulindi and forcibly led us, and I told you that I worked very near where they were based, so I don't think it's a problem to tell them that I do not wish to wear banana leaves.
Q.	Now, Witness, you've told us you were forced to loot from the corpses.  What did you personally loot?
A.	We were asked to go into the parish enclosure to loot everything that was there and put it in the gendarme's vehicle.
Q.	I'm asking, what did you personally loot from the dead bodies of the victims at the Nyarubuye parish?
A.	Personally, I did not take anything from the corpses of the victims.  I did not walk away with anything.  I did not leave with anything.
Q.	Witness, you've told us you were terrified and that you were forced to loot.  Are you now telling us that you weren't under any duress and that you could freely walk away and not loot?  Did you have that choice?
A.	I told you that we were forced to enter the parish enclosure to pillage.  We were forced.  We went into the enclosure, but the fact of entering the enclosure doesn't mean that one should necessarily leave with anything.  However, some people looted property, put it in the gendarme vehicle.  They took bags belonging to victims or furniture from the church, but I personally did not take anything.
Q.	Now, how long did this looting take?
A.	I would say that the looting, pillaging, approximately -- but I can't really make an estimate because I immediately left because I didn't stay with the others.  I went home well before the gendarme, so I cannot give you an estimation.
Q.	How long did you stand and watch the looting?
A.	I told you that when we were forced to enter the parish enclosure, I entered and immediately left.  I did not stay long, not long.
Q.	So, in fact, you weren't forced to loot at all, were you?
A.	I was forced to enter the enclosure to take property, but upon emerging, exiting, I immediately left, and I immediately departed and left the gendarme and the people there.
Q.	So, in the presence of a gendarme who was armed and forcing you to loot, you were able to leave; that's right, isn't it Witness?
A.	When they ordered the people to enter the parish enclosure and they were firing, they themselves went into the enclosure, so they forced us to go into the enclosure and take things and put them in their vehicle.  And as soon as I went in, I immediately came out again and I left them there.  I immediately departed home.
Q.	I want you to answer my question.  In the presence of an armed gendarme, you said you were forced to loot, but you didn't loot, did you?  You were able to leave.  Yes or no, Witness.
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Yes or no, Witness?
A.	We were forced -- firstly, we were forced to enter the enclosure, and I entered the enclosure.  Upon emerging, I immediately went home.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?  We did not hear the question, but we heard the answer.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	The question was:  In the presence of an armed gendarme who was forcing you to loot, you were able to leave?
A.	I answered that the gendarme forced us to enter the enclosure and they themselves entered, and when I emerged, I immediately went home.
Q.	So, now you're changing your evidence aren't you, Witness?  Earlier you told us you were forced to loot; now you tell us you were only forced to enter, but you were able to leave.
A.	When they asked us to enter by force -- when they forced us to enter, they told us to take the goods, take the property, and put it in their vehicle.
Q.	Witness, I'm not going to leave this question until I get a direct answer.  Earlier you told us that you were forced to loot, and now you're telling us you were only forced to enter.  You weren't forced to loot and you were free to leave.  You are changing your evidence, aren't you?
A.	I told you that we were forced to enter to take it -- things from inside the parish and put -- that is, to loot and then put them in their vehicles.  But when I went in, I was able to come out again, and as soon as I got out, I went straight home.
Q.	You weren't forced to loot at all, were you, Witness?
A.	But if I hadn't been forced, why would I have gone in?  I couldn't have gone in.  I would have stayed outside the enclosure.
Q.	I understand why you're evading the question, but you have to give a yes or no or we're going to keep repeating it.  You told us you were forced to loot --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, they said, "You are eluding the question, but you will -- should answer."  That is not a question, that is a comment.  The witness has answered it on several occasions, but we have other witnesses to get through.  It was a comment from the Counsel from the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, there might be a problem with the translation, but what I understood from Counsel for Prosecution was that the question was not being answered, and they want the witness to answer the question more directly.  But there's no need to argue about that; I think we can continue.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, when you entered the building, were there the gendarmes?  They were outside the building or they entered together with you?
THE WITNESS:
We entered the compound together?  Yes, with the gendarmes, except for one gendarme that remained near the vehicle and was receiving the belongings of property that was being handed to him from the building.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Should I understand that when you came out of the building, there were nobody who could prevent you leaving from this place?
THE WITNESS:
There were many of us coming out of the building, and I slipped away at one point.
JUDGE EGOROV:
And there were gendarmes who could prevent you leaving this place?

THE WITNESS:
Yes, they could prevent me - they could have prevented me from leaving if they had seen me.
JUDGE EGOROV:
I see, thank you. 
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	So, Witness, I want a short answer to my question.  You didn't loot, did you?
A.	I have told you that I went back without carrying anything out of the parish.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for counsel, please.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	It's correct, isn't it, Witness, that it takes less than 10 minutes to travel in a vehicle from near Nyarubuye parish to the border of Nyarubuye and Kankobwa secteur, doesn't it?
A.	Did you say Kankobwa?
Q.	Yes, I said Kankobwa.
A.	I don't know where the border is between Kankobwa and Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness, do you recall making a statement to Defence investigators on the 30th of July 2003?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you knew when you were making that statement, didn't you, that you were going to be called to testify in Arusha?
A.	The person who contacted me interviewed me and asked me if I could come and testify before this Tribunal, and I said that I was willing to come and testify.
Q.	Witness, without revealing any personal information, I want you to tell us how many years of schooling you've had.
A.	I completed my secondary education.
Q.	So you speak and read French, don't you?
A.	I can read, but it's been a long time since I last read.
Q.	Witness, you told us today that you saw Sylvestre Gacumbitsi on the 8th of April 1994, didn't you?
A.	Yes, that's correct, I saw him.  I did see him on the 8th of April.
Q.	You've told us today that on the 13th of April 1994, the commune of Rukira was attacked, hadn't you?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	You also told us about an attack on the parish on the 12th in Rukira.
A.	Yes, that's correct, there was an attack.
Q.	You've told us that you were carrying no weapon at Nyarubuye parish, haven't you?
A.	I was not carrying a weapon.
Q.	You've told us that at Nyarubuye parish, you heard someone tell the innocent to come out, hadn't you?  When you were interviewed by --
A.	Yes, I did hear someone state those words.
Q.	When you were interviewed by investigators, knowing that you were coming here to testify, you didn't mention, did you, that you saw Gacumbitsi on the 8th of April?
A.	The person who was questioning me, perhaps, did not put that question to me, but when you put the question to me, I had to answer your question.
Q.	I didn't put the question to you, Witness.  This is information you gave in evidence-in-chief.  Now, yes or no, you didn't tell investigators, did you?
A.	He may have put the question to me, or he may not have.  If he put the question to me, I answered and perhaps he did not write down my answer, but in that case, it would be the investigators fault and not mine.
Q.	You didn't tell the investigators about the attack on Rukira parish on the 12th, did you?
A.	I did not speak of this event because they were asking questions about events that took place in Rusumo commune and not about events that took place in Rukira commune.
Q.	You didn't tell investigators about the attack in Rukira commune on the 13th, did you?
A.	I have told you that I could speak about those events because he was asking questions that were specifically about the events that took place in the Rusumo commune.
Q.	When you were questioned by investigators about the attack on Nyarubuye parish you said, and I quote: "We were carrying our household weapons, i.e., machetes, hoes, spears, arrows, while the gendarmes carried firearms."  That's what you told investigators, isn't it?
A.	I told them that the persons who were forced to participate in the attack were carrying traditional weapons and that the gendarmes had their own weapons.
Q.	So your answer is, yes, you did tell investigators exactly what I read to you, didn't you?
A.	I told them that people were forced -- were taken by force, and they had to take any weapon that was lying around, machetes, clubs, stuns, and then they were forced to go to Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness, listen to my question and answer my question.  You told investigators, and I quote: "We were carrying our household weapons, i.e., machetes, hoes, spears, arrows, while the gendarmes had firearms."  Now, you told that to investigators, didn't you?  Yes or no, Witness.  We don't need a long explanation at this stage.
A.	He might have miswritten my statement because I personally was not carrying any weapons.
Q.	You also failed to tell investigators that someone had said, "The innocent should come out", didn't you, Witness?  Another oversight on your part.
A.	I would have told him that if he had asked me a question about that.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, this might be an appropriate time to break for coffee.  I have one more line of questioning for the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall now observe a 15-minute break.  This hearing is adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1105H to 1125H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Could the Prosecutor continue cross-examination of the witness.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Thank you, Madam President.  At this stage of cross-examination, I will apply for a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any questions that could lead to the divulging of the witness's identity?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Yes, Madam President, this final phase of my cross-examination goes to many matters that could divulge the witness's identity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, thank you.  We therefore order closed session to ensure the protection of the witness.  (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 34 to 37] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel Kouengoua, who is your next witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Witness RCR, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We shall start with open session now.  The witness is RDR?
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Yes, I believe, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Please usher in Witness RDR.  

Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
You are a protected witness, and you shall be known under the pseudonym RDR.  You are the Witness RDR.  You will be examined by the Defence, cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  The Judges may put some questions to you and the Defence may also proceed to a re-examination.  Before answering the questions, we shall ask you to make a solemn declaration administered by the registry. 
	(Declaration made by Witness RDR, in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  Thank you, registry.  

Counsel Kouengoua, you have the floor. 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 	
Madam President, Your Honour, Defence respectfully requests that the entire testimony of this witness be given in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Will you explain the reasons for your request in closed session.
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

I suppose that there is no objection from the Prosecution, so we shall go into closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you, Counsel.  Pray proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.  As regards this witness, Madam President, the Defence respectfully prays, respectfully but firmly prays, that the entire testimony be taken in closed session.
MR. RAMADAN:
Madam President, the Defence counsel has given no leave of the moment, and the Prosecution has therefore the right to object.  If he will bring us his reasons in closed session --
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Very well.  We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  We shall go into closed session, and counsel for the Defence will explain the grounds for his request.

1705H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, we are in open session.  That was the last witness you had for us for the week? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It is my last witness for the week.  It is the last witness we have in Arusha, and we are wondering what we do about the Judge.

We have two witnesses, YW3 and XW15; we have the expert witness who was to be heard after Monday 25th; we have Professor Lecomte and Professor Vorhaouer from Paris, but at the present moment since the last witness has testified and the third Judge is still not there, we should like the Trial Chamber to tell us what we do with the actual witnesses for whom the WVSS has said yesterday -- for whom WVSS stated yesterday at the hearing that they are preparing the papers.  If they arrive here, whereas there are no hearings, I will be held responsible.  It has happened before.

I should rather not that this occur again, so I very respectfully pray the Bench to tell me what I should do with these various witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, indeed Judge Reddy will only be back here by the end of the month, on the 31st, in principle.

As regards the witnesses, there are no further witnesses on the spot since WVSS tells us that they are processing the papers in respect of those witnesses, so they are not yet scheduled. 

So I think you had better schedule the other witnesses for early November, because the three Judges will then be present.  The Judges will be involved in other matters, but we can always find the time to hear a few witnesses. 

We should also know as far as the experts are concerned what we will do, because you told us of two pathologists, forensic pathologists, and we need a document to tell us what these forensic pathologists are coming here to tell us. 

As of now, if it is absolutely necessary for forensic pathologists to come here, it is quite enough to have one, we don't need two.  And as regards Ndengejeho, the other expert witness, we have received an objection on the part of the Prosecution.  I don't know if you have received it, whether you have been served with that document which we have received.  So we have to examine all these problems, because the Prosecution objects:  first of all, does not accept the report, if I correctly understood; and secondly, the Prosecution wants to know whether, if the witness is to be heard, that the Prosecution be allowed to cross-examine the witness. 
We should like to know if you yourself have the intention to examine the expert witness and how long it would take, because it should not take more than a day, maximum a day and a half, because as we told you, from the end of the month we are going to be very busy, all of us respectively, and we ask you therefore to make efforts so that we can hear the two factual witnesses and the potential NQ4 -- you have not made any application, so we still don't know what you intend to do with him -- and the three expert witnesses that you had been planning to cite.  So it is about time you made all these matters clear to us.  As you know, the Trial Chamber can refuse an expert witness's appearance.  We should like to know before that exactly what those expert witnesses are going to contribute to your client's cause.

That is what I wanted to tell you, but I do not see how we can sit as a Bench of two any further.  So that implies that we must await November, early November, if you will, we can settle remaining matters.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The question can be answered, but there is a difficulty.  Could the Trial Chamber tell us -- could the Bench tell us, as Judge Reddy will only be present after 31st of October, "We can hear your witnesses until the 2nd, the 3rd, the 4th or the 5th", but the witness (sic) does not seem to be saying what is the time limit, because I think there is the trial of the ministers which is beginning on the 3rd in which the Judges will be sitting.  If Judge Reddy arrives on the 31st, how are things going to happen?

I think that the other question with regard to the testimony of the expert witnesses, the Trial Chamber could decide that the reports of the expert witnesses are accepted as exhibits.  It all depends what you want to do with this, what the Bench intends to do with it, but we should like to know, we of the Defence, the factual witnesses and the others, what is the deadline for their testimony?  Because we were told that we should do our best for the presentation of the Defence evidence by the end of October, but there has been this unforeseen occurrence.  So if you could tell us we could make the necessary inference, and if counsel for the Prosecution can make the necessary arrangements so it doesn't all depend on the Defence or the Bench.  I don't know how it is going to happen exactly, but could you tell us how much longer the trial will last?  While it was supposed to end by the 31st of October, and on the basis of what we were told we have tried to coordinate our activities.  But in the present state of affairs, it is somewhat delicate.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, pray proceed. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it would appear counsel is trying to create or perceive obstacles where there are none.  My understanding of what Madam President has said is that there is a possibility that we may be able to sit in November.  Our request, Your Honours, is that this possibility be looked into in greater detail.  We are fully aware that three Judges of this Chamber will be involved in other trials, but we believe that in consultation with the President of the Tribunal and registry, if we were given priority as a case that is in its last stages of the Defence hearing, we wouldn't mind if there was a shift, for example, and Mil. 1 could sit in the morning and we could be given the afternoon or vice versa, just so that we can dispose of outstanding business.  And at least this is what we understood Your Lordship to be suggesting, and we fully support it and we are ready to proceed on those terms. 

Regarding the experts, we are yet to receive the expert reports of the pathologists, and at this stage, therefore, we cannot comment on the relevance or probative value.  We reserve our right, of course, once we are served with reports, whether to raise objection or not.  In the meantime, it would be courteous of counsel if he could serve on us the detailed curricula vitae of all the experts he intends to call. 

Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua.  We thank the Prosecutor. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I don't think that Defence can accept what the Prosecutor has just said.  The Defence is not raising any obstacle.  I think that everyone is aware of the fact that the Defence is looking for ways and means for everything to proceed as smoothly as possible for this case in this Trial Chamber.  I will say again that we were prepared to complete our case by the 31st of October 2003.  The current situation is not the fault of the Defence.  Absolutely not, Madam President.  We have put in the request for the appointment of the expert witnesses in time.  We introduced the list of witnesses in good time, and I really would have liked that what the Prosecutor has just said could have been said on the 28th of July or August, because we are dealing with human science, and in fact what we say today is not necessarily true tomorrow.  If we had known that this obstacle might arise, then we would have done everything possible to deal with it in anticipation.  

The Defence is here in good faith to provide all contribution to find a solution to the problem.  If the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that it is said that the Judge will come on the 31st and we shall continue without telling us when we are going to stop, then that is a problem.

Wouldn't it be possible in that case, and this is my contribution to the matter, that we organise an informal status conference Friday or Monday, and once we have all of the information we can decide.  I mean, what the Prosecutor has said really here in the courtroom might lead us on a path that might not be the one that we would choose if we have the time to choose the proper path. 
And, Madam President, if there is someone in this courtroom who would like to see the case finish on the 31st, that is the Defence.  And we would rather not be in Arusha on the 1st of November 2003, and we have done everything we can.  We are paying for the witnesses who had already been brought to Arusha.

So someone should -- my learned friend should not say that we are the ones raising the obstacles.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, I think that we must remain serene until the very end, and I wanted to thank you, actually, because I feel that you have cooperated, and it is because of your cooperation that we were able to bring this trial to the current stage we are in.  But we will have to find solutions to the problems being raised, and these problems are not the fault of any particular person, these are unforeseen events.  The Judge had to absent himself, and even if we wanted to continue, we could not continue because the witnesses are not here. 

We can suggest a date.  We were waiting to find out if you were open to our suggestions.  Now it seems that the parties are willing to listen to us.  We had already raised the problem with the President of the Tribunal and also with the court management section, but first we wanted to obtain your consent, and once your consent was obtained then this could be finalised.

This is what we suggest:  there is no reason to bring the witnesses now because I think there are still problems that need to be resolved with respect to these witnesses.  Therefore, we shall sit after the 3rd of November on other cases, but we can make arrangements to sit, for example, on the Government trial, Government 1, in the morning -- or the so-called Government 1 and the so-called Military trial in the morning, and then in the afternoon perhaps we could sit in for Gacumbitsi, and this would allow us to continue as of the 3rd of November.  And I believe that in view of the fact that we do not have many witnesses to hear, perhaps in a week we should be able to finish, and if we are not able to complete within the first week, then possibly we can continue into the second week of November if everyone agrees.  But that is what we can say.  Nevertheless, we believe that we should be able to complete on the 7th of November. 

Now, as an informal meeting that you suggested, that is true, we can meet again if you wish.  I am prepared to meet with all of the parties, perhaps in my office.  Instead of having to organise a status conference, we could meet in my office and have a meeting to resolve the pending matters. 

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor is ready to abide your decision and proceed on the 3rd of November as proposed.  We have no objection.  However, there are matters that may not lend themselves to an efficient utilisation of trial days if we start on the 3rd November, the first being the availability of the factual witnesses.  WVSS did mention that they would be available after 31st October, so the question is, will they be in Arusha for trial on 3rd November? 

The second point relates to the pathologists.  Just assuming for a moment that their expert report was filed tomorrow, the 22nd of October, the earliest they can testify would be after 21 days, which would be the 12th of November, so that too creates problems.  And in order maybe, Your Honours, to circumvent those problems, we may wish to start on Monday, 10th November, rather than on Monday, 3rd November, so that once we start on the 10th of November with the assurance that all the outstanding witnesses, expert and factual, are in town, we can proceed with the trial on a non-stop basis and conclude it. 

What we are avoiding is starting on 3rd November and not being able to proceed for the rest of the week.  I would rather if we started, we went through this trial and disposed of all the witnesses smoothly, rather than having the hearings truncated by absences and the like.  Most obliged, Your Honours.

	1730H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, it's true the expert report -- reports have not yet been filed -- as far as the forensic pathologists know, they haven't -- and it's true that this problem might delay us somewhat because -- as the report must be filed twenty-one days before the witnesses come to testify, that might cause some problems.  I had made a suggestion that we begin on the 3rd of November.  Now the Prosecutor has made a suggestion that we begin on the 10th of November so that all of the witnesses can be there and the twenty-one day delay might be respected. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, wouldn't it be possible to waive the rights to the twenty-one day filing?  That is a decision -- I mean, the parties must execute the decision as ordered by the Trial Chamber.  I think that if you were to voluntarily execute a decision that it cannot be said that it was imposed to you subsequently.  

We are looking for ways and means to deal with a difficult situation and I think that perhaps the Prosecutor should make additional concessions to the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would like to bring to your attention that this is a perversion of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  It is not up to the Trial Chamber to determine this time limit. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President; absolutely, Madam President.  

Madam President, the Trial Chamber, the parties are the Defence and the Prosecutor.  My suggestion remains on the table because we have just finished with four witnesses.  Perhaps we could meet as a small committee and perhaps we might find a solution overnight.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Just --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Just one moment, Your Honour.  I don't intend to waste much of the Chamber's time, but since you agreed in principle to having a small conference in your office later this week, Your Lordships could consult WVSS and confirm availability of witnesses for November so that by the time we meet we can make an informed decision on which date to start, be it the 3rd or the 10th.  As long as all the parties are agreed that we can proceed in November on an afternoon shift basis, the final details are all contingent upon witness availability and the twenty-one day rule, and WVSS should be in a position to advise Your Lordships on the scheduled arrivals and departures of witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  I believe that it would be best if we were to meet in my office.  We shall agree on the date.  Please, I would like to request that the parties keep in touch and we shall choose a date.  After that, we shall be able to set the dates on which the hearing shall resume.  

Very well, at this stage of the proceedings we shall now adjourn the trial without being able to decide on a date now, but there will be a date in November.   We will sit again in November and we shall advise each and everyone who is interested of the dates, once we have agreed with the parties.  

We thank everyone, and this session is adjourned, unless there are any other questions.  

(Court adjourned at 1735H)
