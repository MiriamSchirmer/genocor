P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is now in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  

Would the Registrar be kind enough to read the cause list? 
MS. THOMPSON:
Yes, Your Honour.  Good afternoon.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Sergey Egorov and Judge Jai Reddy, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 17th of November 2003, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, case No. ICTR-01-64-T.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam.  We should like to invite the parties to present themselves, beginning with counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is represented by Melanie Werrett, Chief of Prosecutions, and myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Thank you very much.  

I now turn to the Defence.  Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam, Your Honours, distinguished members of the Tribunal, including the interpreters and the court stenographers.  Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is represented by Anne Mbattang, myself, and we are assisted by Mr. Tharcisse Gatarama.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.  We have been seized of a Defence motion to reconsider our decision of 11th November last.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any motions to raise before the Trial Chamber? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours, the Prosecutor doesn't have motions.  However, the Prosecutor wishes to raise two housekeeping matters for your attention before we proceed with the hearing today. 

The first one goes to form and the other is substantive and is related to the Defence motion filed this afternoon.  And with your leave, we'd like to submit on these two matters.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor to raise the matters you wish to raise. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honours.  
The first matter, Your Honour, which I said goes to form, concerns the programme for completion of the Defence case.  We were notified last Friday there'd only be two factual witnesses this week.  Now, in the informal status conference held in your chamber on or about the 22nd of October this year, with Judge Egorov in attendance, it was my understanding that in the event of the non-availability of the expert to testify after the factual witnesses, the Accused would be required to take the stand. 

Now, subsequent to that meeting, Your Honours, Defence counsel contested that position.  So we would like to learn from the Chamber what the exact position is and submit that an earlier resolution enables all parties here to plan from an even keel. 

The second and more important matter, Your Honours, arises from your decision of 11th November concerning the Prosecutor's motion for the exclusion of the expert report and proposed evidence of Pascal Ndengejeho.  The Prosecutor  now seeks directions, Your Honours, on how this Chamber proposes to proceed with the evidence of Pascal Ndengejeho in light of your decision. 

Now, during lunchtime, Your Honours, the Defence filed a motion seeking a reconsideration of your decision of 11th November concerning the expert.  I'm hesitant, Your Honours, to join issue with the Defence on its request for review because I've not fully read or understood the motion, having been filed during the lunch break in a language I have difficulty with.  I will, however, proceed to raise Prosecutor's concerns regarding your decision. 

Now, in the said decision, Your Honours, you partially granted the Prosecutor's motion and disqualified Pascal Ndengejeho as an expert but permitted him to testify as a Defence witness nonetheless to matters concerning Rusumo commune during the months April and May 1994.  Now, our understanding of your decision, Your Honours, and which we submit ought to be the correct interpretation, is that witness Pascal Ndengejeho cannot proffer opinion evidence, having been disqualified as an expert.  He can only appear as a witness of fact, like the past 18 Defence witnesses heard so far.  This presupposes, Your Honours, that Ndengejeho was a witness to facts in issue before you and that his evidence can assist in the proper determination of these issues if his evidence is relevant and probative. 

Now, two issues arise from this interpretation of your decision.  First, it's a matter of public record that Pascal Ndengejeho took refuge at the French embassy in Kigali on the 8th of April 1994, where he remained until the 12th of April 1994, when he was evacuated by the French air force to Bujumbura.  At no time relevant to the charges in the indictment was Pascal Ndengejeho in Rusumo commune.  It would follow, therefore, Your Honours, that he cannot be a witness of fact in compliance with paragraph 9 of your decision.  And we submit, Your Honours, that had you adverted to this fact, your decision would probably have been different. 

The second but related issue concerning the limitations you've placed on the content of his testimony arises from the exhibits that the Defence seek to tender into evidence through this witness, namely, videos of the Belgian Senate enquiry.  We submit, Your Honours, that this is a most insidious, if not underhand, method of introducing other people's evidence onto the record without giving the adverse party the right to test such evidence through cross-examination.  The Defence has had all the opportunity to call Luc Marechal and Marcel Guerin to testify for Gacumbitsi, but have chosen not to, and ought not to be allowed to present such untested evidence by way of videotapes.  

We submit, Your Honours, that to permit such conduct would be to undermine the provisions of 
Rule 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence which require that a witness be heard directly by a Chamber unless a deposition is granted pursuant to Rule 71.

Now, these matters, Your Honours, are complicated further because this witness, who was neither in Rusumo nor is an expert, does not come to this Chamber without bias.  He has opined in the conclusion to his report that the Accused Gacumbitsi is innocent.  And we submit, Your Honours, that by doing so, he invades your province as triers of fact in circumstances, Your Honours, where he has not heard the witnesses you have heard in this trial.  He has, Your Honours -- and if I may be facetious -- become a fourth judge whose sole purpose is to sum up the case for the Defence.  Indeed, Your Honours, I'm prepared to waive cross-examination of this witness altogether if the Defence will waive its closing statement, because that is what Ndengejeho is here to do and is doing so in a manner that is most insidious and contrary to fair play.  

The long and short of my request, Your Honours, is that short of reviewing your decision altogether, you ought to give clear directions on what is properly permissible before this Tribunal, which we submit is testimony within the confines of Rules 89 and 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  One, the evidence ought to be relevant and have probative value for it to be admitted onto the record; two, a witness must be heard directly by this Chamber unless a deposition is granted under Rule 71. That, Your Honours, is my brief submission regarding the Prosecutor's request for directions. 

Concerning, Your Honours, the Defence motion filed during the lunch hour today, I wish to make brief comment seriatim.  In the paragraphs, Your Honours, on legal reasoning, the Defence does not state the legal basis of their motion for review or reconsideration.  We submit, Your Honours, that the powers of revision are spelt out in Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and only apply to final judgments, and decisions are not decisions such as the decision of this Chamber of 
11th November 2003.  We concede, however, that Your Honours retain the inherent powers under Rule 54 to revisit your own decisions in the interests of justice. 

From a closer reading, Your Honours, of the Defence motion, though couched as a request for revision or reconsideration, it's actually an appeal against your decision of 11th November 2003.  The Defence is impugning your decision and asking you to sit in appellate jurisdiction, and we submit that there's no legal basis for such an appeal. 

I now turn, Your Honours, to the grounds that the Defence advance in support of the appeal.  The first is that your decision is contrary to Article 20, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Statute, insofar as it denies the Accused a fair hearing.  Nowhere, Your Honours, does counsel show how the Accused has been denied a fair hearing by reason of your decision.  We submit that the disqualification of an expert and the exclusion of evidence are clearly matters at the discretion of this Chamber and counsel has failed to show how such discretion has been erroneously exercised. 

Under chapter 2 of the Defence motion, Your Honours, they cite -- the Defence cites a number of what they refer to as erroneous grounds.  The Defence also refers to a Prosecution motion dated 
17th October 2003 regarding its objection to the expert report of Pascal Ndengejeho.   We correct the impression, Your Honours, that it was a motion.  It wasn't a motion, but rather a notice of objection filed within 14 days, which is a mandatory requirement under Rule 94 bis.  This notice, Your Honours, did not bar the Prosecution from filing a substantive motion under Rules 54, 73 and 89 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence for the exclusion of the proposed evidence and the report of Pascal Ndengejeho.  And we submit, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor's motion of 3rd November 2003 was properly before Your Lordships and is common practice when screening experts at a preliminary hearing in order to determine whether an expert should be accepted or not. 

The Defence further submit, Your Honours, in the motion that Trial Chamber III in 
The Prosecutor v. Semanza qualified Pascal Ndengejeho as a witness.  We submit, Your Honours, that is a misstatement of the record in Semanza, which we placed before you in support of our application.  The transcript of 28th January 2002 in the case of The Prosecutor v. Semanza will not only indicate that I was on the record present in court on that day for the Prosecution but that Trial Chamber III, presided over by Judge Lloyd Williams, disqualified Ndengejeho as an expert witness and only allowed him to testify in the interests of justice.  Your decision therefore, Your Honours, is entirely in harmony with the approach taken by Trial Chamber III in the Semanza case. 
JUDGE REDDY:
So what was the scope of his evidence in the Semanza case? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
In the Semanza case, Your Honours, he was ordered to testify on particular paragraphs, allegations in the indictment, particularly paragraph 2 of the Semanza indictment and paragraph 7. 
JUDGE REDDY:
So would similar limitations in this particular instance meet the, if I might call them, "expectations" of the Prosecution? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Unfortunately, Your Honours, they wouldn't because we have very little expectations from this witness and what he proffers in the interests of justice because he's been disqualified as an expert and can therefore only appear as a witness of fact.  

In the strictest sense, he cannot appear as a witness of fact because he was never in Rusumo during the months of April and May of 1994, because it's a matter of public record both in the Semanza trial and in the Cyangugu trial 2nd of July 2002 that this witness was evacuated from Rwanda, from Kigali, by the French air force on the 12th of April 1994.  So he cannot testify from knowledge as a witness of fact of what happened in Rusumo.  And you have heard witnesses of fact both for the Prosecution and for the Defence who were present in Rusumo at all times relevant to the allegations in the indictment.  And that is why Your Honours' decision makes it quite complicated unless directions are given -- specific directions are given elaborating on your ruling at paragraph 9, what is this witness going to testify to if he wasn't in Rwanda and has never been back.  

If it's a question of reading newspaper articles, I'm sure Your Lordships too can read newspaper articles and reach your own conclusions.  

With your leave, I'll go back to the Defence motion filed today under the heading "Lack of Equity" in which the Defence submits that a work plan was agreed on but that the Chamber went ahead and made a decision on the ground that no response had been filed by the Defence, which is erroneous, Your Honours.  

The lack of response referred to in your decision of 11th of November is a Defence response to the Prosecutor's motion for exclusion of the evidence of Ndengejeho filed on the 3rd of November.  Now, pursuant to Rule 73, the legal basis of that Prosecution motion, the Defence was obliged to respond within five days.  In the event that it didn't, Your Lordships were entitled, as you did, to rule on the motion. 

In conclusion, Your Honours, we'd submit that the Defence motion should not be entertained as it amounts to an appeal, a misconceived appeal, over which you have no jurisdiction, and should therefore be struck out.  We are most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  I think you have gone a bit beyond housekeeping matters, but now we will invite the Defence in the person of Counsel Kouengoua to respond. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I must admit that at this point in time -- at this juncture where I stand before you, I'm somewhat embarrassed.  I'm all the more embarrassed at the comportment of counsel for the Prosecution, the Chamber will have noted; I don't know whether I'm responding to the Chamber or what the Prosecutor has said because the question put to the Prosecutor was, "Do you have any motions?"  And he answered that he didn't have any motions, only housekeeping matters.  Now, how can you in dealing with housekeeping matters address a matter of a motion raised by one of the parties?  I just don't think that's possible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray continue. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President.  I was saying that when matters of housekeeping are addressed and that is introduced in dealing with a motion by one of the parties, I don't think that is pertinent, but I should not like that tomorrow before this Chamber it be said that Gacumbitsi had at any time done anything to slow down his trial or hinder the proper functioning of the Trial Chamber, and that is what the Prosecutor wants, and we will not follow him down that road.

Madam President, the matters that arises now, while awaiting the Prosecution to read my motion, on the 3rd of November, the Prosecutor raised a motion and at the end of which he requested that a decision be taken before the 17th of November 2003.  We are at the 17th of November 2003, a date on which we should have heard my witnesses of fact.  What the Prosecutor must say in order to allow all the parties to advance and the Trial Chamber to fulfil its task, why has he asked for a decision to be rendered before the 17th of December -- November, excuse me. 

Madam President, that is the question because -- but if the Prosecutor cannot ask that question, it comes back to me to ask the Trial Chamber to review their decision of the 17th of November.  I don't need to lay out the grounds for my motion.  But as -- I should like to tell the Prosecutor that as an attorney for the Tribunal, you have the imperium and you have the jurisdiction, it's up to you to analyse and decide.  If you had taken the trouble to see my motion -- to look at my motion, you will have seen that the sources of law are not only the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the Statute.  I also referred to case law, to precedents.  And the precedent is the precedent of the Tribunal.  It is constant and wise.  

Why doesn't the Prosecutor want for Gacumbitsi's trial to end on the 31st of October?  That was the date on which you'd asked us to conclude, and you did not extend the date.  Judge Reddy's availability is not a reason for extending delay.  How can you proudly stand before the Trial Chamber and say on the 3rd November you raised a motion, on what basis?  I think you should have concluded to allow the Trial Chamber to decide in chambers.  

When I filed the expert's report on the 6th of October in accordance with Rule 94(B)(i), (ii) and (iii), you are justifying my motion inasmuch as you dissimulated from me a procedure, and for reasons that I do not feel obliged to divulge here.  Remember on the 16th of October, what did you say in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Gacumbitsi?  The Defence must tell us, referring to Ndengejeho, for how long they intend to have him testify, because in Semanza it took two weeks for him to be examined and cross-examined.  Have you forgotten that, Mr. Prosecutor?  It was on page 58, I think.  I put that also in my motion. 

The Prosecutor made reference to various Rules and purported that there was some confusion on the part of the Defence team.  We are in open session for the truth.  I would want to be shown the text of Rule 94.  I would want to be shown Rule 94, which comprises (i) and (ii) since May 2003.  Yet, these are the points on which you succeeded in surprising the Judges by introducing a motion, whereas you did not have the right to do so.  You were time barred.  

And since this is not a matter of trickery, this is the Gacumbitsi case, it is not a closed session, Madam President, allow me to read the famous Rule 94, with your permission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 66(A) to Rule 73 bis(B), Rule 73(B) of the Rules, "The full statement of any expert witness called by a party shall be disclosed to the opposing party as early as possible and shall be filed with the Trial Chamber not less than twenty-one days prior to the date on which the expert is expected to testify.

"(B) Within fourteen days of filing of the statement of the expert witness, the opposing party shall file a notice to the Trial Chamber indicating whether: (i) it accepts the expert witness statement; or (ii) it wishes to cross-examine the expert witness; and (iii) if it wishes to cross-examine the expert witness."  

I had this witness testify on Monday, 6th October, at the end of the presentation of the Defence case.  On the 7th of October the Prosecutor responded and asked the Chamber in his notice to allow it to cross-examine the expert, and this is established.  

Prosecutor, I think that on 22 October, when we met for the smooth functioning of this Chamber, the Prosecutor knew what was -- still had to be done and who had to appear before this Chamber.  The only matter in issue which we were still discussing was to know whether it was useful for Professor Lecomte and the doctor to come both at the same time. 

Madam President, the Prosecutor responded on the 17th of October, as I said.  He said he was going to cross-examine the expert witness.  He recognised that witness's status expressly on 3 November, 28 days after, instead of the 14 days as imposed by the Rule.  How can he bring a motion challenging the status or the report filed by that witness?  The Prosecutor was time barred. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I am compelled to respond to the Prosecutor because I would like Gacumbitsi's trial to come to an end within the time limit that we agreed on jointly.  And I do not intend to shy away from this responsibility. 

Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor talked about 31 January.  No, it is rather the hearing of 22 January for an expert witness in the matter of Laurent Semanza, and your colleague who was the presiding Judge of that Trial Chamber at the time, in light or in view of the report and the discussions that followed during the hearing, was of the opinion that it was no longer possible to hear Pascal Ndengejeho on his entire report, but the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination were limited to paragraph 2, entitled "The Conflict in Rwanda -- Situation of the Armed Conflict in Rwanda from 1930," and the paragraph was entitled "Laurent Semanza, the big bourgmestre."  This is what was decided -- this is what was agreed on to be heard, but when I hear the Prosecutor say that it was out of favour, that it was out of indulgence that the funds of the Tribunal were committed to bring Ndengejeho to this Tribunal, this may appear true to the Prosecutor, but to me the decision made by the Bench is a decision that is binding on everyone and it is a decision that is made with seriousness.  How can you decide to hear an expert witness and then somebody comes to say that you did so simply because you had realised that the witness was already in Arusha?  Who is that insult directed to?  To the International Criminal Tribunal?  To the United Nations? 

Madam President, in the motion that I filed, I stated that -- I was referring to pages 16 to 70 and that will be beginning with paragraph 2 of the transcript.  And this cannot be the subject of any discussion whatsoever. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to understand.  The Prosecutor says that you do not have the power to review your own decision.  I would like the Prosecutor to tell me what Rule he relies on to overlook the time limit set by Rule 94.  Your Chamber advised the parties that these proceedings take place in mutual respect and friendliness.  The Prosecutor, who is used to calling me at night, I told him on the 22nd that I was leaving for Cameroon.  My professional domicile is in Cameroon.  Did he at any point in time verify whether his motion, which was no longer up to date or on time, whether that motion reached me?  He did not verify that.  

Prosecutor, in your motion of 22nd October you told the Trial Chamber that in the event you admitted Pascal Ndengejeho, the Prosecutor will request to cross-examine that witness.  Prosecutor, how can you cross-examine someone who was taken away from the French embassy since the 12th of April?  Why did you not disclose that information to the Bench so as to enable them to assess, even 
post facto, what you were saying?  I cannot come to the conclusion that you hid that fact.  Rather, I think that you yourself were not aware of that fact.  And when you are not aware of something, Prosecutor, a proverb in my village says that it is better under the circumstances to acquire more information before asserting what you cannot prove. 

Mr. Prosecutor, on 17 October you informed us that Pascal Ndengejeho had been examined for two weeks.  That is the expression you used, verbatim.  I was not there.  Gacumbitsi was not there.  Do you think that in two weeks he was asked for how many days he stayed in the embassy?  Have you had a look at the questions that were asked of him by Mr. Osuji, how many ministers were members of the cabinet, the political organisation, who were the ministers who were in charge of -- who held state powers?  To answer these questions, would it have been necessary to be at the Chinese embassy?  I do not think so. 

Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor repeated before you and before me, without him being embarrassed in any manner whatsoever, that when the Chamber noticed that the Defence was not responding to their motion of 3 November, that it was overlooked -- Madam President, this is what Rule 17 of the Rules says, unless the Chamber provides otherwise: When the time limit for filing a motion or when a motion --
THE ENGLISH INTERPETER:
Can the counsel tell us what Rule he's reading, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we would request that you finish within seven minutes.  You have filed a motion which is well developed.  I am simply asking you to answer the few questions asked by the Prosecutor, and please try to conclude as soon as possible.  We will be grateful for that. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I thank you.  I must confess that I was not expecting to carry out this exercise that the Prosecutor has subjected me to, and the danger is that he did not read.  I am compelled to read.  All that he presented to you is on the reverse on the 3rd of November; I was not here, but today I'm here.  And please, please, the time which you find precious is also precious to me.  

If the Prosecutor had said what I wrote, I would have ignored what he said, but in fact he tried to present the contrary, the opposite, of what I wrote.  Madam President, respectfully, if it is only a matter of time, allow me that later on I should make up for this through my witnesses, but the facts of today are so serious that if the Chamber does not allow me to explain those facts, Madam President, I'm sorry, but it is an ambush motion that has been filed behind me by the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is your opinion.  We have told you that you have five minutes to conclude.  We have given you as much time as we did give the Prosecutor.  You would agree the Prosecutor spoke for 20 minutes, and you have been speaking for more than 20 minutes.  We are not trying to limit your speaking time, but all we are telling you is that it is unnecessary to elaborate on this for much longer, so please try to conclude.  If you want to make a written submission, you can do so. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Very well.  Well, when you feel much pain, then you have to shout loud enough. 

Madam President, Your Honours, that being the case -- I said, Your Honours, because I should conclude -- I said that your Chamber has the power, has the right to review, to reconsider its decision of 11 November.  For what reasons?  At the time the Prosecutor filed this motion, you did not know that it was time barred.  The Prosecutor never told you in his motion that the expert witness was at the French embassy.  The Prosecutor never made it possible for you to know that Defence counsel did not receive disclosure of their motion.  And the review was already made on 18th July 2003 by trial -- in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Théoneste Bagosora et al.

On 31 March 2002 the Appeals Chamber of the same Chamber in the matter of 
The Prosecutor v. Barayagwiza had laid down the principle and admitted that a decision could be reviewed if, at the time it was rendered, the factual circumstances were not known to the Judge, and I have also brought to you that information today. 

Madam President, Your Honours, with all due respect, I am sure that you are going to accede to 
this -- you are going to grant this motion.  But since we are -- since this is a science and we are in the field of law, if the Chamber is of the opinion that its decision is irreversible, I respectfully submit, Madam President, Your Honours, that I should be allowed to apply Rule 73 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence by having recourse to other remedies.  Because one thing remained unexplained and it is that the Prosecutor so far -- I'm going to conclude soon -- the Prosecutor has not said why he required that the decision be delivered on the 17th.  I would have also liked -- well, the 17th was the date for resumption of trial and for the date when my witnesses had to be heard.  I would therefore strongly wish that the Trial Chamber give me -- or grant my motion, rather, before the Gacumbitsi trial, which was suspended and which had to resume today.  I think my motion should be granted.  It is a matter of fairness.  It is a matter of equity, and I know that equity is of utmost importance to your Chamber.  Over and above my client, it also goes to the credibility of your jurisdiction.  

In my motion I included Rule 15 -- or Article 15, entitled "Impartiality of the Trial":  The counsel are requested not to do anything that may cast discredit on the trial and the counsel must do everything so that no other person discredits the proceedings of the Tribunal.  

I thank you, and I will not fail in my duties.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Kouengoua. 

Prosecutor, do you have any response?  If not, we can proceed to an examination of the list of your witnesses for the continuation of the trial. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Just a very brief response, Your Honours, that counsel has failed to see the difference between the Prosecutor's notice of objection filed under 94 bis(B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the subsequent motion filed -- for exclusion filed under Rules 54, 73 and 89 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  The point I want to underscore, Your Honours, is that the notice of objection filed under 
94 bis(B) was not a bar to a substantive motion under Rules 54, 73 and 89(C) for the exclusion of evidence that we had indicated we'd object to. 

The second point, Your Honours, arises from counsel's allegations of lack of fairness, by which I understand him to be submitting that the Prosecutor was allowed expert testimony, so should the Defence.  Such an argument, Your Honours, is misplaced for two reasons: first, the Prosecutor's expert witness, Alison Des Forges, was qualified and accepted by this Chamber, and the sole purpose for her testimony was to place the killings we allege took place in Rusumo in the overall context of the killings in Rwanda in April through July 1994.  Ndengejeho, on the other hand, 
Your Honours, has been disqualified by Your Lordships, and counsel shouldn't therefore mix apples and oranges by equating Ndengejeho with Alison Des Forges. 

The second reason, Your Honours, is that Alison's evidence was necessitated by the Defence failure to indicate at the commencement of trial which facts Defence was admitting and which facts it contested.  So the trial started on the premise that the Defence contested all the facts. 

Now, it subsequently turns out, Your Honours, during the Defence case that a number of Prosecution allegations concerning killings in Rusumo were admitted by Defence evidence, so the only issue for determination before Your Lordships is whether the Accused participated in the killings and rapes as we allege, and we submit in that regard, Your Honours, that the proposed evidence of Ndengejeho does not help you in the proper determination of the issues at bar.  Most obliged. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Prosecutor, I'm somewhat handicapped because I was absent for part of the trial, so you'll assist me.  You accept that you did not comply with Rule 94 bis(B)(i), the notice?
MR. KAREGYESA:
On the contrary, Your Honours, on the 17th of October, the Prosecutor filed a notice of objection.
JUDGE REDDY:
So you complied with it.
MR. KAREGYESA:
We complied with that.
JUDGE REDDY:
And what are the other three Rules, I think you mentioned, under which you say you made the application to disqualify this gentleman as an expert witness? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I've mentioned Rule 54, the inherent powers of a Judge or Chamber to issue orders, summonses, subpoenas, warrants, et cetera, as may be necessary for the purpose of an investigation or for preparation or conduct of the trial.  This is the boilerplate clause, the inherent powers of the Judge or Chamber in trial.  

Rule 73 provides for filing motions, motions that are not preliminary motions under Rule 72, and gives deadlines for responses, in this case, five days.  And then Rule 89 concerns admission of evidence, and more particularly, 89(C), which provides that a Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.  

Now, in our motion for exclusion of the expert report and the proposed evidence, we relied on these three Rules, and this is independent of the notice of objection filed earlier under 94 bis(B)(i).
JUDGE REDDY:
And have I understood you correctly to say that we have no jurisdiction to review our own decision insofar as we have held that this particular gentleman is not an expert within the meaning of that term as used in the Rules? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Not at all, Your Honours.  On the contrary, my submission was that Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence relates to review subsequent to final judgment.  And my submission was that this wasn't a final judgment.  However, we do concede that the Chamber has inherent powers under Rule 54 to revisit its own decisions in the interests of justice.  

What we contest, however, Your Honours, is that this isn't a request for review.  He is basically -- counsel is basically appealing your decision of 11th November and asking you to assume appellate jurisdiction.  He's not asking for review, although he submits it's a review.  This is an appeal.  He wants your decision overturned. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And what is the essential difference?  If a review leads to a decision being overturned, what's the difference?  A lot of appeals result in a review of the decision that's appealed.  I mean, an exercise of appellate powers is essentially an exercise of powers of review, isn't it?  Honestly, I don't see the difference. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, the difference stems from the fact, Your Honours, that no sufficient grounds have been established necessitating a review.
JUDGE REDDY:
Well, that's another issue.  That's another proposition.
MR. KAREGYESA:
It ought to be a review based on grounds.  There are no grounds for the review and therefore can't be any for an appeal.
JUDGE REDDY:
I'm with you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honour.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you.

	1530H 
MADAM  PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We shall of course take time to respond to your arguments and to issue our decision.  

Counsel Kouengoua, are your witnesses present? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, our witnesses are in Arusha.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are they present on the premises of the Tribunal this afternoon? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I arrived in Arusha on the 13th, and I was informed of the decision on the 14th.  I had no opportunity to meet any of the witnesses to welcome them.  I did not even have the opportunity to do so.  However, Madam President -- what I was saying, Madam President, was that before I left, the schedule for the appearance of witnesses was sent previously.  Certainly the section must have -- the witness section must have brought the witnesses to Arusha, but I would like to ask the Chamber to consider as soon as possible, Madam President, our motion.  And I believe the appearance of our two witnesses wouldn't pose any problem.  We can do so in record time as required by the Chamber, but we would wish the Chamber to examine -- to consider our motion and rule on it.  

The Prosecutor continues to give us the impression that we are not on the right track.  Madam President, we did not think we would be able to hear our witnesses this afternoon.  Today is Monday, and I believe the witnesses arrived on Saturday, contrary to what was decided here during the hearings.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kouengoua, the witnesses have nothing to do with the question of the review of the decision.  We are dealing with the expert witness Ndengejeho, but I am referring to the two factual witnesses who are to be heard today.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I suppose that you have been able to talk to your witnesses, and it appears that both witnesses are here.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, indeed, Madam President, they are present.  We were told that one of them is not well and the witness section got drugs for them.  

We arrived here on Saturday.  I said that there is a witness who was heard -- who was listened to by my colleagues, but I have not had the opportunity to see any of them.  I was focusing on the decision of the 11th.  So it is only a request we are respectfully presenting to you, Madam President.  If the Chamber doesn't find that there is any particular inconvenience in this, we would -- we intend to proceed in such way that everything would be in order.  I would suggest that both witnesses be heard tomorrow.  It's only a discussion, Madam President, unless the Chamber finds that there is something very seriously wrong with my suggestion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you tell us whether the witnesses -- could you tell us who are the witnesses who are due to appear during this session? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The witnesses who were supposed to appear when we adjourned on the 22nd, Madam President, was XW13 and XW22, who arrived from Rwanda.  There was also the expert witness, Pascal Ndengejeho; there was also the two expert witnesses, Professor Lecomte and Professor Vorhaouer from Paris.  

Pursuant to Rule 94, the witness -- the Prosecution accepted their testimony and didn't have the -- was not of the opinion that his testimony was not necessary, so there is no change in the schedule which we had on the 22nd of October, Madam President.  

With regard to the forensic experts, the French forensic experts, I believe there was no problem with their testimony and they are going to testify.  And that is why I would respectfully request that the factual witnesses be heard tomorrow, unless you are of the contrary opinion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to point out to you that we are sitting in other cases, and that on the 26th of November -- that is, as of the 26th of November none of us will be sitting in this case.  

We are obliged to hear both the factual witnesses and the expert witnesses before the 26th.  I will consult with my co-Judges.  

Counsel Kouengoua, we would like to hear your first witness this afternoon.  It would appear that there is a witness who has come with a baby.  In that case, wouldn't it be good to start with that witness? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, apparently, Madam President.  Yes, there is a witness who has come with a baby.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who is that witness who has come with a baby?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
	XW13, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then, we shall start with that witness in order to finish with him or her very quickly.  

Please bring in Witness XW13, Registry.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness.  You are a protected witness, and for purposes of this trial you would be known under a pseudonym, Witness XW13.  You will be examined by the Defence and then 
cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and the Judges may have some questions to put to you and, if need be, you may be re-examined by the Defence counsel.  

Before answering the questions, we would ask you to make a solemn declaration, and the registrar will assist you with that.
	(Declaration made by Witness XW13 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Witness and Prosecutor (sic).  

Counsel Mbattang, are you the one to question the witness? 
MS. MBATTANG:
Thank you, Madam President.  

I would first of all like to wish the Judges and all of the other members of the Tribunal good afternoon.  

Before we start, Madam President, I have three copies of the witness statement which I would like to hand over to the interpreters, with your permission.  If the registrar could assist with that. 
JUDGE REDDY:
What is the number of this witness?  How many Defence witnesses have you called to date?  This witness?
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I cannot tell you what  -- the number of this witness.  Many witnesses were withdrawn.  I am not in a position to say what number she is.  Perhaps No. 19.
JUDGE REDDY:
Eighteen.

MS. MBATTANG:
It's rather No. 18.  Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I would request that this witness be heard exclusively in closed session.  

Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we are listening to you.
MS. MBATTANG:
I would like us to start this hearing in closed session in order to afford this witness protection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For how long will you question the witness?  Is it only with regard to her identity?
MS. MBATTANG:
No, Madam President, I will explain in closed session why I am requesting that the entire testimony be given in closed session, and I have many reasons for that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well then, Counsel, we are going into close session, and we crave the indulgence of the gallery, but all this is to afford the witness protection.
