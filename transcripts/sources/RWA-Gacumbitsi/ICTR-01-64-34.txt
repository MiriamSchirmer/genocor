P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're still on the appeals in the case of Gacumbitsi against the Prosecutor.  I take it that appearances are as they were yesterday.
MR. WESTON:
Yes, that is so, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This morning we have received an urgent motion by the Accused for the admission of the statements presented by the Prosecutor -- that motion has been made under Rule 115 -- having regard to the urgencies of the case.  I propose that we should dispense with the usual procedures under which the Prosecution would be entitled to some time to respond to the motion, and we can regard the Prosecution's response as set out in its notice relating to the two statements concerned.  If that is agreeable, then we would defer a decision until later in the day, subject to any argument that the parties may wish to make now.
MR. WESTON:
Mr. President, that is an acceptable course to the Prosecution, if I may say so.  We only saw that motion before the commencement of the hearing this morning.  Some matters of evidence are being checked now.  So we will be in a position to make any oral argument that is necessary later this morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Later this morning.  

The Defence, have you anything to say?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  We had intended to submit documents in support of our motion, but since yesterday we had waited for our turn, as scheduled, but then we didn't have the opportunity to reply to the Prosecutor.  But when our turn to speak will come up, we'll have the opportunity to reply.  But we are fully in agreement with the suggestion made by Your Honourable selves.
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I suggest that we aim to do this, and that we expect the Prosecution will facilitate the course of the proceedings by doing any necessary checks and being prepared to make any submissions by the time the proceedings recommence after this morning's coffee break.
MR. WESTON:
Yes, the Prosecution will be ready then, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Then we will defer the decision until then.  
May I -- prosecuting Counsel, doctor who spoke last yesterday, to take the stand in case if there are any questions from the Bench, that is I'm talking of Dr. Wadora (phonetic).  Would you like to be up standing at this time and to receive any questions that may come from the Bench.  Judge Meron wishes to put a question to you.
JUDGE MERON:
Thank you, President.  I have a question for the Prosecution.  

You will recall that my learned colleague, Judge Schomburg, yesterday asked a question, I believe, directed to the Defence with regard to paragraph 12 of the indictment.  You might want to have that part of that in front of you.  And here is my question:  As I read the judgement, am I correct in my understanding that the convictions for committing -- I emphasise committing -- extermination and genocide rests exclusively on the killing of Mr. Murefu.  Let me make it clear that I'm not suggesting that this will necessarily affect the finding by the Trial Chamber that Mr. Gacumbitsi was guilty of genocide and of extermination pursuant to other Article 6, paragraph 1, liability.  

Now, if my understanding is correct, do tell us, Counsel, how could the Defence not have been prejudiced by the fact that this killing was never mentioned in the indictment?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Your Honour, if I may quickly reply, subject to any further submission I may make, after making further cross-checking of the judgement --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I interrupt you by saying that I believe your name is Mr. George Mugwanya.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you have my apologies.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Subject to further cross-checking, especially with regard to the basis upon which the various convictions were specifically placed, because the judgement is a little bit big, I would only submit on two points.  Your Honours, I mainly focus on the pleading in paragraph 12, which you actually want me to submit on, and I'll be summing that this paragraph that was pleaded does not intend, or was not intended, to actually rely on any specific matter in the context of the genocide.  This indication was clearly underscored by the word "use" including, when it came to mentioning the victims, it uses the phrase "among other victims."  This phrase, Your Honour, means that the intention of that paragraph was merely to alert and inform the Accused that in pleading the term of genocide, extermination, that Prosecutor intends to rely on any specific matter, particularly given the fact that these crimes, by their very nature, will, particularly in the country of Rwanda, involved massive killings.  So the phrase used here did not, in any way, provide any kind of misinformation.  It informs the Defence, well, there were many killings here, whether Murefu or others.  Murefu is mentioned here but there were many killings here, including the victims here mentioned.  So, to that extent, regardless of whether Murefu was specifically mentioned, there was no prejudice because the Defence was not invited by this paragraph to go even to investigate specific killings, in a sense, because the words used were "among other victims."  Therefore "among other victims", some of these were mentioned, implying that the Defence was not called upon, in a sense, and I said "in a sense" to go and investigate specific killings.  

If, Your Honours, we were pleading this paragraph in the context of crimes like -- crimes like (unintelligible) murder, and was saying, "Well, the Accused killed a specific individual."  Your Honour, we would have caused the prejudice if, at the time of events during the proceedings, we came out with a different matter altogether.  That would have been a prejudice.  I would want Your Honour to rely on the jurisprudence of this Tribunal with respect to the crime of extermination, and I specifically want to rely on the decision in Ntakirutimana.  Your Honour, in that decision we are -- the Prosecutor appealed contesting the Trial Chamber's finding that in pleading examination (sic) the Prosecutor was bound to specify the victims, in terms of names and the particulars.  Your Honour, the Appeals Chamber held that with regard to the term of "exterminaton" the Prosecutor is not bound to spell out the particulars of those victims, given, among other factors, the nature of this crime.  This crime targets civilian populations.  As long as the Prosecutor spells out, in general terms, that the victims that were targeted were a civilian population, that will suffice, without requiring the Prosecutor to spell out further details in terms of names, in terms of particulars of identity.  It suffices if the Prosecutor gives, in general terms, the nature of the victims, namely a civilian population.  

Your Honour, although this decision is in the context of extermination, I submit it applies equally to the crime of genocide and I would submit that it would fit within the parameters of paragraph 12 of the indictment, which did not seek to inform the Accused that the Prosecutor was relying on any specific victim -- on any specific victim of the genocide.  This intention was to inform the Defence that there were many victims killed, victims belonging to the Tutsi population.  So, whatever name comes out of the victim, including Murefu and others, Your Honours, the Accused was notified.  And if I may add, Your Honour, given more time, with Your Honourships (sic), we will give further cross-check, especially in terms of further notices that were given in the preferred brief, among others, further informing the Defence that the Prosecutor does not intend to rely on the paragraph -- I mean, on the bit of paragraph 12, to rely on that specific killing.  But, again, other notice, to inform the Defence that, well, this murder was committed against a huge number of victims, and this list, which was given, was not exhaustive.  So there was no need for this information, whatsoever, regarding --
JUDGE MERON:
Counsel, I have some little problems here, I must say.  The question that I asked you was not with regard to possible other forms of liability under Article 6 paragraph 1 with regard to genocide and extermination.  My question was specifically related to the finding in the judgement that the Accused committed, was responsible for committing certain crimes, committing, himself, certain crimes.  Now, you are telling us, if I understand, that the fact that paragraph 12 of the indictment uses the word "among them" - "among them," that this gives the Accused Article 8 notice that he has been notified to use the word "notify," how would that fit with the doctrine of the Tribunal regarding the need to contain adequate pleadings in the indictment so that the Accused can prepare his Defence?  

If you are not quite ready to give us all the aspects of that question, I don't mind if you come back to it after checking the record further, but I have problems here.  Inter alia, why not write all the time in the indictment inter alia and say, "We have given adequate notification."  That concludes my question.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Your Honour, again subject to further submissions I may make, I also want to draw your attention, in addition to paragraph 12, the immediate following paragraph -- I beg your pardon -- if you can refer to the judgement, paragraph 288, and another page subject to further submissions after further cross-checking.  The basis upon which these convictions of Gacumbitsi were grounded were planning, instigation, ordering -- and ordering an (unintelligible) committing, plus aiding and abetting the killings of the Tutsi population.  That's a broader basis.  But maybe, specifically, what was your question about the necessity of pleading the killing of the specific individual? I would make my submission on this, maybe, subsequently, but I would still submit that the paragraph 12, really, the way it stands, issues of terms "among others" would -- I mean, mind you, it didn't cause any confusion.  But, as I said, in terms of further submissions, I make submissions whether we really needed to spell it out, but I still believe that we didn't need to because the theory of the Prosecutor's case was quite clear, that we were not relying on any specific victim having been killed and our intention was, from paragraph 12, to inform the Defence that his genocide and extermination count was based on his involvement in the massive killing of so many victims, among which those ones named in paragraph 12.  So, our case for submissions on that, I would still maintain the position that that paragraph adequately covered the victim in this case, Murefu, who was shot dead, among the many victims that were involved in this massive killing.  

I would like to mention that I may make my submission on your needs, but that's the position of the Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I yield to my colleague, Judge Schomburg, and give him the floor.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Counsel, I'm extremely grateful that you finally came back to count 1 and count 2, that is genocide and complicity in genocide, as pleaded in the indictment, and not referring to the jurisprudence on extermination.  Mainly, this would lead to different results.  Can -- did I take your arguments correctly in that you are saying that, as we all know, genocide, the crime of crimes, consists predominantly on the mens rea, the specific intent and the specific intent to kill, or other alternatives mentioned in Article 2, a targeted group and not individuals.  So, is it your point that the last four lines of paragraph 12 are only of additional assistance when you say, in the beginning of these four lines, "among them" and concluding with "among others" that, from your point of view, the crime of genocide or complicity in genocide would have been pleaded with the sufficient preciseness, even without mentioning any name, because the target is not the individual but the group.  Did I get your point correctly?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
I would say, Your Honour, that's the position.  As Your Honour pointed out, the crime of genocide targets groups.  Individuals are victimised not because of their individual personalities, but because of their membership in the groups being targeted.  So, even without mentioning the names in further -- even if we do not mention the names, and we had just merely pleaded that the accused was involved in the perpetuation of killing, targeting a civilian population at Nyarubuye parish and other scenes, that would have been sufficient, without even naming the names, without giving the names, without giving the specific names, that would have sufficed, Your Honour, because what transits (unintelligible) a killing of an individual, in terms of genocide, is the targeting of the individual as a member of the group.  The group becomes the victim of the crime.  So even the mere meeting, Your Honour, I would submit, that the Accused was involved in perpetrating crimes against a group of individuals because of their Tutsi identity would have been sufficient.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Güney wishes to ask a question.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Counsel, could you please tell me if appellant Gacumbitsi was able to establish that their Defence was compromised by the defects in the indictment?  If the answer is yes, if the conviction is for genocide, does it stand on the basis of other facts which can be inferenced from other facts in the case?
MR. MUGWANYA:
Your Honour, even presuming there was prejudice, which we submit really never existed, our decision would stand on the basis of other facts.  Your Honour, as the record shows, the Accused was involved not only at Nyarubuye but in other locations.  And even more so when it comes to Nyarubuye parish, Your Honour, his involvement -- his involvement may be the mere killing of Murefu.  When he killed Murefu he called upon -- it was a signal for others to take action.  Even for Nyarubuye alone -- the massacre at Nyarubuye parish alone, even if we had put apart the killing of Murefu, which we submit, Your Honours, that it should remain, to use the genocide conviction (unintelligible) could be grounded on that Nyarubuye parish incident because his killing of Murefu was a signal.  It set in motion a commencement of massive killing, and based on his action at Nyarubuye, Your Honour, the Accused was found culpable besides committing the killing of Murefu.  He was correctly found for ordering the communal police to kill the victims at Nyarubuye parish and, actually, commit -- further in our appeal he's ordering actually persons beyond the communal policemen, because there were other perpetrators, Interahamwe, civilians.  

So, if I may summarise, Your Honour, in answer to your question, even assuming the Defence were to plead prejudice in the context of the killing of Murefu, the committing of genocide based on Murefu, genocide commission still stands totally on the basis of the Nyarubuye killings, on the basis of other killings.  So the killings -- the killing of Murefu was a signal.  So his killing of Murefu was a signal.  It was closely interpreted, also, because the killing was construed, in addition to the words that he used that, "Well, now take weapons."  The committing alone, the ordering came and took place and the instigation came and took place within the same circumstances at Nyarubuye, besides other massacres scenes which were involved.  So the commission would still stand, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Judge Meron.
JUDGE MERON:
Sorry, Counsel, but the events of this matter is important enough to insist on clarification.  First let me point out that my question did not deal with mens rea but on the (unintelligible) strengths.  

Secondly, I really defer to the point made by my distinguished colleague, Judge Güney, even without more Murefu other forms of liability, criminal liability, under Article 61.  My question was very specific, it related to the word in Article 61, "committed."  Now, for committing you need something additional, and if you look at the judgement, for example, the judgement tells us in Article 259, "moreover the Accused personally killed Murefu."  In paragraph 261, in particular, the Chamber found the Accused killed Murefu, so given the problem of articulation, proper pleading of paragraph 12 does presence a problem, at least for me.
MR. MUGWANYA:
May I briefly add or make my submission on this.  Your Honour, we have knowledge that the jurisprudence of the Tribunal insists that when you allege personal commission you should spell out the identities of the victims, personal commission.  Of course the jurisprudence has exceptions; for instance, when there's a massiveness of crimes, or when it is alleged that the Accused was involved in a continuous policy of criminality or a systematic crime, the level of specificity may be lower or is lower and the (unintelligible) holds that, well, if the petitioner comes hand in hand with the information, we can provide it, evaluate it, when he obtains it.  

Paragraph 12 of the indictment does not, as I said, intend to talk about personal commission, as to demand a high tentative level of specificity.  It does not.  Paragraph 12 does not intend, and it is explicit.  It was intended to provide a mode of participation, you know, over an Accused in a massive killing, providing some specificities in terms of "among others" by using the term "among others," but is not intended to focus on the personal commission that Gacumbitsi killed X, Y, or Z.  So, notwithstanding the requirement that where personal commission is the focus, which was not the case here, we would submit that paragraph 12, really, (unintelligible) is included in paragraph 12 or "other victims" among others Murefu included.  So this doesn't intend (unintelligible) to talk about personal commission in strictly speaking.  It was unintentional to allege the Accused, that you are not being charged with specificity.  We are not charging you for specifically committing a specific murder.  We are charging you for committing massive murders.  And in that context, Your Honour, the level of specificity is lower, the level of specificity is lower.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, my colleague, Judge Liu, would ask you a question now.
JUDGE DAQUN:
Thank you, Mr. President.

I still have problem with your indictment.  If the personal commission of the murder is not charged in paragraph 12, but they are aware of it is pleaded in the indictment, and I want to know whether you could check with your pre-trial brief or any other specific submissions, even after the Prosecution's case, whether this crime is sufficiently pleaded anywhere or if this defect, as put by Defence counsel, was cured by any other subsequent actions.  

And another question is that whether the murder of the Mr. Murefu is charged with the murder of killing or it is pleaded in relation to the commission of the genocide.  Thank you.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thank you for that.  I'll make first cross-checking, but, still, our position is that we -- the position I actually submitted on, that when we did not charge - or, we didn't insist -- we didn't intend to inform the Defence, in paragraph 12, that we are relying on Murefu.  We pleaded, in paragraph 12, the fact that the Accused was involved in a massive killing of many victims and so regardless -- and this is my submission -- regardless of any subsequent communication -- I'll collect communication in a moment -- regardless of any communication that came subsequently, paragraph 12 adequately covered many victims -- including Murefu -- but many other victims and the Accused was adequately informed of this fact, not to go out an investigate Murefu, not to go out an investigate specific individuals.  The intention was clear.  You were responsible for massive killings of victims.  We are not charging you for a specific murder.  We are charging you with a massive killing of many victims.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Meron has another question, please.  
JUDGE MERON:
I hate to pursue this but, if I understand you correctly, you said that, a few minutes ago, that the indictment did not intend to charge Gacumbitsi with any particular killings but with a large picture.  Am I right in my understanding?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone.
MR. MUGWANYA:
(Microphone not activated)
JUDGE MERON:
Among which is not referred now, how would you reconcile with paragraph 4 of the indictment which said Sylvestre Gacumbitsi killed persons by his own hand -- killed persons by his own hand.  And we saw the finding in fact, found on the trial in Court, Trial Chamber, found that there was specific killing of Mr. Murefu.  Now, I'm sure that -- I suspect my colleagues would like to know in what was the Accused given the kind of notice that would have allowed him to prepare a Defence due to the indictment statement that he killed persons, plural, no identification, no names, by his own hand, and paragraph 12 cites names and says, inter alia, and Murefu is not mentioned there?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
As I said, first our submissions on this we have, Your Honour, to come back to it.  Thank you, very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, could you answer me one question like this.  I have been affected by some of the questions put to you from the Bench, and in keeping with that reaction, I ask you whether you concede that it was a little unfair on the part of the Prosecution to put the Defence to the necessity of investigating whether there was a killing of these 12 persons who are named.  You appreciate that on a seeking of an indictment, worded in the way in which this indictment was worded, the Defence, as your good counsel, you could be a Defence counsel, would have had to investigate whereas there was a killing of any or all of these 12 people?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
We are cognisant, Your Honour, about that reality, but there is no question about that in a sense, that names haven't been given.  It is unreasonable that a party would, maybe at a certain point, investigate those names.  However, the paragraph -- I mean the pleading, as it is expressly pleaded, does not also, on the other hand, seeks the hand of the Defence to those other murders.  So, beside those specific murders, the indictment invited the Defence to investigate broadly, because the intention was of the (Unintelligible) was not limited to set up those specific murders, but it was intended to go beyond them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask you this question to make sure that I'm understanding your presentation correctly.  You would say, would you, that paragraph 12 of the indictment does not use the word "committed;" is that correct?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
In relation to (microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Paragraph 12 of the indictment, yes or no -- it may be that I'm wrong -- does it use the word committing?
MR. MUGWANYA:
Not to my knowledge, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, then I move onto an understanding of your position.  You would say that it is true that paragraph 285 of the judgement, 2-8-5, which uses the word "therefore" seems to link the committing of genocide to the killing of Murefu.  Is that right?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Your Honour, I'll tell you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you would say, would you, that it is for the Appeals Chamber to consider whether, on the findings made by the Trial Chamber, that the committing of genocide had a meaning wider than the linkage to the death of Murefu would suggest.  You would turn to paragraph 2 -- you would turn to the paragraph in which you were -- "committing" was mentioned, and you would link that to paragraph 168 to 178 in which the Trial Chamber finds that the Accused directed and personally engaged in the attacks, which resulted in these deaths, and would that be a way of saying that the Appeals Chamber should, therefore, find that he committed genocide in all of these ways?  Would I be correct in understanding your position that way?  

In paragraph 288 you said, "In the light of the foregoing, that has to do with the Accused directing these attacks and personally engaging in them, which the Trial Chamber found -- in the light of that the Trial Chamber find that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was responsible for planning, instigating, ordering the communal police committing and aiding and abetting in the killing of members of the Tutsi ethnic group."  Is that your way of looking at it?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Well, I submit, therefore, Judge, is broad in a sense, all inclusive in that context.  And maybe I will also add that actually some (unintelligible) in our comment -- grounds, acts of committing were involved, not only personal commission but also commission in terms of joint enterprise.  But, besides that, Your Honour, the broadness of the prosecution of the Accused, actually is, as I must say, you're pointing out that was crucially found by Trial Chamber.  It was not (unintelligible), it was much broader, and it emanated from the Accused's conduct at the scene of the crime, Nyarubuye, but when we came to the Nyarubuye parish, his involvement actually brings into play a broad range of multiple participation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In other words the opposition may be summed up this way, that this statement of a principle is not contradicted by failure to establish any particular illustrations of the principle still at work.
MR. MUGWANYA:
I beg your pardon, sir, I didn't follow that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Counsel, Judge Schomburg will speak.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Sorry, Counsel, but apparently we get lost in discussing this point, but the further we go into details, I think, the more questions arise.  In the beginning of Roman (iii), when you plead count 1 or alternatively count 2, it reads, "Pursuant to Article 61 of the statute," by virtue of this affirmative act in ordering seems surprisingly enough instead of "incitement to commit," it reads, "Instigating, commanding."  I don't know where this language stems from.  In any event, it's not in Article 2 - "participating in aiding and abetting."  And the same is true for complicity in genocide.  It also is pleaded "instigating, commanding, participating, and aiding and abetting," but nowhere the word "committing" appears.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Which paragraph is that?  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
There is no paragraph.  It's when you start with the charges, count 1, and then the first paragraph on page 94 in the English version of the indictment.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Yes, we have it.  Yes, I see that.  That's the second paragraph from the top?  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
The first paragraph where it reads "ordering, instigating:  Instead of "incitement to genocide, commanding," whatever that means," participating in aiding and abetting."  And the same is true as you follow up count 2, the second paragraph under count 2, let's call it the Shapo (phonetic) pleading, to there, the word "committing" does not appear.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Your Honour, I beg your pardon.  What is the question, Your Honour?  I didn't get the question then.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
It's a follow-up question into the actus reus where we departed this morning by the question from my distinguished colleague, Judge Meron, when he asked you the question on the actus reus and there whether it amounts to "committing" or, when you read correctly, jurisprudence on genocide of the Tribunal, for example, in the Tribunal in the case of Kupreskic or Ntakirutimana that it could be qualified in another way.  And I missed -- maybe you can help me out with this -- in the beginning of the pleading, already, the words "committing", and I would be interested in what is the basis for "commanding genocide."  Maybe I'm absolutely wrong, but I can't see this mode of participation in Article 2, para 3 of the statute.  Thank you.
MR. MUGWANYA:
I'll quickly go to the question.  Regarding your first question, Your Honour, on the pleading, I was looking at the French version of the indictment, the paragraph you referred to, it includes the pleading that the Accused participated in the commission.  I don't know whether the English volume may be different, but it talks about the Accused participating in the commission.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
In the English version it reads -- maybe it's another version: "Participating in aiding and abetting".
MR. MUGWANYA:
Well, interestingly the French version says, "Participated in the commission and the aiding and abetting."  

Did I get your question, Your Honour, in relation to the French version?  But also the judgement in paragraph 269 seems to explain it more -- 69 -- I wonder whether there was a problem of translation from French or from English to French, but accordingly, the big issue is commission.  

Could I move to another issue, Your Honour?  Maybe I can provide further information in case I come by -- I mean I have my submission regarding the paragraph.  

Now, concerning the existence of "commanding" or the absence of "commanding" in the statute, Your Honour, this word was used.  We have knowledge that commanding is not really mentioned in the statute, but, in terms of construction, the Trial Chamber correctly found that, although it is not available, not mentioned in the statute, ordering would be -- I mean it is covered, I mean it is covered in the context of ordering.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Sorry, you plead "ordering and commanding" at the same time.
MR. MUGWANYA:  
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Therefore it creates confusion.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Actually one of them is -- can get away, actually, one of them is redundant, in a sense.  

JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Okay, this is a plain explanation and I understand it.  Thank you.
MR. MUGWANYA:
And then finally maybe -- this is in relation to the question raised by the learned Judges Meron and others -- concerning and Judge Güney concerning whether there was an effort, in the sense of providing further particulars on the Murefu.  I submit, Your Honours, that actually this was well done.  The Prosecution, following the indictment, the Prosecution provided further particulars, particularly in the context of witness disclosure, in which the name of Murefu was contained and it was a statement of Witness TAQ.  So there was a subsequent effort, Your Honours, to communicate the fact that Murefu would be one of the victims, among the many that the Prosecution intended to rely on, in establishing the culpability of -- we listed for genocide and extermination.  And we are obliged to refer you to our brief, paragraph -- especially paragraph 152, 153, and the following paragraph, sir, but mainly 152 and 153 where we address the question of post-indictment communication in respect of the killing of Murefu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Meron.
JUDGE MERON:
I am extremely grateful to your friend for --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour's microphone, please.
JUDGE MERON:
I'm very grateful to the President for drawing our attention to paragraph 288 of the judgement, which refers -- uses the word "in light of the foregoing," so the foregoing includes paragraph 285.  Paragraph 285 defines "committed" and I read, "Committing refers generally to the direct and physical concentration of the crime by the offender himself, so in the present case the Accused came to Murefu, a Tutsi, the Chamber, therefore, finds that he committed crime of genocide within the meaning of Article 6(1)."  So to simplify things in this context, what you say about ordering or instigation is not relevant to the point, the narrow point I have asked.  

Now, regarding the indictment, again, at paragraph 4 of the indictment, which I cited before, speaks of Gacumbitsi killing persons by his own hands.  Killing persons by his own hands means to me, in simple English, committing the killing.  And, of course, a finding of the Trial Chamber supports this line of reasoning.  

Now, your last point was, if I understand correctly, that duty of the Prosecution to give proper notice to the Accused, even if not satisfied by the indictment, itself, may have been satisfied by the fact that Mr. Murefu's name is mentioned in a witness statement.  Now, again, I'm a bit troubled by the -- does this mean that witness statements provided by the Prosecution, we should assume that the Prosecution is charging every potentially criminal act that described in each statement of a witness and what would this do to the well established jurisprudence of this Tribunal regarding the need to have adequate pleadings in the indictment?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
Thanks, your Honour.  The jurisprudence, which is established by the Tribunal, did allow for exceptions, where there is a failure to communicate.  Your Honour, in the context of this indictment, especially reading it holistically, (unintelligible) there was an effort to communicate the fact that we are relying on a specific matter as such, we were relying on the broader (unintelligible) base concerning the nature of the crimes that the Accused was involved in.  However, in terms of communication, I think that the (unintelligible) also allows, in some circumstances, communication to the Defence, including pre-trial brief and statement, can be important.  In the context of this case, although arguably it may be put that not every aspect of the witness statement is material -- I mean immaterial; however, in this case, given the limited number of witness statements, and given the specificity with which Gacumbitsi's involvement in the murder (unintelligible) is mentioned, we would submit that this was adequate communication.  

If there had been a massive material -- and I think this arises from the Ntakirutimana judgement -- that there are cases of situations where the existence, for instance, of various statements referring to the same scene can cause confusion.  And I think, in the case of Ntakirutimana, there were several situations where several situations were disclosed, yet they caused some confusion.  In this case the disclosure was of a specific witness statement, specifically including the mention of Murefu and the Accused's involvement or the Accused's killing of this Murefu.  So there was not such a massive disclosure of statement regarding the same event whereby the Accused was confused.  The Accused was put on specific notice, and this notice was conveyed in a specific statement.  There were no other statements that were conveying confusing information.  So, in this context, we submit that this communication was an adequate cure.  It didn't cause any confusion, but it clarified the matter of commission that his involvement in the commission of the killing of Murefu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
My colleague, Judge Schomburg. 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Maybe it would be helpful, in light of the jurisprudence, if at all the Chamber comes to the conclusion that the indictment, as such, is, in relation to genocide, committing of genocide (unintelligible) are not specific enough in that it can be cured in inter alia by the charts of witnesses and in the chart of witnesses you normally draw the attention of the -- to your learned friend that this statement is related to a concrete alleged crime and to concrete facts.  Could you please be so kind -- maybe not now, because it may take some time -- but when you introduced the killing of Murefu, based certainly on a witness statement, what is the reading of this chart of witnesses in relation to the killing of Murefu and in relation to which crime?  Thank you.
MR. MUGWANYA:
I will cross-check that in a moment, maybe later in the submissions.  

But, finally, Your Honour, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that beside the communication which I mentioned, the Witness TAQ, which was very specific, the Accused never raised any objection to this, and I suggest now the burden now is on him to demonstrate the prejudice.  That is jurisprudence, Your Honour, Niyitegeka, paragraphs 191 to 200.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I ask you to confirm something to me, and the first thing is that you have hunted out that the French translation of the indictment was not the same as the English text, so, could you tell me whether, as you understand it, the Accused would have been presented with a French translation and whether he would have been dealing with a matter in the French language?  

The second question -- well, I put that one first.  Judge Schomburg has pointed out that I was in error in speaking of the French translation.  It should have been the original in French.
MR. MUGWANYA:
Quickly to respond to that, and I will submit, based on (unintelligible), given that the French was the original language of the indictment, and also given that actually the Accused is French speaking, I would apologise if I am mistaken, I think you may find that he was given that in the French, so he was working on the French indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then, can you answer me a second question, and that is Judge Meron has quite accurately pointed out that he is concerned with the word "committing."  Do I assess your position correctly to say that, in any case, the indictment also spoke of other means for engaging responsibility under Article 6, paragraph 1 of the statute, and that those "other means" are not effective?
MR. MUGWANYA:
No, Your Honour, they are not.  I may be (unintelligible)  in addition to what I say to Your Honour, this question, the question of my father says -- accused me of raising an objection.  There was subsequent communication of the material, the witness statement.  And, finally, the Accused actually does not contest it in his appeals brief or in the notice of appeal in the appeals brief, Your Honour, so that should be considered, given the circumstances which have been addressed, Your Honour, I think our question is that we conveyed -- we communicated adequately the pleading, I mean the allegation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, we are behind schedule a little.  We should be hearing from the Prosecution.  We should be continuing his argument at this time, but the Prosecution was scheduled to speak from 9:00 to 9:45 by way of continuing his response.  May I take it, in the light of our discussions, you will find it possible to curtail that presentation?  
MR. WESTON:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  There were only two other grounds which the Prosecution had to address, it was going to be a brief, brief, with regard to basic grounds, in any case, that is the sentence ground and the ground my colleague was going to speak about regarding alleged procedural problems, and we can be very succinct.  Miss Onsea will now give background and procedural grounds.
MS. ONSEA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  In our response I wanted to deal with the appellant challenges to some interlocutory decisions the Trial Chamber has taken in this case.  The appellant is challenging six interlocutory decisions and he, in fact, referred to these decisions very briefly yesterday during our submission.  Now, we have addressed the form in which the appellant has presented his appeals and the merits of his appeal in our brief, and I was not going to go into the details today.  What I just wanted to make clear to you today was that I wanted to go back to the essence of his appeal.  And the essence is, was the Trial Chamber wrong in issuing these decisions?  Now, our submission is that the Trial Chamber was not, and that the Trial Chamber had the responsibility of managing executive procedure, dealing with the pre-trial and the trial issues of the case in order to ensure that the appellant received a fair and expeditious trial.  Now, our submission is that the Trial Chamber did that in a fair and reasonable way.  Reasonably with respect to the application of the law and reasonably with respect to the ability of the Accused to make full answer in Defence.  

My intention was to lead Your Honours to each of the decisions, just to point out that the Trial Chamber is, in effect, ensured a balance.  I don't know whether, with the time constraint, whether you still want me to do that, but I'm always willing to ask (sic) any additional questions which you my have in addition to the submissions to be made in our brief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will try to consult with my colleagues on the Bench.  

We won't trouble you at this time with a discussion into those matters.
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honours, I may finally address the sentence ground.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want to confine your address within the space between now and 1030?  
MR. WESTON:
Yes, Your Honour.  My submissions are simply this.  The Prosecution relies on the matters contained in its brief regarding the sentence ground.  It is our submission that a 30 years sentence for the crimes of which the appellant was convicted is not only a sentence within the permissible range but it is, in fact, regarding the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, a lenient sentence.  

This Chamber, of course, may only intervene if there is some discernible error is shown or demonstrated by the appellant in the sentencing exercise.  

It is our submission that there has been no such error demonstrated by the appellant.  All of the matters which were canvassed yesterday by the appellant -- well, most of them were considered, that is the appellant's previous good character and his family situation.  Consideration was given to those matters by the Trial Chamber; there was no error shown in their approach.  

With regard to some of the other matters which were raised, such as the age of the appellant and the average life expectancy of a person in Africa, personally we submit there is nothing exceptional about the age of this appellant.  He is roughly the same age of most other persons that have been convicted by this Tribunal of the crimes of genocide and extermination.  Secondly, with regard to the issue of possible life expectancy, that is simply irrelevant, in our submission.  

Unless there is any further assistance we can give to the Court on that point, I have no further submissions on the sentence aspect. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any questions?  Thank you very much.  

We will invite the counsel for the appellant to address us at this time, if he has anything to say in reply he might do so now, and I would be grateful if he could manage to compress his reply between now and 10:30.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  The Defence of the Accused is somewhat handicapped in its address to the Chamber for the simple reason that I have filed a motion and the Chamber is still to deliberate on that.  However, what I said yesterday, Your Honours, regarding the Accused, Gacumbitsi, concerning the crimes alleged, remain entirely as I said them.  

I would respectfully request that the Prosecutor, who knows what he will be doing this afternoon -- and let me tell you why, because in the words that they stopped me from using yesterday, not the word, it was second, he admitted that his indictment is not precise.  I do respect the sanctity of the Office of the Prosecutor, when it is told, did he commit -- it says he participated.  Is that correct?  But, in my view, the Accused can't commit the incitement, can't commit rape, but when it is said that he committed murder, that means he killed, and in the indictment, paragraph 4, "personally killed or in his own hands," I heard the Prosecutor state -- and he fought with a lot of finesse I must admit, because I was expecting better than that regarding the interruptions yesterday -- but, you see, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Accused never asked that he be told, whatsoever, in the indictment regarding crimes against humanity, genocide and extermination, it would be sufficient that a single individual be killed -- and I said this yesterday -- for the crime to be characterised in its definition as provided by the text.  Now, this is a problem that the Prosecutor will be faced with.  And I mentioned this problem before the Chamber, even if I do not have the time, please refer to what I said in my text.  At paragraph 12 - or, in the judgement it is said that Murefu was killed, that the Accused kill Murefu.  It was regarding genocide and extermination, crimes against humanity; the list or the addresses of persons killed is not provided.  

The question which the Appeals Chamber needs to ask, and which I submitted to the Trial Chamber, is when the Prosecutor claims that the 12 persons in paragraph 12 were killed by Gacumbitsi, how can you get to know that these people were Tutsis?  How can you know that Murefu is a Tutsi?  Because only one person is killed, does that mean genocide?  This is, provided that he is a member of the target group, the religious, national group, that was targeted.  The least of things in such circumstances -- and this is quite clear in your jurisdiction, I don't need to go back into this -- I've heard that this Tribunal has been qualified as shameful because its job is not well done.  The indictment against Gacumbitsi, and I'm saying this looking you in the eye, my dear colleagues -- tell me which is the prejudice that an Accused can be faced with for having killed 14 people?  What is the role of the Defence, when you claim in the English or in French, when you say investigate, what does that mean for us, what is our job in that instance?  We would have preferred -- apart from an identity card, which would be excessive -- but we would have wished that the Prosecutor prove, at least, the fact that those who are mentioned are members of the targeted group.  And that was not the case.  And you will find this nowhere, Your Honours, I plead.  

The Prosecutor, in his conclusion, in his brief, said that the appellant did not suffer any prejudice, I believe it's paragraph 20 and 52.  He did not make any objection regarding Murefu.  Your Honours, I would wish that the Prosecutor reads what I write, and he should read this from paragraph 214 to 220.  That is my principal criticism, and any reasonable Judge would not accept taking into consideration Murefu as the basis for the criminal character of Gacumbitsi.  I've heard from the other side across the floor.  I've heard it said by my colleagues, my learned friends who took four years to prepare the allegations against the Accused, that there were other targets.  That is not my role.  They are the ones who prepared the indictment, and they are the ones to provide evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  They need to tell us exactly what happened in Rusumo, Your Honours.  There is nothing said in that regard.  

Genocide cannot be defined by a specific crime.  I do admit and I believe that this is the essence of genocide, but when you look at 285, paragraph 161 of the judgement, they say that it is said that Gacumbitsi killed Murefu as a signal for the others to go into the commission of a crime.  Murefu is mentioned, but there is no evidence to suggest that Murefu, if he did indeed exist, was indeed a Tutsi, and even in the indictment nothing proved that these people were Tutsi.  And the Prosecutor will be unable to prove this to you.  The Prosecutor will claim that Murefu was part of a wider investigation, but the Prosecutor has not proved -- has not provided any evidence to that effect.  

I have to come back to this issue.  It's the fact that Murefu was killed, or allegedly was killed on the 15th of April.  Now, the 15th of April Gacumbitsi was taken to the parish of Nyarubuye by Sebudandi.  And you have the disclosure made by the Prosecution, whereas in 1994 Sebudandi was no longer a driver of the commune.  He had already been fired in 1992.  So these are things which are sufficiently pertinent and relevant and which caused defect to the indictment, and the Chamber, in its embarrassment, had to substitute the only name that it was provided with, mainly, Murefu.  Where does this name come from, Mr. Prosecutor?  I said this yesterday, and I would like to repeat, the jurisprudence is applicable only when there is no evidence, and the law states that the indictment must be precise.  Please, do not mention the names of victims.  There's no problem.  But as soon as you do it, you have to be precise, so that the Accused can be aware of what the allegations are.  

Mr. Prosecutor, did you at least, in one instance, say where Murefu lived, what commune?  And you've had the sentence of 30 years and you believe that life expectancy is a joke.  And I don't think that it is a joke.  What I would like to say is that I have not been informed of the other sites of genocide.  Learned friends, Gacumbitsi was alone in Rusumo and the only crime that was committed has been viewed to -- related to genocide, to rape and all the events that occurred in Nyarubuye parish between the 15th and the 20th of April, whereas my client was in hiding.  

Honourable Judges, in your deliberation, if you are to find a paragraph through which the Chamber has rejected my client's alibi, please let me know.  But if that is not the case, the Prosecutor cannot impose its own will on the decisions already rendered by the Trial Chamber. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Rex Lear)









1030H 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
We said, in our alibi, that the Accused was not there, and I repeated this in my submissions yesterday, Your Honours.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi's case -- unless you believe otherwise -- depends specifically on the events which took place in Nyarubuye.  And as regards for killings, for murder, for extermination of a target population, the Prosecutor claims that there were other sites, apart from Nyarubuye.  

I have noticed, Your Honours -- and I would like to conclude on that note -- that in the reply to my brief, the Prosecutor, regarding sentence, did not dare to mention what I said yesterday.  When you look at the judgment before you, you will see that the most serious aggravated circumstances of Gacumbitsi at the time of the events was bourgmestre.  That was his position.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  I was saying, Mr. President that the aggravating circumstances was that Gacumbitsi was bourgmestre.  Yesterday, in replying to my brief, he mentioned two of his witnesses, TAB (sic) and TBH.  TBH ********************** secteur.  He killed five people.  He committed genocide.  He admitted in writed (sic) to these commission -- to these offences and he was sentenced.  TBI also committed crimes, and he has been brought before the courts in Rwanda.  

Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Yes, I was saying, Your Honours, that TBH led the killings, and he admitted to killing five people, and this was in Kagina (phonetic) secteur.  And TBI, in Kigarama secteur, admitted the facts, and they were prosecuted in Rwanda.  Now, one had 15 years, and the other 11.  So, in total that was 26 years.  Gacumbitsi, who was not seen at the parish, was sentenced to 30 years.  And it is alleged that merely by the fact of being bourgmestre is sufficient for that to be mentioned as an aggravating circumstance.  

Your Honours, I do not know whether I may continue maybe for another five minutes, otherwise the time which had been allotted to me has expired.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Kouengoua, can you do it in a little less than five minutes?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours I am convinced of one thing, and I am submitting that thing to you.  If, in this case, in this trial, you will remove Murefu, if you remove Nyarubuye as a site, the Prosecutor will have all the difficulties in the world to mention the commission of any crime.  Because TAW, its star witness, left Rwanda on the 13th of April, and he stated before the Chamber -- and this is in my book of the appellant -- there was no burnt-down houses, and he never killed -- "And I never saw Gacumbitsi kill by his own hand."  

Yesterday, the Prosecutor stated that counsel for the Accused is mentioning the fact that the Prosecutor has manipulated witnesses.  Dear colleagues, the Prosecutor, I didn't say anything; it's your witness, TBH, who made those statements.  The Prosecutor said in Court on the 20th August that he received a document by diplomatic pouch on Saturday, and he looked for me everywhere.  But when the witness appeared on Monday, he said that I discussed this document with the Prosecutor on Friday, and he believed that it wasn't done properly, and we needed to review it.  This is a document which appeared, and this was a time when the witness claimed that there was distribution of weapons.  It's in the transcripts.  The Prosecutor did that, and that's what the witness said.  

I hope that when the Prosecutor mentioned this witness, he should maybe not (sic) have asked that -- the Chamber for a moment of silence, because I do not believe that that gentleman is still alive.  He did not live for more than one month.  

These are facts, Mr. President, Your Honours, which I'm submitting to you for appreciation.  TBH did what no other witness did, and in full view of the Court.  More than four pages he repeated the same question (sic), and he said over and over again that, "I never did so."  Yesterday I heard it said that he was not corroborated.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, instead of relying on the fact that my client came to you, you are depending on doctrine.  Now, I'm telling my colleague, and my colleague says that I am the one that gave her the document.  I said to the Chamber I had never seen this document, and then they mentioned to me corroboration.  All that we have said with regard to evidence is true, and from this moment nobody has proved this to the contrary.  

All that they want you to believe is that this is jurisprudence.  That's the theory.  And I'm saying, let's apply those -- that jurisprudence and those facts to -- and those doctrines to the fact.  This has not been done, and we have not been provided with that information, and we believe that our appeal is well-founded, and we believe you should consider it fully.  

I thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Much obliged to you, Mr. Kouengoua.  May I ask one question to wrap up the proceedings.  From the point of view of the record, would I be right in saying that the Defence speaks French and did receive a copy of the indictment in the French language?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Mr. President, that is indeed the case.  That is indeed the case, Mr. President, Your Honours.  And in French law, the copy that the Accused receives is equivalent to his own original.  That is the one -- the text that he should be using.  And that is the text he should be confronted with.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Kouengoua, I'm led by your observations to stress the point that the Appeals Chamber endeavours to give both sides a fair hearing.  You would appreciate that much of the discussions from the Bench this morning related to a point in your favour, would you?  You appreciate that the discussions initiated by the Bench related to a point that tended to favour your side?  Do you appreciate that?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Your Honours, the Defence team, of which I'm lead counsel, feels comforted by the words pronounced by your Chamber, and we believe that promises of flowers will definitely bear fruit.  But I do believe that this was not the case in the Trial Chamber.  And I do apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we must keep an open mind on all issues decided -- presented before us.  But I think you will appreciate that the Appeals Chamber tries its best to hear both sides reasonably fully.  

Now, for the Prosecution, I have a question.  

Mr. Prosecutor, I believe you undertook to investigate certain things relating to the motion the Defence has moved before us.  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, Your Honour.  If I might just consult with my colleague, I will find out the status of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you.  

Your Honour, I'm instructed that those checks were made, and the Prosecution is ready to argue the matter, if necessary, now.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, then, we will take the adjournment at this time and return at 11 o'clock to hear you and the Defence on the motion.  Is that right?  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  
(Court recessed from 1041H to 1102H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Prosecutor, we will now hear from you, I think, on the motion for the file by the Defence.  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, if Your Honour pleases, Mr. Stewart of counsel will speak for the Prosecution on that point.  I turn the floor over to Mr. Stewart.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. STEWART: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Did you wish to hear from us first on the admissibility of the motion, on all the issues relating to the motion?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. STEWART: 
Thank you.  

I just had a document in my hand -- which I have now recovered, thank you.  

Mr. President, just to alert you, I'm going to make two submissions very briefly, and when I come to the third submission I'm going to have to request a closed session for just a couple of minutes, because I have to refer to evidence that was taken by the Trial Chamber in closed session.  But I will alert you to that when I come to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  
MR. STEWART: 
Now, first of all, I want, as a matter of putting this on the record, to say that we regret that the two statements that have been disclosed to the Defence were not disclosed before the trial.  They were within the possession of the Prosecution, I believe, by April of 2003, if I'm not mistaken, and the trial began in July of 2003.  Insofar as we're able to determine it was an unfortunate oversight, but it's one that we regret, and we recognise that we have to improve our performance, even at this level, because although we did make the disclosure, as we should have done, we did so so late that clearly it has perturbed, to some degree, the hearing of the appeal.  And so I regret that, and I apologise for it on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor.  

When the disclosure was made we filed a document, and I'm simply going to adopt the two arguments made in that document as two of the arguments in response to the motion you have this morning.  And I needn't go into detail with respect to those arguments.  
The first one is that the information contained in the statements is of a purely hearsay nature, with respect to the meetings designed to sensitise the population against killing, and in relation to the arrests.  These two individuals are reporting information that they have received from other people.  The one individual who speaks about meetings says, in the next breath, that he never attended any of the meetings.  So we take the position that it's rank hearsay.  

We also have taken the position, and provided you in the filing document, if I can call it that, with specific references to the trial record that there was indeed better evidence, if you will, before the Trial Chamber in relation to these same incidents.  And in the end result the Trial Chamber, having considered that evidence, found that it did not detract from the cogent Prosecution evidence it had heard, and upon which it based its conclusions.  So, our submission is that, given the hearsay nature of the material, and the treatment of even better evidence by the Trial Chamber, this material, this information, this evidence, if you will, could not have had a decisive impact on the verdict, and therefore is not admissible under Rule 115.  

My friend has raised a third point which we, of course, did not anticipate, and have not responded to, if you will, in anticipation, in the filing document.  And I would like to address that point briefly now, but in order to do so I have to make reference to closed-session transcript.  So, if we could have just a couple of minutes of closed session, I would be grateful, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Registrar.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 24 to 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 19 to 23 by Kirstin McLean)














MR. WESTON: 
Yes, Mr. President, before the Prosecution appeal proper starts, the Prosecution is in possession of some of the information which was requested from the Bench earlier, regarding facts concerning the timing of disclosure of certain material.  Would it be convenient for the Prosecution to place that on the record now?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes.  
MR. WESTON: 
I will ask my colleague to do that.  He has the material.  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Very quickly, Your Honours.  In response to a question asked by Judge Schomburg, regarding the schedules to the pre-trial brief, Your Honour, we are in possession of that and we are happy to pass it on.  It was part of the proceedings in the Trial Chamber.  And then the disclosure of the relevant witness statement, also.  It is also part of the proceedings and is also available.  

Just in brief, the pre-trial disclosures are expressed -- expressly include the statement of the relevant witness.  It was given a set time limit, or time yesterday.  And in view of our submissions of the post -- in the communications, we believe that the Accused was well in advance informed of this allegation.  

Is it okay to pass it on?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do I take it that you have concluded, Mr. Mugwanya?  You have concluded?  

Yes, you will circulate the documents now, and then I take it, subject to the circulation of documents, you have concluded your submissions?  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
On this point, yes, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Then may I turn to the Prosecutor and ask him to open the appeal for the Prosecution.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, by way of overview, there are six grounds of appeal pleaded by the Prosecution.  The Prosecution will address oral argument on each of those six grounds, which obviously means that we will need to be quite succinct in our submissions.  The appeal Chamber, of course, does have the benefit of an extensive written brief on all six grounds.  

I -- if I may set out the order in which the grounds will be argued.  They do not correspond entirely to the order in which they appear in the notice of appeal.  That is not done in any way to confuse anyone, but merely because -- to present a more coherent account.  

The first ground you will hear oral argument on is ground 2, the ground pertaining to murder as a crime against humanity.  I will address the Court upon that ground.  

My colleague, Dr. Mugwanya, will then address the Court on grounds 3 and 6, that is, the ground of rape as a crime against humanity, and the ground regarding the liability of the appellant for ordering.  

Ms. Onsea will then address the Court on ground 5, that is, the ground where we say the Trial Chamber erred in law in not considering joint criminal enterprise.  I'm sorry, I have that out of order.  Before you hear from Ms. Onsea, Mr. Stewart will address the Court on the ground concerning the Trial Chamber's definition of the elements of the crime of rape as a crime against humanity.  

Ms. Onsea will then address the Court on the ground concerning the Trial Chamber's error in not considering joint criminal enterprise.  

And finally I will address the Court on the first ground of appeal, that is, the sentence appeal lodged by the Prosecution.  

By way of overview, the arguments are these:  Firstly, with regard to the ground concerning murder as a crime against humanity, our argument is essentially that the Trial Chamber erred in fact, as well as law, in not considering all relevant supporting evidence.  

With regard to ground 3, the crime of rape as a crime against humanity, our complaint is that the Trial Chamber erred, both in law and in fact, in not considering all of the relevant evidence and misconstruing the ambit of the nature of instigation.  

With regard to the 5th ground, the ground of joint criminal enterprise, we say that the Trial Chamber erred in law in not considering that joint criminal enterprise was properly pleaded -- a mode of liability which should have been considered by the Trial Chamber.  

With regard to the count concerning the definition of the elements of the crime of rape, we firstly say that that ground does not, in itself, affect the outcome of this appeal.  But, however, it is a very important point of law which has been directly raised by the Trial Chamber in its judgment.  

And finally, with regard to the sentence appeal, we will submit that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate; that the Trial Chamber failed to -- amongst other errors -- pay appropriate attention, or give appropriate -- sufficient weight to the gravity of the crime and the appellant's role in committing the crimes.  We will submit that the only appropriate sentence which should have been imposed, and which this Court should impose, is life imprisonment, not 30 years.  

Your Honour, that is the overview of the appeal.  If I may now turn to the second ground in the Prosecution notice of appeal, that is, concerning the crime of murder as a crime against humanity.  

If the Court pleases, the appellant was acquitted of murder as a crime against humanity.  The appeal by the Prosecution focuses on the decision by the Trial Chamber to acquit the appellant of the murders of the Tutsis women, Beatrice and Marie.  The error which we say is disclosed in the Trial Chamber's judgment is found at paragraph 196 of the judgment.  

Shortly put, the evidence which was considered by the Trial Chamber is this:  There was a statement overheard by a Prosecution witness, Witness TAS, who was accepted as a most credible and reliable witness.  She overheard a person called -- a police officer called Kazoba -- which I will spell K-A-Z-O-B-A -- state that Gacumbitsi had ordered the killings of the Tutsi, and they were to commence with the murders of Marie and Beatrice.  The Trial Chamber in its judgment accepted that the witness did hear that statement, they accepted that she was a reliable witness, that she did hear those words as she gave them on oath in Court.  However, the Trial Chamber declined to use that evidence to convict the appellant of murder.  

The error, which we say is disclosed in their reasons, occurs at paragraph 196 of the judgment.  The Trial Chamber says that, lacking sufficient cooperation, they declined to act upon the statement that the Witness TAS heard.  

It is our submission that the Trial Chamber, firstly, either did not correctly apprehend the nature of the corroborative evidence, or if the Trial Chamber did correctly apprehend it, it did not correctly apply a body of evidence which was in the Prosecution's case which was capable of -- in law and in fact -- supporting the testimony of Witness TAS.  That is, there was a body of surrounding evidence, of cogent surrounding evidence, which goes to prove the truth of the statement overheard by Witness TAS, that is, the man Kazoba relating to someone else that Gacumbitsi had ordered the killings of those two women.  

As we set out in our appeal brief, it is not necessary, of course, for corroborative or supporting evidence to be capable, standing on its own, of proving any conclusion of fact.  And it has been recently stated by this Chamber in the Kamuhanda judgment, evidence of a circumstantial nature can, of course, be corroborative or supporting.  

When one looks at the judgment, it is plain that there is a body of circumstantial evidence which, taken on its own, would not go anywhere to proving culpability for this crime.  However, when that evidence is considered as an integrated whole, and when the evidence of the Witness TAS is considered with that supporting evidence, our submission is this:  That there is no other inference, there is no other conclusion which is possibly open on a reasonable basis, other than that the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, ordered the murders of those two women.  

If the Court pleases, the matters relied upon by the Prosecution are set out in the written brief, but it is convenient now -- and I am conscious of the tight time constraints that we have -- but if I may just briefly set out the matters which we rely upon.  

Firstly, there is the fact that the Witness TAS overhears Kazoba say those things some time on the night of the 12th or the 13th of April.  The circumstances under which Kazoba is saying these things to an unknown person can only suggest -- and can only mean that when Kazoba was saying it -- not knowing that he's being overheard by anyone, that when Kazoba was saying those things, he is saying them spontaneously, and he is saying them as an indication of the truth of the contents.  There is no other possible construction which can be put on those words.  There would be no reason, no rational reason for Kazoba to fabricate such a statement.  

We also know that, of course, the victims, Marie and Beatrice, were well-known to the appellant.  They were his tenants.  On the 13th of April the appellant, along with some police officers, had evicted the women from their home.  The women were, of course, Tutsi.  The appellant was angry with them when he spoke to them.  He told them to get out or things would go badly for them.  

We also know, from the body of evidence contained within the Prosecution case, that in the days leading up to April 13, 1994, the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, had only one thing in his mind.  The appellant was concerned with the planning, preparation, and organisation of mass violence, directed by the Hutu towards the Tutsi.  We also know from the evidence that in those surrounding days, Sergeant Kazoba was frequently seen in the company of the appellant.  It would seem that he was in his entourage; it would seem that he would be a man who would be privy to orders which were being communicated by the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

When all of those facts is considered, including the fact that the two women die a violent death some time on the 13th or possibly early the next morning, it is our submission that there is no other inference which can be drawn from those prudent facts, other than what Sergeant Kazoba said was in fact an indication of what the appellant had ordered, that the appellant had ordered the deaths of those two females.  

Now, as we put in our written submissions, it is the case that the Trial Chamber, in determining what was to be done with the evidence which TAS gave, formed the view that there was no supporting evidence.  The Trial Chamber did not articulate what it meant by "corroboration".  Nor did the Trial Chamber go on to examine any other item of evidence which we say was corroborative -- in fact, is corroborative, and should be used to support the evidence of the witness.  

So, we say that the Trial Chamber fell into error.  Firstly, an error of law -- that it either did not understand the nature of corroboration; that it possibly set the bar too high for corroboration.  And the test for corroborative evidence should be, as we say, that it is evidence which merely supports the relevant piece of evidence and some material particular.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MR. WESTON: 
That was not articulated by the Trial Chamber.  Now, if that correct test is applied, we say that there is that body of evidence which does go to support the testimony of TAS, which goes to -- just goes to prove the truth of the contents of the statement she overheard.  

In that respect, as we set out in our written brief, the hearsay evidence that TAS gives is invested with such a high degree of reliability, given that strong supporting circumstances, that that is the only conclusion which can be drawn.  

Your Honour, they are my oral submissions on that ground, unless there's any question the Court has of me.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No questions.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  My colleague will now address you on the next two grounds.  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Thanks, Your Honours.  I will be addressing the appeal in relation to the rape conviction, and the one regarding ordering.  I will begin with the one in relation to rape.  

Your Honours, the Trial Chamber correctly returned a conviction of rape.  This conviction was based on the testimony of Witness THU, who gave evidence that she was raped, in addition to her colleagues; seven other colleagues -- women and girls.  However, Your Honour, the Trial Chamber erred by convicting him on the basis of only those rapes, and failing to convict him on other rapes which were proved beyond reasonable doubt.  And I refer to these rapes as "other rapes", for the purposes of the submissions.  These other rapes, Your Honour, were proven beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the testimony given by Witness TAS, TAO, and TAP.  

Before I go into the errors, Your Honours, I would like to provide a brief factual background which forms the basis of our appeal.  

It was proven by the Trial Chamber that on or about 17th April 1994, Gacumbitsi, in the company of others, went around Rusumo commune, and more specifically in the smaller part of this commune called Nyarubuye secteur, with a megaphone directly and publicly inciting Hutus to rape women.  Following this instigation, immediately, Witness THU and seven women/girls were raped.  The Trial Chamber found Gacumbitsi culpable for these rapes.  

Within the same location of Nyarubuye some other rapes took place, as described by Witness TAS, TAO, and TAP.  

Now, Your Honour, in finding Gacumbitsi culpable for the rapes of TAP and the seven women, the Trial Chamber found that those rapes took place immediately, and within the geographical location of the instigation.  That is correct, and we do not want to contest that.  The Trial Chamber was correct in returning a conviction of Gacumbitsi on the basis of those rapes.  However, it erred when it failed to expand the basis of conviction regarding the other rapes, and our main contentions are four.  

Your Honour, the first one is:  The Trial Chamber erred by narrowly construing the notion of instigation as a mode of participation.  It construed it by requiring a very high threshold not required by the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, namely, a demonstration of cause/effect, as opposed to a demonstration that the instigation substantially contributed to the rapes.  

Then our second error -- the second error which we raise, Your Honour, is that the Trial Chamber erred, on the facts, that it unanimously accepted to draw the only conclusion, that the rapes of the other three women -- the rapes of other women was substantial -- I mean, it arose as a result of the instigation.  It arose as a result of the substantial contribution of Gacumbitsi's instigation.  

Then a third error which we raise, Your Honour, is that, even assuming the Trial Chamber was correct not to find instigation as a basis of liability, it should have found Gacumbitsi liable on the basis of other -- Article 6(1), modes of liability.  
And finally, our fourth principle error is that it should -- the Trial Chamber should have found Gacumbitsi culpable on the basis of Article 6(3).  

Your Honour, I will quickly go back to the first error.  The first error is that the Trial Chamber erred by narrowly construing the nature of the instigation.  As I submitted, we don't contest the fact that following Gacumbitsi's instigation, Witness THU and seven women were immediately raped.  But, in dismissing the culpability of the Accused on the basis of the other rapes, the Trial Chamber holds -- without explaining clearly -- that there was no causal nexus between the instigation committed by Gacumbitsi and the rapes.  

But, in view of the fact that the Trial Chamber had emphasised the notions of immediate -- immediacy and closeness, in terms of geographical location, of those rapes of THU and seven women, it seems clear that the Trial Chamber's conception of instigation was that it must be proven that the instigation causes the rapes. 

This approach, Your Honours, is wrong -- it's wrong because the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber is that the instigation must substantially contribute to the rapes or to the crimes.  It should not be demonstrated by the Prosecution that without the instigation there would not have been crimes.  What is required is that the Accused's participation contributes substantially to the crimes.  And this is established in a number of cases, including Kayishema, paragraph 198, and other cases from the ICTY.  

Your Honour, by requiring the immediacy and the closeness in terms of geographical location, the Trial Chamber heightened the threshold.  Given the fact that the witness -- given the fact that the other rapes also took place within the same timeframe -- and I will demonstrate in the second error -- I will demonstrate.  And given that the crimes were perpetrated within the same location, our submission is that, actually, the other rapes met this heightened threshold.  

Your Honour, I will go to the second error, which is an error of fact.  Your Honour, when you examine the facts which the Trial Chamber unanimously found as having been proven, our submission is that the only reasonable inference is that Gacumbitsi is culpable for the other rapes.  And I will ask very quickly the -- our booth behind for the Powerpoint.  I want to simply go through the facts, the factual findings, which the Trial Chamber unanimously accepted.  

If I can ask the booth for Powerpoint?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What do you have in mind?
  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
I just wanted to show the facts very quickly, but if that's not possible I can just summarise them, the facts.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please proceed.  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Your Honour, a number of facts were accepted by the Trial Chamber, unanimously.  Among which is, one:  Gacumbitsi directly and publicly instigated rapes.  Immediately following this instigation Witness THU and seven women were raped.  

In addition, other women were raped.  Some of them were raped within the same location as the instigation, namely, Nyarubuye secteur.  And these other rapes were committed within the same timeframe, mid-April 1994.  

Some witnesses -- the victims of the rapes -- confirmed that their rapists told them that they were executing Gacumbitsi's order.  

Other witnesses also explained that the crimes were perpetrated with atrocity in a manner which Gacumbitsi had stressed, namely, that those who resisted were supposed to be raped atrociously, including inserting instruments in their genitals.  

Furthermore, it was found by the Trial Chamber that these rapes were part and parcel of widespread attacks within the commune.  

Finally, it was established in several paragraphs of the judgment that Gacumbitsi was the bourgmestre; he was the highest authority in the commune.  He had the obligation to ensure law and order.  But despite his knowledge of these rapes, he did not take any steps to prevent them.  Instead, he was directly involved in the commission of crimes against the Tutsi population.  

Your Honour, looking at all these facts, holistically, in light of the entire context of the crimes within Rusumo, and in light of the position Gacumbitsi held as the highest authority in the commune, our submission is that the only reasonable inference the Trial Chamber should have drawn is that these other rapes must be held on Gacumbitsi -- Gacumbitsi's instigation.  

Your Honour, the Appeals Chamber jurisprudence also is helpful on an appellant point, as it has been established in a number of cases by the Appeals Chamber, including Blaskic, paragraphs 41 and 42, and Kordic, paragraphs 31 and 32.  Your Honour, it has been established that an accused participating in a crime with the knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood that crimes would be committed, that accused must be assumed to have accepted those crimes.  

Your Honours, the totality of the facts that the Trial Chamber accepted leads to the conclusion that Gacumbitsi accepted the commission of these crimes.  He accepted not only that TAQ and seven women had been raped, but that rapes be committed widely, far and wide.  The other rapes, as I said, were committed with the same timeframe and within the same geographical location, the secteur of Nyarubuye.  So, Gacumbitsi set in motion, and he accepted setting in motion, a chain of events whose repercussions he knew very well.  He knew that Tutsi women would be raped.  And our submission is that he should be held accountable for those other rapes.  

Thirdly, I want to address very quickly the third ground of -- the third complaint, or third error, namely that even assuming the Trial Chamber would not hold Gacumbitsi culpable for instigation, they should have held him culpable for other modes of liability in Article 61.  I don't want to go into those modes of liability, but I want to stress that, among other modes of liability, at the very least the Trial Chamber should have held Gacumbitsi culpable for aiding and abetting.  

Your Honours, as established in the Appeals jurisprudence, aiding and abetting involves a situation where an accused encourages, supports, or promotes the communal conduct.  It is not required that the crimes take place at the scene of the encouragement, at the scene of the aiding.  The crimes can be committed in a location far removed, or far -- I mean, in a location different from the scene of the aiding and abetting.  In this case, we submit that, at the very least, besides planning, besides participation in joint enterprise -- which will be addressed by my learned colleague, Inneke Onsea -- at the very least, aiding and abetting would have been an available mode of liability to hold Gacumbitsi culpable.  

It's not in dispute that the manner in which he perpetrated the instigation, the manner in which he encouraged the commission of rapes; that this instigation substantially contributed to the perpetuation of rapes, in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Tribunal in relation to aiding and abetting.  The same principle applies to other modes of liability, including planning, ordering.  Most specifically I refer the Appeals Chamber to Kordic, Appeals Chamber.  So our submission is that at the very least Gacumbitsi should have been held responsible for aiding and abetting.  

Finally, the final error we want to address is in relation to Article 6(3).  And our submission is that, even assuming that article 6.1 liability wasn't available, the Trial Chamber should have held Gacumbitsi culpable for -- he should have been held culpable as a superior, within the meaning of Article 6(3) of the statute.  Your Honour, the fact (unintelligible), among other factors, demonstrate clearly that Gacumbitsi was a superior over and above not only the communal policemen, but other perpetrators of crimes.  He was the highest authority in the commune.  As the Trial Chamber found, he could give binding orders to anyone.  He knew that crimes were being committed, but they were not -- he took no steps -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, will you take a question from my colleague, Judge Schomburg?  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Yes.  
(Pages 28 to 37 by Kirstin McLean)































1200H 
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Could you please help me with this.  I know you are pleading only in the trial text if 6.1 is not established, but how can you come to the conclusion that Mr. Gacumbitsi held a superior position over the perpetrators and then on the police forces in his capacity of bourgmestre?  

I think we have established in our jurisprudence the 6.3 responsibility in relation to military personnel.  However, as regards civil personnel, it's highly disputed, and in particular, I can't see any responsibility or hierarchy or superior subordinate relationship between perpetrator and Mr. Gacumbitsi. 
MR. MUGWANYA: 
I will quickly respond to that, Your Honour.  I will -- I will address some parts of that question in my next -- next ground, but if I can quickly point out, Your Honour, although, as you actually pointed out, this mode of liability has been established for the military.  The same mode of liability applies to civilians, because the main test, the main test, I must say, is what has got to be established is that an accused -- an accused possessed effective control over others.  The manner in which his position of superior emerges is actually immaterial.  What must be established -- actually, the position -- the position of superior can emerge formally or informally.  It may be de jure or de facto.  And that this Chamber has actually explained, if I can refer you to some jurisprudence, that -- I'll get to the jurisprudence in a moment -- that actually questions regarding the existence of effective control material ability are left to evidence.  They are not matters of law.  They are left to evidence.  Because what is required is that it must be demonstrated that an accused possessed effective control, and this, in turn, means that he must possess the material ability to punish, prevent, or actually initiate proceedings for the punishment of perpetrators. 

Now, concerning the jurisprudence which I just pointed out that indicators of effective control are matters of evidence than substantive law, Your Honour, I'd like to refer you to Blaskic Appeals Chamber jurisprudence, article -- paragraph 69 and Aleksovski -- if I can spell that, A-L-E-K-S-O-V-S-K-I -- paragraph 76.  

So matters concerning effective control and material ability are matters for evidence, not matters of substantive law.  Because superior responsibility is not confined to de jure formal relationship.  It can emerge in a de facto setting.  As long as it can be shown that the accused possessed effective control in the context of material ability to prevent and punish the crimes.  

Now, in the context of Gacumbitsi, as actually submitted in detail in our -- in our brief, Gacumbitsi possessed effective control over a wide range of perpetrators.  He could punish.  He could prevent.  And at the very least, he could initiate proceedings against perpetrators.  As explained by the Appeals Chamber, prevention or punishment is not limited to the direct -- to direct punishment, that an accused must directly punish by himself, but to certain situations where an accused in the same position can at least initiate proceedings against the perpetrators. 

Gacumbitsi was the bourgmestre of Rusumo.  He was a high society in the commune.  Gacumbitsi, as the Trial Chamber found, could give orders binding on everyone.  So even assuming he was not capable of punishing himself, at the very least, he was in a position to initiate proceedings leading to the punishment of the perpetrators.  

So in our humble submission -- submissions, regarding the ground of rape, our position is that even assuming Article 6.1 culpability is not available, at the very least, Gacumbitsi should have been held liable under Article 6.3 given that she (sic) was a superior against a wide range of perpetrators of crimes, the Hutu population and Interahamwe, because he could or was in a position to prevent, punish, or initiate proceedings for the punishment of those who committed the other rapes for which Gacumbitsi wasn't held liable. 

I don't know whether I answered your question, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Sorry, no.  I'm not satisfied at all.  Is it your submission that it formed part of customary international law in 1994 that you can be held criminally responsible for acts committed by perpetrators and that you can be seen as a superior to those perpetrators?  And then in addition, isn't it a contradiction in itself that you request that a perpetrator, as is the position -- the opinion of the Prosecution and of -- in the judgement, that when you are acting yourself as a perpetrator, that you should take the necessary steps to punish, yourself?  
MR. MUGWANYA: 
Thanks, Your Honour.  In a given situation where an accused is directly involved, and this is the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, if an accused is directly involved in the crimes, it's preferred that the Prosecutor and the Trial Chamber is actually in - in establishing his culpability rely on Article 6.1, such that if he was also a superior in the same circumstances, that superior position will be relevant in sentencing. 

Now, in terms of the study you have given, whether it is a contradiction if an accused is actually perpetrator, then he wants to initiate proceedings against himself, my submission is that, well, he can be held responsible under 6.1, but the fact that he was also involved does not absolve him from the legal obligation that there are others over which he exercised effective control are brought to justice or they're reported to relevant authorities.  

So in our submission, really, even if an accused was directly involved with his own subordinates, that doesn't absolve him from the obligations under the law to initiate proceedings or to punish the perpetrators.  Of course, I mean, of course, one may argue that he wouldn't do it because he wasn't involved, but his not doing it, actually, is the reason -- is the very reason why he should be held responsible under 6.3 as well, just assuming, for instance, if Article 6.1 is not established.  But if he's established to be liable under 6.1, then his superiors -- superior position would be taken into account in sentencing.  

I will quickly -- I will quickly address our -- our sixth ground of appeal, which is in relation to the notion of ordering. 

Your Honour, our main -- our main errors which we submit were committed by the Trial Chamber are two.  First, the Trial Chamber had in its construction of ordering -- the Trial Chamber required, which is wrong, that to establish culpability for ordering, it must be proven that the one giving an order was a former superior to those whom he gave the order, thereby reading Article 6.3 into the notion of ordering.  

Then our second area is that -- the second area we are raising is that the Trial Chamber, even on the facts, adds by failing to draw the only reasonable conclusion that on all the facts that were before it and on the basis of the facts it had accepted, the Accused gave orders to commit crimes. 

Maybe briefly, the factual basis of this first complaint is this:  The Trial Chamber found that Gacumbitsi was culpable for ordering only in relation to the communal police, because the communal police, under the laws of Rwanda, were -- or was a de jure subordinate over the Accused.  And, Your Honours, this can be found in -- in paragraphs -- in paragraph 243 of the judgement. 

So in the opinion of the Trial Chamber, although Gacumbitsi gave orders to perpetrators of crimes who were jointly involved in the perpetration of crimes, namely, communal police, Interahamwe, the Hutu population, gendarmerie, his order was confined to the communal policemen only, although these perpetrators were involved jointly, and even if Gacumbitsi gave the order to all of them.  

Your Honour, this is a wrong approach to the law.  A look at paragraph 40 -- look at paragraph 243 of the -- of the judgement, the Trial Chamber holds that Gacumbitsi was not a superior over the other perpetrators of attacks because the law did not make him a superior.  And the law did not put him in a -- in a position whereby he was in a formal administrative hierarchy as a superior. 

So in paragraph 243, the Trial Chamber emphasises the absence of the law that made him a superior and the absence of him being in a formal hierarchy and superior within the law.  Your Honours, the Appeals Chamber jurisprudence is different on this.  To prove he ordered, it's not required that the Prosecutor demonstrates that the Accused was a superior, strictly speaking, within the meaning of Article 6.3.  

What is required, as explained by the Appeals Chamber, is that an accused is in a position of authority and uses that position of authority to compel others to commit crimes.  This is spelt out in a number of cases, among which is Kordic, Semanza, and Kamuhanda.  It's not required that the Accused is a former superior.  What is required is that he was in a position of authority to give orders or to give instructions, which instructions compel others to commit crimes. 

Your Honour, this was the position in the present case.  De jure, we could submit that he was in that position.  And even de facto he was in the position to compel others to commit crimes, and he, in fact, compelled them to commit crimes.  

This takes me to the second area we want to rely on, and this is the fact that even on the basis of the facts before the Trial Chamber, the facts the Trial Chamber unanimously accepted, the unreasonable conclusion is that the Accused was in a position of authority to give orders and that he gave orders, which orders were carried out by -- by the Accused. 

Your Honour, in our brief we detail -- we detail the factual findings, and these are found on paragraph 209 to paragraph 220 of our brief.  But, in summary, besides him being a bourgmestre and being the highest authority in the commune, with the capacity to give binding orders on everyone, regardless of whether they were communal police or Interahamwe, Your Honours, the Accused was at massacre scenes.  He gave instructions indiscriminately to groups of attackers, amongst which were communal policemen, and other perpetrators, Interahamwe, Hutu population.  These attackers didn't hesitate in accepting or in following Gacumbitsi's orders. 

At the Nyarubuye parish, Your Honours, when Gacumbitsi struck down one of the victims and when he called upon the attackers to follow suit, they never hesitated in his appeal.  He never begged them.  He never convinced them.  He never took the effort to convince them.  Their response was immediate, a reflection of the fact that Gacumbitsi was in a position of authority to give instructions, and for those instructions to be obeyed.  

On other occasions, including his consistent visitations to various locations, Gacumbitsi gave instructions.  These instructions were followed, among which were on 17 April he went round Rusumo commune instigating rapes.  And as found by the Trial Chamber, immediately following those -- that instigation, Tutsis were raped.  
On 13th April, 1993 in Karama commune he called upon assailants to kill Tutsis.  Tutsis were killed in the pursuit of the Accused's instruction.  In Kanyinya, in Nyarubuye parish, and other locations, the Accused gave instructions.  None of the perpetrators questioned his instructions.  They all complied.  

In conclusion, Your Honour, without even taking much of the time of the Appeals Chamber, the facts summarised in those paragraphs demonstrate overwhelmingly that Gacumbitsi was in a position of authority to order, not only the communal policemen, but other perpetrators of crimes:  Interahamwe, the Hutu population, gendarmerie.  

And our humble submission is that the Appeals Chamber corrects the area committed by the 
Trial Chamber by expanding the basis of Gacumbitsi's conviction for ordering to encompass not only communal policemen, but other perpetrators of crimes, perpetrators whom Gacumbitsi gave instructions to commit crimes, and they heeded to those instructions. 

Unless I am -- unless there are some questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. STEWART: 
Good day, Mr. President, Your Honours. 

I'm going to address briefly quite a different situation.  You've been hearing grounds of appeal advanced in relation to errors that the Prosecutor submits the Trial Chamber made.  In this particular case, there is no complaint about the way in which the Trial Chamber dealt with the particular situation.  The complaint relates to the legal framework within which the Trial Chamber was compelled to deal with the situation, and we are seeking redress in relation to that legal framework. 

The Trial Chamber got it right, but it had to deal with the situation I'm about to address within a legal framework which we submit needs to be clarified and changed. 

Rape was used as an instrument of genocide in Rwanda in the period from April through June of 1994.  Now, this cruel fact is well documented.  The UN special rapporteur in speaking about the situation of human rights in Rwanda in that period reported rape was systematic and was used as a weapon by the perpetrators of the massacres.  And we've given the references that I'm going to be used in our brief.  We've developed this argument fully within our brief. 

And this fact clearly emerges from cases tried before this Tribunal, cases such as Akayesu, and more recently Muhimana, and it is obviously a central feature of the case before you now. 
Now, the Trial Chamber in this case handled the definition of rape in international law and its application to the facts impeccably.  And as I've mentioned, this ground of appeal relates not to the Trial Chamber's handling of the definition of rape and its application to the facts, but rather to the legal framework within which the Trial Chamber was compelled to work, given the current state of the law.  And we're requesting that you adjust that legal framework and give the definition of rape and sexual violence a shape that is appropriate in international criminal law.  

What I would like to do is outline the position that we take, note what the Trial Chamber did, and then explain where the tension lies, why there's an issue at all.  Because you may be wondering, you know, why there is an issue.  And I'll explain why there's an issue and then come to our prayer for relief. 

Our position is simply this:  Given the coercive circumstances inherent in rape as an international crime, the presumption should be that the victim did not consent and that the perpetrator knew about that absence of consent.  In the usual case, the Prosecution should not be required to prove the absence of consent in the victim and the knowledge of this on the part of the perpetrator. 

In other words, non-consent and knowledge of non-consent are not essential elements of the crime of rape that the Prosecution must establish.  

Now, the only exception to this rule would be where, in the circumstances of a particular case, the evidence discloses a defensive consent that has an air of reality within the procedural and admissibility requirements of Rule 96.  Only then, only then would the Prosecutor have to discredit the Defence and prove that there was no viable consent on the part of the victim and that the perpetrator knew this or was aware of circumstances that would reasonably have put him on notice. 

Had this been the rule, then the Trial Chamber would not have had even to address the issue of consent as it did at paragraph 325 of the judgement.  I was going to quote that to you, but I just leave you with that reference.  It is -- it is elegantly and efficiently dealt with in that paragraph.  And our submission is that the Trial Chamber would not even have had to address the issue of consent if the rule were as I have submitted it should be.  Because in the end, in a case such as this one, and this is a good example of such a case, we submit that there is no useful forensic purpose that is served by requiring a Trial Chamber to address the issue of non-consent. 

And really, what I'm getting at is what lies behind the Trial Chamber having to address that issue.  And that is the question that has to be put to the victim or to the witness.  It's the handling of the evidence which lies behind, of course, the Trial Chamber's having to address such an issue.  We submit that there's just no useful forensic purpose in the normal case for that. 
We've taken the opportunity to raise the issue in this appeal because we're not likely to get another chance for a long time until quite late in the life of this Tribunal, as far as we can see.  You may be aware that there was recently a conviction for rape as a crime against humanity in the case of Muhimana.  But in that case the parties were agreed on the definition of rape, and the issue that we want to raise in this appeal doesn't appear in Muhimana's notice of appeal.  So it's not going to come before you in that case, as far as we can determine.  And yet, we have a number of cases in trial now where rape has been charged, and we have cases pending where rape is charged.  So the definition of the crime is a matter of importance to the Prosecutor. 

The Chamber is well aware of the Trial Chamber's definition of rape in Akayesu.  I'm going to read that because it is important and it's really our -- our baseline, it's our position.  

The Trial Chamber defined rape in clear but flexible terms as follows at paragraph 598 of its judgement in Akayesu.  I quote:  "The Chamber defines rape as a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive.  Sexual violence, which includes rape, is considered to be any act of a sexual nature which is committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive." 

Now, it is said that there is a tension -- has been said, let me put it that way, that there is a tension between that elegant definition and the later elaboration of the definition in the case of Kunarac.  And this Chamber is well aware of the case.  A definition was elaborated by the Trial Chamber in Kunarac, and it was accepted by the ICTY Appeals Chamber.  And I would submit that the definition accepted was compatible with Akayesu except that it explicitly injected into the definition the requirement that non-consent on the part of the victim be proved as part of the actus reus of the crime and that the knowledge of this non-consent be proved as a component of the mens rea of the crime, as I read Kunarac. 

Nevertheless, the Appeals Chamber in Kunarac went on to say at paragraph 130, and I quote:  "The circumstances giving rise to the instant appeal and that prevail in most cases charged as either war crimes or crimes against humanity will be almost universally coercive, that is to say, true consent will not be possible." 

The same observation I would submit would apply to genocide.  My submission is that the Akayesu definition and the Kunarac definition is more apparent than real.  In the end, the coercive circumstances that inevitably emerge from the evidence in the cases we deal with make the issue of consent or non-consent superfluous.  As I've said the good example is the respondent's. 

I mention to you the Muhimana decision, and in that case, the Trial Chamber has tried to reconcile Akayesu and Kunarac.  Both the Defence and the Prosecution in Muhimana accepted the Akayesu definition, and I would refer you to paragraph 535 of the Muhimana decision.  And the Trial Chamber then went on at paragraph 400 -- I'm sorry, 546 of its judgement to place the emphasis on the coercive circumstances feature of the Kunarac decision. 

Our submission is that the focus should be upon the conduct and the state of mind of the accused and not upon the conduct and the state of the mind of the victim, except in the exceptional case where the evidence throws up a potential defence of consent.  And Kunarac, of course, is an example of that.  There was a consent defence or a mistaken belief in consent defence in relation to one of the incidents, as I recall.  And the Trial Chamber had little difficulty in disposing of that, given the circumstances of the case.  So that defence can come up.  The accused is not barred from raising the defence in an appropriate case, and then it will be dealt with and the burden of proof will be on the Prosecution. 

Now, I suppose I could just sum up our position by submitting to you that what I'm suggesting the approach ought to be is the approach that the ICTY Appeals Chamber accepted for the crime of enslavement.  And I would submit to you that enslavement, like rape, implies an overbearing of the free will.  But the Prosecutor is not required to prove lack of consent or knowledge of lack of consent in the case of enslavement as an essential element of the crime.  And yet, the Appeals Chamber in Kunarac accepted that in an appropriate case, if on the evidence the Defence could say, "Well, there was consent, this wasn't a case of enslavement, the person was willingly doing what the evidence discloses," in that situation, the Chamber will consider the evidence in order to determine whether or not the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proof.  And in our submission, a similar approach to rape would be entirely workable and would recognise the nature of rape as an international crime. 

I just want to touch very briefly on a point we've developed in our written brief.  Both the Akayesu 
Trial Chamber and the Kunarac Trial Chamber noted that a common feature of the definition of rape in domestic jurisdictions was its nonconsensual nature.  All I'm saying is that in domestic jurisdictions the law has to cover a spectrum of behaviour.  And at one end of the spectrum you have behaviour which resembles very closely consensual behaviour, and so it becomes essential in order to prove a crime of offence that the nonconsensual nature of the behaviour be established. 

However, in domestic jurisdictions, at the other end of the spectrum, there are situations where consent is simply vitiated by power imbalance, by threat, by whatever.  And I would submit that it's that end of the domestic spectrum of law, if you will, that really offers the better parallel to the situation that you have to deal with in international criminal law. 

Rape is not even cognisable as a crime under our jurisdiction unless it is an instrument of genocide causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group that's targeted, or it is linked to a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population on discriminatory grounds so as to make it a crime against humanity, or it qualifies as a violation of the Geneva Conventions.  So going in, rape as a crime in international criminal law is necessarily linked to a situation of violence or oppression.  In my submission, this should be recognised frankly by this Chamber. 

I'm not going to read the passage to you, but there is, in my submission, a striking passage in the 
Trial Chamber's decision in Akayesu at paragraph 597 where the Trial Chamber compares rape to torture and speaks about rape being used for the purposes of intimidation, degradation, humiliation, discrimination, punishment, control, or destruction of a person. 

That is the -- that is the dreadful quality of crime in our jurisdiction.  And in my submission, this Chamber should take the next logical step which, I submit, is anticipated in the Kunarac judgement and find that the Prosecution accept where a viable defence comes up on the evidence is not required -- is not required to address explicitly the issue of consent or non-consent, and neither should a 
Trial Chamber.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
One question.  Mr. Stewart, I must say that I am much attracted to your arguments, but tell me this:  In the present state of customary international law, is the burden on the Prosecution to prove absence of consent in rape?  
MR. STEWART: 
Well, my submission is that the burden on the Prosecution is to prove an aggressive act that happens to have a sexual character because, as opposed to demonstrating a case where someone has taken a machete and sliced off an arm, what has happened is that the person has been thrown to the ground and a stick has been shoved into her genitals, or she has been raped in the sense that she's been -- been taken by a man.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I ask you this question:  In view of the disposition of the Tribunal to infer absence of consent on proof by the Prosecution of coercive circumstances, is there any pressing need for the Tribunal to go, once more, into this question of discharging the Prosecution from the obligation to prove lack of consent?  
MR. STEWART: 
Mr. President, I suppose what I am pleading for is the repute of international criminal justice and the situation of victims of rape, be they male or female.  

If it is clear that that inquiry is not a necessary one, then, of course, the evidence is going to be led about the coercive circumstances, as it is now.  But no one is going to have to put a question to a witness to ask the obvious, a question that may seem surreal to the witness, even hurtful, and yet, we do preserve the ability of an accused person in an appropriate case.  We haven't discussed such cases, and it's probably not appropriate to do it in this case, but we certainly have racked our brains to -- to discover such cases.  And there are some cases where, although the Prosecution would likely be able to meet its burden reasonably easily, still the issue would come up.  I'm talking about situations of concubinage where potential victims of genocide are, in essence, sheltered from the killing by being attached to a powerful man who is able to protect them.  And you have a very interesting situation there that would need, perhaps, to be explored forensically in the appropriate case.  But in the normal case, such as this one, it just -- it just seems such an unnecessary step, and it's not one required in the case of other crimes such as enslavement.  

So it may be a counsel perfection, Mr. President, but I make it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand, Mr. Stewart, but tell me this:  If it is this state now of customary international law that the burden is on the Prosecution to prove absence of consent, then does it lie within the power of this Appeals Chamber of this Tribunal to reverse that burden?  
MR. STEWART: 
My answer to that, Mr. President, Judges are always, at least in the traditions that you and I could from, discovering the law that exists.  And I would submit that the law has been discovered perhaps in a way that's not quite perfect.  And customary international law, in fact, permits you to do what we request that you do on an examination of -- of the factors that Kunarac and Akayesu examined.  It's just, in a sense, a recalibration of the law.  It's a shifting, if you will, of -- of the definition, and I submit it's quite within your ambit to do it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One last question:  Article -- Rule 96(ii) does seem, arguably, to place on the Defence the burden of proving lack of consent or consent.  Was that really -- if that is a correct interpretation of that rule, was that rule competently made by the rule-making authority?  
MR. STEWART: 
If you -- I'm familiar with the rule, but I just want to check that paragraph again so that I don't misspeak myself.  

My submission is that that really reflects the state of the law in domestic jurisdictions where, as I mentioned, consent is vitiated.  And it only casts an evidentiary burden, if I can put it that way, or a burden of persuasion on the Defence which is quite acceptable.  It's not a shifting of the burden of proof.  It's simply to -- to -- what it alerts the Defence to is the need to produce evidence that gives the issue of consent an air of reality.  In other words, it simply can't be raised in a vacuum.  It has to be connected to the case.  It's no more than that, I submit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Stewart, I must be careful how I manage the time.  
MR. STEWART: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And not allow myself to appear to be monopolising the microphone, so I will now pass the word over to my colleague, Judge Schomburg.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  A very short question.  I'm really surprised that you come with this submission right now after the Kunarac appeal judgement.  If my recollection serves me right, in Kunarac appeal we explicitly stated when there is such a coercive situation, there is no need to prove the absent of consent.  

Referring also to domestic law in different countries where there is a rule when, for example, a prisoner is extremely vulnerable and helplessness (sic), then the absent of consent needs not to be proven.  It would be the rationale behind, and I think we emphasised this in Kunarac in relation to a camp situation, that it would be cynical to ask the victim of a rape whether there was consent or not.  

Do I understand you correctly, that you're aiming at developing the law from the Kunarac appeal one step further, that not only in the situation of a camp, but also in the situation we had before us in 1994?  Women were in a situation of helplessness, particular vulnerable, and therefore, it would be, again, cynical to ask for -- whether or not there was a consent.  Of course, there might be situations, as you've correctly indicated where, in fact, there is consent, and then the burden of proof is, no doubt, lost. 
MR. STEWART: 
Your Honour, I take comfort from your question, because it's certainly the way we read Kunarac practically.  We put the emphasis on the coercive circumstances.  The concern -- and you're absolutely correct that we, in a sense, are looking for an expansion of -- of the approach that you've just described across the board, so that it's an unusual case where consent becomes the issue, not one where we have to worry about it. 

You know, in the Kunarac trial, the question was put to the witnesses.  I remember that.  Counsel had to put that question to the witnesses.  Now, they found a way of putting it which was -- was the least harmful.  I think the question that was framed was, "Did this occur against your will?"  And of course the witness then had to chance to expand on just how much that was the case.  

But that's -- because in the Kunarac definition at the trial level, which was accepted, but then, I would submit, softened and modified in the way you've described by Appeals Chamber, because those elements are still there in black and white, we're requesting the clarification.  And it may be that it's just a clarification of what was intended by the Appeals Chamber in Kunarac, and if we get that, we'll be very, very satisfied.  Thank you.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.  You've been very helpful. 

Yes.  
MS. ONSEA: 
Good morning, once again, Your Honours.  I will now deal with the fifth ground of appeal pertaining to the refusal of the Trial Chamber to rely upon joint criminal enterprise as a basis for individual criminal responsibility of the Accused. 

Our submission is that the Trial Chamber was wrong in deciding in paragraph 289 of the judgement that joint criminal enterprise was not pleaded clearly enough to allow the Accused to defend himself adequately.  The Trial Chamber erred in law for two reasons, and these will be my two submissions.  

First, the Prosecution gave adequate notice to the Accused that it intended to charge him under a theory of common purpose liability as a co-perpetrator of a joint criminal enterprise. 

Second, the findings of the Trial Chamber show that the Accused acted, in fact, as a co-perpetrator of a joint criminal enterprise.  He should have been held liable as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. 

My oral submissions cover paragraphs 184 to 211 of the Prosecution's appellant's brief relating to the ground 5 on pages 60 to 74.  

But before I will start, Your Honours, with the gist of my submissions, I would like to bring an issue to your attention which was not raised during trial nor during the appeal by parties until this stage.  The paragraphs in the indictment which, in our submission, refer to joint criminal enterprise liability, namely, paragraphs 22 and 25, are, strictly speaking, grouped under the count of genocide and complicity in genocide. 

However, it is clear from an examination of the record that the Prosecution was pursuing a joint criminal enterprise theory for all crimes charged.  In this appeal we maintain the position that the indictment should be read as a whole and that, therefore, joint criminal enterprise liability is pleaded in paragraphs 22 and 25 of the indictment was pursued in relation to all counts. 

First, notice issue.  The real issue is, Your Honours, whether the Accused was given sufficient information that the Prosecution was relying upon a theory of common-purpose liability in order to be able to prepare his defence.  The Prosecution submits that in this case the Accused did receive adequate notice.  The Defence knew the case they had to meet.  It was clear from the language and the acts charged in the indictment that the Prosecution was relying upon the common-purpose theory.  And further, consistent notice was given in the pre-trial brief, the opening statement, the evidence as it unfolded at trial, and the arguments made in the closing brief. 

I want to lead you now through the notice procedure and the relevant documents through which notice was given.  These documents are referred to our appellant's brief, and you will find the paragraphs in the briefs in the footnotes.  That's why I suggest to you, Your Honours, that I will not repeat the paragraphs now during my oral submission, but I refer Your Honours to the written submissions we made in that respect. 

First, the indictment.  This is the first place where the Accused, in our submission, received notice that he was charged under a joint criminal enterprise theory.  We acknowledge that in light of the recent decisions as the Kvocka appeals judgement, the indictment is vague because it fails to make specific mention of joint criminal enterprise, and it fails to plead the specific form of joint criminal enterprise which is being alleged.  

Having said that, the indictment did include information which put the Accused on notice.  Paragraphs 22 and 25 of the indictment explicitly charges the Accused for acting in concert with other people in furtherance of a common plan.  And I will read these paragraphs out for you.  

Paragraph 22: "From those first days of April 1994 through 30 April 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi ordered, directed or acted in concert with local administrative officials in Kibungo préfecture, including bourgmestres and conseillers de secteur, to deny protection to civilian Tutsi refugees and to facilitate attacks upon them by communal police, Interahamwe, civilian militias, and local residents." 

Paragraph 25:  "Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, in his position of authority and acting in concert with others, participated in the planning, preparation, or execution of a common scheme, strategy or plan to exterminate the Tutsis by his own affirmative acts or through persons he assisted or by his subordinates with his knowledge and consent." 

Although the label used in the indictment is "acting in concert with," the label described the same situation as acting pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise.  At the time when the indictment was drafted and confirmed in June 2001, the expressions "joint criminal enterprise," "common purpose" and "criminal enterprise" were all used interchangeably.  It is commonly accepted that a reference to acting in concert together means acting together pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise. 

However, irrespective of what label has been used in the indictment, what is important, Your Honours, is that the underlying concept is always there.  The concept as such was pleaded in the indictment.  In line with the Kvocka appeals judgement, the indictment pleads the material facts underlying the joint criminal enterprise, namely, the purpose of the enterprise, the identity of the participants, and the Accused's participation in the enterprise. 

The purpose of the enterprise:  The indictment pleads the shared intent to destroy the Tutsi population and actions taken by the accused in furtherance -- in furtherance of this aim, namely, the criminal acts charged.  

The identity of the participants:  At least four individuals were identified by name in the indictment.  In addition, groups of individuals such as administrative personnel at a level of the commune, including conseillers de secteur, responsables de cellule, communal police, Interahamwe, and civilian militias were referenced as being involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the Accused.  

The nature of the Accused's participation in the enterprise was also described in the indictment.  The Accused's position as a bourgmestre of Rusumo commune in Kibungo préfecture at the time relevant to the indictment. 

Next, his authority to organise and direct the genocide that ensued in Rusumo commune.  Third, the indictment describes the Accused circulating about Rusumo in a vehicle belonging to the commune and actively encouraging attacks targeted on Tutsi by making speeches aimed at destroying the Tutsi group. 

In addition, the Accused is alleged to have organised meetings with military and administrative officials and arranging the transport of communal police, Interahamwe, and weapons in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi population.  

In addition to the indictment, Your Honours, the factual allegations in the pre-trial brief point to -- 
JUDGE MERON: 
Excuse me, with permission of the President.  You now referred to the words "joint criminal enterprise," drawing on the indictment or not drawing on the indictment?  
MS. ONSEA: 
Sorry, Your Honour, could you --  
JUDGE MERON: 
You used the word "joint criminal enterprise" in your last sentence. 
MS. ONSEA: 
Yes.
JUDGE MERON:
Or the sentence before that.  Where did you -- 
MS. ONSEA:
No, the indictment -- 
JUDGE MERON: 
Where did you take those words from?  
MS. ONSEA: 
Well, the indictment, in fact, does not plead the words "joint criminal enterprise."
JUDGE MERON:
So it was your interpretation of the indictment. 
MS. ONSEA:
It was my interpretation of the indictment.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Okay.  Let's have it clear. 
MS. ONSEA: 
In fact, it was in furtherance of a common scheme acting in concert with to destroy the Tutsi population.  And I can refer you to the paragraphs in the indictment.  Okay.  
JUDGE MERON: 
I just wanted to avoid the impression that you were citing from the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Onsea.  
MS. ONSEA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you slow down your pace a little for the interpreters?  
MS. ONSEA: 
I will.  I will, Your Honours.  I'm sorry.  My apologies to the interpreters. 

In addition to the indictment, the factual allegations in the pre-trial brief point to the existence of a common criminal plan amongst the attackers in which the Accused played a pivotal role.  Some examples: 
The pre-trial brief states that the Accused organised the campaign of destruction of the Tutsi civilian population by planning, preparing, and executing the looting pillaging, torturing, raping, and killing in Rusumo commune, Kibungo prefecture. 

The pre-trial brief also includes specific allegations of planning and inciting other participants in the attacks to kill the Tutsi civilian population throughout the commune.  It described meetings organised or attended by the Accused.  These meetings gathered the most senior and influential persons.  During these meetings, anti-Tutsi sentiments were expressed, and calls for the extermination of the Tutsi were made. 

It described the Accused inciting the conseillers de secteur, responsables de cellule, the chiefs of the MRD -- MRND and CDR political parties and the population in Rusumo commune to attack and kill the Tutsi throughout -- throughout the commune. 

It also pointed out that these actions formed part of a larger scheme to destroy the Tutsi population.  

On top of that, the allegations in the Prosecution's pre-trial brief, in particular with respect to the central incidents in Nyarubuye parish attacks, reflected existence of a joint action and purpose to destroy the Tutsi population.  

It is our submission, therefore, that viewed as a whole, the indictment, together with the pre-trial brief, put the Accused on notice that the Prosecution was relying upon a common purpose doctrine of liability. 

A further -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm in error.  I had assumed you had finished.  You hadn't.  
MS. ONSEA: 
No, I haven't finished, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Güney wants to ask you a question.  
MS. ONSEA: 
Okay.  Thank you.  
JUDGE GÜNEY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I thought that I was going to put my question to her after she finished, but I will do it now. 

I find a certain amount of difficulty in accepting that the indictment was adequately clear regarding the responsibility of the Accused in the participation in a joint criminal enterprise, given the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber.  As you are well aware, the vice was not cured by the disclosure, but do you continue to be believe that the Trial Chamber erred in failing to examine this mode of responsibility?  That is my question to you.  Thank you.  
MS. ONSEA: 
Your Honour, we do acknowledge that the indictment, as such, is vague in light of recent jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber in that it does not plead JCE, as such, it does not mention joint criminal enterprise as a term, and it does not indicate the category of joint criminal enterprise that was being alleged.  

However, the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber also states very clearly that vagueness may be cured, and our submission is that this vagueness has been cured during this case, not only in the indictment itself, because the indictment pleads the material facts underlying this mode of liability as required by the Kvocka Appeals Chamber, but it also -- also through notice given in the pre-trial brief, as I just pointed out to you, notice given in the opening statement during trial.  Further review of the trial record shows that the Prosecution did not transform its case and that the case at trial was clearly prosecuted on a theory of common purpose.  And this -- 
JUDGE MERON: 
Could you remind us, Counsel, please, when was -- what was the date of the Appeals Chamber judgement in Kvocka?  
MS. ONSEA: 
I'm sorry, Your Honours, but I can come to that -- I can provide you with a date.  I don't have the date here.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Am I right in assuming that Kvocka was decided after the trial?  Sorry?  
MS. ONSEA: 
Yes. 
JUDGE MERON: 
Excuse me?  My assumption is that Kvocka was decided after the judgement of the Trial Chamber in the case of Gacumbitsi.  So in looking at the context of the paragraph of the judgement which my learned colleague Judge Güney cited, I don't think that Kvocka really is here -- should be here used to analyse the error or not error made by the trial Court in Gacumbitsi. 

Now, looking at this paragraph 289, we read:  "The Chamber cannot make a finding on such allegations" -- that there was participation in joint criminal enterprise - "since it was not pleaded clearly enough to allow the Accused to defend himself adequately."

So putting quite apart from Kvocka, if it is true, as you are arguing, that the Prosecution really meant to allege joint criminal enterprise liability, why didn't it simply use the words "joint criminal enterprise"?  You spoke about the sort of equivalent value of this expression and certain other expressions used in the indictment.  Given how easy it would have been for the Prosecution to use these words, couldn't a reasonable Defence attorney take the omission of these words from the indictment as strong evidence that no joint criminal enterprise was being alleged?   I'm following the question presented by 
Judge Güney. 
MS. ONSEA: 
Thank you for your question, Your Honour.  Our submission is, like I said in the introduction, that at the time when the indictment was drafted and the indictment was confirmed, the different terms were used interchangeably.  I do agree -- we do acknowledge that it would have been better to have used the term "joint criminal enterprise," but at the time, different concepts were used to describe the same situation:  Common purpose, criminal enterprise, acting in concert with.  And, in fact, Ntakirutimana, and I can refer to the footnote, it is also acknowledge by the Appeals Chamber that these concepts were used interchangeably, and that at this moment we speak about participation in the joint criminal enterprise.  And that's why we also used this term in our appeal submissions.  

Now, the second part of your question comes down to notice.  Did the Prosecution give sufficient notice to the Defence that a common-purpose doctrine was alleged?  In our submission we did:  First the indictment, afterwards in the pre-trial brief, and during the trial.  In fact, the first time that joint criminal enterprise was used as a term was in the Prosecution's closing brief, but it was clear that the situation which was described there, was always being alleged against the Accused.  And, in fact, the Accused knew that he was charged with the common-purpose doctrine.  In his closing statement -- in his closing brief on page 65, he refers to that.  And he says, "Well, there is not enough evidence," but then it also implies that he understood the concept as such.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask you one question?  I don't claim any paternity over Tadic, though I was one of the Judges there, probably the presiding Judge.  But my understanding is that the case proceeded on the basis that it was not legislative.  It was putting forward a judicial construct based on its own analysis of the doctrines pertaining to the field.  Now, do I understand you to be saying some of the more recent decisions to which you have referred require the Prosecutor, if the Prosecutor is relying on JCE, specifically to mention JCE in the indictment?  
MS. ONSEA: 
Your Honours, one of the reasons -- I think one of the important implications of this ground is that, in fact, we have a lot -- we have other indictments before this Tribunal where a same common -- common-purpose doctrine is being alleged without, in fact, using the words "joint criminal enterprise" as such.  I would advise as a Prosecutor to other colleagues, if they come to me today with an indictment in which joint criminal enterprise is being alleged, to specifically put in the terms and to specifically refer to the -- to the concept as such.  

Now, in this indictment, the underlying situation was being described, and the material facts were also pleaded in the indictment.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We should thank you for your excellent contributions and close the arguments at that point.  We would resume because of a contraction in our programme.  I propose that we -- what is it -- we would resume at 2:35.  Is that agreeable?  2:35.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor -- 
MR. WESTON:
Thank you, Your Honour.  We don't have any court reporters though.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- the floor is yours.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  First of all, Your Honour, may I just enquire of the Court if there are any further questions the Court wishes to ask on the ground that was last argued before lunch that pertained to joint criminal enterprise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WESTON:
There are questions that the Court asked on the ground, are there?  
JUDGE MERON: 
We already ask our questions, I think.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I only see one more question, now that you have raised the matter.  This morning we had a discussion of the liability of the Accused for committing genocide through personally killing victims -- 
MR. WESTON:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- victim or victims.  Assuming that the Court holds that submission, would it be your view that the submission is, in any event, cancelled out by a finding, if there be a finding, that the Accused is liable on JCE?  
MR. WESTON:
Your Honour, that is the Prosecution position.  If, in the worse case for the Prosecution, that the Appellant's argument was upheld, the Prosecution pertains that a proper finding of joint criminal enterprise would establish liability under Article 6(1) on the basis of committing genocide for the appellant.  Thank you, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, if I may -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you.  If I may turn to the last ground in the Prosecution appeal, the ground pertaining to sentence.  Thirty years imprisonment for the crimes of genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and rape as a crime against humanity, given the position which this Appellant held, the power that he wielded and the grave consequences his actions caused, 30 years' imprisonment is manifestly inadequate.  

This Chamber, of course, has a limited jurisdiction in correcting sentence matters.  As is well established law, this Chamber may only intervene if the Appellant demonstrates a discernible error of law.  That is the case here.  The sentence of 30 years imprisonment for the crimes which 
Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, the Appellant, committed in April 1994, involving the use of his position as bourgmestre which involved his planning, instigation, ordering, aiding and abetting, and to some degree, committing the crime of genocide, his involvement on the same basis for the crimes of -- for the crime of extermination and his role in instigating rape.

These crimes can only be punished, can only be properly punished -- can only be adequately punished when the principles of deterrence and culpability of sentences are considered by the imposition of a term of life imprisonment.  

The Appellant -- sorry, the Respondent on this appeal, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, is a man of middle years.  He is completely corrupt of any exceptional mitigating circumstance.  Over matters which can be pleaded in mitigation of penalty, such as the fact that the man was of previous good character, has a family, and had performed his duties as bourgmestre in an efficient matter, all those matters are only exceptional; they cannot carry any significant weight at all in fixing the final sentence.  So that is the Prosecution position on appeal.  

The sentence of 30 years' imprisonment imposed upon the Appellant Gacumbitsi is manifestly far too low.  It does not reflect the two paramount considerations on sentence, namely, the gravity of the crimes and the offender's role in the commission of those crimes.  

As I have just said, there are no significant mitigating circumstances in this man's favour which can counter-balance in any way the gravity of the crimes which he has committed.  

Now, if the Court pleases, one striking aspect of the Trial Chamber's judgment regarding sentences is that in the discussion concerning sentence, there was essentially no meaningful analysis by the Chamber of culpable decisions of this Chamber, or the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia for the sentences of these crimes.  There was some -- I hesitate to use the word "review", but there was some listing of a number of cases, ranging from persons who were secondary offenders, such as Ruggiu, who received a 12-year sentence, up to a brief list of others who had committed the crimes of genocide and have received life imprisonment.  

The reasons of the Trial Chamber regarding sentence are, with respect, quite unsatisfactory and quite inadequate.  There is no meaningful explanation advanced by the Chamber as to how it fixed this term of 30 years imprisonment. 

With regard to the gravity of the crimes, it is the Appellant's position that the crimes committed by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi are amongst the most serious which have come before this Chamber.  On the evidence which was accepted by the Trial Chamber, and that is the evidence upon which the man must be sentenced, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi who had been bourgmestre for some 11 years prior to 1994, in early April 1994, used his official position to convene a meeting of his subordinate conseillers, he used that meeting to instruct them to again begin, in effect, a campaign of violence directed against the defenceless Tutsi minority within his commune.  

The Appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, further used his position to actively involve himself in the distribution of weapons.  He used his position, the authority which stems from the position as bourgmestre in Rwanda, to incite the Hutu population to commit acts of violence against the Tutsi.  He used his official position to instruct a person called André to prevent refugees crossing into Tanzania.  

Possibly the most egregious example of this man's great criminalities is:  Over a three-day period, he was instrumental in the mass killing of a very large number of defenceless and helpless Tutsi refugees.  The Trial Chamber made no precise finding or even any approximate finding as to the number of deaths which are on this man's hands, but it is the case that there is reliable evidence from a number of Prosecution witnesses, who were accepted, that there were thousands of refugees at the parish in the middle of April.  One estimate had them as possibly 20,000 or more.  There is also the evidence that no significant violence occurred to the refugees at the parish until Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrived and gave, in effect, the order or the instruction for the killing to commence.  

Sylvestre Gacumbitsi did not walk away from that killing.  He revisited that massacre site on each of the following two days.  And it would seem on the evidence that his only purpose -- his sole purpose was to ensure that the maximum number of Tutsi refugees were killed, that there were to be no survivors.  This evidence demonstrates beyond any doubt that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was involved in the commission of mass violence towards the Tutsi minority from early April onwards; that his involvement was not momentary, it was not hesitant; that his involvement was that of a committed genocidaire, a person who was wholeheartedly divided towards trying to kill as many Tutsi as possible.  
We further have the evidence that in mid-April, and this pertains particularly to the crime of rape as a crime against humanity, that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi committed this attack as part of this attack on the Tutsi minority, he committed a particular sadistic zeal.  The Court will be familiar with the evidence principally coming from the Witness TAQ, pertaining to the crime of rape, that the Appellant Gacumbitsi used his authority as bourgmestre to instigate rape and to incite rape.  Moreover, that the particular mind with which the rapes were to be committed were, without question, horrific.  This, the Prosecution says, shows a particular savage dimension to the man's criminality.  

On the evidence which this Chamber should accept and which the Trial Chamber did accept, 
Sylvestre Gacumbitsi played, really, an instrumental role in the attack upon the Tutsi refugees within Rusumo commune, a role which was only possible because of his official position, a role which was enhanced by the powers he was able to use or the position of authority he had conferred upon him as bourgmestre.  

Now, it is established rule that the gravity of the crimes and the offender's role to the most important considerations, if not the two most important considerations, is that it's important to take into account:  Here on the evidence, the crimes of mass grave, the offender's role was at the highest level in the commission of those particular crimes.  He was not an unwilling subordinate reluctantly following orders.  He is not a mere aider and abettor, a mere facilitator.  The Prosecution submits that those matters warrant and condone sentence.  

Furthermore, it is the case that when regard (unintelligible) practice of this Chamber for persons in a position of authority of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's or analogues of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's, committing the crimes of genocide and extermination, the appropriate sentence is life imprisonment.  The Chamber has had the benefit of a number of cases cited by the Prosecution in our Appellant's brief.  In addition, I should mention some more recent decisions of this Chamber.  

There is the decision of Kamuhanda from this Court.  Your Honours may recall that Mr. Kamuhanda was a minister in the government.  He was minister for higher education, but his role was quite close to that of Mr. Gacumbitsi.  He was a person who was important in a local area, a regional sort of politician.  He was convicted of genocide and extermination; his criminality was essentially limited to one massacre where some thousands of people were killed.  His role in that massacre was essentially this:  That he arrived there with some armed followers; he gave an order or an instruction to Hutu assailants to commence the attack; he then departed.  

Kamuhanda was a man of approximately the same age as Gacumbitsi; again, a man of previous good character; a man who'd been a solid public servant to the people of Rwanda prior to 1994; a man with a family -- the same mitigating circumstances pleaded in Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's cause.  Notwithstanding the fact that Kamuhanda's role was not as protracted as well as Gacumbitsi, this Court held that a life sentence was the appropriate sentence.  

If I may also refer the Court to the -- its decision in Kajelijeli.  Kajelijeli, like Gacumbitsi, was a bourgmestre.  He was a middle level official in the Rwandan regime.  Like Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, he was a man of previous good character before 1994 (unintelligible) useful service to the Rwandan state.  Kajelijeli was convicted after a trial of, again, genocide and extermination.  Again, he was involved in the planning, facilitation, aiding and abetting and instigation of the genocide.  He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment.  This Chamber was not -- only intervened to this limited extent:  It held that Kajelijeli had suffered some violations of his pre-trial rights; he'd been unlawfully detained for ten months, and so it was appropriate to compensate him for that, therefore, a term of life imprisonment was converted into a fixed sentence of 45 years, which is still 50 percent higher than that imposed upon Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

That mitigating feature, that special feature in Kajelijeli's case does not appear here.  There is no pre-trial violation of Gacumbitsi's right.  That being so, both Kamuhanda and Kajelijeli are compelling authority or position that a life sentence should be imposed upon Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

Furthermore, it might be said against the Prosecution that 30 years imprisonment is a heavy sentence, and it might also be said that there is no material distinction between 30 years and life imprisonment.  That cannot be correct.  If we look at Kajelijeli, there, the conversion was from life to 45 years to compensate him for his pre-trial violations.  Further, the Court held there was a material distinction between the 45 years' imprisonment and 30 years' imprisonment.  It is not the case that 30 years and life imprisonment are effectively analogous.  

If the Court pleases, if there is no intervention by this Court on the Prosecution appeal, if the Prosecution appeal is dismissed, if a life sentence is not imposed upon Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, then this Court is effectively saying that for persons who wielded considerable power in a regional setting, who are deeply involved in the planning, instigation, aiding and abetting, ordering and, to a limited degree, committing genocide and extermination, even with that particular aggravating sadistic zeal, which we say has been demonstrated in the case of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, this Court would be saying to the world that 30 years' imprisonment is a suitable sentence and that the range for these crimes stems as low as 30 years, even when there is no mitigating or special mitigating feature in an accused's waiver.  That, we submit, would simply throw culpable sentences into complete disarray.  

Your Honour, the Prosecution relies upon the matters contained in its written outline.  Those are my oral submissions, subject to any assistance I may give the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weston, what would you submit should be an appropriate sentence if the Bench did two things:  First, if the Bench upheld the argument that Mr. Gacumbitsi engaged no criminal responsibility for killing anybody; and if, two, the Bench rejected your argument that in any event such a holding would be cancelled out by a finding of responsibility on the ground of JCE?  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  That decision is this:  When the liability of the Appellant is examined, the Trial Chamber held that there were a number of different modes of liability which he had incurred.  There was planning, instigation, ordering, aiding and abetting, and committing.  Now, of course, the committing, as was evident from the interchange between the Bench and the Bar this morning, was currently (unintelligible) them to his involvement to the killing of the one man at the massacre site.  If that multiplied liability of committing would have been struck out, of course, the other modes would still stand. 

On the evidence the mode of liability of committing was relatively the least serious of the modes of liability.  As I just submitted, it was confined to the death of one man.  When I said that, I do not mean to diminish the impact or the gravity of the death of that individual, but I'm merely speaking in a relative term to the other crimes which the Appellant has been convicted.  When the other modes of liability are considered, as I was submitting a moment ago, this man was involved in the bringing about the deaths of probably thousands of individual innocent people, as well as the commission of some atrocious rapes on seven innocent victims.  As I also submitted, his involvement in doing that was instrumental.  

Our submission would be that if the Chamber did come to the conclusion that committing cannot be sustained as a matter of law, for whatever reason, that that would not affect the sentence.  

And, again, if I may refer to the culpable case of Kamuhanda, he was not a committer, as such, but was an orderer, instigator.  I probably said "orderer", I don't think that's a correct English word, but he was guilty of ordering and instigating.  Again, for genocide and extermination, but on the facts, his involvement was less protracted than Gacumbitsi.  A life sentence was held to be the appropriate sentence there.  We say that this case is worse than Kamuhanda.  If the mode of liability of committing were to be struck out, it would not materially affect the sentence; life imprisonment is still the appropriate sentence.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weston.  
Mister -- Judge Meron has a question to ask you.
MR. WESTON:
Certainly, Your Honour.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Just to follow up on my learned President's question -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, sir.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Just to follow up on my learned President's question, I realised that the Prosecution almost plays down the motive for killing because this involved one person.  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes.  
JUDGE MERON: 
But in legal terms, as I pointed out this morning, the convictions for committing extermination and genocide to rest on this one (unintelligible).  Now, I don't want to -- let me just ask you this one question:  You are no doubt aware of our decision -- of the decision of Appeals Chamber in the case of Radislav Krstic.  In that case, you may recall that we reversed the conviction for committing genocide, but found Radislav Krstic liable for aiding and abetting.  The view of the Appeals Chamber in that case, was that this change in convictions required a certain reduction in the sentence.  Since you cited one case, I thought it would have been helpful to ask if you would have referred to those two.  Because we have -- please, don't understand, as Judge Shahabuddeen told you many times, from our questions that we lean in any particular way, but we are trying to be as well advised by the Bar, even by the parties as we possibly can.  So we ask these questions, not because they indicate what we feel about that -- 
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, of course.  
JUDGE MERON: 
-- but we want to be well informed.  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, of course, Your honour.  Yes.  

Well, each case, of course, turns on its own particular facts in the final instance.  Here, as I have submitted a moment ago, if that mode of liability was not proven, there are still a number of other modes of liability which remain on foot.  And my submission is that it is simply on the facts here, that whilst they murdered, committing genocide and extermination by killing the individual, this is serious a matter.  When compared to the totality of the criminality of the Accused, it would not affect the ultimate sentence that we say should be imposed, that is, life imprisonment.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Thank you.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, in General Kostic's case, as I recall it, there was evidence of some mitigating circumstances, including, for example, a statement I recall, that he was supposed to have made to the effect that one shouldn't touch a hair of some of the victims concerned.  Well, those factors, I believe, would have been taken into account as well.  
MR. WESTON: 
Your Honour, I must confess that it's been a while since I have seen that case and I can't -- and it's my fault, I must accept blame for that -- but I can't -- I can't give a meaningful analysis of the case than has already been mentioned.  But our submission, of course, here is that there were no significant mitigating factors, certainly no exceptional mitigating factors in this man's favour.  And at the risk of repeating myself, when balanced against the gravity of the crimes and when taken into account the sentencing pattern of this Tribunal, then life imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are through?  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, I am, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we would invite Defence counsel to make his response.

It's now seven minutes past three.  On the schedule, you are supposed to go from two hours, but if you can find a way of delivering your message to the Court before the expiry of that time, I'd like to welcome -- that effort would be very welcome.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
We are obliged to you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Our submission will be done by 
Madam Mbattang.  Now, if we can cut down on the time allotted to us, I would see if I could say just one more thing, Your Honour.  
MS. NGATIO MBATTANG: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours of the Appeals Chamber.  

Mr. President and Your Honours, I could have directly addressed the issues raised by the Prosecutor, but I felt right from the morning today -- or I was made to understand that all the concerns raised by the Prosecutor focussed on increasing the sentence of Mr. Gacumbitsi, and that's why I would plead with you, despite the urgency of time, I would plead with you to take you back slightly to what occurred in Rwanda, just to point out, Mr. President, Your Honours, just to point out that Mr. Gacumbitsi is not the person they would want you to believe that he is.  So, Mr. President, Your Honours, I will slightly sum up what happened in Rwanda. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi's Defence, as I told you earlier, will slightly dwell on the circumstances of the tragedy that befell Rwanda.  If I may, I would like to draw the attention of your Chamber to the fact that after the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994, Rwanda was caught in the throes of some formidable violence.  And that's why right from the 
7th of April, killings occurred more or less everywhere in the country, and particularly in the north.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, right from the 7th of April, as I stated earlier, following the death of President Habyarimana, killings started, more or less, all over the country.  We will attempt to prove, Mr. President, that the entire country was riddled with unrest.  The same situation did not occur in Rusumo commune.  It was only as from a certain period; in other words, as from the 10th of April 1994, that there were some killings in the commune under the jurisdiction of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, if Mr. Gacumbitsi was a person who sought to kill all the Tutsis, he wouldn't have waited for the 13th, because the Prosecutor told you this morning that it was as from the 13th of April 1994, that Mr. Gacumbitsi started to execute Tutsis.  I was, therefore, saying, 
Mr. President, just to point out to you when the killing started in Rusumo commune, well, I did say that it started on the 10th of April.  And it is established, it is proven, Mr. President, Your Honours, that as from the 7th, for instance, in the northern part of the country, killings had started.  And, Mr. President, it was only towards the 12th that some other killings occurred in the Rusumo commune.  

I would even tell you subsequently that whenever such killings occurred, Mr. Gacumbitsi intervened and did what had to be done.  Mr. President, now, in the afternoon of the 12th of April 1994, where Mr. Gacumbitsi had ordered the arrest of some Hutus who had killed Tutsis in the night of the 10th to the 11th, and the 11th to the 12, just to put them in the jail, as a bourgmestre, he was threatened by some extremists from the Rukira commune.  And when he was threatened -- when they went to threaten the sous-préfet because Gacumbitsi was described as an accomplice of the Tutsi, well, this sous-préfet subsequently had to release the offenders.  

You will be told that he participated in the killings on the 13th, that he engaged in excitement on 
the 14th.  We did tell you, Mr. President, in our briefs that when he was threatened, he went into hiding, and as from the 13th he was not seen again.  And we are therefore saying, Mr. President, that Mr. Gacumbitsi is not the person being described by our friends on the other side.  And it is my view, Mr. President, that what we are going to say to you will demonstrate that Prosecution did not provide evidence for you, as it were, to increase the penalty that you've handed down on Mr. Gacumbitsi and to prevent him from returning to meet members of his family.  

I was therefore saying, Mr. President, that we have detailed all these facts before the Trial Chamber.  We have provided evidence to demonstrate the innocence of Mr. Gacumbitsi.  In spite of that, there was a judgment that was delivered on the 17th of June 2004, sentencing Mr. Gacumbitsi to 30 years' imprisonment for genocide, rape, and extermination. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, both parties appealed against that judgment.  My lead counsel has had occasion to explain to you -- Mr. President, I was saying that my lead counsel has amply explained to you the errors committed by the Trial Chamber.  And if this is correct -- these are corrected, Mr. Gacumbitsi can go back to his family.  

The Prosecutor also lodged an appeal and it raised six grounds.  The Prosecutor raised six grounds in his appeal.  

Mr. President, I was saying, the Prosecutor set out six grounds comprising errors in law, errors in fact, and my lead, Kouengoua, will attempt to explain to you the evidence which will enable you to disallow whatever the Prosecutor has said.  That would be on the sentence.  And I, Mr. President, I will be dealing with murder, rape, the joint criminal enterprise, and the application of Articles 6(1) and 6(3).  

So let me start with -- let me start -- Mr. President, Your Honours, let me start with the second ground on which the Prosecutor lodged an appeal.  

In this regard, the Prosecutor claims that the Trial Chamber committed an error of law by failing to find Mr. Gacumbitsi, the Respondent, guilty of the murder of Marie and Beatrice.  In Paragraph 59 of his Appellant's brief, he states that Trial Chamber III committed two errors by concluding that there was no evidence susceptible to corroborate the statements of Prosecution witnesses -- Witness TAS, and by failing to take into account a second piece of information which is the basis of the criminal responsibility, namely, that the Respondent allegedly aided and abetted the commission of the murder of Marie and Beatrice.  Before we respond to the submissions of the Prosecution, the Defence believes that a knowledge of the circumstances of the fact would be a useful point. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber, in April 1994, Marie was a Tutsi, was a tenant of the Respondent in one of his buildings situated at the Nyakarambi market.  She was not the only Tutsi; several other Tutsis lived there in that building, amongst whom were witness -- Prosecution witnesses -- Witness TBC.  History will teach us that before the events of 1994 -- April 1994, there was some misunderstanding between the two races or tribes, and that close relationships between a Tutsi and a Hutu was not very well considered.  And the Accused, Mr. Gacumbitsi, was the only one to be blamed for the fact that he was a Hutu and he should not be housing Tutsis in his building.  These facts were reported to the Trial Chamber by Witness TBC, as can be seen in the transcripts of the 
5th August 2003, paragraphs 1 to 7 on page 70.  

So I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, despite these blames heaped upon the Accused, he continued to house Tutsis in his building:  Marie, TBC, and other Tutsis, especially those who had fled troubles in their own areas and had sought refuge in Rusumo.  

As I had said earlier, Your Honours, the Tutsi (sic) extremists did not think kindly of the fact that this Accused person here present should provide housing for Tutsis.  This is why, Mr. President, 
Your Honours, that in the morning of 13th April 1994, the Accused received a message, a threatening message from the head of the Interahamwe in Rukira commune.  And what did the message contain?  In the message, he was being told that if he does not send away Marie and all the Tutsis who were living in his building, that evening those Tutsis would be killed and his house -- his building would be destroyed.  

In a panic, the Accused went to his tenants to inform them of that threatening message he had just received and to ask the same Tutsis to go and seek safety, either by leaving the country or by finding another shelter where they would not be easily found.  So those are the circumstances, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber.  

Therefore, it is not the version given to you by the other side, knowing that when the Accused sent away the Tutsi tenants from his building it was because he was trying to prevent them from being killed.  As I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, when he went to inform his tenants about what may happen to them, TBC fled.  He immediately left in order to find refuge elsewhere.  Marie also left in order to join her sister who was living not far away from there.  Mr. President, Your Honours, it is during that same night that she and her sister were killed.  The Prosecution was aware of what was happening because there was a factual witness who came before the Chamber to testify, and this is YEW, 
Witness YEW, a Defence witness.  

YEW stated before the Trial Chamber that these two Tutsi women were killed by two bandits.  This was one Kirenga and another Kigaki.  

Let me go a little bit back because I made a mistake on the pseudonym of the witness.  It was 
Witness UPT during the hearing of 16th October 2000, and it's at paragraph 182.  
Now, if the trial Judges had before them an eyewitness, would they have sought elsewhere for other reasons to justify the fact that it was the Accused who killed Marie and Beatrice because of their ethnicity, because they were Tutsis?  Let me explain to you, Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Gacumbitsi, who physically looks like a Tutsi, would not have been able to kill these women.  And if he did want to do so, if he was the one who had incited Tutsis to be killed, Mr. President, Your Honours, do you think that knowing that Tutsis were living in his building, would he have waited for the 12th, for the 13th, whereas killings had already began on the 7th?  

Mr. President, I believe that if we are to look for a reasoning, a humanitarian or legal reason, one cannot state, Mr. President, Your Honours, that Mr. Gacumbitsi was the perpetrator, is responsible for the double murder of these women.  And it is rightly so that the Trial Chamber found that the 
Accused Gacumbitsi was not guilty of that murder.  This is furthermore true because the Prosecutor was aware that its submissions were no longer holding water; it had recourse to the provisions of Article 6(1) of the Statute by alleging that the Respondent aided and abetted the murder of Marie and Beatrice, and this is something that could not have been done, given the submissions made above.  The Prosecution does not prove that the conditions to find someone guilty or responsible for such a murder has been found.  

A superior must have de jure or de facto authority to prevent the subordinate from committing a crime or enable the superior to punish the offender after their commission of the crime.  Has the Prosecutor in the case been able to demonstrate that the bandits here were subordinates of the Respondent?  If so, how could they be?  The role of the bourgmestre is to ensure the protection of the people living within his administration.  The Prosecutor has also failed to adduce evidence that the Respondent had the material ability to prevent the commission of the crime or to punish the principal perpetrators of the crime.  Similarly, the Chamber must be convinced of the effective control over his subordinates at the time of the events.  

The Prosecutor, in paragraph 106 of the Appellant's brief, alleges that the Respondent exercised considerable power, authority and influence in the commune to such an extent that the Tribunal should find the Accused responsible for the murder of Marie and Beatrice.  As I was saying a moment ago, he could not do this.  He did not know -- I believe that at the time when he was telling them to leave his building, he could have asked them to refrain from staying in the town.  Mr. President, on this point, I would wish to say that the Prosecution submission do not hold water, and you should therefore dismiss the submissions of the Prosecution because they are not founded.  
Let me move to the third ground of the appeals, dealing with other rapes committed in 
Rusumo commune.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not know whether I should take too much more of your time on this particular ground.  We have all today seen in this Chamber the difficulty the Prosecution had in order to sustain his own allegations.  For me not to waste your time unnecessarily, I will not go into the matter of TAQ.  I think principal counsel -- lead counsel already spoke at length on that, but I would like to speak on TAP, TAO and TAS.  And this is what you are being asked by the Prosecution:  To take into account the fact that the rapes took place during a widespread or systematic attack.  But we are all jurists, we are all lawyers, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber.  We all know that the Prosecution must provide evidence, the legal and factual evidence which proves that for each case, each crime for which the Accused is charged, must be proven.  

And now, what is the other side saying, apart from TAP -- TAQ's rape?  First, you are told that this was in a widespread and systematic attack.  Even if that had been the case, had there been one rape before -- after the incitement, that would be considered within the responsibility of the Accused because it happened within the framework of a widespread attack.  

Now, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not believe that this crime should be considered in that view.  I am saying, Mr. President, that your honourable Chamber, you and your colleagues have your own principles.  Incitement to rape can only be constituted if the person accused of the incitement did the incitement at a given point, and following that incitement, a rape was committed.  And I would say, 
Mr. President, there is established jurisprudence before this Chamber, and let me take the case of Laurent Semanza.  Because in that case -- in the case of Laurent Semanza, what exactly happened?  

Mr. Semanza held a meeting, and during that meeting, he incited Hutus to rape Tutsi women.  Immediately after that meeting, one of those who had attended the meeting went and found a Tutsi woman who was hiding in a room, and raped her.  So, Mr. President, this is to tell you that contrary to what has been submitted by the other side this morning, it requires a need -- a link between the incitement and the commission of the rape.  In this instance, each case of rape should be treated separately and discreetly.  This is not the same as in the Semanza case.  It had been alleged that another woman had been raped and the person who had done the rape was doing what had followed the incitement by Mr. Laurent Semanza.  But in this case, Mr. President, you were maliciously made to believe that all cases of rape took place in Nyarubuye secteur.  I am saying, Mr. President, 
Your Honours, that TAS never lived in Nyarubuye secteur.  Furthermore, when we know what happened to TAS, I think that TAS was from Kigina secteur.  

And TAS said -- in his statements of the 5th August 2003, TAS said she was raped on the 
14th of April 1994, by the brother or cousin of the Accused.  Mr. President, the Prosecution said from the other side that the rapist used the same language as the Accused here present used in Nyarubuye on the 17th April 1994.  I'm saying that if we were to base ourselves on words which are used, these words were used everywhere in Rwanda.  So, therefore, all those who were arrested and prosecuted should be sentenced for rape -- convicted for rape.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm saying that the allegations made against the Accused here present took place on the 17th, and it would be impossible that this incitement which encouraged the -- those who raped TAS on the 14th of April 1994, would have been impossible because that was three days earlier.  I do believe that I would encourage you to apply the principles which should be applied to the rape of TAS.  It would seem that this lady, who was raped by the conseiller of the secteur of Nyarubuye, we do not know on what date, but before she was raped, apparently the Accused had incited people to rape.  

The same is for TAP.  I must say that she did live in Nyarubuye secteur, but we do not know on what date she was raped.  It's not clear.  As required by jurisprudence, which you apply all the time, this is not followed in the two cases; in other words, the link between the incitement and the rape of TAS, TAO, and the mother of TAP.  And I'm saying that the Prosecutor is being very malicious because the Prosecutor has not given a date, and this is purposely -- purposely done.  Because in other statements, all precise information is provided, including dates.  So I'm saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, that if we are applying principles regarding incitement and rape, as in the Semanza case, you will not be able to grant the request being made by the Prosecution.  

If there has not been any incitement, I do not wish to go as far as saying that the Prosecutor needs to prove that incitement substantially concurred with the perpetration of the rapes that are imputed to the perpetrators of the rape.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the time that has been allotted to me is going so fast that I need to look into my brief which -- our Appellant's -- our Respondent's brief, and I will send you to paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

1545H
MS. NGATIO MBATTANG:  
This morning the Prosecutor found itself on shaky ground and they then went to discuss joint criminal enterprise, but I think we will come to this under ground five of the appeal and the same will apply, Mr. President, Your Honours, to the Accused's responsibility as a superior, Mr. President, Your Honours.  So, we will conclude with these grounds to say that the Prosecution has failed to adduce evidence that the Accused is responsible for the rapes of TAS, TAP and TAO and, therefore, I pray that this commission be dismissed for failure of any grounds.  

With regard to the fourth ground of appeal, I shall not go back over that, as we are not prejudiced by it.  We believe the Prosecution did that in the instance of justice to shed light on the issue, namely, if we should take into account the victim's consent or lack of consent.  

Let me now move onto the fifth ground of appeal.  In the fifth ground -- in the fifth ground of appeal the Prosecution criticises the Trial Chamber for refusing to allow them to rely on joint criminal enterprise as a basis for the individual criminal responsibility of the Accused person.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, in our respondent's brief we made submissions regarding everything we thought about that ground of appeal.  We had discussions this morning.  They were right in line with our brief, which you certainly have before you.  We said, and the Prosecution this morning acknowledged as much, that their indictment was vague, unspecific; they even went further then that to say that they did not take into account certain matters because the indictment is defective.  What can we do with a defective indictment, is it null?  No argument, therefore, as this is null and void, can be drawn from it and certainly cannot be a basis of conviction of the accused person.  This is simply a matter of procedure.  

Earlier, and I've just repeated it, the Prosecution felt that their indictment was faulty.  And what did they say?  Yes, even if the indictment is defective, and, therefore, null and void, we can use other materials that came in afterwards; namely witness statements, for example; pre-trial briefs; and opening statements.  

What does the opening statement explain?  What are the witnesses going to explain?  In those circumstances, Mr. President, Your Honours, we made substantive arguments against that ground, and I was going to refer you to our previous submissions.  But I should like to draw your attention to the fact that if, after a defective indictment becomes null and void, we can then fall back onto other materials?  I believe such an approach would amount to serious violations of legal standards and norms.  This is the law that, first and foremost, must be applied.  What does the law tell us?  It sets out the conditions that are required to make an indictment valid.  This is in Article 17 of the statute and Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  No one is authorised to amend the law as regards those letters.  As such, Mr. President, Your Honours, we believe that you cannot grant the Prosecution's request.  They seem to have asked you to apply principles and jurisprudence which arose later, after they failed in their approach to attempt to correct the indictment with other materials during trial.  You were given a response this morning, knowing that this could not be applied in this case.  And a decision was made prior to the decision that they wanted to base their arguments on.  As such, we submit that the Chamber, at trial, correctly applied the law.  I'm referring to paragraphs 169, 284, and 314 of the Trial Chamber judgement.  Looking at that, the Prosecution's request should be denied, taking into account my submissions in our brief.  Let me now move on, Mr. President, to ground number 6 of the Prosecution's appeal.  

On this ground the Defence submits that the Trial Chamber in the impugned judgement at paragraphs 169, 284 and 314, as I mentioned before, gave a relative analysis of the individual criminal responsibility by applying provisions of Article 6 of the Tribunal Statute.  I don't want to move backwards, Mr. President, but, in fact -- and, in fact, in this sixth ground, what does the Prosecution tell us?  He repeated this morning that it is sufficient to make statements in a given environment and if you are a superior or someone who has influence over the population or authority over them, everything and everyone in that context are your subordinates.  This was the Prosecution's argument, but is it a reasonable one?  Mr. President, it cannot be a de facto superior, but you must be superior, the jury, rather.  The law does not provide conditions to be a superior of someone.  If that is not provided for, how can you imagine, in a given group and a given environment, that all of the people there fall under the person who has influence over them or authority over them?  If we were ready to admit, to allow such an assertion it would be wrong.  A superior has to have control over their subordinates.  I say the subordinates must report back to them and tell them everything they do; then the superior can take measures to punish those who commit infractions or offences.  If we put ourselves in the context spelled out by the Prosecution, would it be reasonable?  And let me take the case of the Accused person here before us.  Everyone acknowledges, we were told, when there were incidents in his commune there were refugees from other communes.  Did he control them?  Did he ever see them?  And the trial showed that they were the ones who committed the crimes.  Should this be attributed to the Accused?  People arrived, people incited, were given orders; everyone there, were they the subordinates of the influential person in the commune or in the préfecture?  One moment's indulgence, please.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, let me repeat what the Prosecution said, to demonstrate how this is impossible.  They, themselves, acknowledge this.  The Accused arrived in the certain secteurs.  He made some statements.  On the basis of what he said, people committed crimes.  They call that incitement.  Your Honours, just because you are a superior or because you have authority over some people, you say something in a certain context, everything said and everyone there are your subordinates.  That's incorrect, in Gahina or elsewhere.  The Accused here spoke to the people living in those cellules and secteurs and the Prosecution calls that incitement.  Your Honours, subordinate relationship has not been established.  Just because you are a bourgmestre or minister or préfet in a country or given place, on the basis of that, Mr. President, the Prosecution's arguments do not hold water.  For that reason, please refer to our previous submissions in writing.  The appellant has failed to adduce the necessary evidence that the Accused was a superior of the Interahamwe, who weren't even in his commune; of the gendarmes, who were not assigned to his commune; of the préfets, who were not in his commune; and other civilians who were Hutus.  Otherwise, the préfets, the bourgmestres, the ministers, would have to follow every single citizen in their areas.  That reasoning doesn't hold water, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that the Prosecution has failed to adduce the necessary evidence which would allow you to uphold the conviction of the Accused or to confirm the decision that was taken.  For that reason, Mr. President, we request that you deny the motion by the Prosecution in its entirety.  We ask you to closely read all of the submissions in writing given to you by the Prosecution and by our side.  

I had some submissions in closing, but as lead counsel wants to deal with the first ground of appeal, with your leave, I would ask him to address that, now, and come back with a closing address.  Since lead counsel would now like to deal with the first ground of appeal, I have nothing more to add.
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  Very quickly, following Counsel Mbattang, I want to come back to the first ground of the appeal broached by the Prosecutor.  I am responding to that lastly.  I was adequately edified, Mr. President, you see, I was telling you yesterday -- I repeated it this morning -- but I was not understood.  Your jurisprudence is what you're building and what you're constructing.  That's why you are here spending holidays listening to us, and when we bring an accused to you, you are being told that your jurisprudence is what you need to apply, Mr. President, Your Honours.  That is not what you are here for.  And when you are being asked to do what we did not do, we end up being in the wrong.  And since this is the rule, as the Prosecutor has said, I propose that I follow the rule and I take the violation, the judgement -- because to acquit Bagilishema -- the Trial Chamber said that the bourgmestre, the bourgmestre, préfet was accused for having failed having stopped or prevent the massacres, the killings.  Did he have the powers?  Now, Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi, did he have the means with which to prevent the killings?  

Mr. President, up to the 13th of April he was the powerful leader of the commune, and this is because he began by arresting Hutus and the wrongdoers who had threatened him with death.  If Gacumbitsi had not arrested those people, maybe he would never have been threatened.  And when death -- even when he started to arrest the wrong doers and putting them in jail, he began to be afraid and he began to hide.  This happens to anybody, presidents, lawyers, préfets, because physically we are only human beings.  I may have said, like the religious say, the clergy say, that we are all returned to dust.  Gacumbitsi is, apparently, being accused by the Prosecutors for having killed, because if Witness TBC, which was his close friend *****************, and he's the one who said this, if (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed, under seal) had taken time and was safe, it is because when Gacumbitsi received threats from Tesa (phonetic), an extremist, of the Birhinga Interahamwe who came to say that he was going to come to kill all the Tutsis for helping and then he will come back and kill him.  He went to tell his friend.  People said he had let them go without them knowing.  But put yourself in his place, his driver, his tenant, spent their first night in the house of Gacumbitsi's first sister, eldest sister.  How can he ask TBC, his friend, and his driver, and other tenant, to go and flee and seek refuge in his *****************************.  That lady came here and she said as much.  The same was admitted by TBC.  But I'm being told no, he committed savage crimes in other sites.  And in the final analysis, the Prosecutor, in all fairness, quoted the Kamuhanda jurisprudence, said there were errors made but they said that they were the same age, that Gacumbitsi was born in 1943, Kamuhanda was born in 1953, a difference of 10 years Your Honours.  I even heard somewhere it said that Gacumbitsi started to run.  I hope, Mr. President, that when you give him an opportunity to speak, he will be able to tell you.  I don't know what his athletic qualities are, but as far as I know, his lead counsel have never been informed of his athleticism.  This is a man who saved his people.  This is a man who stopped the killings, the massacres, of people who were threatening him with death, because there is something which is referred to as the omission of providing assistance.  Now, he did not omit to provide assistance and it is said in (unintelligible) that you cannot be prosecuted because your own life was not in danger.  Gacumbitsi started from the 7th to the 13th.  From the 13th it was not only the population, he himself was afraid and he began to hide.  Apart from Nyarubuye site, and this is where I understand the Prosecutor, if there is no Nyarubuye, there is nothing else which will remain standing.  

Savage crimes, and I say this is the only trial I have in Rwanda.  The Prosecutor has many sites in Nyarubuye.  Now, many people fled to Nyarubuye because it was one of the last communes where there was still peace and where there was still safety and security and this was thanks to the courage of the Accused.  Although it was limited, Gacumbitsi had that courage.  Maybe in Nyarubuye people were killed, but I'm telling you that Gacumbitsi was not among the attackers.  And in the final analysis, what could this lone man do against the extremists?  What this single man could have done against the killers?  Can one organise, plan, participate in a joint criminal enterprise with his partners and then arrest them at the same time?  

This happened to the extent that there were refugees in Rwanda, even as far as Tanzania.  If these other sites mentioned by the Prosecutor were to be listed, we would never be speaking about this now.  
(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) said something extraordinary in cross-examination, "I would not lie about this, Gacumbitsi did not know how to handle weapons.  I would not lie about that."  And this was at the hearing of the 21st August 2001.  He will not lie, and that's what he said.  But I do say that he lied about other things, because he said that "My parents wanted me to become a civil servant and not a driver of a commune and Gacumbitsi did me wrong.  He didn't do anything good for me.  I left him a letter when I left, but he didn't respect what I asked him, so if Gacumbitsi was the criminal," the witness says, "I left a letter for his son, Marcel, to give to Gacumbitsi."  And this comes out in all the statements of this key witness of the Prosecution, who continually says -- even TAW mentioned a whole list of things, but when he was asked when he left Gacumbitsi in the market at 1300 hours, what driver was left with him, and he said that he went to look for a driver who didn't have a job and he didn't find any.  Where was Sebudandi, Philippe if he was, indeed, the commune driver at the time?  

Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi is not a criminal.  And I believe, not like the Prosecutor said, because he said, apart from -- if you don't increase his sentence, at least remain with the 30 years you've given him.  But I'm asking you something else, very humbly, because your jurisdiction enables you to determine with wisdom, with humanity, given the circumstances in the case, to determine the sentence which goes or corresponds with each situation, but the involvement of Gacumbitsi, had that been possible, had that been in existence from March to July 2003, up to 2004, January, when Trial Chamber rendered its judgement, then Gacumbitsi, because of the facts is given 30 years.  Today we are being asked that the sentence be increased and decisions in 2005 are being quoted.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, and this is where I will conclude, no other document can replace the indictment.  Article 50 says -- Rule 50 says, once it is confirmed, any amendment must be made through you.  Any amendment must be made through a judgement.  If you remove one letter, that power which is given to you, you will be ceding it to the Prosecutor and tomorrow you will hear that although the name of the Accused does not appear, there was disclosure three weeks after the conviction, and you will say that this was what is being done.  But you should not allow this to be done.  Before its confirmation, any amendment can be made, but once it is confirmed everything has to go through you.  And one cannot say, "Oh I amended this," or "I used the witness to say this," or "I had a pre-trial brief."  What is the intent of all this, in order to amend the indictment?  No, the law has stated the amendment, as to confirmation, had to go through you and no one else can do you in your stead.  And I am speaking to you.  I tried this in 2001, 10th of November 2001.  Just after I was committed, I tried to have the indictment amended, and I was told that I could not do so.  Although I went to the Chamber, the Prosecutor prevented me from doing that, but he himself preferred to have communication disclosure and use witnesses and not go through the correct proceedings.  

Now, if I refer to the expert witness produced by the Prosecutor, I insist that whether you are asking for the increase of the sentence, we are going to stick to the truth.  Alison Des Forges said that there were deaths at the Nyarubuye parish, but that there were less than 1,000.  But this doesn't mean much in terms of genocide.  The numbers don't really matter.  But when the Prosecutor, today, says two or three years later says that a thousand people were killed at the parish, I am saying that we do not need to go that way.  I don't know where this information is coming from.  At any rate, as far as I'm concerned, I don't know about this information.  I didn't receive disclosure.  And in regard to what I have followed, it is supposed the expert knows better than everybody else regarding the events that took place.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi, believes in international justice.  His Defence team, also, and we sincerely thank you on that note.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just one question, Mr. Kouengoua, you have made interesting submissions to the effect that Mr. Gacumbitsi has no criminal responsibility for committing genocide in relation to the death of Mr. Murefu and you have, likewise, made submissions to the effect that he has no criminal responsibility in respect of the death of Marie Beatrice.  Now, assuming that this Bench were to uphold your submissions, would anything remain of the conviction for genocide or will something remain, and if so, what?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, for your question, Mr. President.  The Defence never intended to request the Chamber to find that there was genocide or not.  That's not before us.  However, what we are saying, the fact Gacumbitsi did not kill anyone, even the people whose identity we don't know.  If we had simply said that Gacumbitsi decimated all of the population in Rusumo it would be up to the Prosecution to qualify that, but they gave you the names of 14 people.  Those 14 people were set aside by the Chamber.  But Murefu was mentioned -- but for Murefu, they said that he -- on three occasions they said he committed the murder personally.  It's up to the Prosecution to say why they did not put Murefu's name in the indictment.  How are you, Your Honours, going to know that if Murefu existed and he was a Tutsi.  If they don't give all of the details they should at least let us know the person, allegedly, killed was a member of the targeted group.  

Mr. President, what I am requesting, I'm telling you that Gacumbitsi was not there on the 15th, on the 16th, on the 17th, and certainly not on the 14th.  He was in hiding.  Given that, you have the authority to assess that.  We are requesting that you acquit Gacumbitsi.  The Prosecution has asked for a conviction.  We have the scales of justice.  It's up to you, Mr. President.  It is up to your Chamber to rule to make a finding.  The Prosecution and us simply give you the evidence.  We try to clarify our positions in a certain matter.  Beyond that, we have no other authority, Your Honour.  We have those limitations on our level.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kouengoua, do I gather, from what you have said, that the other grounds on this issue would invite this Bench to hold against the conviction for genocide, such as alibi, et cetera?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:  
Mr. President, besides the death of Murefu, as I've been saying yesterday, with regards to the crime of genocide, there was the rape -- case of rape, there was extermination, but still with regard to Murefu, again in Nyarubuye, the only witness who was raped, who testified, was TAQ and TAQ recognised the accused's driver.  Unfortunately, during the events, he was no longer working.  Perhaps she was mistaken, but the witness did not see the Accused.  She only saw the driver.  That's the big paradox here, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
One question, it's a very simple one, I hope it presents you with no problems of limiting your responses, are you making any submissions about whether it is possible to proceed on both Articles 6, paragraph 1 and Article 6 paragraph 3.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm already convinced I know this case.  As counsel for the Defence, at no time did I believe that he was present at -- during the commission of the crimes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's one other question from Judge Schomburg, please.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I only wanted to give you a possibility to respond, because that's what has been discussed this morning.  There is no doubt that a valid indictment is also the prerequisite for trial.  However, it's a submission of the Prosecutor that on 16 May 2003 the Prosecutor filed its pre-trial brief and attached to this there was a witness statement in which it was stated that the Accused killed Mr. Murefu, a Tutsi.  I don't want to go into details, this statement was distributed and it was linked to count 1 and count 2, that is genocide and complicity to genocide and to extermination.  May I ask you, is it correct that you received this pre-trial brief the 16th of May?  How did you react?  In particular, did you contact the witness from which you got the statement prior to the opening of the trial and what was -- if so, what was the result of your own investigation in relation to this allegation.  Thank you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

Your Honours, what the Prosecutor has told you is his version.  To answer your question, let me give you my version.  The Prosecutor is not a genie or a genius.  He can make a mistake.  He is quite human.  He can have an indictment drafted without having information which later comes to him and, therefore, can be used to beef up the indictment.  Let's take TAO and TAQ.  TAO was heard on the 15th May -- 15th of April 1998.  April 15, 1998, I repeat.  Four years to the day after the alleged acts and he never spoke of Murefu, unless what was disclosed to me was not true.  And he never spoke of Murefu.  Witness TAQ was heard on the 9th November 2000, one year before the indictment, but, Mr. President, Your Honours, so many years have passed, I know you get information, you want at what cost, but since he is a bourgmestre, like Akayesu he must also go to prison.  You amend the indictment, and you want to bring it here.  In the pre-trial brief, statements were given.  There must be proof that there was no other possibility to do better.  But if the trial began, and I apologise for the way I'm speaking, I am having to use these terms.  If this was started with all these difficulties, I assure you that there was a lot of concealment and I had difficulty in dealing with the Prosecution.  And when we were told that the diplomatic pouch arrived on Saturday and three or four months later this document was available, we say that there is something not right.  And when the indictment was drafted all this information was there, but I had never seen anything about it.  I had been cut off.  No rapes.  These are such acts which are so serious that one cannot forget them four, five, six years later on.  

Mr. President, let me take you back, but maybe this is not my role.  I shouldn't even do this, but in my situation imagine the Accused tells you he had forgotten, he would be lying.  If the Accused said, "Oh, Mr. President, I've forgotten," he would be lying.  But when it is Prosecution witnesses, we find all manner of artifice because one thing that is certain in this procedure the principle is the incarceration.  The principle of innocence is rather an exception because if that had been the case, with all the enormous powers that the United Nations have placed at the disposal of the Prosecutor, he had all the time.  Gacumbitsi was in a refugee camp.  He could not disappear.  He was picked like a flower and he said that he was taken from the camp quite simply and then he was brought here.  I think a criminal would have taken steps to hide himself.  A criminal would have taken precaution to plan.  He should have also looked at his possible flight, and he was not doing that.  We see the contrary.  Let us look at what elements we have, what information we have.  He did not flee and the people who, allegedly, in the documents that were sent, were available for years after the events, and he did not speak about Murefu.  This is how come the Prosecutor is being asked how are you going to speak about this person if you did not included him in the indictment?  I thank you for having given me the opportunity to speak.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then your colleague will now speak, will you?  Are you finished?  
MS. NGATIO MBATTANG: 
No, just a brief address, Mr. President.  I was saying, Mr. President, that you should bear in mind the important role you have.  In other words, to rule fairly, to give a just sentence.  You will acquit Gacumbitsi if the law and the materials enable you to do so.  Mr. President, Your Honours, we are putting together the necessary elements so that there is sustainable peace and no more killing and rapes.  If we are able to build, Mr. President, Your Honours, such a system, Mr. President, I believe is your role to have peace reign.  You will have built that, then history will then judge you favourably for that.  Thank you, very much Mr. President, Your Honours.  That's all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam.  Now by the Prosecution.

The majority of the Bench favours a break at this time.  It will be a short break, let us say 15 minutes.  At a quarter to five we should be back.
(Court recessed from 1630H to 1650H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, before we resume on the appeal by the Prosecution, we will revert, for a few minutes, to the appeal by Mr. Gacumbitsi, for want of a purpose of delivering our decision on the motion for additional evidence we have considered this matter carefully and we have reached a conclusion that the motion must be dismissed and we have -- we are in the course of filing a written decision to that effect.  The reasons will appear in that decision.  

Now then, we will return to the appeal by the Prosecution.
MR. WESTON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, the Prosecution has nothing in reply to the submissions just made by counsel for the Defence.  However, there is one consenting matter we wish to bring to the attention of the Appeals Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WESTON:
And, Mr. President, I ask that the Chamber now go into closed session, while I make this submission.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 80] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 71 to 79 by R. Lear) 







 

JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
My question is just this, is it correct what Defence counsel submitted, that Prosecution knew already four years before filing the indictment in the case before us and the witness was heard one year beforehand and the first question would be, why wasn't the name of Mr. Murefu included in paragraph 12 of the indictment and, second, do you know whether or not Defence contacted this witness?  So this could be seen as an expression of being informed in a timely fashion, but this is, of course, for the Chamber to decide.
MR. WESTON:
Of course, Your Honour, dealing with the first aspect of your question, drafting of paragraph 12 of the indictment, I regret that I'm unable to assist the Chamber as to why it was drafted in that manner.  I did not know the reason why it was drafted that way, and I cannot give any evidence from the Bar why it was drafted in this manner.  

The fact of the matter is, that we left with the submissions which the Prosecution already made regarding disclosure of material in the pre-trial brief.  That is as far as I can take the matter.  
(Page 81 by R. Lear)






















1700H 
MR. WESTON: 
With regard to whether there was any attempt by the representatives of Mr. Gacumbitsi to contact a particular witness, again, I have no information either to confirm that or dispute that.  I simply do not know.  I cannot take the matter any further, I'm afraid, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
But then the follow-up question is, why did you include in the list of witnesses -- also this witness testifying on this concrete (unintelligible), when it's -- yeah.  Apparently not related to the concrete indictment.  And why didn't you, with a view to this, amend the indictment?  
MR. WESTON: 
Well, again I cannot speak for the way in which the trial Prosecutor conducted his case, as to why it was thought it -- it was thought not necessary to seek to amend the indictment.  So I cannot take that matter any further.  

However, what we do have is the information regarding the event in question, the killing of Mr. Merefu, was disclosed, we submit, to the Defence in a suitably timely fashion.  There was no objection taken by the Defence to the admission to that evidence, and no objection taken by the Defence during the trial to the form of the indictment.  

Your Honour, my answers are probably not completely satisfactory, but regrettably that is as high as I can take the matter.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Thank you.  
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then we will invite Mr. Gacumbitsi to make a personal address, limited to ten minutes, as specified in the scheduling order.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Would you want grant me one minute?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Oh, yes, Judge Meron.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Just give me one minute.  

Yes, if I may, I would like to follow up on the question of my distinguish colleague, Judge Schomburg.  

You will notice -- may I remind you that Judge Schomburg focussed on the question whether -- why the indictment was not amended, or no attempt was made to amend the indictment on a matter of such importance.  

Now, the annex -- the annex, which lists the name as Mr. (unintelligible), was annexed to the preliminary pre-trial brief in support of the submission.  And this was supposed to cure the lack of the disclosure in the original indictment.  

Now, what is not clear to me is, given the major importance of naming the names here, how to explain that this was included in the annex, and there was no mention to that in the brief itself?  If you want to direct the attention of the Accused to something, do you just mention it in an annex?  Why don't you mention it in the brief?  Then the onus would have been much greater on the Accused to respond to that.  

I realise you were not involved in writing those documents, but unfortunately you are the only addressee to whom we can turn with our questions.  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  That -- I appreciate what Your Honour has just said.  

The -- at the risk of repetition, the Prosecution can place it no higher than this:  That, whilst it was unfortunate and -- that those details were not pleaded in paragraph 12 of the indictment, we -- our position is maintained that there was sufficient disclosure of this material, in the form of the witness statements, which show that there was evidence given of the time and place of the killing of Mr. Merefu.  That material was disclosed to the Defence prior to the trial on -- given the very concise nature of the Prosecution case regarding the events at the parish, it would have been apparent to Defence counsel, if I may say so, that the evidence was going to be relied upon by the Prosecution.  

Now, if there was going to be any prejudice suffered by the Defence in the preparation of its defence, or if there was any suggestion that the Prosecution case was not being pleaded in an unambiguous manner, there would have been ample time for the Defence to have taken various points of law.  They could have either asked for an adjournment to fully investigate the matter, if they thought it was necessary.  They could have objected to the reception of the evidence because it was not properly pleaded in the indictment.  Those matters were not done.  The evidence was led without objection.  We submit that, that being so, and given the particular facts of this case, there can be no resulting prejudice to the Accused.  

Your Honour, that is probably, to some degree, a repetition of statements which have been made by this end of the bar table earlier today.  However, that is as far as the Prosecution can take the matter.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. WESTON: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MERON: 
I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then, Mr. Gacumbitsi, you may now make your address.  
MR. GACUMBITSI:
Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you for allowing me to address the Court.  If I take a couple of minutes more, I would apologise to you.  

The Rusumo commune, right up to 1994, was a haven of peace.  On the 8th of April 1994 my colleagues, the other bourgmestre and myself, attended a meeting of the security committee for the préfecture.  That meeting was chaired by the préfet of Kibungo; his name is Godfroid Ruzindana.  The agenda was to map out strategies to ensure that there is peace and security throughout the préfecture following the death of the president.  

The recommendations made after the meeting had to be conveyed to the population of the commune promptly.  That's what I did on the 9th of April.  And I brought together the conseiller de secteur for the commune.  And let me inform you that diverse political parties were represented at that communal meeting.  Now, at that meeting I did insist that, in their respective secteurs, there not be any unrest; that they had to ensure that there is security.  

Now, the recommendations of that meeting -- that is at the préfectural level -- were broadcast over the national radio station.  A tape that was disclosed to us, together with my diary, wherein those recommendations were entered, were disclosed to us as exhibits by the Prosecutor.  

I wish to insist, Mr. President, Your Honours, that the Rusumo commune never had any Interahamwe militiamen, and no distribution of weapons occurred there.  In fact, this was denied by witnesses for the Defence and those for the Prosecution, including TBH.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I fought the criminals on the 10th, the 11th, the 12th, and the 13th of April.  I went to assist people in a secteur (sic) called Nyamugali, (unintelligible), Gatore, and Kigarama where there was unrest.  Their houses were burnt; some people were injured, and some others were killed.  I was able to arrest and jail those criminals.  I held security meetings to condemn criminals, wherever they came from.  And even those who attended the meeting condemned those criminals, because they had brought shame on the secteur, in particular, and on the commune in general.  I was able to recover the properties that were looted from the Gatore centre, and they were restored to their owners.  This was evidence before Trial Chamber III, together with the exhibits in support.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, after doing all of these, I was threatened with death by the criminals that I imprisoned.  The sous-préfet of Kirehe released them after being threatened by their acolytes, who had conspired against me and threatened to destroy any- and everything if they were not released.  Since this Kibungo central prison yard was not working anymore, the sous-préfet told me they had been released in the hope that he would pick them up when peace was restored.  

Now, these criminals threatened me with death and blamed me for jailing the Hutus in order to protect the Tutsis.  They said the Sous-Préfet Habyarimana and the Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi -- myself -- were accomplices of the RPF.  They blamed me for accommodating the Tutsi in myself at the Nyakarambi centre, and that, by the way, I looked like a Tutsi.  They openly stated that, at the first opportunity, I would be physically eliminated.  I also was threatened with death by a certain Cyasa, an extremist, a leader of an Interahamwe group based at the Birenga commune.  He sent someone from the Interahamwe to come and warn me.  At the Nyakarambi centre they said that Gacumbitsi was accommodating Tutsis in his house, and he had to explain how his house had become the CND.  That surprised me.  

I felt pain that my judgment 17 June 2004, Trial Chamber III, did not take into account my diary wherein I had entered what I did right up to 13th of April, combatting the criminals and protecting the Tutsis.  That diary was found in the refugee camp after my own expected arrest and detention by the Prosecutor.  I arrested criminals in a manner known, and even seen, by each and everyone.  These are matters that are verifiable.  Eyewitnesses confirmed before this Court that as bourgmestre -- and I even said this in my diary -- I had nothing to blame myself for, and I had nothing to (unintelligible).  

After all this stress, well, I said to myself, prevention is better than cure.  And I went, and I alerted my -- the people who were renting my house, including Marie and other Tutsis, of the Rukira and Birenga commune, who were seeking refugees -- refuge there.  And I asked them to leave.  I told them that I was threatened, and I did not want to see them being mistreated, or put to death there.  One of those *********************************** TBC, a Prosecution witness, confirmed this before Trial Chamber III.  Everybody left, sought refuge in Tanzania.  

And the next day I learnt that Marie went and joined her younger sister, Beatrice, in some other house rather than the one she was renting at the centre.  Defence witnesses testified here as to the manner in which those women were killed.  Let me insist, Beatrice was never someone staying in my house.  

Those who sought refuge in Tanzania went back to Rwanda, and they are still alive.  TAW also told me that he was afraid, and that he wanted to run away.  And I told him not to hesitate because the situation was becoming increasingly unbearable.  He left with his wife and children.  ***************** and his family.  They spent the night at my elder sister's house.  My elder sister lived at Ngara in Tanzania.  

Fear is a human feeling.  Mr. President, Your Honours, as I stated, these criminals who wanted to kill me were like mad people.  People of their ilk could kill me.  They were unscrupulous people.  As I told my boss at the time, as from the evening of the 10th of April, I started -- I went into hiding for fear of being killed.  I was of no significance to those criminals.  And let me add that anyone who felt afraid, or worried, could go across Kagera river and seek refuge in Tanzania without a hitch.  And among them there are those who came here to confirm what I'm saying before the Court.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I am not a killer.  I did not kill anyone.  I have never incited anyone to practice evil on his neighbour.  If there were planning, as it is claimed, to kill the Tutsis, I wouldn't have arrested and jailed extremist Hutus who burnt houses, injured and killed people.  If I had intended to kill the Tutsis, I would have started with my driver, who was always with me, right up to the afternoon of the 13th of April.  Or, I could have killed him right from the 7th of April, since I knew every Tutsi in my commune, as well as where they lived.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor blames me for the fact that during the meeting of the conseiller de secteur on the 9th of April 1994 I incited them, so that they go and hold meetings, grouping only Hutus to kill their brothers and sisters, the Tutsis.  This is absolutely impossible.  I insist, it is indeed impossible.  Holding a meeting of just one ethnic group of the population in secteur, or a cellule, where Tutsis and Hutus were always together, lived together and shared everything?  

Something else, at the cellule level, there was a five-member committee, including the leader of the cellule.  And there was somebody -- someone responsible for a group of ten houses to ensure security.  All these leaders at the grassroots level comprised Tutsis and Hutus.  

Let me say this to you -- I'm saying this to you just to prove that such a meeting that was selective, as claimed by the Prosecutor, could not hold (sic).  Mr. President, Your Honours, as the Prosecutor claims, did I incite the Hutu to kill Tutsis, and then subsequently arrest and jail them?  It would be incomprehensible.  

Let me not fail to tell you, also, that in the month of April, Rusumo commune welcomed several thousands of refugees from Byumba and Kibungo préfectures.  Rusumo was the only commune where one would feel secure, with the advance of the RPF.  On the 28th of April, that is when those soldiers moved in -- officially into the Rusumo commune.  All those refugees, together with a huge number of the Rusumo population, both Hutu and Tutsi, went on the path to exile towards Tanzania.  At the end of April 1994, RPF closed the passage of refugees over the Kagera bridge towards Tanzania and occupied the entire Rusumo commune.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, allow me now to speak about the refugees at the Nyarubuye parish, on which a great deal has been written.  During the security -- during the préfectural security committee meeting on the 8th April, there was mention made of disturbances in communes which led to the displacement of people who were under threat to other, safer, areas.  It is these refugees who were seen coming to Nyarubuye parish from the north -- in the north of Rusumo commune before the 15th of April 1994.  When they arrived, the inhabitants of commune -- Rukira commune, which is a neighbouring -- Rukira commune, which neighbours Rusumo, began to threaten these people in Nyarubuye secteur, from the 13th April, because they had welcomed Tutsis from elsewhere.  

It is public knowledge that on the 14th April 1994, the inhabitants of Rukira commune attacked Nyarutunga cellule from the Nyarubuye secteur, through Birembo, to the north-west of the parish.  Thanks to the togetherness of the Tutsis and Hutus of Nyarubuye secteur, these invaders were repelled.  But, later on, they came back with gendarmes from the Mulindi centre in Rukira commune.  They attacked Hutus and Tutsis who were gathered at the Nyarutunga centre in Nyarubuye secteur, and the gendarmes disbursed after having killed some of them.  

On the 15th of April, late in the afternoon, the Gendarmes came back, without warning, with civilians from the Rukira commune and from other regions, and they attacked the refugees at the parish.  They had commandeered vehicles from traders at the Mulindi trading centre in Rukira commune in order to transport the assailants.  The convoy was reinforced by other vehicles from Kibungo.  They came, picking up other people on their way.  When they arrived at the parish the attackers killed the refugees and quickly returned to their homes using the same route.  

Eyewitnesses who were present at the attack on the parish came to make statements before Trial Chamber III.  Others who participated in the attack are in prison in Rwanda now.  They made their own confession and pleaded guilty before Rwandan courts.  And they clearly stated that the attacks on the church were led by gendarmes based in Rukira commune.  

All these witnesses and prisoners never ever said that Gacumbitsi directed the killings at the parish.  I have always said that these evil-doers who killed the refugees at the parish came from outside Rusumo commune.  If my trial had not been expeditious, I would have been able to present further eyewitness witnesses who are Hutu and Tutsis.  

These refugees were safe at the parish.  They had no problems.  They were having food and they were having no difficulty with the local population, although they were many in number.  

Since I was living far from Nyarubuye parish, and because I had always been in hiding from the evening of 13th April 1994, I was like a swollen ball -- a deflated ball.  I -- someone -- a civilian from Nyarubuye commune, one Neza, came to tell me very early on the morning of the 16th, 1994.  But since he didn't find me in the commune office, he came to my home.  After this sad news, my heart went beating and I spent a moment of silence.  I was extremely shocked.  The sous-préfet of Kirehe was also informed of this sad, unexpected event.  

Prosecutor -- Prosecution Witness Fergal Keane, the journalist of the BBC, went looking for me in the refugee camps in (unintelligible) in Tanzania -- in Tanzania to ask me how the refugees at the Nyarubuye parish were killed.  I explained to him that I did not -- that he had misunderstood.  I told him that he should go to the Red Cross in order to find out what really had gone on at the parish, and he refused.  I protested against what this journalist was doing, and I wrote to the director of the BBC, but there was no answer to my protest.  A copy of that letter was together with my personal effects in the refugee camps, and I have a few of those effects.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, when -- with the -- the Almighty God, may he live in the hearts of men because he is the supreme witness.  

I was living in the Nyarubuye parish, and the communal office was very far.  There was no telephone, neither at the sous-préfectures, neither at the commune office, nor even at the parish.  I could not imagine that these gendarmes, based in Rukira commune, and foreign civilians, would come to my commune to attack refugees who were living peacefully at the parish, such as others who had assembled in other secteurs.  It should be noted that, given the situation at the Rusumo commune office, people could leave the neighbouring commune in order to come and do things in this area, in the north, without the bourgmestre knowing.  

To the bottom of my heart, I have said truthfully what happened in April 1994, and the truth will always conquer lies.  

Furthermore, I am inclining (sic) myself before the victims of the war which befell Rwanda from 1990.  I also incline -- I bow before the victims of all ethnic groups, and I condemn, seriously, the ravaging of my beautiful country, Rwanda.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to conclude by begging you, sincerely, to review my situation in all justice and all fairness.  I am convinced that justice is there in order to punish the guilty, but also in order to free the innocent.  I am in no doubt that your august chamber will render justice by acknowledging my innocence which I have continually reclaimed (sic), right from the beginning, and which all honest people from Rusumo and Rukira communes have confirmed, without any hesitation.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I thank you sincerely for having given me your attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Gacumbitsi.  We have allowed you something more than the stipulated time, and I hope that that is appreciated.  
MR. GACUMBITSI:
Merci. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, there are no other submissions by either side?  
MR. WESTON: 
Nothing from the Prosecution, thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Nothing?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
No, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is the end of these proceedings; curia advisari vult.  We will announce our decision in due course.  On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I wish to thank both parties, as well as their able and distinguished counsel, for all the assistance they have given to the Bench.  We warmly appreciate that.  We would like, also, to thank the officials of the Court, including, very specially, the interpreters.  The Appeals Chamber of this Tribunal now stands adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1730H)
