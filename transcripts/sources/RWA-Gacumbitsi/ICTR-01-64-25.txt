P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  We are going to deliver our decision. 

On 17 November 2003, the Defence brought before the Trial Chamber a motion, an extremely urgent motion, for the review of the decision delivered on 11 November 2003 by Trial Chamber III.  The Defence submit that the Prosecutor had 14 days to challenge the status of expert of Mr. Ndengejeho or to request to exercise its right to cross-examine him.  For the Defence, the 17th of October 2003 -- on the 17th of October 2003, the Prosecutor chose to object to the report filed on 6 October, 2003, thus waiving his right to challenge the status of expert of the witness.  The Defence also purports that it has a right -- that its right to a fair trial has been violated because the Trial Chamber did not take into consideration its answer before -- or its reply before deciding on the Prosecutor's motion.  The Defence requested the Trial Chamber to review its decision in the light of these new issues, or to authorise the Defence to lodge an appeal against this decision. 

At the hearing of 17 November 2003, the Prosecutor presented an oral response to that motion, challenging the foreclosure and inadmissibility of his motion of 3 November 2003 raised by the Defence.  The Prosecutor submits that revision can be founded only on Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and can only arise on matters relating to merits.  The Prosecutor also presented a counterclaim for the review of the same decision of 11 November 2003, on the grounds that Mr. Pascal Ndengejeho was not in Rusumo in April 1994 and that, consequently, he cannot be a witness of the facts which occurred in the Rusumo commune in April and May 1994. 

The Trial Chamber takes note of the conditions in which the Prosecutor's motion was disclosed to the Defence and also of all the other elements relating thereto which the Defence brought to its knowledge. 

The Trial Chamber recalls the competence of every Judge to review its own decision, if new circumstances emerge after its decision so justify, and this is in conformity with established case law in this Tribunal.  Consequently, the Trial Chamber admits the application for review, recalling its competence with regard to expert witnesses under paragraph 8 of our decision of 11 November 2003.  The Trial Chamber is of the opinion that it has the competence to accept or dismiss, in whole or in part, the contribution of an expert witness and that it can exercise this competence proprio motu. 

In the circumstances, and for the reasons already presented in the decision of 11 November 2003, referred to above, the Trial Chamber dismisses, on the merits, the motion for the review of its decision. 

The Trial Chamber holds that this decision does not in any manner whatsoever adversely affect the equity, the rapidity of the process nor its outcome and that, consequently, it is appropriate to dismiss the motion for certification of the appeals Defence in accordance with Rule 73(B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 

The Trial Chamber dismisses the motions filed by the parties. 

I will now turn to Mr. Kouengoua. 

Mr. Kouengoua, you have a witness of fact this afternoon; is that right? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor, the registry, the interpreters, stenographers. 

For this afternoon, Madam President, it was agreed that we had to hear Witness XW15. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can you bring in Witness XW15, please? 
(Witness entered the courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I suppose the parties do not have any motion this afternoon.  If that be the case, we will begin immediately with Witness XW15. 

Good afternoon, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness.  Therefore, we will be referring to you under the pseudonym XW15.  You will be examined in-chief by the Defence and cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and the Judges perhaps may ask you questions.  Before answering questions, we request you to make a solemn declaration and the Prosecutor -- rather, the registry will help you in making your solemn declaration. (Declaration made by Witness XW15 in Kinyarwanda).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness. 

We thank you, registry. 

Ms. Mbattang, who is going to examine the witness in-chief?  Well, you have the floor, Mrs. Mbattang. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Good afternoon, Madam President; good afternoon, Judges; good afternoon, Prosecutor; good afternoon, stenographers; good afternoon, the registry; good afternoon, interpreters; and good afternoon, Witness XW15.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Counsel. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I would request that this examination-in-chief be split into two parts:  first of all, in a closed session, because I may ask questions that may reveal the identity of the witness; and after the closed session, we could move on to an open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you have any comments to make? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we are going to begin with a closed session.  We apologise to the public, but we are proceeding as we are doing in the interest of protecting the witness's identity. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 6] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 3 by Mark Porter)















MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session. 

Counsel, you may continue with your examination-in-chief.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness XW15, since when did you know Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre?
A.	I knew him since 1985.  I was already mature enough to know someone.
Q.	What relations did you have with Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	The relations I had with the bourgmestre were relations between a bourgmestre and a junior.  He was the bourgmestre of our commune.  That's all.
Q.	Where and when did you hear of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana? 
A.	We heard of the death of President Habyarimana over the radio on the 7th of April, in the morning.  There was an announcement asking the population -- or asking everyone to remain at home, not to move about.
Q.	Witness XW15, when this news was announced, what was your reaction? 
A.	When this news was announced, we remained home, but people showed sadness as a result of the death of the president of the republic.
Q.	Witness XW15, you say that people were sad.  Were there disturbances as a result of the death of the president?  I mean disturbances in your area, the area where you lived. 
A.	After the president's death was announced, in the morning of the 7th, from the 7th until the date when we fled, there were disturbances only in one place.
Q.	Witness XW15, how many Tutsi families lived in your area? 
A.	There were about 20 Tutsi families, at least those that I knew.
Q.	What were the relations between the Tutsi and the Hutu in your area? 
A.	The Tutsi in our area had good relations with the Hutu.  There were intermarriages.  They gave gifts of cows to one another.  There were godparents for -- there were Tutsi godfathers for Hutu children and vice versa.
Q.	Witness XW15, did those relations change after the death of the president? 
A.	The relations did not change suddenly, but subsequently -- in any case, I'm referring to the area where I lived -- the situation changed.  But this was after our departure; that is, after we had fled.
Q.	Witness XW15, to your knowledge, did the Tutsi population of your area -- was the Tutsi population of your area persecuted? 
A.	No.  From the death of Habyarimana until the date we went into flight, a manhunt had not started, hunting for people had not started.  At some point in time, some irresponsible people wanted to cause problems.  They burnt the houses of some families, and this caused some tension, but our bourgmestre immediately arrested them, and those who had such plans or intentions were warned therefore.
Q.	Witness XW15, to your knowledge, did the authorities of your locality, that is Nyumbakume, the officials of the cellule and the conseillers, did they hold meetings after the death of the president?
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness XW15, Witness XW15, during your stay in Rwanda after the death of the president, did you hear that the commune officials incited the Hutu to kill the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  Since the death of President Habyarimana, from that time up to when we crossed the border, nothing of the sort happened in our area.
Q.	Did you hear about such incitement occurring in the neighbouring areas? 
A.	No.  We didn't hear about such incitement occurring in the neighbouring areas.
Q.	Do you know whether refugees came from elsewhere to hide in your area? 
A.	Yes.  Refugees came from Murambi, Birenga, as well as other communes and they settled in Rwanteru in our area.  Besides, those people committed evil acts, and they would go and harvest bundles of bananas, as well as cassava tubers.  And the bourgmestre tried to sensitise them not to create tension within the local population.
Q.	Witness XW15, can you tell the Chamber the ethnic group of those refugees? 
A.	They were of mixed origin.  I wouldn't be able to say that they belonged to such-and-such an ethnic group.  Those refugees were fleeing the war.  The war was raging in their area, they said.
Q.	Witness XW15, during your stay in Rwanda before you fled, did you hear the officials or the responsables of the commune asking people to rape Tutsi women and children? 
A.	No.  I never heard such an order.
Q.	Witness XW15, are you aware of rape of Tutsi women and girls during that period? 
A.	In our area, and in other areas as well, such acts were not committed.  Peace reigned at the time, so no such acts were committed. 
Q.	Witness XW15, while you were in your area, did you hear that instructions were given to boatmen to prevent people from crossing the Akagera river to seek refuge in Tanzania?
A.	No.  No such orders were given.  People were crossing the Akagera.
Q.	Witness XW15, you said a while ago that you gave reading lessons and writing lessons to old people.  Did you hear that arms were distributed in your area by the responsables of your commune?
A.	No.  We didn't hear of such things.  If we had heard about them, we would have left a lot earlier, but no such things happened in our area.
Q.	Do you know Tutsis who crossed the Akagera river during that period?
A.	I know of many who travelled -- who crossed the Akagera, large numbers of people crossed the Akagera.
Q.	A while ago, you said that before you fled, there were no disturbances in your area.  On what date did you flee? 
A.	We fled on the 14th of April.
Q.	And why did you flee, since there was peace and there were no problems? 
A.	We fled because in Nyamugali secteur, there were nocturnal rounds, following the fact that bandits had burned houses.  Those bandits were arrested by the bourgmestre, and after they were arrested, we heard that Tutsis' houses had been burned, so we became afraid.  There were other people who had problems with Gacumbitsi, and they wanted to take possession of his farm.  And those people said,  "Now we will take possession of the farm.  We assure your bourgmestre."  And at that time we were afraid and we fled.
Q.	Witness XW15, how many of you left Rwanda on the 14th of April 1994?
A.	There were, in all, ten families.  If you do not object to it, I could name some of these families, amongst the ten families that fled with us.
Q.	Please do so, in the interests of the Chamber, if you can do so.
A.	I will name the families I can remember. 
Q.	Please go ahead. 
A.	There was Didace Gakwaya; Oswald Mukomeza, and there was his family as well as his sisters; Antoine Mpunga, as well as his family and his sister.  There was also Calixte Gasimba and his family.  There was also Jean Rwabitenga and his entire family.  There was also Ndakaza, his junior brother -- his junior brothers.  There was one Kayiru.  These are the people I remember.  There was another person called Nwarabu and his family.  These are the names I remember. 
Q.	Witness XW15 --
MS. MBATTANG:
Could the interpreter please spell the names mentioned by the witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was Gakwaya, G-A-K-W-A-Y-A.  Mukomeza is M-U-K-O-M-E-Z-A.  Mpunga is M-P-U-N-G-A.  Gasimba is spelt as follows:  G-A-S-I-M-B-A.  Rwabitenga, R-W-A-B-I-T-E-N-G-A.  Ndakaza, 
N-D-A-K-A-Z-A.  Kayiru, K-A-Y-I-R-U.  Nwarabu, N-W-A-R-A-B-U.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness XW15, on that day, did you flee with all the members of your family? 
A.	No.  I left with my brother, my husband, my child.  I was pregnant -- I had a nine-month pregnancy, and my mother stayed behind with my child.
Q.	Witness XW15, through which border crossing did you cross over into Tanzania? 
A.	We passed through the Mitako crossing, M-I-T-A-K-O. 
Q.	Witness XW15, did you encounter any problems crossing?
A.	We had no problem.  The boatmen helped to us get across without any problems.
Q.	Witness XW15, did you have to pay any charges in order to be taken across?
A.	Apart from myself, who did not pay because the boatman knew me, others paid 50 francs, but those who did not have money were also helped to cross over.
Q.	Do you know who helped you cross over, Witness XW15?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Can you please tell the Chamber his name?
A.	His name was Gahigana, son of Rwabitenga.  He was a Hutu.
Q.	Witness XW15, a while ago you told the Chamber that when you sought refuge in Tanzania, your mother stayed behind in Rwanda.  Is she still in Rwanda? 
A.	No.  She was killed.  There was a man who posed for a giant, and he had his acolytes, and the day after we crossed over, we heard that Alphonse had launched an attack -- Alphonse Derimuderi had launched an attack, during which my mother was killed.
Q.	Do you know the circumstances in which your mother was killed? 
A.	No.  All I heard was that she had been killed.  I don't know the circumstances in which she was killed.
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, Your Honours, it would appear that the answer that has been given to us is not exactly what the witness said. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did the witness say, according to the information you've received? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
(Previous translation continued) ... she should just ask the booth to clarify or ask the witness to repeat her answer -- much obliged -- rather than make comment on the record.  She is incompetent , as far as we are concerned.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, I would like you to stop such interruptions.  It's not up to you to tell us what we have to do.  Allow us to do our work.  If you want to do it in our place, do so, if you can.  I asked the question:  What was inaccurate?
MS. MBATTANG:
The name of the person who killed the witness's mother.  That name was not properly interpreted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please repeat the name of the person who killed your mother? 
THE WITNESS:
It was the leader of the assailants.  He was the one who was leading the attack.  His name was Alphonse Derimuderi.
MS. MBATTANG:
Can you spell that name, please, interpreter? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Derimuderi is spelled as follows:  D-E-R-I-M-U-D-E-R-I.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness XW15, what was that person you have just named doing in your area? 
A.	He was a trader.
Q.	Witness XW15, since you sought refuge in Tanzania in 1994, did you go back to Rwanda? 
A.	We went back.
Q.	In what year?
A.	We went back this year.
Q.	Witness XW15, since you went back to Rwanda this year, how have people of your area been speaking of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	I am not in a position to tell you.  I didn't hear people say what -- say anything concerning him.
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have no further questions to put to this witness in examination-in-chief.  Thank you for your kind attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Mbattang. 

Judge Egorov has some questions for the witness. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Did you see Mr. Gacumbitsi on the time when you were in Rwanda, before your departure? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I did not see him, but we can get such information from his subordinates. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  And before your departure, did you live in your own house or somewhere else? 
THE WITNESS:
I stayed at home.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to clarify something, Witness.  You said that you returned to Rwanda "this year."  Do you mean in 2003 or in 1994?  In what year did you return to Rwanda?  

I believe there is a problem, because all we get is the English. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness indeed said that she returned to Rwanda in 2003. 

The problem came from the microphone.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you may proceed to cross-examine the witness.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, between the 7th of April and the 14th of April 1994, when you fled, it would be true, isn't it, that you did not go to Rwanteru? 
A.	No, I didn't go there.
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that Gahigana, who helped you cross when you were in flight, is the son of Jean Rwabitenga?
A.	He is indeed his son.
Q.	And it's true, Witness, in your examination-in-chief, a while ago, you told this Chamber that Jean Rwabitenga is or was a Tutsi, isn't it?
A.	He was not Tutsi.  Only his wife was Tutsi.  He was an old person, so they all left together.
Q.	But Witness, a while ago you listed the Tutsi families that fled with yourself to Tanzania, and amongst the Tutsis, you listed Jean Rwabitenga, isn't it?
A.	That is right.
Q.	And do you recall making a statement to Defence investigators on the 14th of June this year? 
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	And do you recall telling the investigator that Jean Rwabitenga was amongst the Tutsis who had fled through the Mitako gap?
A.	Yes, I do remember.  I said so, because it was a man who came from Rwanda, and he was considered as a Tutsi, whereas he was Hutu.
Q.	Now, do you also recall telling investigators that Emmanuel Kananura was amongst the Tutsis who fled to Tanzania through the Mitako gap?
A.	He was Hutu.  He was Hutu. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I have no further questions for this witness, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
He was helping my husband, trying to protect me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Mbattang, would you like to re-examine the witness?  
MS. MBATTANG:
Just one question, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead, Counsel. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness XW15, how did you come to know about the fact that there were refugees in Rwanteru? 
A.	We heard about that from people coming -- that -- because there were people coming from other areas and trying to foment disorder in our area, and our bourgmestre was sensitising the officials of our secteur to stop that from happening.  We knew that there were refugees from Rwanteru because from our house we could see their camp and they were attacking Nyamugali and our area, looking for banana bundles and other things to eat -- and cassava to eat.
MS. MBATTANG:
I have no further questions for the witness, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Witness, you've come to the end of your testimony before this Chamber.  We thank you for coming to testify, and we wish you a safe journey back home. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have just heard the two factual witnesses who were scheduled to testify this week.  We still have the Accused and Mr. Ndengejeho.  What do you intend to do?  Is Mr. Ndengejeho present in Arusha? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, thank you.  The Defence is not in a position to answer that question.  We are not able to answer that question.  We have not received any information with regard to that subject.  We knew that our expert witness had to come and testify.  I don't have any answers to that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, then, I have just received a letter from the representative of the witness section, and she says that Mr. Ndengejeho is due to arrive on the 19th.  That is tomorrow. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am obliged to the Bench for that information. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And now, how do you intend to organise things?  Do you want Mr. Ndengejeho to testify before the defendant or can we hear the defendant first?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the programme we had submitted put -- placed the defendant, the Accused, last. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In fact, that is what you had said, but in view of the circumstances, you still prefer that he should be heard after Mr. Ndengejeho, who is due to arrive tomorrow?  Because at this point, we have no further witnesses. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No.  We have no further witnesses, Madam, but it would be preferable that the Accused, the defendant, be heard after Mr. Ndengejeho.  I merely wanted to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to the fact that the trial was due to conclude on the 31st of October (sic), so inasmuch as we resumed on the 17th, I feel we have a few days before us to refine a few points.  I don't really know.  Maybe it's not always a bad things to have a bit of time.  We can take advantage of that.   
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Kouengoua, we need your assistance.  Could you tell us how long the Accused's testimony will take, that is the evidence in-chief, your examination of him?  How long will it take?  Have you any estimate, any idea? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  As things stand, we couldn't say how long it would take.  But as it is Judge Reddy who is putting the question and wasn't there, we have covered a lot of ground.  We covered -- we heard four witnesses in a very short time, so please rest assured that we'll do whatever is necessary to avoid any difficulties.  Going back to my notes here, we adjourned on the 
21st of October.  We had six trial days remaining, therefore, and I'm sure that in that time, we can do whatever is necessary.  So as far as the witness -- the Defence is concerned, we feel no anxiety.  We shall be able to do what's necessary in the time available. 
JUDGE REDDY:
The only thing is that as from the 26th, which is next Wednesday, the President will be presiding in another case, and as you know, we are already in the Military case.  So if we don't finish by next Wednesday, this case will have to stand over until next year, for the evidence to be completed.  And I'm sure you don't want that.  I don't think anybody wants that.  So I'm just wondering why we cannot save time by introducing the Accused now and calling the expert witness later.  I don't know what the reasoning is, what the thinking is, behind this -- your strategy, but generally, in many jurisdictions, the Accused gives evidence first.  I see no particular advantage, but you may wish to explain.  I'm merely trying to save time, that's all, with the permission of the President. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  As regards time, Gacumbitsi's Defence has never wanted and never -- and we never let ourselves be -- let be extended beyond the end of November.  That has never been our wish.  And please be rest assured, we've done everything necessary to stay within the time limit.  And now you mention the date of the 26th of November.  Believe us, the Defence understands very well what is being said from the Bench.  We will do whatever we can, even to understand you further.  But understanding is like an elevator which must be shuttled back and forth.  But sometimes we found ourselves waiting very long for the others to send the elevator back to us.  But please rest assured we shall get through what we have to get through within the time limit. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We've already told you, Counsel, that as of the 26th of November, we will be hearing another matter.  I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that you mentioned that you had six days of hearings remaining, owed to you.  But if you consider that we only have Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning, plus Monday -- we don't even know whether Tuesday might not be a holiday.  So you see, we don't have much time.  So couldn't we already do something so as to not lose tomorrow? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, thank you.  I think when I mentioned six days, I was referring to the amount of time given to the Defence to find the witnesses and call them.  And we are still within the time limits fixed as they were during October.  We are doing the maximum that we can.  That's all we are saying, Madam President. 

Madam President, please, I think I cannot ignore elements such as those just now brought to my attention, but Mr. Pascal Ndengejeho is coming tomorrow.  I think that in such a case, when it is the party calling the witness, they should be informed first.  I don't know, I've never met the gentleman.  But anyhow, as far as we are concerned, we undertake to do what we've undertaken to do in Gacumbitsi's Defence so as the Trial Chamber should not suffer in matters of time used or time available.  Now, whether it is to the cost of the Accused, that is another matter, but we will do our duty as his counsel. 

Your Honour, I was going to forget, I think that as far as Ndengejeho is concerned, he will only be examined for a couple of hours, one or two hours.  It won't take us any time at all, only two hours.  So really the only person remaining is Mr. Gacumbitsi, and I don't think in spite of his size, it will take ten days to examine and cross-examine him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, what we are suggesting is that he should start testifying as of tomorrow, as we don't have anybody else lined up for tomorrow, because, otherwise, we will be running risks.  I told you we have to hear another matter, and we cannot go beyond the date we have given you.  So it is to -- if we do not sit tomorrow, it will be a risk that you are running and we merely want to draw your attention to that.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I think another solution would be that if there isn't enough time, you might decide not to hear the Accused or partially hear him, but if I was told at what time Ndengejeho was coming tomorrow, perhaps I could tell you before lunchtime that I would call Ndengejeho.  But as regards Gacumbitsi, I don't think we can hear him tomorrow -- I am prepared to hear him tomorrow, to examine him tomorrow, for very obvious reasons, but if I'm told Ndengejeho is coming in the morning, then I have no objection whatsoever to calling him in the afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We take due note.  Unfortunately, we have not been told at what time Ndengejeho is arriving in Arusha.  We are only given the date, the 19th of November.  I should like to be informed of the precise time, and if he arrives tomorrow morning, then we can sit tomorrow afternoon and hear Mr. Ndengejeho. 
Very well, that's the way we are.  Any other comments from the parties?  The Prosecution? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
It's entirely at your discretion, Your Honours.  I raised this matter yesterday as one of our housekeeping matters.  I note that we are running out of time.  There is a possibility of a public holiday next week.  So I leave it entirely to your discretion. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Is your cross-examination likely to be long, Mr. Prosecutor, of the Accused? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
It's difficult to tell at this stage, where counsel has not given us how long he's going to be in chief.  So you know, it would be a leap in the dark for me to suggest that it's going to take an hour or a day.  Much obliged, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall adjourn and resume tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.  If Mr. Ndengejeho arrives tomorrow morning, you can then prepare yourself for the hearing at 2:30 p.m.  That is our intention.  All going well, we will resume tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. to hear Mr. Ndengejeho. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam, I should merely like to ask the counsel for the Prosecution if he withdraws the objection -- will he object again tomorrow?  Because that is a problem coming as a witness of fact.  Yesterday, a witness -- the Prosecution said he could not be a witness of fact because he wasn't there, but if he has any further objections, he should make them now so that we have better things to do than to argue about it again tomorrow.  We are planning to call him tomorrow as a witness for facts.  He will be tired, he's arriving, there is no point bringing him in to object again tomorrow.  Let him say so now and thereby we can save time.  And then I can also talk with Gacumbitsi, to prepare him, so that we can save time and not wait until Tuesday or Wednesday next week. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, yesterday we sought directions on how the Chamber intends to proceed with the evidence of Ndengejeho, and this regards what is permissible, what is admissible, in evidence.  In the event that we didn't get any directions, we intend to object if counsel seeks to elicit material we find objectionable. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Listen, let's not jump the gun.  We heard one decision a little while ago.  We rendered our decision.  I think it might be a good idea for everybody, one or the other party, to read through it again so as to be quite clear as to what we have decided in respect of Mr. Ndengejeho's testimony. 

We shall now adjourn, as I have said, and we'll see later as to the objections. 

We have received an item of information.  Apparently, Mr. Ndengejeho is arriving tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m., unless there is any change.  So he will be here tomorrow morning at 9:45, so we shall resume tomorrow at 2:30 p.m., all being well. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you for that information, Madam.  But I hope that with your experience and the experience of your colleagues on the Bench, that if Ndengejeho comes to testify for the Defence, we should have had an idea at least of this information.  I know he is someone coming out of the plane.  I don't know if he's coming by plane or what.  It is somewhat delicate.  It's a witness that we have called.  It's our witness.  And it's true that they are giving us the information.  When you've just asked us whether we have any other witness, is that really lawful?  Is it courteous?  Is it proper? 

Madam President, Your Honours --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think there is any reason to get upset, Counsel.  We asked for the information and we obtained it, and we have taken note of it.  It's at this very instant that we got the information.  We were not informed.  It's as we get the information, we pass it on to you.  The problem is Mr. Ndengejeho only confirmed his arrival now.  It's only now that we got the information.  I don't think there is any need to
-- there is no need to throw the responsibility on anyone else's shoulders.  We just got the information, we just gave it to you.  That's it. 
(Court adjourned at 1550H)
