MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 

Counsel Kouengoua, do you have a witness for this afternoon? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good afternoon, Madam President; good afternoon, Your Honours.  The Accused has to testify this afternoon, Madam President, as a witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, then, thank you. 

Accused, could you please go and sit in the witness box? 

Would you like to testify in another language or in French? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Madam President, I would like to testify in Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  The interpreter, the Kinyarwanda interpreter, is there. 

Before we start, I would like to point out that you will be examined in-chief by the Defence, 
cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and the Judges may also put some questions to you.  In view of the fact that you have accepted to testify, we will ask you to make a solemn declaration to swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, and the registrar will assist you with the solemn declaration.  (Declaration made by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  Please be seated. 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do the parties have any motions to file before the Chamber?  And if they don't, I would ask Counsel Kouengoua to proceed to examination-in-chief of the Accused. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you.  The issue regarding the motion the Defence would like to raise, Madam President, is that, yesterday --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any problem, Counsel? 

MR. KOUENGOUA:
I was saying, Madam President, that yesterday, it was envisaged that with the permission of the Chamber, with the leave of the Chamber, the witness could be heard today and on Monday.  I would like to ask or to request the august Chamber, in the event of this witness not testifying entirely today, I would request permission to meet him before Monday, in view of the witness's status. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I believe you know the procedure and you know what to do in order to meet your client, if need be. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
At the moment, it is somewhat premature. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President.  That is the only question I had for the Bench, Madam President, as regards the situation before examination-in-chief of this Accused. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua. 

So is there any motion on the side of the Prosecutor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
There is no motion, Your Honours, just comment on counsel's application.  It would appear that once a witness is in the stand, on oath, he should not interact with counsel until he's completed his testimony, in this jurisdiction, Your Honours. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, if you please --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I would like to add, Madam President, that when I made representation regarding the procedure, I filed a certain list of documents that I intended to disclose during the testimony of the expert witness, and most of those documents were attached to his report.  That is why I respectfully request the Chamber that whenever the Accused will mention those documents during his testimony, those documents should be produced, and if that were not the case, I don't see on what other occasion I can do so, Madam President.  The list had been disclosed, and I had submitted that all documents that I would have subsequently would be tendered to the Chamber.  That is the only addition I wanted to make with regard to what I said earlier, Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any comments regarding the documents Counsel Kouengoua has referred to? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
The only comment being, Your Honours, that sufficient foundation has to be laid when any exhibit is sought to be introduced into evidence by counsel, and it's at that stage that the Prosecutor will raise an objection or not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  We thank you, Prosecutor. 

Counsel Kouengoua, please, you may proceed to examination-in-chief of the Accused. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.

Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you attend school?
A.	Yes.  I went to school.
Q.	Can you give us your school curriculum, please, your background, educational background, please?
A.	The studies I did were quite out of the ordinary.  At the time when I went to school, it was -- everyone was not accustomed to going to school.  When I was of school age, there was a sub-chief named Kalkabarani (phonetic), in the Kigina secteur.  He came to our house and he told my father that I had to go to school, because he didn't want to see any children who didn't go to school.  My father heeded his advice and enrolled me in school.  In our secteur, there was only one school establishment, and only one child went to school at a time, and after school he came back home.  The primary school was in Nyarubuye.  After the first year in school, I was still very young, and I followed schoolmates who were older than me to go and study in Nyarubuye parish, about 30 kilometres from our home.  So I had to be sheltered somewhere, I had to look for my food myself, fend for myself, and that is what I did.  God helped me and I completed my studies.  In 1956, I passed the national exam, which enabled me to be admitted in the boarding section of the school.  I succeeded very well in that exam.  I went to study in Rwaza, in Ruhengeri préfecture.  But I had problems.  We were poor.  My mother did not have the means to send me to school, and she told me, "Come back home.  There is nothing else we can do."  But the parish priest in Nyarubuye parish was the director of studies in the school, as well, as -- and the sub-chief whom I mentioned earlier came to our home, and they said, "This child should pursue his studies in secondary school."  My mother said, "It is not possible.  I am poor."  And they answered saying, "We understand all that.  You are poor.  But the child should not be a victim of this situation.  The world of today requires that children should go to school."  And I was exempted from paying school fees. 

However, I had to find transportation charges up to Rwaza, in Ruhengeri préfecture where I went.  I had to study.  My mother accepted that, and she said,  "I will do everything to ensure you get there.  Whenever you, yourselves, can, please help me."  I went to study in Rwaza.  I spent a year in boarding school.  And at the end of the first year, I passed the end-of-course exam and this gave me access to Byumba school, where I went to seven year, which is known as the preparatory year, and after that year, I went to the École normale, and I pursued my studies there.  In 1963, I graduated with a teacher's certificate, and I started working as a teacher. This is my academic background.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You said that the single-cycle school near your home -- you went to study 30 kilometres away from home.  Were you the only one in your neighbourhood who went to that school?
A.	I said that there were other schoolmates of mine who were older than me, and these schoolmates accompanied me to the school, and they protected me on our way to school, and I joined them, and we studied together in Nyarubuye.  As from the fifth year, I was in boarding school with other Tutsi schoolmates from our neighbourhood, from our area.  These are Kanyarutsinga and Safari, Léopold.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Could you please spell those names for us? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kanyarutsinga is spelt as follows:  K-A-N-Y-A-R-U-T-S-I-N-G-A.  And Safari is spelt as follows:  
S-A-F-A-R-I.  Safari, Léopold.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I believe those facts refer to 1954-55, the period from 1954 to 1955; is that correct, Witness?
A.	We completed the fifth year of primary school in 1957.  We went to boarding school, to first-year boarding school, in 1958.  And I started the teacher training college in Byumba in 1959.
Q.	At that age, did you already know that those schoolmates of yours whom you've just named were of the same ethnic group as yourself? 
A.	Yes.  They told us so in class.  They usually asked for classmates' ethnic groups, and each time they asked for them, we gave that information.  That is what was done at the time.
Q.	You have just told the Chamber that you had two classmates, known as Kanyarutsinga and Safari, Léopold.  Were they Hutu like yourself or what was their ethnic group?
A.	I believe I stated that those two children attended the fifth year with me, and they were Tutsi.  They also took the exam with me.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You completed --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon.  Could you please continue, Counsel? 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, you said that you completed your studies in 1953.  What did you do thereafter? 
A.	I graduated as a teacher, and I started teaching in primary school.
Q.	Where did you start teaching? 
A.	First of all, I taught in the Kirehe school.  I taught the first year of secondary school, and I was what was called the main teacher, maître principal.  In other words, I was the supervisor of the other teachers.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Apart from teaching the first year of secondary school and being the main teacher, did you have any other responsibilities or duties within the school?
A.	I continued my teaching career, and in 1966-67, our inspector went on further training course, and I was asked to replace him as interim inspector.  After that period of one year, I continued teaching in Kirehe, where I was.  Then, I believe it was in 1970-1971, I was sent on further training, where I spent one year, and upon my return from the further training course, I continued teaching. 

With time, the Rusumo commune created what was referred to as the Banque populaire, the People's Bank.  The People's Bank was under the control of another bank in Kigali.  The members of the bank chose me as the chairman of that branch of the People's Bank, so I carried out that duty until I was selected bourgmestre.
Q.	Witness, what are the criteria for -- what were the criteria for to you become chairman of the People's Bank; that is, the Banque populaire? 
A.	First of all, you had to be a member.  Then, you have to -- you had to have the abilities, especially administrative ability or competence.  Besides, you have to be someone serious, someone who is capable of leading people.  Then you can be elected, and the members of the population can, in fact, elect you on the basis of these criteria.
Q.	Witness, you said that while you were in school, you named some friends with whom you were in school, from various ethnic groups.  During your career as a teacher, and also when you were the chairman of the bank, did you have friends? 
A.	Yes.  I had many friends.  I will begin with the two whom I named before.  But I had many other friends.  Among the teachers, among the employees of the commune or state employees, among members of the local population, that is people who were under my administration, I had many friends, both Hutu and Tutsi.  Everyone -- if you want me to give you names, I could give you a few names, but I had many friends.
Q.	And after the time when you finished with teaching or the bank, in your area, did the members -- or were the members of the local population spread throughout the -- your area on the basis of their ethnic origin? 
A.	No, not at all.  The mode of settlement in Rwanda was not in the form of villages so much so that -- well, you did not have one ethnic group living in a given village.  Hutu, Tutsi and Twa were mixed up.  There was no territory for any given ethnic group.  People were intermingled.  People lived together without distinction on the basis of ethnic origin. 
Q.	Among your friends in -- while you were working, can you name some of your friends while you were  -- some of the friends you had while you were working?
A.	Yes.  I will give you, for example, the name of Ruhigisha, Claudien; Kanyogote, Alphonse; Ruzigana, Onusime; Karemera, Pierre; Ndabikunze, Faustin.  And many others.  Indeed, many others.  For example:  Bitegeko, Antoine; Bonesha, Jervais.  There were many. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The interpreter, please, can you help us with the spellings of the names that the witness has just cited? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, counsel.  Ruhigisha is spelt as follows:  R-U-H-U -- I take that again.  R-U-H-U-J-I-S-H-A.  I'll repeat the name I just spelled:  It is R-U-H-I-G-I-S-H-A.  Kanyogote is spelt as follows:  
K-A-N-Y-O-G-O-T-O  -- T-E.  Ruzigana, R-U-Z-I-G-A-N-A.  Karemera, K-A-R-E-M-E-R-A.  Ndabikunze, N-D-A-B-I-K-U-N-Z-E.  Bonesha, B-O-N-E-S-H-A.  Bitegeko, B-I-T-E-G-E-K-O. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, interpreter. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, in 1975, you became the chairman of the People's Bank, the local branch of Rusumo.  When did you become bourgmestre?  On which date did you become bourgmestre? 
A.	I became bourgmestre on 2nd August, 1983.
Q.	According to what you told us at the beginning of your testimony, you were born in Rusumo commune, in 1943, if my memory serves me right, and in 1983, you became bourgmestre of the same commune; is that correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	The fact of being born in the commune, and becoming the head of that commune, 40 or 50 years thereafter, can one claim that you knew that commune very well? 
A.	You are indeed right.
Q.	Witness, can you introduce that commune in which you were born and the commune which you led?  Can you introduce it to the Trial Chamber?  Can you talk about it to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	In the 1960s, that commune was not called Rusumo.  It was called Kigina.  Later on, there was a merger of certain communes.  The Nyarubuye commune was split into two.  Part of it was attached to the Kigina commune and the other part to the Rukira commune.  Kigina, and part of Nyarubuye, together, were now named Rusumo.  This was, I believe, in 1961.  In 1994, Rusumo commune had lakes in the north, the lakes called Tanasho (phonetic), and the Akagera river, which crosses that lake, and goes towards Uganda.  The Akagera is at the same time the border between Tanzania and Rusumo commune, which shares a border with Rwanda.  In the southeast, the Akagera river continues.  Once more it serves as the border with Burundi in the southwest.  In the southwest, there is the Birenga commune, whereas in the west, you have the Rukira commune.  These are the borders of the Rusumo commune. 

I do not know whether you want to have some other information on the commune.  I have just given you the borders of the commune.
Q.	Yes, Witness.  I asked you whether you could introduce your commune to the Trial Chamber.  That is the surface area, the population and so on.  You are supposed to know that commune. 
A.	Thank you very much.  Since the commune became Rusumo, it became very vast.  It had 9,000 -- 68,000 square kilometres, and it has ten secteurs -- 968,000 square kilometres.  The commune comprises a number of zones.  For example, you have the Kibungo zone, which comprises several secteurs, the Nyarubuye secteur, which is very big, the Nyakabungo (phonetic) secteur, as well as the Nyabitare secteur.  You also have the Bihuya (phonetic) zone, which comprises the Kigina secteur, Kirehe, Gatore, Musaza as well as Kigarama.  Then you also have the zone referred to as the cuvette zone.  This is a basin, the Akagera basin.  This zone comprises very big secteurs, in particular that of Nyamugali and that of Gisenyi.  All these secteurs are subdivided into cellules.  Rusumo commune comprised a hundred cellules.  

What I can say in addition, with regard to Rusumo, is that Rusumo commune had a population on the basis of the general census of 1991, that is the census of 15 of August 1991 -- according to the figures of that census, Rusumo commune had a population of over 120,000 inhabitants.  In April 1994, the number of people increased; the population was about 140,000 inhabitants. 

What else can I say?  Well, for a long time, the Rusumo commune was only inhabited in the high hills.  In the valleys, you had only forests where you could find wild animals.  People lived on the highlands of the commune.  There are préfectures that are highly populated, like Butare, Ruhengeri, which were overpopulated, and the members of the population did not have farms to cultivate.  In 1967-68, somewhere there about, the state created what they called "paysanat," small holdings, and the small holdings were constituted in such a way that pieces of land were shared.  People from other préfectures were brought and settled in those small holdings.  The Rusumo holdings comprised Nyamugali and Gisenyi.  The Rusumo préfecture was very vast and fertile.  A lot of sorghum was produced there, as well as cassava, groundnut.  In fact, people wanted to settle there so as to be able to do farming. 

The first settlers were brought there by the state and an organisation called IDR.  It is an NGO.  That NGO developed a small farm holdings in collaboration with the state.  Later on, other people came on their own initiative, following their close relatives, and they settled where land was available.  The state gave them the land.  The state would give them a piece of land, and the report would be sent to us.  The bourgmestre would write to the native commune of the new settlers so that those communes should send their information concerning them to our commune so that we should be able to register them in our commune and thus enable them to vote like any other person.  Several préfectures, Kibuye, Butare, Kigali, even Kibungo -- there are people from Kibungo who left their places of origin to come and settle in Rusumo because the land in Rusumo was very fertile.  That is how the population increased.  

I can also say, with regard to Rusumo, that in 1982, a number of persons who had taken refuge in Uganda, Milton Obote, one of the Ugandan presidents, sent them away, told them, "Go back to your place, Rwanda."  These same refugees crossed the Mutara, which is in Rwanda, and the Rwandan state looked for ways and means of resettling them.  Most of these former refugees came to Rusumo.  They were settled in -- or resettled in Rusumo.  And it is the NGO called Africa -- or rather Africare, the NGO called Africare, it is that NGO which created villages.  It created villages for these refugees who had come from Rwanda in 1982, '83.  The refugees were settled in a modern manner, in -- or, rather, on lands well developed.  There were five villages that were created:  The Rushoka village, Ehutu (phonetic), Rubaya -- Rubaya, and Nyabubare and Ebande (phonetic) villages.  All these villages were known as Nasho.  They are located in a broad sector known as Kankobwa. 

In a few words, that is the presentation of Rusumo commune, as far as I could describe it in 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How did you become bourgmestre of that commune? 
A.	In fact, I was surprised when I became bourgmestre.  I was on holiday in the month of July.  I was tilling my land.  Someone brought to me a stamped letter.  I opened the letter, and on reading the letter, I was very surprised.  It was said in the letter that, "You, Gacumbitsi, you have become the bourgmestre of Rusumo."  I was very surprised to become bourgmestre.  I had never thought of becoming bourgmestre.  Thus I became bourgmestre, with this letter from the president of the republic.  That is how I became bourgmestre.
Q.	Before you, were there other bourgmestres at the head of this commune, and if yes, do you know them? 
A.	Yes, of course, there were other bourgmestres who had been at the head of that commune.  There was a certain Mugande, Anatole Mugande.  After him, you had a certain Augustin Baribudsa.  And after Baribudsa, you had a certain François Ntibarukinga.  There was another person at the head of that commune called Ndagige.  This was around 1981.  And I replaced a certain P. Mutunzi.  
P. Mutunzi was assassinated.  He was murdered in his office.  A criminal met him in his office and killed him with a machete.  That is the person I replaced.
Q.	Witness, can you go more slowly?  Because I have the impression that the stenographers and the interpreters have difficulties following you.  Thank you. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:   
Interpreter's booth, can you spell the names given by the witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Counsel.  Mugande, M-U --
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
I will go more slowly. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mugande is spelt as follows:  M-U-G-A-N-D-E.  Baribudsa, B-A-R-I-B-U-D-S-A.  Ntibarukinga, 
N-T-I-B-A-R-U-K-I-N-G-A.  Ndagige, N-D-A-G-I-G-E.  Mutunzi, M-U-T-U-N-Z-I. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, you have just said that the person you replaced was murdered by a criminal.  Do you know the date, on about what date he was murdered? 
A.	If my memory serves me right, it was in the month of January, the 6th of January, 6th of January 1983.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  From January 1983, to August 1983, the date when you were appointed bourgmestre, was there no one at the head of the Rusumo commune? 
A.	As provided for by the law, when there is a reason which prevents the bourgmestre from exercising his duties, there is an alternate bourgmestre or conseiller.  During that period, there was a conseiller who replaced the bourgmestre until the appointment of a new bourgmestre.

Q.	What are the steps that you took in order to become bourgmestre? 
A.	I loved the teaching profession, because that is what I learned to do.  I taught my pupils or students well, and my students loved me.  I did not do any other thing to become bourgmestre.  Moreover, I did not like politics.
Q.	And after your appointment as bourgmestre, did you continue to be manager of the Rusumo branch of the People's Bank, the Banque populaire? 
A.	I realised that it would not be easy for me to combine both functions, and as the People's Bank belonged to the commune, I decided to resign as chairman of the board of the People's Bank, and someone else was appointed, because as the bourgmestre is responsible for the commune's development, and the People's Bank belongs to the commune, the bourgmestre should do all he can to ensure that the bank is properly managed, properly run.  So I resigned from that position, and I asked that someone else replace me.  That was in 1984. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, we should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Accused has been testifying for about an hour now, and we are still on what he did, but not what he is accused of.  We draw your attention to that.  You should try and proceed more expeditiously so that we can concentrate on the accusations leveled against your client. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, madam.  It is in the interest of the Accused, justice and the proper defence that the better you know the personality of the individual you are trying, the better you will be able to evaluate and assess all the facts which we will come to. 

I should like to point out that the indictment is essentially in his capacity as bourgmestre and chairman of the MRND in Rusumo commune that all the rest befall him, and there is no one else who can explain these points apart from than himself, so I think we have to go into this to be able to make an essential appreciation of the individual who is before you.  It is in that sense that I am proceeding in this way and not for any other reason, but because I feel that it is essential to -- for understanding.  Nevertheless, I shall try not to dwell entirely on this, and parts of my examination will bear on the facts, I assure you. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, to which party -- of which party was the bourgmestre a member in 1983?
A.	At that time, there was only one party in Rwanda.  That is to say, the entire Rwandan population belonged to that party, which was the MRND.  So the bourgmestre belonged to the MRND party, just as every other Rwandan did.
Q.	And as there was only one party, did the bourgmestre play any role in the party at that time? 
A.	The bourgmestre was the chairman of the party in the commune he -- of which he was bourgmestre.  That was the practice at the time.  He was bourgmestre of the commune and chairman of the party in his commune. 
Q.	You have said that the bourgmestre was appointed at that time.  Were the conseillers also appointed? 
A.	No.  The councillor, conseiller, was elected.  There were candidates to the post, to the position.  People applied, and the people of an age to vote voted for the conseiller, and the post was given to whoever had the most votes.  So the conseiller was not appointed but elected by the population of his secteur.
Q.	And who -- what about the conseiller de cellule? 
A.	No. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
No, the responsable de cellule.  Sorry.  That was the western born -- the responsable de cellule.
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
The responsable and the deputy and assistants were elected by the population of the cellule.  Whoever obtained the most -- the majority of votes automatically became responsable of the cellule, and others -- the others were members of the bureau of the cellule.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	And candidacies to the position of conseiller de secteur, were they administered by the bourgmestre?
A.	The candidate elected to the position of conseiller, or councillor, sent a letter to the bourgmestre, and those who fulfilled the conditions to the post were placed on the list, and then we had elections, we held elections.
Q.	Witness, in 1990, there was a war in Rwanda.  Was Rusumo commune affected by that war? 
A.	In October, there was war in Rwanda.  Well, for example, take the human body.  When a finger hurts, the whole body hurts.  Your head hurts; everything hurts.  So with the attack on Byumba, we were all affected, just as -- like the human body.  But the war did not impinge as such, affect as such, Rusumo commune.  But we were saddened by the war because people were being killed in Byumba préfecture.
Q.	And before April 1994, was Rusumo commune attacked? 
A.	If I remember well, in 1991 or 1992 -- I think it was 1991, rather -- Inkontanyi, coming from the park, entered through Nasho to the north of our commune, and they came and there was a detachment in Mulindi that resisted the Inkontanyi, and other soldiers who were ensuring security in the commune, and they resisted the Inkontanyi attack and repulsed the Inkotanyi attack and it was finished.  Otherwise, there were no other attacks.  Everywhere was safe and secure. 
Q.	Witness, you just mentioned Mulindi.  Mulindi is in which commune? 
A.	Mulindi is in Rukira commune.  Nasho -- part of the Nasho area is in Rukira commune, and the other part is in Rusumo commune.  Lake Nasho is in Rukira.  Other lakes such as Rwampanza are in Rusumo commune, but the whole area is called the Nasho area, Nasho region.
Q.	Did the 1994 attack affect the Rusumo commune population, the people of Rusumo commune? 
A.	The attack did not last long.  It was immediately repulsed.  So it did not affect Rusumo commune.
Q.	Now, Witness --
MR. KAREGYESA:
We are just seeking a clarification for the record.  The English interpretation we got was "the 1994 attack."  Now, I don't know whether counsel is referring to the 1994 attacks or to the 1991 attacks. 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
I did not follow what counsel for the Prosecution was saying. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution is asking for clarification.  He heard "1994" in his earphones.  Did you mean 1991 or 1994? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Counsel for Defence was asking me whether -- whether the beginning of the war in 1990, there was any attack on Rusumo.  I told him that there was an attack in Rusumo area, that was immediately repulsed by detachment in Mulindi and other soldiers ensuring security in the commune, and that was in 1991.  That is what I stated. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
The problem, Your Honours, wasn't so much with the witness.  It was the question posed by counsel.  His last question, the interpretation we got was 1994.  And maybe counsel could advise whether he was referring to 1994 or to another year. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, can you answer the question, please? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am sorry, I don't understand what we are talking about.  The witness mentioned an attack in 1990, on Byumba in 1990 and an attack on Nasho.  Nasho is shared between Rukira and Rusumo communes in 1991.  And he said that it did not last because it was repulsed by soldiers coming from Mulindi, and I asked the question whether Mulindi is in Rusumo commune, and he said no, Mulindi is in Rukira commune, but Nasho is shared between Rukira and Rusumo communes.  I don't know whether that satisfies the Prosecution, unless there is something I was not clear about. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the -- if I may quote, counsel's question was:  "Did the 1994 attack affect the people of Rusumo commune?"  And the witness answered, and that's when I got up to seek the clarification.  And we may wish to check with the English stenographer. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
On this point, I thank you.  I'm sorry, if I said 1994, or if it heard -- if it came from me, it was a slip of the tongue.  Or it is a mistake someone made down the line.  But I was not talking about 1994.  I'm not here to suggest answers.  I'm only -- the witness has only mentioned 1990 and 1991.  I never said that there was any attack in 1994, and I don't think that anything has been said about 1994 so far.  I hope -- thank you for drawing the attention to this confusion.  I'm sorry.  I did not realise it, and I should like it to be corrected, if such was the case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken due note.  You may continue. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, after the events of 1990 in Byumba, and 1991 in Nasho, can you tell us at what time the change occurred in Rwandan life in the commune and multipartyism in your commune, of which you were bourgmestre?  At what point did multiparty -- was multipartyism introduced? 
A.	Multiparty politics began in Rwanda in 1991.  That is when it replaced the mono-party politics and several political parties were born.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us the names of some of the political parties that saw the light of day in Rusumo with the advent of multiparty politics? 
A.	There was the MRND, the MDR, the PL, PSD, and later, there was the CDR.
Q.	As of 1991, was the bourgmestre still chairman of the party in the commune? 
A.	After the introduction of multiparty politics, the bourgmestre was no longer chairman of the party.  He became a mere authority in the context of multipartyism.  He was not chairman of the party.
Q.	You told the Trial Chamber that when you were appointed bourgmestre in 1983, you were at the same time chairman of the MRND party.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber who was chairman after the advent of multiparty politics, who was the chairman of the MRND party?
A.	Yes.  In 1994, there was someone called Edmund Bugingo, who was chairman of the MRND in the commune, just as all the parties had communal chairmen.
Q.	Witness, you said that you were bourgmestre of Rusumo commune, and you were in Kirehe 
sub-préfecture, I think.  Can you tell us what was the distance between the communal office and the sous-préfecture, sub-préfectural office?
A.	The Kirehe sub-préfecture was established in 1983.  It was made up of two communes, Rukira and Rusumo.  The sub-préfectural office was in Kirehe in Rusumo commune.  The communal office and the sub-préfectural office are very close to each other; I'd say about 300 yards or even less, the distance between the two offices.
Q.	And of you two, you and the sous-préfet, the sub-prefect, what was the hierarchical relationship?
A.	It is obvious the sub-prefect was -- held the superior position, because the bourgmestre is head of a commune and the sous-préfet is responsible for two communes.
Q.	You said before that there were two attacks in 1990 and 1991.  Did they affect the relationship between the members of the population which you administered?  In particular, between the Hutu and the Tutsi. 
A.	Between the attack in 1990 and the small attack in '91, the limited attack in 1991, the situation between Hutu and Tutsi did not alter.  Both ethnic groups had good relationships -- had a good relationship even as they had before the war.
Q.	Witness, as regards Rusumo commune still, how was the administration organised there? 
A.	When you say it is the bourgmestre at the head of the commune, it doesn't mean that it is he that is in charge of all activities.  There are conseillers, there were responsables, so there are various levels.  There is the communal council, composed of the bourgmestre himself and the conseillers, councillors.  There is a committee of experts, the technical committee, which studies communal projects.  There is also the communal development council.  So there is the communal council, consisting of the technical committee.  And when the members of that committee meet, there is what you call the heads of technical departments at communal level.  And when all these people get together in a meeting, that is called the communal development council. 

All those people, therefore, are responsible for the development of the commune. 

Those three councils are responsible for the development of the council, and the three councils are responsible for the administration of the commune.
Q.	Bourgmestre, between the three ethnic components of the Rwandan population, Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, were they all represented within the governing councils of the commune? 
A.	Yes.  Inasmuch as in a commune, there are Hutu, Tutsi who were intellectuals among them, both Hutu and Tutsi are represented.
Q.	Were all the political parties represented within the governing councils of the commune? 
A.	At communal level, we don't speak of political parties, no.  The political parties, that's something else.  But as regards communal administration, the important thing is to see what one person or another will do.  If he's a technician, we see how -- what his is -- what is his expertise.  We don't take into account his political leanings or affiliations.  Political parties have little importance in that case.
Q.	Can you give us the names of some of your staff and their political affiliations?  You said experts, technical experts.  Can you give us some names? 
A.	Yes, I can give you some names.  Among the civil servants of the commune, there were Hutu and Tutsi.  I'll give you the names I remember.  There was an assistant bourgmestre, who was a Tutsi, deputy bourgmestre.  My driver, the communal driver, was Tutsi.  There were Tutsi agronomists, Hitiyise, Birasa, Kanyogote; they were all Tutsi who were administrators in -- at various levels in communal administration. 

In the schooling, there were several Tutsi teachers.  They were very numerous. 

You also mentioned the political parties.  I can tell you -- name some representatives of political parties.  Nutabarungu, he was a Tutsi.  He was deputy bourgmestre, a member of MRND, and he was deputy bourgmestre.  There was Birasa, who was a member of the PL party.  Faustin Ndabikunze also belonged to PL.  The accountant, communal accountant, now I'm talking of a Hutu.  There are various -- do you want me to give you other names or only Tutsi names or others? 

They came -- the employees, staff, local government, they came from -- from several different parties. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Defence is asking the Kinyarwanda booth to give the spelling of the names.

Very good.  Hitiyise, H-I-T-I-Y-I-S-E.  Birasa, B-I-R-A-S-A.  Kanyogote, K-A-N-Y-O-G-O-T-E.  Nutabarungu, N-U-T-A-B-A-R-U-N-G-U.  Ndabikunze, N-D-A-B-I-K-U-N-Z-E. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, interpreter. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, did you hear -- have you ever heard of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how did the local population and yourself react to those accords? 
A.	You see, there was the RPF who wanted to take power in Rwanda, and there was the government that was the government in place.  So the sharing of power was to take place on the basis of the accords negotiated here in Arusha.  We were delighted, because the population did not want people to continue dying.  So, for us, it was something very encouraging, very important.  As and until the accords were signed in August 1993, we were very happy.  We thought the situation would come back to normal.  In other words, we thought that Rwanda would be at peace and the RPF and the government in place would share power.

	1600H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When did you learn of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana?
A.	I learnt of the president's death on the night of the 6th of April.  It was on that night that the information was given.
Q.	And who informed you?
A.	I heard about it over Radio Rwanda which broadcast the information.  I followed this information over the radio.
Q.	And when you heard the information did you leave your house that night?
A.	It was very late.  I heard it at night and I could no longer go out.  I went to bed very sad.  When a head of state dies, you'd understand it's a major problem.  The following day in the morning, we continued listening to various radio stations sadly.
Q.	When you say the following day in the morning, do I suppose you mean on the 7th of April?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What did you do on the 7th of April, Witness?
A.	On the 7th of April, I woke up, sad.  I went to see the sous préfet who didn't live very far from me, and we wondered what we could do in the face of that tragedy.  In the announcements that were made, people were called upon to stay at home and we decided that we should go about a little, even if that meant going about in the neighbourhood to try to console members of the population, to tell them that in spite of the president's death they should be calm and that there was nothing we could do.  And that is what we did on the 7th of April.
Q.	On that same date, did the authorities of the Republic of Rwanda come to see you in Rusumo commune?
A.	No.  We were visited by no authorities in Rusumo.  I was alone with the sous préfet.  The other
high-ranking authorities of the state were sad, but they did not come to Rusumo.
Q.	On the 6th of April 1994, did you have phones in Rusumo?
A.	Well, that was one of the problems I had.  Rusumo commune was not hooked up to the telephone network, neither did we have electricity. All we had was a radio, and we could only -- we could not communicate with correspondence in Kibongo or in Kigali.  We were isolated.
Q.	Prior to the date of the 6th of April 1994, did you receive in Rusumo superior government officials?  Between the 1st and the 6th of April, were you visited by government or political officials in Rusumo?
A.	Between the 1st and the 6th of April 1994, no hierarchically superior authorities visited me in my commune.
Q.	In March 1994, did you receive any such officials?
A.	No, none of such officials visited me.
Q.	Did they visit you in February or in January?
A.	No, no, no; since the beginning of that year, I was not visited by any of such officials.
Q.	Between the 1st of January 1994 and the 6th of April 1994, did you travel to Kigali?
A.	No.  No, I did not travel to Kigali.  I only travelled as far as Kibongo.  I believe I visited Kibongo in April.  I didn't go any further than that.
Q.	You stated that on the 7th of April authorities from Kigali, that is, government officials did not visit Rusumo.  Did they visit Rusumo on the 8th of April, that is, the following day?
A.	On the 8th of April no government officials visited our commune.  However, I and the sous préfet attended a security meeting convened by the préfet.  He had organised a security meeting inviting all the bourgmestres to discuss the security situation in the préfecture.
Q.	Witness, what happened at that meeting of the 8th?
A.	The said security meeting took place in Kibongo.  It was chaired by the préfet himself.  We studied the security situation in the various communes.  Each bourgmestre gave a report on the situation in his commune.  I spoke about Rusumo.  I had nothing to say because nothing particular happened there, but the bourgmestres of the other communes, or at least some of them, made mention of disturbances in their préfectures.  After giving our account of the situation, directives, clear instructions were given to the bourgmestres with regard to the conduct they should adopt in the various communes.  We passed down the same instructions to the conseiller who, in turn, had to inform the members of the population of the decisions taken at that meeting.
Q.	You have just said that that meeting was attended by the sous préfet and the bourgmestre of the préfecture of Kibongo.  And you said that some bourgmestres made mention of disturbances in their areas of jurisdiction.  Now, I would like to ask you whether those bourgmestres gave those reports in public.
A.	Yes.  Each bourgmestre spoke at that meeting, the venue of that meeting, where the security meeting on the préfecture was held.  They spoke about those problems.  They mentioned people who had died in Rukira.  We heard that refugees had come from Murambi, from Byumba préfecture, and mention was made of house plundered in Kigarama.  And they mentioned people, who had fled in Rotunda, and these people had fled from the houses that had been looted, and the owners of those houses had sought refuge in the Rotunda parish, which is to say, that each bourgmestre gave a report on the security situation in his commune.  And what I said was that we did not have any problem in our commune because security was maintained there. 
Q.	Witness, who chaired that meeting?
A.	That meeting was chaired by the préfet of Kibongo.
Q.	Can you give his name to the Chamber?
A.	The préfet's name was Ruzindana Godfois.
Q.	Witness, when you went to the meeting held on the 8th, who was your driver?
A.	My driver was Ndabikunze, Faustin.  He is the person who drove the car to Kibongo.
Q.	And in Kibongo préfecture, in what hall was that meeting held?
A.	As usual, the meeting was held in the conference hall of the préfectural office.
Q.	Did you attend that meeting in the conference hall with your driver?  Was your driver allowed to get into the hall?
A.	No.  Listen, the driver had nothing to do with a security meeting on the préfecture.  He stayed close to the vehicle with his colleagues.  Only those who had been invited to attend the meeting, that is, the sous préfet and the bourgmestres took part in that meeting, of course.
Q.	Who convened that meeting?
A.	It was the préfet who convened that meeting.
Q.	On your way to that meeting did you encounter any personal problems?
A.	On my way to Kibongo, when I got to Birenga commune, an area called Kibayi, I found a roadblock and the people manning the roadblock stopped me and they asked me where I was going.  I told them I was going to attend a meeting in Kibongo.  And they told me I could not pass.  And I asked them, "How?  How come?  I am the bourgmestre of Rusumo commune".  And when they had ascertained that what I was saying was true, they allowed me to pass.  And they said anybody ought to stay at home, nobody is supposed to move about.  "And why are you going -- where are you going?"  So I spoke to the authorities and I told them I was the bourgmestre of Rusumo, I was going to a meeting, please let me pass and they allowed me to pass.  That was the only little incident I can mention.  I had no other problems.
Q.	You said that that incident occurred in which commune?
A.	I said that it was in Birenga commune.
Q.	Can you now tell the Chamber the recommendations that were adopted at the meeting held on the 8th at the Kibongo préfecture?
A.	The decisions arrived at that meeting were as follows -- or, rather, they were broadcast over national radio.  And those decisions had to do with instructions to the bourgmestres to make sure they ensured security, they provided for the security in their communes.  They had to organise security meetings, several security meetings, particularly in secteurs that were encountering -- that were the scene of disturbances. They had to organise meetings aimed at ensuring reconciliation between members of the population.  Displaced persons had to come back.  The bourgmestres had to do their best to resettle them in their homes, and in a peaceful manner.  

We also decided that curfews were to be instituted and was supposed to start from 6 p.m. -- from
6 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Members of the population had to organise night rounds in an organised manner, and these night rounds were to be led by members of communities in the cellules or other designated persons.  The choice of these people did not have to be discriminatory on racial grounds or on grounds of -- on political lines.  

All members of the population had to take part in these night rounds in order to provide for the security of the population.  And if ever any individuals disturbed public order, they had to be referred to the public authorities and punished accordingly.  

Members of the security committee of the cellule had to decide to move about to visit the areas where disturbances were occurring and to assist communal authorities in organising meetings aimed at reconciling members of the population.  

This was a commitment which the préfectural security committee had to take.  We also decided that all kinds of banditry had to be forbidden.  We were aware of the fact that certain individuals, under the pretext of the president's death, or people encountering difficulties, were attacking shops to loot goods, and we decided that the traders had the right or the responsibility to organise themselves to protect their goods in order to prevent such criminals from stealing their property.  

These are the decisions that were taken at the meeting and that were passed down to the people over the national radio.
Q.	Witness, apart from the préfet, the sous préfecture and the bourgmestres, were there any other participants at that meeting?
A.	It was a security meeting.  Only members of the security committee and the bourgmestres who had been invited attended that meeting.  There were no other participants.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we have received from the Prosecutor disclosure of an audio cassette relating to that meeting of the 8th of April 1994, which was held in Kibongo préfecture.  We would respectfully request you to allow us to file this document as number -- document No. 7 for the records.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you have any objection to the request made by the Defence with regard to tendering this cassette as Exhibit 7? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
	Your Honours, the witness hasn't sufficiently identified the transcript that counsel wants to tender into evidence.  Maybe we should go through that formality first.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you mentioned a cassette you received from the Prosecutor.  Could you elaborate what the contents of this document are? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It is an audio cassette KT00.  These are the Prosecutor's reference: K0940(RSF)K24.  This was disclosed by the Prosecutor and had to do with the security meeting held on the 8th of April 1994, and chaired by the préfet of Kibongo préfecture, Mr. Ruzindana Godfois.  And regard -- with regard to which -- and Gacumbitsi participated in that meeting.  These are the references of the Prosecution, Madam President: (K0163524) last paragraph K01 -- K01 -- 0163525.  These are the last paragraphs of the transcript, Madam President.  

We received the cassette from the Prosecution.  We transcribed it and -- and that is what we are tendering today as exhibit -- as Defence Exhibit No. 7.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do we consider that -- do you consider the identification sufficient? 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, it wasn't the identification given by counsel that I was contesting.  What I'm saying is that -- or what I'm opposing is whether the Accused witness has established sufficient link to what he is saying and to the document that counsel seeks to enter unto the record.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we do not object to the fact that the fact that the witness should read the document and tell you whether this document is related to the said meeting or not.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The presiding Judge's microphone, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can you please kindly show us the document and also give it to the Accused.  

Do you have several copies of it, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Is there an English translation of this available? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Honour, this is a document from the Prosecution and we prefer to leave it as it is.  It is a document we received from the Prosecution, and I would not want it to be said that we changed any word in it.  That is the form in which we received the document.  Thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
	Your Honours, if counsel could be kind enough to have the Prosecution get a copy of the document.  He has passed around a document and up to this point, he hasn't given us a copy to establish whether it's the same copy that was disclosed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Prosecutor, even myself, the Defence counsel, I do not have another copy left.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, have you had time to look at the document which is in Kinyarwanda? 

MR. KAREGYESA:
	All I can confirm, Your Honours, is that it has referencing from the Office of the Prosecutor, but I'm unable to read this language.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You acknowledge that this document comes from the Office of the Prosecutor.  At this stage, do you accept that it should be tendered into evidence, or would you want the Accused to read the document so that it can be translated into a language that we all master?
MR. KAREGYESA:
It's really up to the Defence and how they intend to go about their case, Your Honour.  I don't think it's appropriate for me to show them how to go about it.  But as you will, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you will not object to the fact that this document be tendered into evidence?  You have identified it as a document coming from the Office of the Prosecutor.  That is the question I'm putting to you.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
What I was trying to say, Your Honours, is that we haven't reached that stage of having it admitted unto the record, and that's what counsel for the Defence has to work on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Defence counsel has already requested that the document be admitted into evidence.  

Mr. Kouengoua, do you have something to add?  Do you want to question the Accused on this document?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I think this is an open session.  The Accused is giving testimony in his language.  If the witness was not in agreement with what the counsel is saying, he would have objected.  He has not said anything, he has no reacted, so I supposed that the Accused is not opposed to me filing this document as Defence exhibit.  On the contrary, the person who to object to it is the Prosecutor.  I believe that if the Prosecutor does not object to the document being admitted into evidence since he has identified the document as coming from his office, logically, this means that this document should be admitted into the records, Madam President.  Unless, the witness, if he has enough strength to read it.  Well, I do not object to the Accused reading the document.  I personally would not be uncomfortable with that if the Accused wishes to read the document, except that by so doing we should also take into consideration what is on the wall. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I suppose Defence counsel is referring to the time. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thought it necessary to say that this document comes from the OTP.  If it is the Accused who has to translate this document, it will be a waste of time and that is -- we would be losing time and that is what we want to avoid.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Accused, have you been able to look at this document?  Do you have any opinion on this document? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI: 
	Thank you, Madam President.  Indeed, I have browsed through the document in French.  I noticed that it contains the decisions to which I had referred to, the decisions of the security meeting mentioned in the report.  It is also mentioned that it is the préfet of Kibongo, Mr. Godfois Ruzindana, who chaired the meeting.  In my opinion, this document corresponds to what was decided in the said meeting.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Is that document in French or in Kinyarwanda, the one you are looking at? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
	The version I have before me is in Kinyarwanda.
MR. KAREGYESA:
At this stage we have no objection, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document is admitted into evidence and marked -- 0163524.  It is marked Defence Exhibit D. 07.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Your Honour.
	(Exhibit No. D. 07 was admitted)
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, you've just explained to the Court what happened at the meeting on the 8th and the resolutions that were taken at that meeting.  On that same day, did you return to Rusumo commune?
A.	Yes, on that very day I returned to Rusumo commune.
Q.	On the same day did you start implementing the recommendations of the meeting in Kibongo?
A.	I took immediate steps to convene the conseillers communaux to a meeting to tell them about the recommendations of the security meeting which held in Kibongo so that they in turn, they should be in a position to tell the members of the population the recommendations.  

The following day, on the 9th of April, I convened them to a meeting and informed them of the decisions of the meeting.  I asked them to see to it that in their respective secteurs security reigned.  I told them, "Return to your respective secteurs and ask those under your authority to ensure security in accordance with the resolutions of the préfectural meeting."  This is the message I passed on to them and they left.
Q.	Witness, on 8th April 1994, at the meeting of the security council of the Kibongo préfecture, did the recommendations include the distribution of arms?  Were you given arms as part of the recommendations?
A.	Arms for what purpose?  Are you talking of guns?  We did not talk about any -- we did not talk about any other thing apart from security.  How could we have been talking of security and yet at the same time distribute weapons?
Q.	The meeting you convened on your return from Kibongo, did it take place?  If yes, when?
A.	The meeting held on the 9th.  It was on the 9th of April in the communal office that I chaired the meeting.
Q.	Can you tell the Court the persons whom you convened to the meeting?
A.	I convened the conseillers of the communes.  All of them turned up except one.  I think it was the conseiller of the Gisenyi secteur.  He was the only person absent, all the other conseillers were present.
Q.	Witness, from the date the president was assassinated on the 6th of April until the date of the -- until the date of the 9th of April when you held your meeting, was there insecurity in Rusumo commune?
A.	Can you please repeat the question?  I did not clearly understand it.
Q.	I repeat: the president died on the 6th of April.  You held a meeting at the commune office on the 9th.  Between these two dates, were there disturbances in Rusumo commune?
A.	As I was going to explain during the security meeting that held on the 8th in Kibongo, there were no disturbances between the two dates that you have mentioned.  There were no disturbances in the Rusumo commune between those two dates.
Q.	The conseiller you said did not attend the meeting, did he give you the reasons for his absence?
A.	Subsequently, I knew the reasons why he was absent.  At the end of the meeting someone came and informed me that the conseiller in question was unable to attend the meeting because he had to solve a problem concerning one of his subjects who had a security problem.  And while he was solving that problem, he was late.  And even I, after the meeting, I went there to find out what happened, and the conseiller in question explained me what a happened.  

I confirmed that it was not acceptable for acts of violence to be committed against anyone under the pretext that the president of the republic had been killed.  So I confirmed that.  So after the meeting which I chaired, I went to the place.
Q.	And what was the problem which this conseiller de secteur had?
A.	People from the Gisenyi secteur had committed acts of injustice against someone who had been accused of being an accomplice of the RPF.  They told the conseiller that they had suspicions regarding that person.  They wanted to commit acts of violence against him, and when I arrived, I confirmed what the conseiller had just stated by saying that it was unacceptable to threaten anyone or to commit any acts of injustice against anyone under the pretext that that person was an accomplice of the RPF.
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court who came to inform you of the situation which existed in Gisenyi, if you remember?
A.	It was not in Gisenyi the préfecture but, rather, it was in the Gisenyi secteur.  So the person who came to inform me of this is called -- I believe he was called Pierre.  Yes, Pierre.  Pierre told me, "Do you know that the situation in that place is not good?  I believe that someone wants to -- someone is about to be hurt wrongly."  And I did not want any incident to occur in Rusumo, so I immediately rushed to that place.  Therefore, it is a certain Pierre who came to inform me of that situation.
Q.	Witness, in your capacity as bourgmestre of Rusumo, you convened a meeting which you said held on the 9th.  Did communal drivers also attend that meeting at the same time as the secteur conseillers.
A.	The drivers were outside and those who were invited to the meeting were the communal conseillers.
Q.	We are referring to the date of the 9th.  Apart from that incident, was there something else which occurred in your commune, Witness?
A.	I wanted security to reign throughout the Rusumo commune but, unfortunately, that was not the case.  There was an incident which greatly saddened me.  It occurred in the night of the 9th to the 10th.  The house of a certain Birasa of the Nyamugali secteur was torched, was burnt.  So the conseiller sent someone to tell me that the house had been burnt.  I immediately brought the matter to the attention of the prosecutor's office.  I asked the prosecutor's assistant to accompany me, to accompany me to the place.  It was the prosecutor in the Kirehe commune.  I told him that if he was busy doing something else he should accompany me.  He accepted, so we went to the Rumugali secteur (phonetic) to take stock of the situation.  When we arrived there we met the conseiller who was holding a meeting.  And, indeed, the house had been burnt but the owner of the house had fled.  So the conseiller had gathered the members of the population for the purpose of carrying out an investigation.   We helped in the investigation in order to be able to identify the culprits.  We asked him to continue with the investigation and to inform us of the outcome thereof because we were going to see what security situation was in other localities.  

We went to the Gisenyi secteur and also other villages which I mentioned earlier.  We went there to find out what the security situation was.  We moved about, and on return, the conseiller told me that the investigation had not ended.  So this is the incident which took place, that is the house which was burnt and the situation saddened me greatly.  It occurred on the 10th.
Q.	At what time did you return to your house on that day, the day of the 10th?
A.	The Rusumo commune is a very vast commune.  It is therefore difficult to monitor the situation everywhere; in the forest, in the various neighbourhoods and so on.  For this reason, we returned in the evening at about 6 p.m.
Q.	Were you with the same driver, that is the same driver who accompanied you to Kibongo on the 8th?
A.	Yes.  I was with the same driver.
Q.	What happened on the 11th?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the witness specify the time when he went there?  He specified the hour, or the time when they returned, but can he specify when they went to Nyamugali?
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
	We went in the morning at about 11 o'clock.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	What happened on the 11th in your commune, Witness?
A.	I had difficulties bringing the situation under control in that secteur.  Moreover, the same group which torched the house of Birasa, which group had not been identified, that same group in the night of 10th to 11th April, torched other houses, burnt other houses.  They burnt the house of a certain Pierre Karemera, and a certain Karanganwa, nicknamed Kiki.  I was aware -- I became aware of this the following day, the 11th.  It was a Monday and I informed the assistant prosecutor.  I asked him to assist me so that we go and verify the situation that prevailed in the Nyamugali secteur.  We carried out a short investigation.  We went to Karemera's house.  We went to Karanganwa, alias Kiki, and we carried out an investigation.  

A young man called Gashambagara told us, "I'm going to tell you what happened.  Look for a certain Kamenyero.  It is his group that is responsible for this act".  We looked for the Kamenyero who named other people, and we arrested them.  After their arrest -- there were people who had been injured in Kamenyero's house.  Sisters took them -- some reverend sisters took them to Kibongo hospital, and I arrested the criminals.  I took them to the market square Nyamugali.  This was the market day; it as a certain Monday.  I held a meeting in Nyamugali, and the people who had come to the market attended the meeting and also people in the neighbourhood.  I held a security meeting.  I told them what happened in their secteurs; I told them what happened in Birasa's house and also in Karemera's house, as well as Kiki's house.  I clearly underscored that I would not want such criminals to continue perpetrating their acts.  The participants at the meeting also demonstrated -- showed their indignation.  They said that certain persons wanted to destabilise the security situation in our secteur.  So I took the criminals away and locked them up in the communal jail.  I transferred the case file to the deputy prosecutor who was there.  So this is the situation which prevailed in the course of that day, that is the 11th.  So, in fact, I was saddened by the acts of these criminals who wanted to destabilise the security situation in Rusumo commune.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Interpreter, can you please spell the proper nouns that have just been called by the witness.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Gashambagara, G-A-S-H-A-M-B-A-G-A-R-A, Gashambagara; Karemera, K-A-R-E-M-E-R-A, Karemera; Karanganwa, K-A-R-A-N-G-A-N-W-A; Kiki, K-I-K-I;  Kamenyero, K-A-M-E-N-Y-E-R-O; Nyamugali, N-Y-A-M-U-G-A-L-I.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Interpreter. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, the 10th, the 11th, you have said that there were disturbances at Birasa's, Kiki's and Karemera's.  Were there any deaths in those three families?
A.	No, there weren't any deaths but there were injured.
Q.	At this stage, can you tell us what -- to which ethnic group those people belonged?
A.	If -- let's begin with Birasa.  Birasa was Tutsi -- is Tutsi.  Karemera is Tutsi.  Karanganwa, nicknamed Kiki, is Hutu -- was Hutu.
Q.	Witness, I should like to ask you once again to speak slowly.  The court reporters are having difficulty in following you.  So please try and keep the speed slow.  

So we were on the 11th.  Now, on the 12th, did anything happen in your commune on the 12th?
A.	In the night of the 11th to the 12th, another incident occurred that cost lives in Gatore secteur.  Bandits attacked the house of someone by the name of Nkurinzinza and killed four people there, on the 12th.  I was informed of the deaths, the death of the people killed in that secteur, and I hastened there to check out the situation.  There were a lot of the people at Nkurinzinza's residence and I asked what had happened.  They informed me people had come during the night and had hacked up Nkurinzinza's family with machetes.  But the assailants were not arrested until the next morning.  The secteur conseiller was there.  He had been summoned.  I immediately asked the conseiller and the responsable of the cellule to ask the local inhabitants to participate in a security meeting at Ngatore secteur office.  The meeting was held.  And we tried to find those bandits.  

After a few hours, we were able to determine the identity of the assailants, and it was a group led by someone called Augustine Nguzuzami (phonetic), alias Marishal (phonetic).  We sought the group, arrested them and they were taken to the meeting and shown to the population.  They told us before going to kill Nkurinzinza's they had attacked the residence of one Evariste Kamanzi, and that they had stolen property, as well as in other residences in Ngatore secteur.  

Having noted that there was also the problem of thieving, I summoned the judicial police of the commune to try and find where those stolen property had been hidden.  I sent a vehicle to get him and I asked him to search the places where the goods stolen in a trading centre had been hidden.  And we did indeed find the property, including Evariste Kamanzi's motorcycle.  We inventoried the stolen property and we placed it in a room at the Ngatore secteur offices, and I said that the property must be returned to their owners who would come to claim it.  

So, I arrested the people who had committed those crimes and I handed them over to the prosecutor's office.  All the evil doers, whether Nyamugali, Ngatore that I arrested, I made the report that I submitted to my hierarchical superior, notably the sous préfet of Kirehe for him to know, be aware of problems of insecurity in my commune.  So those people were put in the communal jail.  

In the afternoon I stayed in Ngatore secteur, which is a big secteur.  I stayed there to investigate the security situation and I went home at -- in the evening after my check.  That's it.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Witness.  

Madam President, Your Worships (sic), as it is gone 5 p.m., I don't know whether we couldn't take a short break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much longer do you think you would be taking, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I was on the 12th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I'm asking you how long will it last?  Because you've been at it for nearly three hours now, more than two and half hours.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
We are now on points of fact.  I think perhaps within two hours the examination-in-chief will have been finished.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Two hours more?  That seems a bit long.  Then there is cross-examination, and the Judges' questions.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Could I ask you what time you intend to adjourn because that is also important.  We have to take everything into account.  You see that I have left aside many other aspects of the matter so that we go straight into the facts.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But I think at this juncture you should tell us how much longer you need to finish the 
examination-in-chief because two hours, I believe, is a bit long.  You told us it was to be three hours, the examination-in-chief.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
No.  Yesterday, madam -- three hours was in case we are starting on Monday to finish on Tuesday or even Monday.  I said it yesterday.  You can check the transcripts.  I said that I would have liked to begin on Monday and I was told but if we start on Monday how do you think examination-in-chief would last.  I said three hours, and you said, "No, but we are starting tomorrow."  "Well, if it's tomorrow, well, I will not commit myself to three hours".  And I think it must have been taken note of by everyone. That is what I said, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But I never told for my part that we were going to add two more hours to those three hours.

We will adjourn for 10 minutes, and then we will work until 18:15 because some people are observing Ramadan and must go home to break the fast.  So we will ask you to see how much time there is left because we cannot give you two hours more, otherwise we'll never finish in time.  

So please try to limit yourself to an hour, an hour and a half.  Please make that effort.  I think we lost a lot of time in the first part.  It was too long.  So please try and see if we can't finish in an hour and half.  We are going to have a 10-minute break now.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, before we adjourn I should very respectfully like to submit.  I think this is the first case I've  handled here, but Gacumbitsi is the first defendant to testify in a half day, and my witnesses only testified in the afternoon, whereas from the Prosecution, we had witnesses from 8 o'clock in the morning to 5:30 in the evening, and over two days.  So please take that into consideration, madam.  It is the Accused we are speaking of and it is nonetheless in the interest of the Defence and of the Accused to explain a certain number of things.  And I am saying a day like today, we've only got -- had half a day at our disposal.  I should not like the Trial Chamber to lose sight of this fact, whereas others had a whole day at their disposal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken account of that.  We will now adjourn for 10 minutes.
	(Court recessed at 1717H)
	(Pages 17 to 29 by Gifty C. Harding)








	(Court resumed at 1730H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  

Mr. Kouengoua, you may continue. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you confirm before the Chamber that between the 6th of April and the 10th of April 1994, there were still no disturbances in Rusumo commune; is that correct? 
A.	I testified that between the 6th and the 9th, there were no disturbances, but subsequently there were attacks by bandits in Birasa, at Karamera's home.  I think I talked about that. 
Q.	Witness, do you know a certain Jacques Rook? 
A.	You mean Jacques Brooks?  Are you referring to Jacques Brooks?
Q.	Do you know someone by that name?
A.	Yes, I know someone called Jacques Brooks.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Brooks is written as follows -- he was a reverend father at Rusumo Parish.  Brooks is spelt as follows: B-R-O-O-K-S.  And Jacques is spelt as follows: J-A-C-Q-U-E-S. 

Madam President, Your Honours, this priest published an article in Review called -- the log No. 177.  The article deals with the events of April 1994 in Rusumo, and the said article was published in August/September 1994.  The article underscores that the author is called Fr. Jacques Brooks, African Missionary (Vicar in Rusumo Parish, Kibungo).  This is what the author says in the article.  Until --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can counsel take that a little bit more slowly, please?  Can Counsel -- we don't have the paper he is reading from.
MR. KAREGYESA:
(Microphone not activated)...it should come from the witness, if he has any knowledge. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we understand that it is an objection by the Prosecutor, namely, that you yourself cannot give evidence.  It is for the witness to give evidence. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I have not given any evidence.  The witness testified before you regarding the date of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, and at least on four occasions, I asked him up to that point whether there were disturbances in his commune, and he has answered, "no".  
I have found a document in which someone says -- someone has made it public.  Someone made a publication in September 1994.  I asked him if he knows the person, and he says, he was a reverend father at the Catholic mission in Rusumo.  And the person says that up to the 10th, Sunday, 10th April, there were no disturbances in Rusumo.  That is all I am saying; I have not said something else. And I am asking the registrar to present to the members of the Court what I am saying.  I have just found an article which corroborates what the witness just said.  It is not me.  I have not given any evidence.  I just find that there is a document which corroborates what the witness has just testified.  I do not know what the Prosecutor is objecting to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, if you want to tender this document into evidence, there is a procedure for doing that.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That is the procedure you have started.  I requested the registry to collect the document and before he collects it, it was necessary for me to identify the document before giving the document to the registry, so that upon reading it, you will verify that what I am saying is what is mentioned in the document that I have handed to you. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the procedure is entirely inappropriate.  The witness is the best evidence of what may or may not have happened during the period referred to.  Now to bring a newspaper article does not corroborate at all, we submit, what the witness has said.  We are denied the opportunity, 
Your Honours, of cross-examining the author of this article. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours - 

Madam President, this exhibit was disclosed to the Prosecutor, and it was filed on the 15th of September 2003.  It was in the list of documents we filed, and it had an exhibit No. 72010.  According to the registry reference given to us, this document is not from us; it was disclosed to us -- it was disclosed to the Prosecutor and to the Chamber as well.  It is not today.  And on 15th of September 2003, we disclosed it.  It is not something new and the Prosecutor had it within the prescribed time limit, and all parties as well as the Chamber, received disclosure of this document -- of this exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the problem which arises is that you did not make mention of those persons before the Chamber.  Why and how then can we make reference to this document whereas it does not concern the Accused or the name of the Accused is not on it?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, it does not have to do with the Accused.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But if you want to examine this person, how do you go about it, because that person is not one of the witnesses on your list?  How can we cross-examine the person and verify his identify?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I do not agree with the remarks made by the Prosecutor.  The cassette that was disclosed to me, the author will not come here.  The documents that were disclosed to me, the authors will not come here.  It has to do with Rule 89.  

The Accused comes here to testify to certain things which we discovered -- and we discover it was mentioned by somebody who was not concerned with the trial in 1994. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it a valid newspaper?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we find it? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes.  The question that the Prosecutor should have asked was to -- it should have been to the effect that the journal -- the newspaper does not exist, it is not credible.  This is what the problem is, 
Madam President.  

The authors of most of the documents we have been dealing with have not been coming here.  We are dealing with a rule regarding all elements of evidence.  If the Chamber finds that these documents can shed light on what we are saying, they should be brought -- they should be tendered here.  I don't believe all the authors of most of the articles, particularly articles in newspapers have come here.  You will remember that on the 29th of July, the Prosecutor disclosed a copy of a Kangura newspaper, and at the time, the newspaper was not a credible newspaper before this Chamber.  And I disclosed this in September and the Prosecutor did not object to the tendering of that exhibit.  
JUDGE REDDY:
Honourable learned Prosecutor, are you really objecting to this?  I mean, this is a worthless piece of paper.  For the sake of progress, why don't you let it go in, because it has no probative value at all?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Precisely, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Under any rule known to law. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Precisely, Your Honours, and all I wanted to do was to go on record, to say that the content of this document doesn't affect my case at all.  However, however, it is an insidious way.  Why have we spent the last three months in trial if newspapers could be admitted onto the record as evidence?  That is why the Rules of this Tribunal require oral evidence.  I am against the principle, but the content is useless as far as I am concerned.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President's microphone is on.  Would Your Honours switch off their microphones, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, would you like to tender that document into the record, or what do you intend to do with this document?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
We want to tender it as an exhibit, Madam President.  And we respectfully request you to accept it on the basis of Article 89, paragraph C.  This Rule does not allow the Prosecutor to appreciate the value of the document.  The Prosecutor is not allowed to say that this document it not normal or is not credible.  It is not up to him to appreciate the validity of the exhibit, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We may admit it, but, of course, we will assess its probative value. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It is your right and it is under your jurisdiction to do so, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you like to examine the witness on this document?  Have you given him a copy of the document?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I don't know whether the Prosecutor deemed it necessary to give it to him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Right.  
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, would you allow the Defence to tender this document as an exhibit, as a Defence exhibit, as part of this trial?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, have you seen this document?  Have you seen that document?
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Yes.  I have received that document in French.  The contents of the document correspond to what I said in my answer.  By the way, it has to do with what the priest saw in his parish.  I have nothing against tendering this document because the contents of it corroborate what I have said with regard to the fact that I tried to provide for the security of my commune.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, would you please turn on your mike. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we are admitting this document entitled "The events of 1994", and it is D10/08717, and it is tendered under Exhibit D. 08.
(Exhibit No. D. 08 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Counsel.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, just as part of the exhibit labelling, if you could please note that these are extracts, it is in brackets, top right-hand corner of the first page.  These are extracts of a document whose authenticity you may wish to follow up under Rule 89(B).  Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't have to do so because it is already mentioned on the first page of the article. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, we were on the date of the 12th.  The wrongdoers you arrested in Nyamugali and those you arrested in Gatore, did they remain in the communal jail? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  In Rusumo commune, the situation was deteriorating increasingly, and the people arrested were not pleased about having been arrested.  Criminals like them were not happy with the decision I had taken.  So they wanted to come and release those people.  At the time when the prosecutor's office was preparing a file on them, they came and insulted the bourgmestre, the sous préfet and the authorities, saying that they were accomplices of the RPF, and that they were being paid by the RPF, and that they had imprisoned a large number of Hutus, and in so doing, they created confusion.  People from Barera in the north of the country in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures were the root cause of the insecurity in Rusumo commune.  They came in large numbers from rural areas, saying that the authorities were accomplices, and that they were acting like those who had attacked the country, and they had come to release their relatives who had been imprisoned.  I was still in Gatore to check out the security situation.  They came insulting the bourgmestre, but they did not find me on the spot.  

There was a wise man who said -- who told the sous préfet, "I have not seen the bourgmestre.  There is a group of assailants who came threatening to destroy the communal office, and that if need be, they were going to kill the authorities, inform the sous préfet".  And he went through and left.  The assailants came to free their men.  The sous préfet was afraid because he himself was not held in high esteem by those people.  He was also persecuted like Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi.  The people in the prosecutor's office were afraid and they were saying that the commune was going to be destroyed.  

Furthermore, Kibungo was not welcoming prisoners.  They took the decision to release those bandits and, they were indeed released and they left.  

Subsequently, I saw the sous préfet and I asked him: "Why did you release those people?"  And he told me, "Do you know that the situation became increasingly difficult to control?  One thing is true, once the situation will have been restored, when the situation returns to normal, we will arrest them."  So they did not remain in jail. 
Q.	On what date did those events occur? 
A.	On the 12th.  On the 12th, in the afternoon, when I went to Gatore. 
Q.	Witness, how many times did you go to Gatore on the 12th? 
A.	Only once, but I spent some time there to try to solve the security problem.  I went there only once, and I did not spend much time there. 
Q.	Did you stay in the same place? 
A.	No, I moved about.  As you would imagine, the secteur is very vast.  If you look at the map of Rusumo commune, you will find that this secteur goes as far as the border with Burundi.  Between Birenga and that secteur there is a large valley in which people from Gitarama, Kibuye and Gisenyi live.  They live in a region called Rotunde.  We intended to make it a commune, but it didn't work.  But that was what we had intended to do.  So I went to that region which is on the banks of the Akagera to try to assess the security situation. So I used to move about in that region. 
Q.	What did you do on the 13th? 
A.	The 13th was a Wednesday.  Still within the Akagera valley, very close to the farming communities near the Nyankuraje cellule, bandits attacked the house of a certain Kirushya Mabugo.  His house was burnt down and two people died in the house.  They were burnt, including his wife.  I heard about it and I hastened to the cellule to take stock of the situation.  When we got there, we arrested people.  There were lots of thugs hanging around who came to the house in which the people had been burnt, and the family had told me, he was lucky to flee.  And when we tried to conduct the investigations, we obtained no relevant information, but we referred the matter to the Prosecutor's office, and it carried out an investigation and managed to arrest those responsible.  

I left that area to go back to the communal office, and I arrived in the office at about 1 p.m.  When I got to Nyakarambi in the commercial centre close to the communal office, I encountered once more a very tense situation, people who had left peasant farms and who had come accusing us of being accomplices of the RPF.  They were also people from Kibungo sent by a certain Cyasa, a very, very wicked extremist, who had a group of Interahamwes working or operating under his authority, and he had heard that Gacumbitsi was imprisoning Hutus; that Gacumbitsi was sheltering in his commercial building Tutsis.  I had a building which was leased to traders, and Tutsis and Hutus were renting that building.  Those people who were against me and were attacking me, were saying that, "He is supporting Tutsis and he is even sheltering them in that building".  And that is why that group was looking for me.  When I heard about that, I asked where they were coming from.  I carried out my own investigations, and I was told that those people hailed from Kibungo, that they were emissaries of Cyasa.  They asked me to act immediately, otherwise my house was going to be destroyed.  At the same time, there were refugees coming from Byumba, fleeing the fighting.  They had come right to Kibungo.  The RPF was pursuing them in order to kill them.  And on the 11th and on the 12th, they arrived in Rusumo commune.  I am referring to those refugees.  Those refugees were also in Nyakarambi, and people were saying:  "Gacumbitsi, you are the bourgmestre of Rusumo.  Be careful, you know rumours can lead to very serious situations, we are from Byumba.  We have come from afar.  We have lost relatives; we have abandoned our properties.  When we put you on guard against these kinds of misfortunes, you should be careful.  You shouldn't take things lightly.  We know you are the bourgmestre."  So I wondered, and I asked myself, "What should I do? These people want to destroy my commune.  What should I do to prevent them from doing so?"  

So I went to see the people who were renting my house, and I presented the situation to them, and I told them I was between the hammer and the anvil.  I was caught between the hammer and the anvil, and I told them that the Cyasa emissaries wanted to destroy my house under the pretext that I was sheltering Tutsis.  And I recall that the CND was the building housing the national assembly.  The CND means National Development Council, which was the national assembly at the time.  And they were comparing my house to the CND.  Why?  Because the CND at the time was sheltering a battalion of the RPF.  My house was compared to the CND building that was sheltering or housing an RPF battalion.  So I told them, "Gentlemen, I wouldn't like you to get killed.  Pack your things and flee.  When they come, they will not find you.  I myself, I will go and hide in order that they shouldn't find me." 

Among the people I was speaking to, there were some people who had sought refuge in that building, hoping to go back to their homes when peace would return.  So there were Tutsis from Rukira, from Birenga, who had come to seek shelter in that building pending when the security would become normal, and they understood when I spoke to them and they left.  They went to Tanzania.  Only one of them, a woman, for that matter, who had a junior sister who had a trading shop near the Nyakarambi centre, that woman did not leave; she went to live with her junior sister who was renting a house belonging to Kananura, Jonathan.  All the others fled.  They later on returned, of course, and they went back to Rwanda. 

I am sorry.  I will continue explaining what happened on that day.  At that time, my driver Ndabikunze did not work.  He did not work on that day.  He came to tell me that the situation had become critical.  He asked me, "What do I do, boss, because I am also a Tutsi?  And I told him, "Listen my friend, I am in the same situation as you are.  Everyone for himself, try to save your skin and I am trying to -- I am going to do the same thing.  If you can go to Tanzania, do so, and I will also do what I can because I am in hot water.  I am accused of being a Tutsi who wants to exterminate the Hutus.  They want to destroy my house.  They are looking for me.  I am being given all sorts of labels.  So I cannot do anything for you.  Do what you can to save your skin." 

Mr. Ndabikunze on that same day, in the night of that Wednesday, he crossed the border to go to Tanzania.  And I went to see the sous préfet.  I asked him:  "Mr. Sous préfet, it is you who is my immediate superior, how can you protect me, I risk being killed?"  I told him there was someone who died, he was a colleague of the bourgmestre of the commune of Kinigi in the Ruhengeri préfecture.  He was killed in the same manner.  He arrested people, he was eliminated.  He died, and I thought my own time, my own day will come.  So I told my sous préfet, "Listen I am not ready to sacrifice myself, I am going to run away".  And the sous préfet told me, "Well, we are going to see.  We are going to see how we can restore order.  I am going to talk about this to the préfet. That's it".  

I also started hiding myself gradually.  I am still talking about the events of Wednesday, Wednesday the 13th.  I was afraid.  I kept a low profile.  Lawless people could wring your neck and they kill you and you will be buried.  I was concerned about all this. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you hear anyone talk about Radio Muhabura, something like that, Witness?  Did you hear anyone talk about Radio Muhabura?
A.	Yes.  Yes, Radio Muhabura was an RPF radio station, which had been broadcasting since 1991. 
Q.	Did that radio say anything about you? 
A.	Yes.  That radio station talked about me.  It said that Gacumbitsi, Sylvestré, is a very good man.  He has sent to us young people, courageous young people.  Of the praise to me -- but I did not hear those praises with my own ears.  It is other people who came to tell me that you were praised over the radio.  It was said that you sent people, young people to join the RPF forces and they immediately understood that I was going to be persecuted, that I was going to be hunted down.  That's it.  That is what happened.
Q.	According to you, Witness, the fact that the criminals of the 11th and the 12th treated you as an accomplice of the RPF, is this not related to what this radio station broadcast? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, he has already answered the question, we object.  Counsel has basically made a conclusion and put it to the witness.  That's highly objectionable. 
(Pages 30 to 37 by Sithembiso Moyo)







	1815H
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Can I reply?  Madam President, with all the respect I owe you, the Prosecutor has said that the witness has already answered the question; that I have drawn conclusions.  I believe what is prohibited is to ask the same question to the witness, but the witness cannot answer a question that is not asked.  

I'm sorry, Prosecutor, you can say that I've already asked the question, but the witness cannot answer a question which I've not asked.  I do not know where he will get the question from, for it to be said that he has answered.  In any case, I'm trying to enlighten the Trial Chamber.  If the Prosecutor finds this question disturbing, I could ignore it, but I do not think I had asked this question before.  The question I asked before was the following: "Do you know Radio Muhabura in Rwanda?"  That was the question I asked, Mr. Prosecutor; that's all.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I think we should proceed.  Sufficient damage has been done. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think I clearly understand.  Mr. Kouengoua, do you want to ask your question?  Ask your question to the witness. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Well, Madam President, I'm going to continue.  You have indicated a certain -- I'm going to continue, but as I've always said, the terminology or the words used before your Court should be decent words.  When it is said that a member of the Defence team, or the person asking questions, has caused a lot of damage, I think this is not worthy of this Court.  This is what the Prosecutor said.  That is indeed what we heard in French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think that is probably not what was said.  We sincerely hope that that was not the case.  Continue. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, did you, in fact, send people to the -- to join the RPF?
A.	In 1992 -- in 1992, in fact, there were young people who would disappear like that, and it was said that they had gone, that a certain gentleman would receive them.  That person lived in Gahaza in Tanzania.  He's the person who led them up to Uganda.  Of course, we were aware of that situation; we knew that young people were leaving.  

Others went by Gicuma, coming from other communes.  They would cross the border at Rusumo on the market day.  They would cross, and then they would cross the border.  Others passed by Nasho, near the villages I talked about, and in the evening they would come and cross the border, passing by Karagwe, Karara, and they would continue on their way.  We were informed of that situation.  
Of course, there were young people who came from Rusumo or from other préfectures or communes, young people who left, who went.  During the war -- during the war, it was possible to give to travellers laissez-passers that would enable them to go to other communes or préfectures.  

Some persons came to see us, and we would give them travel documents to enable them to travel.  People came to see us, people who regularly paid their taxes, people who had an I.D. card.  There was therefore no reason to deny them travel documents.  Of course, we did so, and when those persons left, I had no right to ask them where they were going, and some of those persons crossed over to Tanzania.  There were several such cases who went like that.  It is not surprising we were aware of that situation, yes.
Q.	Did these operations occur in 1994 -- before 1994? 
A.	It was before.  It was in 1992, yes, 1992, around 1992.
Q.	Witness, what happened on the 14th?  What happened on the date of the 14th?
A.	On the 14th, I was still in the place where I was hiding.  I could no longer go out.  The sous-préfet who had promised to give me an answer had still not told me anything, so I was trying not to make myself very obvious, because there was a real risk, the risk of being eliminated.
Q.	Where were you hiding?
A.	I was hiding in my house.  No, I did not run away from my country, I did not flee my country.  I simply asked the members of my family not to tell anyone that I was home.  I gave them instructions to the effect that anyone looking for me should be told that I was not there, but I did not leave my house.
Q.	Therefore, throughout that period, your family lived in the same house, the house that it is living in today; is that right?
A.	Yes.  Yes.
Q.	And why did you not flee with your family, Witness, since you were threatened -- since you were threatened with death, as you have just told the Court?
A.	No, I could not run away in that manner.  I could not flee in that manner.  I was waiting for the 
sous-préfet, the préfet, to do something to ensure the security of the authorities.  If I had run away with my family, that would have been very serious.  I would have confirmed what people were saying.  People would have said, "Well, you see, all that we were saying is true.  He has taken his family away and taken refuge elsewhere."  As a leader, I had some responsibilities; therefore, I could not commit such an act.  It was necessary for us to stay on the spot, for people to know that my family was present.  If we had run away, the situation would have been more serious throughout the commune.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to stop here.  We set the time at quarter past 6:00, and it is time for various people here now to take the necessary steps as they are fasting.  Everyone is tired -- to break the fast, rather; it is time for everyone to take the necessary steps to break the fast.  

So we are going to adjourn the proceedings now, and we resume on Monday, in the afternoon, at 2:30 p.m., and it will be necessary for you to conclude very quickly, Counsel, because we have the cross-examination.  So you have to conclude as soon as we resume on Monday in the afternoon.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you very much, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm told that on Monday there will be a hearing here throughout the day; consequently, we'll be meeting in Courtroom III on the second floor on Monday as from 2:30 p.m.  So I wish you all a good evening.  I'm sorry for having kept you -- held you back here for so long.  I thank you for having stayed with us up to this time.  Enjoy your evening and see you on Monday.  

The proceedings are adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1820H)
