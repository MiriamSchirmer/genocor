MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

Registrar, kindly mention the matter on the Court's list.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Jai Ram Reddy, and Judge Sergey Egorov, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 17th June 2004, for the delivery of the judgement in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case No. ICTR-2001-64-T. 

Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, registrar.

Trial Chamber III, composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, Judge Reddy, and Judge Sergey A. Egorov, today renders its judgement in the case against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  The Chamber shall now read the summary of the judgement, which shall be interpreted into English and Kinyarwanda.  Immediately after this hearing, the judgement shall be served on the parties and then made available to the public in its written French version.  An English translation shall be made available as soon as possible.  Unlike the judgement's integral text, this summary is not authentic. 

This judgement comprises five chapters.  The first is the general introduction, the second deals with the assessment of the evidence and factual findings, the third deals with the legal findings, while the fourth contains the verdict.  In chapter 5, the Chamber issues subsequent orders.

The Accused, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, was born in 1943 in Kigina secteur, Rusumo commune, Kibungo préfecture.  He worked successively as a teacher in Kibungo préfecture, chairman of the Banque populaire de Rusumo, and between 1983 and April 1994 as bourgmestre of Rusumo commune.

The indictment:  The indictment was confirmed on 2001, and it alleges that the Accused is responsible for genocide and, alternatively, for complicity in genocide on Counts 1 and 2; for crimes against humanity on Count 3, extermination; Count 4, murder; and Count 5, rape.

On 20 June 2001, the Tanzanian authorities arrested the Accused and transferred him the same day to the Tribunal's detention facility where he is still in detention.  On 26th June, 2001, the Accused pleaded not guilty to each of the counts in the indictment.

Mr. Richard Karegyesa, Mrs. Andra Mobberley, and Mr. Khalid Ramadan represented the Prosecutor, while Mr. Kouengoua and Mrs. Anne Ngatio Mbattang represented the defendant. 

During the trial, that commenced on the 28th of July, 2003, the Chamber granted the Prosecutor's motion to admit into evidence the statement of expert witness Alison Des Forges in Akayesu.  The expert witness subsequently appeared to be cross-examined by the Defence. 

In its decision of the 2nd of October, 2003, dismissing a Defence motion for partial acquittal of the Accused, the Chamber did not take into account some allegations of rape made by a Prosecution witness that had not been disclosed earlier in order to safeguard the basic rights of the Accused.

The Prosecution closed its case on the 27th of August, 2003, and the Defence closed its case on the 25th of November, 2003.  The Prosecution and the Defence presented their closing arguments on the 1st of March, 2004, on which date the hearing was declared closed and deliberations commenced.

Regarding the specific allegations made against the Accused, the Chamber found, on the basis of the testimonies of many credible Prosecution witnesses, that between the 7th and 14th of April, the Accused participated in many meetings in Kibungo préfecture and in his own commune, subdivisions, and secteurs.

On 9 April 1994, the Accused instructed conseillers to hold meetings, without the knowledge of the Tutsi, to incite Hutu to massacre the accomplices of the Inkotanyi.

On the 7th of April, 1994, he met with various local officials, the Interahamwe, including Cyasa, one of their leaders, and gendarmes.  Accompanied by the communal police, the Accused drove around in a communal vehicle.

On the 10th of April, 1994, the Accused was delivered boxes of weapons which he either distributed or had distributed in the secteur of the commune at the Kibungo military camp in the presence of Colonel Rwagafirita.  The Accused publicly incited the population to attack Tutsi at the Nyakarambi market square on the 13th of April, at Rwanteru, Kanyinya, and Gisenyi trade centres on the 14th of April.  He urged a Gisenyi local official not to allow people to cross the River Akagera to seek refuge in Tanzania.

The Chamber found that on the 15th of April, 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi participated in an attack on the Nyarubuye parish, Rusumo, where many Tutsi refugees and Hutu refugees had gathered.  Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrived at the parish in a convoy of many vehicles carrying communal police and Interahamwe who were armed with machetes and other traditional or crafted weapons, guns, and grenades that they used in the attack against the refugees in the Nyarubuye parish.  However, based on the evidence adduced, the Chamber could not find that the machetes used by the assailants had been supplied earlier by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, as alleged in the indictment.

Shortly after arriving at the parish at about 3 p.m. and realising that Murefu, a Tutsi refugee, was moving towards him with confidence, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi killed him, thus signalling the beginning of the massacres.  He spoke to the crowd through a megaphone and instructed Hutu refugees to separate themselves from Tutsi.  When some complied with the instructions, the communal police and Interahamwe attacked the refugees in the church building.  The Chamber found that members of the communal police attacked the parish on the instructions of the Accused.  The Accused directed the attacks and gave instructions which the assailants understood as an incitement or encouragement to act.

The Chamber also found that the following day, 16 April 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrived at the Nyarubuye church building, accompanied by a man named Rubanguka, a judge at the Rusumo court, and a group of assailants.  Some assailants were armed with spears, machetes, and bows and arrows.  It is not established that the Accused himself was armed.  In the presence of the Accused, Rubanguka planted a spear into a body, but it was not established if it was that of a corpse or somebody who was live. 

The Chamber found that the Accused also directed the attack of the 16th of April, as he did with the attack of the previous day.

During the attack of the 16th of April, the assailants, including Judge Rubanguka, finished off survivors before proceeding to loot the parish building.

	1130H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber, found on the basis of all the evidence adduced, that between the 15th and the 17th of April, 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi led attacks against Tutsi civilian refugees who had gathered at the Nyarubuye parish and personally took part in the attacks.

On the 15th of April, 1994, he killed a Tutsi called Murefu.  On the 15th, 16th, and 17th of April, he led attacks by giving clear instructions to the assailants to attack Tutsi who had sought refuge in the parish.  Among the assailants of the 15th of April, 1994 were the Interahamwe, gendarmes, and communal police.

The Chamber considers that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi facilitated the transport of the communal police, Interahamwe, and weapons to the Nyarubuye parish by authorising or facilitating the use of commune vehicles.  He led attacks against Tutsi civilians by giving an example or by instructing the assailants to kill the refugees.

The Chamber considers that it is established that thousands of Hutu and Tutsi civilians had sought refuge at the parish in the days preceding the attack of the 15th of April, 1994, and that on that same day, Hutu were separated from Tutsi who were attacked.  Very many Tutsi were killed that day.  Survivors were finished off the following day and two days later.  A few weeks later, the premises of the parish was still littered with many corpses.  Thus, the Chamber found that a large number of Tutsi who found refuge at Nyarubuye parish were killed there between the 15th and 17th of April, 1994.

In his pre-trial brief, the Prosecutor mentioned the murder on the 14th of April, 1994 in the residence or near the residence of the Accused of a Tutsi man named Kanyogote who was accompanied by his three children.  The Prosecutor presented two testimonies in support of this allegation.  The Chamber can only find that these allegations were not included in the indictment.

In this case, it is indeed the substance of the indictment that is affected by the inclusion of a criminal act of murder that was not contained in the indictment or by the amendments of the particulars of identification of the victims of the said murder.  Consequently, the Chamber has decided to disregard the evidence adduced by the Prosecutor regarding the acts of the Accused in relation to the alleged murder of Kanyogote and his children and has refrained from making a finding in this regard.  However, the Chamber found that Kanyogote and his children, who were Tutsi, who felt threatened because of their ethnicity, were killed in April 1994 in Rusumo commune.

Regarding the allegations relating to the murder of two Tutsi refugees at the Nyabitare Catholic centre on the 15th of April, 1994, as set out in paragraph 34 of the indictment, the Chamber was not convinced by Witness TAC's testimony in support of this double allegation of murder.  The Chamber found that several factors negated its credibility and reliability.  Witness TAC witnessed the incident, recounted only for a short time while crawling on his stomach hidden in a banana field at a distance of about 30 metres from the incident.  Considering the situation, coupled with the serious threats in which the witness found himself at the time of the events, his identification of the Accused at the scene and his narration of events and gestures, the Chamber assessed his account of events with caution.  Moreover, the Chamber noted the existence of several inconsistencies and contradictions in Witness TAC's statements. 

Regarding paragraph 36 of the indictment, the Chamber found that on the 13th of April, 1994 at Nyakarambi, the Accused expelled his tenants, Marie and Béatrice, Tutsi women, knowing that by so doing he was exposing them to external dangers and the imminent risk of being targeted by assailants.  Marie and Béatrice were killed in the night of the 13th of April, 1994.  However, hearsay evidence is insufficient, failing corroboration, to establish that the Accused ordered the specific murder of Marie and Béatrice, and considering the circumstances under which Witness TAS obtained this information, her evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused gave the order.

Regarding the allegations of rape contained in the indictment, and on the basis of all the evidence adduced, the Chamber found that the Accused publicly incited on the 17th of April, 1994 the rape of Tutsi girls by specifying that sticks should be stuck into their genitals in the event they resisted.  The Chamber considered as established, beyond a reasonable doubt, the rapes and other acts of sexual violence committed against and recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ and found that such acts were consequences of the instigation made by the Accused against Tutsi women and girls.

In Rusumo commune, acts of sexual violence were part of a systematic and widespread attack against the Tutsi civilian population during the events of April 1994.  Even if it is possible that many rapes were committed in Rusumo commune in the period referred to in the indictment, only a few cases of rape and acts of sexual violence were referred to the Chamber, which did not enable it to make a finding on their widespread character. 

The Chamber found that the rapes recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ, TAO, TAS, and TAP are established.  However, with the exception of the rape of Witness TAS, the Chamber did not find that these acts were the direct consequences of the instigation by the Accused to rape Tutsi women.

Furthermore, the Chamber found that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that from April to June 1994, in Rusumo commune in Rwanda, there were rapes and other acts of sexual violence which were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Tutsi civilian population.

The Chamber is of the opinion that the bourgmestre had legal authority over the communal police, including the communal brigadiers.  He occupied a position of superior vis-à-vis the said communal personnel.  Moreover, he was specifically responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the commune.  However, the Chamber cannot find, in the light of the evidence before it, that the Accused had superior authority over the conseiller of the secteur, gendarmes, soldiers, and the Interahamwe that were in his commune at the time of the events under consideration.  The law did not per se place him in such a position.  Although his responsibilities regarding the maintenance of law and order afforded him the power to take legal measures in that respect, which would be binding on everyone in the commune, the Prosecutor did not adduce any evidence that such power placed him ipso facto in a position of superior, vis-à-vis, each of the category of persons mentioned above.

After having made its factual findings, the Trial Chamber will now focus on their legal characterisation and on the assessment of any responsibility the Accused may have incurred.

With regard to genocide, the Prosecution must prove that the Accused had the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnical, racial or religious group, and that he committed any one of the acts, any one of the five acts enumerated in Article 2(2) of the Statute.  In the case at bar, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is charged with seeking to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group by killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm.

The Chamber found that during the period referred to in the indictment, Rwandan citizens were individually identified according to the following ethnic groups: Tutsi, Hutu and Twa.  In its findings, in its factual findings, the Chamber largely referred to the utterances and actions of the Accused through which he manifested his genocidal intent.  Thus, on the 9 April meeting, he exhorted the conseillers de secteur to instigate the Hutus to kill the Tutsi.  He made similar utterances to the population on the morning of 13th April at the Nyakarambi market and on 14 April at Rwanteru and Kanyinya commercial centres.

On 17 April, the Accused instigated the rape of Tutsi women and girls.  Moreover, he personally killed Murefu, a Tutsi.  The Chamber finds that at the time when the events occurred in Rusumo commune, which events have been established in the factual findings above, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.

The Chamber thus found that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi participated in the killing of Tutsis at Nyarubuye parish, that he personally killed a Tutsi, Murefu, and that he caused serious bodily harm to Tutsi women who were raped at his instigation, all of which bear his requisite genocidal intent.

In the light of the foregoing, and with respect to Count 1, that is genocide, the Chamber finds that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is liable under Article 6(1) of the Statute for planning, instigating, ordering communal police, committing and aiding and abetting the killing of and perpetration of serious bodily harm on members of the Tutsi group as part of the crime of genocide.

Hence, and on account of the similarity of the acts in question, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to consider whether he is also liable under Article 6(3) of the Statute.

Accordingly, the Chamber finds Sylvestre Gacumbitsi guilty of genocide pursuant to Article 2(3)(a) and (b) of the Statute as charged in Count 1 of the indictment.

Count 2, that is complicity in genocide, is an alternative count to Count 1, genocide.  Moreover, it is based on the same factual allegations contained in the indictment as Count 1.  Since the Accused has already been found guilty of genocide as charged in Count 1, pursuant to Article 2(3)(a) and (b) of the Statute, the Chamber did not consider the count of complicity in genocide provided for in Article 2(3).  This count is therefore dismissed.

Crimes against humanity:  With regard to crimes against humanity, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is charged with extermination, murder, and rape.  Before assessing the facts established with respect to each of the three crimes, the Chamber first inquired whether the general constituent element of this category of crimes, that is, crimes again humanity, were established.  On that basis, the Chamber found that a widespread and systematic attack on a civilian population took place in the territory of Rusumo commune in April 1994, and that the Accused -- and that the instructions given by the Accused to the assailants contain an ethnic-based discriminatory factor which prevailed during the attacks and in the choice of victims.

Count 3 of the indictment charges the Accused with extermination as a crime against humanity pursuant to Article 3(b) of the Statute.  The Chamber held, on the basis of its factual conclusion supra, that the high numerical strength of the victims of the Nyarubuye parish massacre supports a finding of widespread killing.  The Chamber noted that witness accounts show that it was a large-scale massacre that resulted in numerous deaths, a fact that is corroborated by the testimony of Mr. Patrick Fergal Keane, a BBC journalist, who, some weeks later, saw and filmed numerous corpses in the parish compound.

The Chamber found that the Accused knew of existence of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population in Rusumo in April 1994, because at local level, he planned and led certain operations.

On the days preceding the attack on Nyarubuye, the Accused participated in preparatory meetings with officials of the gendarmerie and Interahamwe with a view to launching a massive attack against the Tutsi, incited conseillers, local political officials, to kill the Tutsi, to single them out and kill them, distributed boxes of weapons in different locations, and travelled within the commune to ensure that his instructions had produced the desired effect.

The Chamber, in conclusion, stated that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused incurred individual criminal responsibility under Article 6(1) of the Statute for planning extermination, instigating extermination, ordering the communal police to exterminate, and aiding and abetting the extermination of members of the Tutsi ethnic group in Rusumo commune in April 1994.  Furthermore, the Chamber deemed it unnecessary to consider whether the Accused is equally liable under Article 6(3) of the Statute, given the similarity of the events in question. 

Accordingly, with regard to Count 3, the Chamber finds the Accused guilty of extermination as a crime against humanity.

Count 4 of the indictment charges the Accused with murder as a crime against humanity pursuant to Article 3(a) of the Statute.  The Prosecutor's factual allegations in support of this charge are contained in paragraphs 31 to 36 of the indictment. 

The Chamber considered that the Prosecution has not established beyond reasonable doubt the allegations of murder.  Consequently, the Chamber finds the Accused not guilty under Count 4, namely, murder as a crime against humanity.

In the opinion of Chamber, the penetration of the victim's sexual organ by the sexual organ of the assailant or the insertion by the assailant of any object into the victim's sex organs amounts to rape,  although -- although, those are not the only instances of conduct that constitute rape within the meaning of Article 3(g) of the Statute.  The Chamber has already held that Prosecution Witness TAQ was raped at the same time as seven other Tutsi women and girls on an account of the fact that the assailants inserted their sex organs or a stick into the genitals of each of the victims; that similarly, the wife of Prosecution Witness TAO was raped on the ground, that the assailant inserted his sex organ into that of the victim; that Witness TAS was raped in the same manner, as well as TAP and her mother.  All these acts that have been recounted before this Chamber are covered by this definition.
The Chamber reiterates its earlier findings concerning the existence of a widespread and systematic attack on a civilian population in Rusumo in April 1994.  The Accused had knowledge of such a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population because he was one of those who masterminded it and because he planned, ordered, and led the attack at certain times and in certain locations.

In its factual conclusions, in its factual findings, the Chamber held that the widespread and systematic attack targeted specifically a civilian population, notably the Tutsi, and also that Prosecution Witnesses DAQ, TAP, and TAS, including the wife of Prosecution Witness TAO, the mother of Prosecution Witness TAP, and seven Tutsi women and girls, were all raped as recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ.  The evidence shows that all these victims are civilians. 

The Chamber is of the opinion that these rape victims were chosen because of their Tutsi ethnic origin or because of their relationship with a person of a Tutsi ethnic group, which is the case of Prosecution Witness TAS.  The Chamber therefore found that the discriminatory factor guided the attacks and the choice of rape victims.

In the circumstances of the present case, the utterances made by the Accused to the effect that in case of resistance the victims should be killed in an atrocious manner, and the fact that the rape victims were attacked by the very assailants they were fleeing from, sufficiently established that they did not consent to the sexual acts of which they were victims.

	1200H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber considered that the evidence adduced shows that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi certainly instigated the rape of Tutsi women and girls on the basis of his utterances, such as were heard by Prosecution Witness TAQ.  For his part, Prosecution Witness TAS also testified to having heard those who raped her, saying that the Accused had ordered them to rape Tutsi women and girls.

The Chamber recalls that immediately after the Accused made utterances instigating the rape of women and girls, Tutsi women and girls, while he was in a convoy crossing the bridge between Kanbobwa and Nyarubuye in the direction of Nyarubuye, Prosecution Witness TAQ and seven other Tutsi women and girls were raped by young men, who, being in the vicinity, heard the bourgmestre's instigation.  The Chamber therefore finds that the rapes recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ indeed resulted from the instigation of the Accused.  However, the Chamber finds no evidence of a nexus between the rape of Prosecution Witness TAS and the possible utterances of the Accused, and cannot therefore find the Accused liable for rape on that score.  The same applies to the rape of the wife of Prosecution Witness TAO and the rape of the mother of Prosecution Witness TAP.  The Chamber, nevertheless, considers that these rapes have been established and are part of the widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population in Rusumo.

The Chamber therefore finds Sylvestre Gacumbitsi criminally liable pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute for instigating the rape of TAQ and seven other Tutsi women and girls, thereby committing a crime against humanity.  Consequently, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to enquire whether he's also liable under Article 6(3) of the Statute, given the similarity of the facts and the absence of any evidence of a superior-subordinate relationship between the Accused and the perpetrators of the rape.  Thus, with regard to Count 5, the Chamber finds Sylvestre Gacumbitsi guilty of rape as a crime against humanity.

Now, we will call on the Accused, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, to move closer to the Bench because we are now going to hand down the verdict.

Please stand up.  Thank you.

On these grounds and considering all the facts in the case file, Trial Chamber III unanimously finds the Accused guilty of genocide, Count 1; crime against humanity, extermination, Count 3; crime against humanity, rape, Count 5.  The Trial Chamber unanimously finds the Accused not guilty of crime against humanity, murder, Count 4.  Lastly, unanimously, the Trial Chamber, given the guilty verdict in regard to the count of genocide, dismisses Count 2, that is, the count of complicity in genocide.

Chapter 5 of the judgement contains the arguments of the parties regarding mitigating and aggravating circumstances, as well as the consequential orders following the verdict. 

With regard to aggravating circumstances, the Trial Chamber first of all noted that under Article 23(2) of the Statute, the gravity or seriousness of the crimes committed must be taken into account during the determination of the sentence.  It follows that the more heinous a crime is, the heavier the sentence should be.  However, in assessing the seriousness of the crimes of which the Accused has been found guilty, the Trial Chamber also took into account the special circumstances of the case, as well as the form and extent of the Accused's participation in the commission of the crimes. 

The Trial Chamber is of the opinion that the status of the Accused in April 1994 as bourgmestre, and the most influential as well as most important person in Rusumo commune, amounts to an aggravating circumstance to the extent that the Accused participated in the crimes committed, and that he was among the leaders by planning the crimes by inciting their commission and sometimes by leading the assailants to the sites of the massacres.  By so doing, the Accused abused the confidence placed in him by those under his authority.  His active participation in these criminal events explains why he was not able to take measures to prevent them or to punish the perpetrators thereof when he could.

The seriousness of the crimes committed, in particular, genocide, but also atrocious rapes that some victims suffered, are also aggravating circumstances.

Under aggravating -- or, rather, mitigating circumstances, the Trial Chamber took into account the work done by the Accused as a bourgmestre as well as his general conduct before April 1994.  These mitigating circumstances are witnessed or reflected by defence testimony, but also the testimony of Prosecution witnesses, for example, the testimony of Witness TAW.  This witness mentioned the good conduct of the Accused and his good relations with the Tutsi before the death of President Habyarimana.  Furthermore, the family of the Accused is still living in Rwanda and enjoys good relations with their neighbours without distinction as to ethnic origin.  However, these mitigating circumstances must be counter-balanced against the aggravating circumstances in a determination of the sentence against the Accused.

Taking into account the practice followed in our Tribunal as well as in the ICTY, the Trial Chamber notes that a sentence must, first and foremost, be commensurate with the gravity of the offence.  Persons found guilty of genocide or of extermination as a crime against humanity, or of these two crimes, receive sentences stretching from 15 years to life imprisonment.  Forms of secondary participation or participation as accessories receive lighter sentences.

Taking into account the general scale of imprisonment applied by the ad hoc Tribunals and the courts of Rwanda, as well as the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that it should impose an exemplary sentence on Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  The Trial Chamber is of the view that the individual circumstances in the present matter must affect the sentence in such a way that the Trial Chamber will not apply a life sentence against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.

For these reasons and considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, ruling unanimously, openly, and in first instance, in accordance with Articles 23, 26, and 27 of the Statute of the Tribunal, and Rules 101, 102, 103, and 104 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence; considering that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was found guilty of genocide, Count 1, crime against humanity, extermination, Count 3, crime against humanity, rape, Count 5; considering the Prosecution's final brief; considering the Defence's final brief; the Prosecutor -- having heard the Prosecution and the Defence; regarding the crimes referred to supra, the Trial Chamber sentences Sylvestre Gacumbitsi to the single sentence of 30 years of imprisonment for all the counts on which he has been found guilty. 

The Trial Chamber decides that the period of preventive or provisional detention will be deducted from the total period of term of imprisonment, that the sentence will be enforced in a state that will be designated in consultation with the Trial Chamber. 

Pending the transfer to the place of imprisonment, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will be maintained in custody under the same conditions as have existed so far.  

The Trial Chamber decides that the present judgement is imminently enforceable. 

As soon as where there is a Notice of Appeal, the sentence or the enforcement of the sentence will be stayed until the Appeal Chamber makes its determination; however, the convicted person will remain in detention. 

That is the judgement delivered by this Trial Chamber in Arusha on 17th June 2004.

We thank you all.  The proceedings stand adjourned.
