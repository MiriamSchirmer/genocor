MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing resumes.
 
We were in closed session, but we will go into open session for our decision to be read.

The Defence requested an adjournment until December 2003, to begin presenting the case for the Defence.  It is because of problems for preparations, the few missions undertaken, difficulties in locating witnesses, and the lack of time in general terms.  It stated inter-alia that witnesses who have been contacted wanted to speak with counsel before agreeing to testify, and the witnesses were hard to locate.

The Chamber notes that a calendar was already -- had been established after a meeting held in the presence of all interested parties on the 10th of July 2003, Judge Møse, presiding.  The calendar has been communicated to the parties, and no comments had been made as to the dates proposed.

Specifically, the Defence did not object to the date proposed to begin presenting its evidence in the case for the Defence.  Counsel was appointed in October 2001.  He recently declared, in the course of the hearing, that his investigators had met since then, approximately 200 potential witnesses.

It appears, therefore, to the Trial Chamber, that Defence has had sufficient time and resources to prepare its case and to draw up a list of witnesses to testify for Defence as of 6th October 2003.

The Trial Chamber takes note of the difficulties indicated by the Defence, but considers they are not of a nature that justifies adjournment of the trial.  

The Trial Chamber notes, moreover, that the Tribunal's calendar which has already been established for all the Trial Chambers until December 2003, does not allow adjournment and postponement -- the postponement until December 2003.

To help the Defence in its preparation, the Trial Chamber requests the witness and victims section to provide as much assistance as necessary to the Defence, to ensure the appearance of the witnesses for the Defence.

The Defence shall as soon as possible, provide to the WVSS, all the information concerning the witnesses, including the expert witnesses.  The Defence will have to comply with Rule 73Ter., and inter-alia, file its Defence brief -- preliminary Defence brief, before Friday, 3rd of October 2003 at the latest.  The trial will recommence on 6th October 2003 as planned, with the preliminary Defence statement, and then testimony by the Accused if he wishes to appear in his own defence.  We will continue with the testimony of expert witnesses and those Defence witnesses present.

For the aforegoing reasons, the Trial Chamber denies the Defence application to postpone the date for commencement of the presentation of the case for the Defence.

That is it.  We thank you, and we now adjourn.
Counsel Kouengoua, you can come and see us if you have any problems.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing stands adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1235H)
