MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to everyone in the courtroom.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you are a protected witness and will be referred to as DP during these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration to that effect. 
(Declaration made by Witness DP in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
     Do you have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
I have the particular -- do you mean the particulars?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's exactly the one.  Now, is it your signature at the bottom of that page, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is my signature.  Yes, the information is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is then Defence Exhibit 47 under seal.  Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. 47 admitted, under seal)

Defence, please.
WITNESS DP,
			first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
 EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I have three questions on the identity of the witness.  I should like to seek leave for a closed session, so that I put these questions that affect his identity.  It will not take three minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Granted.  So we will have a closed session of about a couple of minutes.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 3] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)




































MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness DP, from now on we are in open session again, so now you have to be careful when you answer questions so as not to reveal your identity.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, for that.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Witness, now during the sitting when I refer to your functions I will talk about the profession that you said you were exercising in 1994 during the closed session.  Is that acceptable?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, still in 1994, how did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learnt about it over the radio when I went back home in the evening, at about 8:30 p.m. or 9 p.m.
Q.	Were you in your native commune that you told us when you learned about the death of the president?
A.	No, I was in Kigali.  I was residing in Kiyovu where my house -- my official residence was Kiyovu.
Q.	Could you tell us, in a few words, what happened in Kigali in your neighbourhood following the death of the president?
A.	As soon as we learned about the death of the president it was said over the radio that there was a curfew, and we were compelled to stay at home without going out.  Then, at around midnight, we heard gunshots and we, of course, remained in our houses for about almost a week.  And it was on the 12th of April that we were able to leave Kigali, and I was on my way to Gisenyi to my parents' house.
Q.	Why did you decide to leave Kigali?
A.	We wanted to run away from the fighting.  It was only on the 12th that we were able to leave Kigali, because the situation had subsided.
Q.	The 12th of what month?
A.	The 12th of April.
Q.	What form of transport did you go out of Kigali? 
A.	I had my own car.
Q.	And you said that you wanted to go where, which city?
A.	To Gisenyi, at my parents.  First of all I went to see my in-laws, who lived in Gitarama.
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Where did you stay in Gitarama?
A.	With my in-laws.
Q.	Did you meet people that you knew before in Gitarama?
A.	Members of my in-laws, the family of my in-laws, yes, and in the evening Mr. Ndindabahizi came to see me at my in-laws' and told me that the interim government had just decided to reopen the banks to be able to pay depositors their money and pay for the food supplies of the army.
Q.	Let's go back a little.  Did you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi before that?
A.	Yes, I had known him in 1973 when we were together at university.
Q.	Did you see him again since then?
A.	No, I only saw him again, practically, when he came to see me in Gitarama.  It was on the 12th of April in the evening.  Before that I had heard he was appointed director of cabinet and I did not see him at the Ministry of Finance, of course.
Q.	Very well.  On the 12th of April, in the evening, at what time, approximately, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?  Do you remember that?
A.	I believe it was 7 p.m., 7:30 p.m. 
Q.	Did you meet him by chance?
A.	Yes, for me it was by chance.  I don't even know how he knew I was there, because we just arrived in Gitarama.  I don't know how he learnt about being in Gitarama.
Q.	Did he come to see you?
A.	Yes, yes, because it was his mission to come and tell me that I was summoned by the government to go back to work.
Q.	Could you give us more details concerning the reasons why he was himself in Gitarama -- Ndindabahizi I mean?
A.	It was because the interim government had decided to set up in Gitarama and to get away from the fighting in Kigali.  They had set up their headquarters in Murambi first.
Q.	Do you know the date that the interim government took seat in Murambi?
A.	We heard it over the radio while we were still in Kigali.  It was around the 9th of April, we were told that they were sworn in in the Hotel de Mille Collines& was all we knew.  It was broadcast over the radio.
Q.	Very well.  And on this 12th of April in the evening at around 1900 hours, what did Ndindabahizi tell you?
A.	Well, he told me the interim government had decided to reopen the banks and that -- because my functions, precedingly, the government had decided to enroll me to work with the other members of the bank who were also called in.
Q.	Did you obey?
A.	Yes, I couldn't refuse because it was a decision of the government, all the more so as there was nothing else I could do.
Q.	On that 12th of April, how long did you stay in the company of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Well, he didn't stay for a long time.  He only stayed for about five minutes and left.
Q.	Did you start working on the 12th of April or later on?
A.	It was later on; on the 13th in the morning, at around 8 a.m., they came to fetch me from my house, from my in-laws.  Then we went to Murambi, that is the headquarters of the interim government.
Q.	Who came to fetch you?
A.	It was a driver -- no, it was a soldier.  I do not remember his name anymore.
Q.	Well, we may not find it important.  I wanted to know if it was Ndindabahizi himself.
A.	No, it was not Ndindabahizi himself.  I do not remember the person as such.  At any rate, when they came to fetch me we found Colonel Bagosora within the government.  We were told that he was responsible for supervising the entire operation now.
Q.	Now, let us go step-by-step, Witness.  On the 13th of April, in the morning, they came to fetch you, and where did they take you?
A.	To the headquarters of the government at Murambi.
Q.	Now, who were you introduced to on the 13th of April in the morning to start you off?

A.	First of all we met the governor of the national bank who was with the accountant-general at the national bank, Mr. -- well, I can't remember his name at this time.  And we were told that he was responsible for the team that was to run operations in the national bank.
Q.	Now, how did you settle down?  Were you given an office in Murambi?
A.	No, not in Murambi.  We were with Colonel Bagosora, and the guard for the funds were -- I mean for the funds were and we therefore went to the secondary offices of the commercial bank in Gisarme.
Q.	Did you meet Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 13th of April?
A.	On the 13th of April, in the morning, he was there, but as the rest of the operation was therefore without him, he went back to his office in the Ministry of Finance.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I didn't get this quite clearly.  Counsel asked you whether you were given an office at Murambi and then you provided an answer with reference to Colonel Bagosora, but I didn't get the gist of your answer.  Can you repeat that answer, please?
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  Now, there were no offices because in principle we were supposed to work in the banks.  So that we left with Colonel Bagosora to visit the offices in the commercial bank, down in the bank in Kigali, and inspect the situation, as far as the coffers of the banks were concerned.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Still on the 13th of April, to make this point clearer.  The purpose of your mission, was it to find you an office or was there any other thing, because you are talking about your mission with Colonel Bagosora?
A.	Now, the purpose was firstly to see whether the coffers of the two banks were safe and comfortable so that we could deposit funds that we got from Kigali in them for operations.  We saw that they were rather empty, so we had to go back to Kigali, but they could take some funds.  We brought back some funds for deposit at Kigarama.
Q.	What are these funds you are talking about?
A.	First of all, the funds came from the general accountant -- the general cashier, the funds that were in circulation, and a bundle of bank notes that were not in circulation to supply the main cashier, if she needed some. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Did you meet Mr. Ndindabahizi on the 13th of April?
THE WITNESS:
No, only except on the 13th in the morning.  After that, we did not see him for the rest of the day, because we went  to Kigali.  We came back with the funds to deposit the funds in the bank.  We didn't go back to Murambi on that day.
JUDGE KHAN:
But in the morning time.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, in the morning.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Perhaps we can try to reconsider what happened on the 13th of April.  Now, you went to Murambi on the 13th of April in the morning, is that correct?
A.	To inspect the premises.
Q.	You also met Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 13th on the morning, is that correct?  Then you met Colonel Bagosora, is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Then, together with Colonel Bagosora, you went to scout for a safe place to keep your funds, is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you find the described coffers?
A.	Yes, we found two coffers at the Kigali bank and at the commercial bank, at the two banks.
Q.	Very well, still on the 13th of April.  Now, after having found the coffers to deposit money, what did you do?
A.	Then, of course, we organised our departure from Kigali to go and secure the funds and, of course, the documents that were necessary, the accounting documents.
Q.	And in Kigali, where were the funds kept?
A.	They were in the coffers of the Rwandan national bank.
Q.	Have you actually transported the funds from Kigali to Gitarama?
A.	Yes, we transported them under the escort of soldiers that Colonel Bagosora had obtained from the Kigali camp.
	(Pages 1 to 7 by R. Lear)





      1500H
 BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	How long did the operation to transfer the funds last?
A.	Indeed, it ran up to the 14th because we had to go back on the 14th as well.
Q.	Did it run for two days?
A.	Yes, two days.
Q.	That operation ended on the 14th of April; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct, on the 14th of April.
Q.	Now, during the course of the day of 13th April, did you see, apart from the morning, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once again?
A.	No, because we never went back to Murambi.  After having deposited the funds, I went back directly to my in-laws' house.
Q.	And where did your in-laws live?
A.	Near the town there.  Very near the stadium -- rather, very near the Gitarama market and near Kabugaye (phonetic), called Giahogwo (phonetic).
Q.	Very well.  This is as far as the 13th of April is concerned.  Now, the 14th of April, did you meet Emmanuel on the 14th of April?
A.	The 14th of April, neither, because they came to fetch us very early.  We didn't have time to go back to Murambi except in the evening when we finished the operation, when we went to get something to drink at very near the Goma headquarters.
Q.	And when you took your break after that, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	No, I caught sight of him in Murambi.  I caught site of him.  We were not together.  I caught sight of him at the time when we went for a drink.
Q.	Very well.  I take it on the 14th of April the transfer of funds was finished.  Now, what was your job after the 14th of April?
A.	Let's say the 15th, because the operations began on the 15th of April, and on account of my qualifications and my functions, I was to prepare vouchers for payments for the national treasury, the treasury of Rwanda.
Q.	Did you have an office at that time, as of the 15th of April?
A.	No, we didn't have any permanent office, because sometimes we were at the Kigali bank, sometimes at the commercial bank.  We didn't have a fixed office as such.
Q.	Did you perform the same duties?  Did you have the same functions?  For how long did you operate in those functions from the 15th of April?
A.	Up to the time that we left the country for Goma, sir, that is around the 14th of July.
Q.	Did you stay in Gitarama since the -- from the 15th of July -- from the 15th of April to 15th of July?
A.	No, Gitarama fell, so we left Gitarama at around the 30th of May.
Q.	Very well.  Could you very quickly and very simply, Witness, tell us what your work in Gitarama consisted in?
A.	The work I did in Gitarama consisted in the execution of payment of vouchers from the general treasurer, so that I established the payees and they were usually the suppliers, and of course the payment of salaries for civil servants.
Q.	Shall I take it that you were responsible for preparing payments for some suppliers for the state?
A.	No, the vouchers for the payment I did not pay.  The payment was done by the chief cashier of the state.
Q.	Now, who were the suppliers that you paid?  What do they supply you with?
A.	Food supplies, especially for the army that was engaged with RPF; that is, engaged in combating RPF.
Q.	Were you responsible for buying arms for the army that was incumbent?
A.	Before, that was one of my attributions.  But at that particular time, one couldn't pay for anything except in foreign currency, and we used only Rwandan francs at that time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are now in Gitarama, are you, from the 15th of April to when? 
THE WITNESS:
Up to the 30th of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's when Gitarama falls? 
THE WITNESS:
That's when we left Gitarama.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then from the 13th of May, where were you then, just to get the overview? 
THE WITNESS:
We settled down in Gisyeni.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then --
THE WITNESS:
We left Gisyeni on the 14th of July to take refuge in Goma. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  We'll take it that you were responsible for preparing vouchers for payment vouchers.  

Now, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, was he your hierarchical supervisor in Gitarama?
A.	No, he was not my hierarchical boss.  He was minister for lands and responsible for the national bank.  My hierarchical boss was director of the national bank.
Q.	Were you regularly in contact with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, actually, he asked me to update him about the situation as far as the treasury was concerned, because he needed that to be able to establish contracts because the government had decided to give advance payment to suppliers because the bank wasn't functioning anymore.  So the government decided to give advances to suppliers so that Ndindabahizi needed an update on the situation, the financial situation.  So every day I had to update him so far as the accounting situation was concerned. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you said that he was not your boss.  Mr. Ndindabahizi was not your boss.
THE WITNESS:
So, I do agree with that, but he had asked me, as minister responsible for my department, because I couldn't find the governor all the time.  It was, rather, the minister of finance who was more directly concerned.  I saw the governor, I told him what the situation was, but I reported that to the minister because the minister needed that information to establish contracts and to evaluate the level of funds.  He also was to pay the civil servants; that is, the civil servants: the teachers, health personnel, legal personnel, and sometimes the gendarmes and soldiers.
JUDGE KHAN:
You are saying that you gave information under the directions of the governor of the --
THE WITNESS:
Well, the governor also had asked me to give him such information.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Who was you're -- I need a clarification.  Who was your immediate boss?  Was it the governor or the director of finance, or both? 
THE WITNESS:
No, it was the governor.  But he was in touch with Ndindabahizi because he was the one that needed the information, so that I should give it to him directly.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Are you referring to the governor of the bank of Rwanda? 
THE WITNESS:
Of the National Bank of Rwanda.  And his name was N-T-I-R-U-M-B-A-B-A-Z-I.  And that was the governor of the Bank of Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was above the governor of the Bank of Rwanda? 
THE WITNESS:
As I said before, it was the minister of finance as being the responsible minister for that portfolio. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When we ask questions again, it's not because we haven't understood the previous answer.  It's because we want to place it in context.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Starting on the 15th of April 1994, did you regularly work with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, in fact, we did.  Well, he would come to ask me for that information or sometimes I would go to give him in Murambi such information.
Q.	When you say that one of the two of you would travel to see the other, from where?
A.	Well, I would go from the bank, the Bank of Kigali, to Murambi, and he would come from Murambi, either at Kigali -- at the Kigali bank or Bank of Commerce, because I used to work in those two places, either one or the other.
Q.	What was the distance between the banks that you spoke of and Murambi?
A.	Between the Bank of Kigali and the Bank of Commerce, there's not even one kilometre distance between the two, and from the bank of commerce to Murambi, there's a distance of not even two kilometres.
Q.	Are those three places in Gitarama?
A.	Yes, they were in the city of Gitarama.
Q.	Sir, to assist us, can you briefly describe the nature of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's work in Gitarama?
A.	As I said, he was in charge of signing contracts with suppliers.  He also had to look at the state of accounts to see what the spending situation could be, and to spend, he could only see what had been deposited by the state into the coffers.  

We had 2 billion 700 million Rwandan francs at the time in the coffers.  When the money became insufficient, he negotiated special advances with the national bank.  He only did that once.  Because the Rwandan government no longer had any income, any revenue, and so he had to go to the system.  When the overdraft was completely gone, he had to look for other situations.  And this was provided for in law. 
Q.	Given the event in your country in 1994, was the minister of finance's work real work or was it just a facade?
A.	No, he did do real work.  Depositors were able to have their money because banks were open.  Civil servants could get their salaries, at least those who could get to Gitarama could, so I would say his work was -- did consist in some real things.
Q.	Did you have an office in Murambi?
A.	Yes, with his immediate associates, collaborators.
Q.	Did he receive many visitors in his office?
A.	Certainly, I'm sure.  Each time we would go to see him there, there were people looking for him, especially suppliers, food suppliers.  Others were looking for advances; others were looking for past payments.  That means he was constantly being looked for, as people were looking for solutions for payment.
Q.	Now, you yourself, how often did you meet with him? 
A.	As I said earlier, it was once or twice a day: once to give him the information on the state of the accounts, and perhaps in the evening when we would go to have a drink in a bar that was very close to the government headquarters.
Q.	Can you be more specific?  In one day how many times would you see him, on average?
A.	On average, once or twice a day, not more.
Q.	In a week's time, how many days of the week would you see him, on average?
A.	Well, excluding the weekends -- we were working.  On the weekends we didn't have any free time, but we did try to rest.  Except we couldn't when we were really demanded.  So it was mostly during the week, and I know that sometimes he went on mission to Nairobi and he left the work to his collaborators, the treasurer and the budget director.
Q.	You said -- that in mid-May he left?
A.	Yes, he went to Nairobi for a few days, about a week.  In mid-May he went there.
Q.	What was the objective of that mission in mid-May?
A.	I think that he had a meeting with the PTA, of the PTA, there.
Q.	What was the PTA?
A.	It's the Preferential Trade Area of East Africa.  It included Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, I believe.  There were about seven countries from central and eastern Africa.
Q.	To the best of your memory, how long did he spend away?
A.	I think it was about seven days he was away in that meeting.  I think it was around the 17th of May, if I'm not mistaken.  Six or seven days he was away.
Q.	Outside of that trip, did Mr. Ndindabahizi voyage often, did he leave often?
A.	No, only when the government would decide to have meetings in Kibuye or Gikongoro.  I don't remember the exact date, but in the evenings he would always come back to Gitarama in such cases.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, these seven days, how do you count them?  You mention -- will you relate these seven days to the date of 17th of May, please. 
THE WITNESS:
This was in mid-May, mid-May 1994.  It was between the 15th -- he left between the 15th and 17th.  And the meeting took place during about a week's time.  But I can't give you the exact dates.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the commencement of the seven day's period was between the 15th and the 17th of May?
THE WITNESS:
No, I think it was the 17th, the 17th, I believe.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So the departure was on the 17th? 
THE WITNESS:
It's been ten years, Mr. President; I'm trying to remember the date.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We really appreciate that, of course, of course. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you mean to say that Mr. Ndindabahizi left Gitarama on 15th of May? 
THE WITNESS:
No, approximately on those dates.  I don't -- I can't say it was precisely the 15th because if I was to try to confirm that, wouldn't be telling the truth, because I don't actually know exactly.
JUDGE KHAN:
But you left Gitarama on the 13th of May?
THE WITNESS:
What I do know, it was in mid-May.
JUDGE KHAN:
When did you leave Gitarama?
THE WITNESS:
To go where?
JUDGE KHAN:
You left Gitarama on 13th of May, didn't you say?
THE WITNESS:
Me?  No, I don't recall saying that.  Myself?
JUDGE KHAN:
On 13th of May? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Your Honour, it was the 30th, 30th of May that we left to Gisenyi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is very often difficult to hear the difference between 13th and 30th.  Thank you. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Let's go back over this, briefly.  So Mr. Ndindabahizi left for about a week around 
mid-May.  We agree on that point?
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	Did he go back to Gitarama after?
A.	Yes, I saw him after his return.
Q.	Now, during his absence, did you remain in Gitarama?
A.	Yes, we never left Gitarama.  Well, we did later to go to Gisyeni, as I mentioned.
Q.	Very well.  Now, besides that trip in mid-May, did Mr. Ndindabahizi leave Gitarama to go to another préfecture as far as you know?
A.	Yes, I think he went to a meeting convened by the prime minister in different préfectures, especially in Kibuye.  I think that he also went to Gikongoro, but I can't remember the dates.
Q.	Very well.  Let's speak about these meetings -- or this meeting.  Did he leave?  Well, how long did he leave?
A.	It was during the day.  It was just a day, during the day. 
Q.	Now, let's speak of other absences that you might have noticed.  Did he -- did he ever leave besides these times that you mentioned?
A.	No, I don't think so because we would regularly contact each other, until the point where it was unsafe to remain in Gitarama, because the RPF became stronger and stronger there. 
Q.	Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
These two one-day trips, Mr. Witness, do you remember when they took place?  Let's start with the meeting in Kibuye.  Do you know when that meeting took place, please?
THE WITNESS:
I really don't remember the dates, but I do know that it was in May. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember whether it was the beginning, middle or end of May?
THE WITNESS:
I think the Kibuye meeting was in early May. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about Gikongoro, then? 
THE WITNESS:
Gikongoro, I'm not sure.  What I do know is that the prime minister convened meetings during the month of May.  They were bundled together, but I don't remember the exact dates.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So your recollection is that also the Gikongoro meeting took place in May; is that so?
THE WITNESS:
I do believe so, but I'm not entirely sure.  I do know that the Kibuye meeting was in early May. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Lets go back to Gitarama.  When you worked with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, did you have a specific meeting time during the days with him?
A.	No, we didn't have, really, working -- specified working hours.  He only would come to see me when he needed to or wanted to.  Perhaps it was at ten o'clock in the morning or maybe later in the afternoon when I would find him there.  And he didn't have any schedule when he came to see me.  We never had specific meeting times.
Q.	To meet him, did you have to make an appointment?
A.	No, I did not.  He had a small office in Murambi.  He was with his employees there.  They were makeshift offices.
Q.	Did you meet Ndindabahizi himself or would you deal with state affairs with his collaborators?
A.	No, that information was given directly by me to Mr. Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Outside of the absences that you spoke about, was Mr. Ndindabahizi there every time you went to see him at his office?
A.	Most of the time I went there he was there.
Q.	Was he there even when you would show up unexpected to see him?
A.	Yes, he was.  He was so busy that he could rarely get away.
Q.	In spite of being busy, would it have been possible, during the month of April or May, for 
Mr. Ndindabahizi to leave for private issues without you knowing about it?
A.	I don't know.  I didn't see him every hour of every day.  It would be pretentious to claim that I did.
(Pages 8 to 15 by S. Eboe-Osuji)
























1530H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Did you ever know or learn that Mr. Ndindabahizi left his duties as minister of finance to distribute -- to go and distribute machetes in Kibuye, his native préfecture?
A.	No, I never learned of such a situation.  That would be surprising to me, especially because I know Ndindabahizi very well.  When we were together in '73 in Butare there were Hutu and Tutsi tensions, and he never had any animosity whatsoever against the Tutsis.  I don't know, but based on what I know about him, I don't think that he would be capable of doing such things. 
Q.	Now, besides his moral qualities, do these things seem physically or practically possible in your mind?
A.	Well, given the position of a minister, it seems unthinkable that a minister would distribute machetes to the population.  Perhaps a conseiller could do it, but a minister, would he really go out and do that?  Personally -- this is my personal opinion -- I don't think so. 
Q.	Leave your personal opinion aside.  Let's concentrate on the facts.  Can you say whether practically, would Mr. Ndindabahizi have the means and time to organise a trip to Kibuye to distribute machetes, given what you know?
A.	Materially that would seem impossible to me, especially given the distance between Kibuye and Gitarama, and given his work and his workload in Gitarama.  I don't know if he could be in the two places at the same time, but it seems very improbable to me that he could be.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, what is the distance between Kibuye and Gitarama? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember exactly.  It's pretty far, and the roads were not good. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
But I don't know the exact distance, especially since I've never been to Kibuye.
JUDGE KHAN:
Can you give us an approximate distance? 
THE WITNESS:
A hundred or so kilometres.  I'm not really sure. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	What was the state of the road between Kibuye and Gitarama in 1994?
A.	Well, it was still under repair.  All I know is that it was not easy to get there. 
Q.	Very well.  Sir, can you repeat, when did you leave Gitarama?
A.	We left Gitarama on the 30th of May.
Q.	Why?
A.	Because of the RPF advance.  We were told to pack up our things and leave as quickly as possible.  On that day the RPF began to attack the market, and so we had to quickly prepare ourselves to leave.
Q.	Where did you go after you left Gitarama?
A.	We went directly to Gisenyi with part of the funds.  We only had one truck.  When we arrived in Gisenyi, I returned back with two soldiers to get the rest of the money. 
Q.	Where did the government set up shop in Gisenyi?
A.	At the Meridien Hotel. 
Q.	And where did you stay when you were in Gisenyi?
A.	I went to my in-laws.  It was two kilometres from Gisenyi, so I would just go to their house. 
Q.	One clarification, there was one thing that is not clear.  Who did -- where did you live in Gitarama and where did you live in Gisenyi?
A.	In Gitarama -- oh, no, rather in Gitarama it was at my in-laws'.  At Gisenyi it was with my own parents.
Q.	Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in Gisenyi?
A.	Yes, from time to time, but we saw less of each other than in Gitarama.  But I would see him, because next to the Meridien Hotel there was an MRND office, and that's where people went to get passports quickly, because the situation was becoming serious and people were getting passports to be able to leave the country.
Q.	What was your work in Gisenyi?
A.	It was the same as it was before, the exact same job. 
Q.	And what was Ndindabahizi's work in Gisenyi?
A.	In principle, he had to do the same thing, but the situation changed.  There was practically chaos, save what you can.  Very few suppliers were paid, because the situation became very grave indeed.  It was chaos. 
Q.	During that period, starting from the 30th of May in Gisenyi, how often did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi? 
A.	Well, I would say not very often, perhaps once every three days, perhaps once every two days.  Not more than that. 
Q.	When did you leave Gisenyi?
A.	I spent the night at home, and on the 14th of July when I went to the office I saw that everything had been packed up.  I followed suit, so I left on the 14th of July in the morning, but there were so many vehicles on the road it took us two days to go to Goma.  When we arrived to Goma, it was two days later. 
Q.	Were you with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when you left Gisenyi?
A.	No, I was with my son, my wife, and other children had left on a bus which was transporting funds, in a bus or a truck.  I was in my own car.  That's why it took me two days to get across. 
Q.	Did Ndindabahizi stay in Gisenyi? 
A.	No.  When I arrived to Goma he was already there, and he had already set up there in Goma.
Q.	Does that mean that he left before you to Goma?
A.	In principle, yes. 
Q.	Thank you, sir.  I don't have many more questions for you.  Perhaps just one or two remaining questions.
MR. BESNIER:
I would ask the Registry for assistance for my last two questions, as I would like to distribute a document.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	I have given you a document, sir.  Do you have it before you?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you tell me, do you recognise this document?
A.	No, I hadn't seen it before till I was at the place I'm staying. 
Q.	You mean the place you are staying here in Arusha?
A.	Yes.  I hadn't seen it before that. 
Q.	What is this document?  Can you describe it for us?  What is it used for?  What is it?
A.	It is a document giving advice to witnesses on how they should behave themselves before the Tribunal. 
Q.	Can you look at page 9 of this document, please?
A.	Yes, sir.  Yes, I've found page 9.
Q.	What is page 9?
A.	This looks like a floor plan of a courtroom in -- of the Tribunal. 
Q.	On this floor plan, can you find the place where you are seated?
A.	Yes, I'm No. 2, at No. 2. 
Q.	Do you see what is indicated at No. 4?
A.	I see that the Accused is seated there at No. 4. 
Q.	In this courtroom can you see where the Accused is?
A.	Yes, I see him behind you, sir. 
Q.	Before coming into this courtroom, did you know where the Accused was?
A.	No, I saw this document in the house where I was staying. 
Q.	That's not my question, sir.  What I mean is, by reading this floor plan, would you have an idea of where the Accused would be seated in the courtroom?
A.	Not at first sight, no, sir.
Q.	Regarding this floor plan, would you have an idea if whether -- where the Accused is sitting; to the right of you, behind you, to the left of you?
A.	Well, I would have to look at how the courtroom is situated to know what side is right and left.
Q.	Well, now that you are in this courtroom, and after looking at this floor plan --
A.	I see that he is on the right-hand side.
Q.	Can you identify the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	Yes.  It's at No. 5, I believe.  Yes, at No. 5, to my left. 
Q.	Can you identify the Bench?
A.	Yes, the Judges are just in front of me. 
Q.	Can you see the seat of the Accused?
A.	Yes, it's to my right, at No. 4. 
Q.	Did you find this document when you came to the safe house?
A.	Yes, I found it when I arrived at the safe house.  There was a document in French and another one in Kinyarwanda.
Q.	This document is also in Kinyarwanda?
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Do all the witnesses get this document?
A.	Yes.  It's in the living room over there at the safe house. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I would, however, request that this document be tendered as the next Defence exhibit.  Thank you. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, the Accused is at your left or at your right?  Mr. Ndindabahizi is sitting at your left? 
THE WITNESS:
No, my left, my left.  I mixed the two up.  I'm sorry.  No, at my left, and the other is on my right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is, then, Defence Exhibit 48.
(Exhibit No. D. 48 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Prosecution, please. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness, and good to see you again.

Witness, I'm going to ask you some questions about your testimony in this courtroom, and if I ask you any questions that may seek to identify you or you feel uncomfortable with, please let me know, because some of them impact on the work that you did in 1994.  Do you understand that, sir?
A.	Yes, I do understand that, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Prior to the genocide of 1994, you were employed at the same institution that you have testified to this afternoon, were you not, sir?
A.	Yes, yes.  I've been working there since 1974, in actual fact. 
Q.	And you, in 1994, held the same position that you testified to in this courtroom earlier today?  Just a yes or no; don't repeat the position, please.
A.	Yes, the same position as I occupied since June 1993, I believe. 
Q.	And the institution that you worked for was what we, in my language, we call the bankers' bank, was it not, sir?
A.	Yes, in principle, because it's the one that oversees all the banks. 
Q.	Thank you.  And would I be correct in saying that by virtue of that function of that -- that oversight function, the bankers' bank regulates the functions of what we call the commercial banks, does it not, sir?
A.	Yes, sir, especially credit and exchange operations. 
Q.	Isn't it also true that most of the reserves of the commercial banks are always held by the bankers' bank?  That's why it is called the bankers' bank, isn't it, sir?
A.	No, not true.  Each bank was entitled to keeping its own funds.  The bank only oversaw the level of foreign exchange as far as the entire country is concerned, but it didn't have direct control over the commercial banks. 
Q.	Sir, that wasn't my question.  My question to you was as follows:  the bankers' bank, by regulatory authority, demands statutorily that commercial banks keep a certain amount of their funds with the bankers' bank; is that right?  They can't keep all their money in their own vaults, can they?
A.	To my knowledge, no.
Q.	Very well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you say no to now, Mr. Witness?  That became unclear.  So just what is your position?
THE WITNESS:
No, the banks' funds belong to the banks, but the use of the foreign exchange, it is done under regulations from the bank.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But are the commercial banks or the normal banks obliged to have part of their funds in the bankers' bank; that's the question. 
THE WITNESS:
No, not to my knowledge, that is not the regulation at national level as far as I'm concerned, if I refer to what I used to do before I was appointed, because before that I was also at the directorate for foreign exchange.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Very well, sir.  Now, your operation -- within your operation, how many staff did you have before the genocide, sir?
A.	About 15. 
Q.	And how many of those staff were of the Tutsi ethnic group, sir?
A.	I didn't ask them for their ethnic groups.  It is difficult to answer that question because I did not seek to know their ethnic groups.  It is a piece of information that I do not have.  I did not make any efforts to seek such information.  Probably somebody else can answer that question. 
Q.	Sir, is it your testimony, sir, that you were never aware of the ethnic groups in 1994 of those who worked with you, sir?
A.	No, they were Hutus and Tutsis, really.
Q.	Very well.  Let me ask you the question -- let me ask you the question in another way.  Did you have all 15 members of your immediate office after April 6th 1994?  How many of the 15 worked when you got to Gitarama; let's put it that way.
A.	Well, I used to work alone.  I used the commercial bank staff, especially for typing assignments and operations like crediting accounts.
Q.	That's precisely what I thought the situation was, sir.  Now, what had happened to the 15 or 14 or so staff that worked in your immediate office after April 6 1994, sir?
A.	I have no clue, sir. 
Q.	So when Mr. Ndindabahizi prevailed on you and others on the 12th of April at your in-laws' house, you had no idea what had happened to the 14 or so people or 15 people that worked in your immediate office, sir?  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	No, sir, I said that after the murder of the president there was a curfew and we all hid in our houses.  I was only able to go out on the 12th when the situation subsided.  We were able to leave Kigali.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Very well, sir.  So it would suffice to say that when you then moved to Gitarama you ran pretty much a one-man operation, didn't you, sir?
A.	No, sir.  There were other members of the team, including the accountant general or the auditor-general, who was the head of the mission.  He came next to the governor in this operation.  We had the director for banking operations, and there was also -- there were also two agents that were found in Gitarama.  They were responsible for producing cash-desk receipts.  So that as far as we were concerned, that was the team. 
Q.	Yes.  I'm more interested in, sir, of the members of your immediate office, would I be correct in saying that you were running a one-man operation, not the entire institution, but your operation, your unit?
A.	Yes, in my unit, my unit, I was practically alone, apart from the fact that I used people that I found there. 
Q.	And would I be correct in saying that there is a very obvious distinction, sir, between your role and the functions that you performed, the very practical function that you performed, and the role of people like the auditor-general and governors and things like that?  There was an obvious distinction, practically, on a day-to-day basis, was there not, sir?
A.	Absolutely.  Absolutely different.  Totally different, actually. 
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that based on that practical distinction, you ran a very manual operation?  It was not theoretical, it was manual, hands-on?  Is that a good way of describing your functions at the time?
A.	Manual, yes, but not routine, because it was not routine work.  There was some discretion to the exercise, for example, which account was to be credited, et cetera, et cetera, so that it was not routine.  There was some cross-checking of accounts or orders to be made beforehand, sir. 
Q.	Pardon me, Witness, I didn't imply at all that the work was routine.  What I actually meant was that it actually needed you physically to be present, it wasn't automated; that is what I was trying to say.  Do you understand that, sir?
A.	Yes, yes.  Yes, sir. 
Q.	You then testified earlier this afternoon that you then, because of the nature of your operation, of your unit, you needed to enlist the help of some people from some other bank; is that what you said, sir?
A.	Other people?  No, I -- there were bank officials that were there that helped me prepare the credit vouchers, and after that I handed it over to the payees, who got paid by the main cashier.  So that I had my own work and the others had their own work. 
Q.	And in terms of your office accommodation at the location you were between April and 30th May in Gitarama, you were located in the commercial centre in Gitarama with other commercial banks; is that not the situation?  You were using the facilities --
A.	Yes, it was at the commercial centre, because the two banks were next to each other, at about one kilometre one from the other inside Gitarama city, sir.
Q.	In other words, you were using the facilities of existing banking institutions, commercial banking institutions in Gitarama, were you not, sir?
A.	Yes, that were there in Gitarama. 
Q.	Now, whilst you --
A.	Yes, still in Gitarama, in the office of the commercial banks that were there. 
Q.	Now, whilst you were temporarily located in Gitarama, did you know a man by the name Gerard Kwangegyo, K-W-A-N-G-E-G-Y-O, Gerard, a young man who worked for Bank Kigali?
A.	No, I don't know him. 
Q.	Now, the government at the time was located in Murambi, was it not, sir?
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	And you testified earlier that as far as you were aware, Murambi was some two kilometres from Gitarama; was that not your testimony, sir?
A.	Two or three, I can't remember, approximately. 
Q.	I represent to you, sir, that it was, rather, four kilometres, sir; would you agree with me?  Could it have been slightly more?
A.	One kilometre, more or less.  I'm not saying precisely that it was three, but one kilometre plus or minus, I don't see the difference.
Q.	The location in Murambi consisted of what, where the government was located at the time?  What did that location in Murambi consist of?  What was it before the government got there?
A.	Before the government occupied those premises, I believe it was a training centre for cadets for Murambi, that is, for the central administration of Murambi.
Q.	So it was like a --
A.	It was where they trained civil servants, that is cadets. 
Q.	And it was -- it was a compound, it was an enclosure, wasn't it?  It was like a compound, it wasn't just on the street?  It had a main gate, didn't it?
A.	If I'm not mistaken, there was a main gate with several buildings inside, but the main gate was not always locked, perhaps with the exception of the night.

	1600H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you know why it was necessary for the government to move from Kigali to Gitarama, sir, at this time?
A.	Really I cannot answer that question because they could have done so in sovereignty -- in their sovereignty. They didn't talk to us to go there, and I don't know why they chose that location instead of another.
Q.	Would you agree with me if I represented to you, sir, that the government moved from Kigali to Gitarama for security reasons, sir?
A.	Certainly, because the city of Kigali was engulfed with fighting.  If not for reasons of security, perhaps for other reasons, because they couldn't worked in a city that was almost falling.
Q.	So, would you also agree with me, sir, that the location in Murambi afforded the government an element of security for at least six weeks, sir?  Would that be a fair assumption to make, sir?
A.	Security, it is quite relative.  Probably they were in greater security or not, but I'm sure if they chose that location it was because they were in greater security.  Perhaps there are other reasons to that effect, so to tell you the truth, I cannot give you my opinion on this one.
Q.	You testified that as far as you know the gate of the complex in Murambi was often open, except at night.  Is it therefore your testimony that you could go in and out of that compound at will?
A.	Yes, sir.  At any rate, whenever I went there it was open.  Yes, it was open.
Q.	And how did you go there, sir, did you walk, did you drive your car, did you -- how did you go?
A.	No, there was a vehicle of the national bank that we used in Gitarama.  There was a Combi minibus, a Nissan Combi minibus -- no, sorry, Toyota.  It was a Toyota.
Q.	And it is therefore your testimony that you could access that location any time you wanted to, couldn't you?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And remind me, the location we are talking about was the location that at the time housed the president of the republic, didn't it?  Yes or no, or was he somewhere else?
A.	No, he also had an apartment there.  Practically all the ministers had apartments there in those premises.
Q.	So the president was there, the prime minister was there, the entire cabinet was there, and it is your testimony that you could just access it at any time?
A.	No, not the apartments they lived in, but the office area, because there were different sections.  There was a section for the apartments and residences, and another section for the offices.  People could accede the office very easily (sic) -- or accede to the office or access them, but the other section, no.
Q.	Very well, sir.  Now, I want to talk you to about the sort of things that you did in terms of your functions.  Is it your testimony, sir, that you reported to someone other than Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?
A.	Yes, sir.  Yes, I did say so, sir.
Q.	And in terms of the hierarchy of your particular institution, you had, as your immediate superior, the treasurer or the director of finance; which one came first?
A.	Who came first?  It was my boss, that is the cashier general, who at that time was sick, unfortunately.  He was there but he didn't do much because he was ill.  By the way, he died later on.
Q.	And after him was who -- came who?
A.	After him, it was the auditor general, who oversaw the entire staff of the national bank apart from the governor -- or, rather, instead of the governor, that is, on behalf the governor.
Q.	And then the governor himself?
A.	After the governor you mean? 
Q.	No, and then came the governor?
A.	No.  It was the auditor general who was practically the overall head, and then the governor.
Q.	Very well.  And in terms of the dealings with the ministry of finance, who was in charge of that liaison between the two institutions prior to the genocide?
A.	Before the genocide, at what level?  At the level -- as the overall -- as the overall supervisor?  Well, firstly, I dealt directly with the treasurer who gave out instruction for payments who was under the orders or instructions of the ministry of finance, sir.
Q.	Where did the chef de cabinet and the director of budget feature?
A.	The chef de cabinet, I didn't deal with him before and even after, because the chief of cabinet was between his minister and the other ministries.  It was not with us that he worked.
Q.	So despite the fact that you didn't have any official established lines of -- reporting lines, it is your testimony, sir, that during this critical period in the country you had reason to report directly to 
Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, sir?
A.	Yes, I said so and I underscore that.  It was upon the expressed request of the governor the national bank who told me that I could report thus to Ndindabahizi directly if he needed such information.
Q.	Did you have any official correspondence between yourself and Mr. Ndindabahizi at this time?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	Everything was off the cuff, informal, oral?
A.	Well, apart from the fact that I used to give him figures of payments which were made out to suppliers and for salaries, I gave him the balance as well, and that was on a piece of paper and he used it as he wished, sir.
Q.	So you would write, for example, two million dollars on a scrap piece of paper and just show it to him that that's what the government has got in the bank; it's that sort of thing?  That was the way it worked, didn't it?
A.	Well, that's not the way to operate, but if I gave him information, whether it was in writing or not, it was between himself and me.  He did what he wanted to do with the information because the governor had -- the governor had confidence in him and he was the boss too.  I could have told him verbally or given it to him in writing.
Q.	Very well.  Now, why was it necessary on the 12th of April for you to -- for Colonel Bagosora to come and pick you up at your in-law's house and take you into the complex in Murambi?
A.	It was not Bagosora that came to fetch me from my in-law's, it was Ndindabahizi, I said, himself.
Q.	You are correct, pardon me.  I meant on the 13th, the following day, not the first day, the 13th of April.  Why was it necessary for the soldier or whoever picked you up and -- why was that necessary?  Why didn't you just drive into the complex yourself?
A.	Well, they came to my in-law's very early in the morning and they came to fetch me in a vehicle.  Of course I could walk down there, but it is rather far.  From my house to Murambi -- from my in-law's to Murambi, already from my in-law's to the city is one kilometre, plus four kilometres on foot.  I believe it was natural for them to come and fetch me by a vehicle.
Q.	But you had the Combi, the Combi belonging to your institution, which I don't want to be tempted to mention.  Where was the Combi at that time?
A.	But the Combi only started working with us later on.  At that time it was in Kigali.  We only took it when we went to Gitarama.
Q.	And the previous day, how had Mr. Ndindabahizi become aware that you had arrived in Gitarama and were lodging at your in-law's?  Did he know your in-law's house beforehand, sir?
A.	Yes, yes, because he was a friend of my wife's aunty who also lives very near my in-laws, very near the -- opposite the Gitarama market actually.
Q.	Yes, that's what I thought.   In fact, he was some distant relative, was he not, sir?
A.	Not to my knowledge.  I knew him, but before that date, I did not meet him apart from the time we were at university.  He'd gone his own way and me, mine.
Q.	I was just going to come to that.  But despite the fact that he was able to find his way to your in-laws' house on his own on the 12th of April, it was you testimony earlier in this Court that you hadn't set eyes on this man since you left university.  Wasn't it, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And during all the time that you both worked in Kigali, him at his place of work at the ministry of finance, and you at your place of work, the place where we've discussed already, it is your testimony, sir -- wait a minute, sir, wait, wait, wait, just wait --
A.	Already --
Q.	It is your testimony, sir, that you never ever had any official business with each other, let alone personal, sir?
A.	Yes.  At any rate, he was only appointed director of cabinet when the parties were there.  He was director of cabinet for PSD.  It was -- it was very recently that he had -- he was appointed minister of finance.  Before that I didn't know where he worked.  Even at the time he was director of cabinet, I knew about it but I didn't meet him at the time.
Q.	Sir, he had been the director of cabinet for two years before the genocide, sir, 1992; two years.
A.	No.  In 19 -- with the advent of the parties; is that correct? 
Q.	You think about it. 
A.	It is possible, but I wasn't interested in that.  I didn't go and see him at the ministry of finance, at any rate.
Q.	More importantly, sir, you didn't have any official reporting lines or connections with him since 1992, did you, you didn't, no?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Very well.  Sir, were you a member of the crisis committee at the institution where you worked in 1994?  Did the institution have a crisis committee and were you a member of it?
A.	I never knew about any crisis committee at the national bank.  There was never any.  We just worked as normally as possible.
Q.	And is it your testimony that during the month of April -- I'm not talking about May now -- the month of April, Mr. Ndindabahizi did not leave Murambi at all?
A.	Not to my knowledge.  I saw him practically every day.
Q.	And is it also your testimony, sir, that you saw him everyday because you worked officially with him, and you sometimes socialised with him in the evening, sir?  That's how come you saw him every day, sir.
A.	Yes.  And on formal occasions sometimes after work he would find me at the aunt's house that I spoke about.  We would talk for a few seconds and then he would leave.  Or before going home I would see him in Murambi.  He was coming -- he would come in front, pass by, but the conversations we had was at the aunt's house.  Sometimes I would go to see that old woman that was his friend for a long time.  She was a friend of his family. 
Q.	And it is your testimony that you are able to account for movement -- listen to this very carefully -- from at least the 15th of April 1994 to the end of the month of April, isn't it, sir?
A.	No, I did not assert that.  I said that I saw him from time to time, but I did not follow him every single hour.  I could not know where he was every day of every minute -- every minute of every day, rather.  We would meet sometimes 10 minutes in Murambi, but it doesn't mean that we were always together.
Q.	Let me rephrase my question.  Is it your testimony that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at least every day?
A.	Yes, once or twice a day.
Q.	Now, between at least the 12th to the end of April, not the 15th, the 12th; is that not correct, sir?
A.	No, not from the 12th; from the 15th.
Q.	Why not?
A.	Because on the 12th I saw him in the morning -- no, no, on the 12th he came to see me one evening.  The 13th we left to Kigali.  The 13th in the morning I saw him.  We had finished transferring the funds and documents on or around the 14th, I believe, and we began work on the 15th.
Q.	So, let's go over it.  12th, one sighting, p.m., correct?  You saw him once on the 12th, in the evening?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Location, your in-law's, correct?
A.	Yes, yes.
Q.	Second sighting: first thing in the morning, 13th; location, Murambi?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Fourteenth, no sighting?
A.	No.
Q.	Then 15th to -- I don't know how many days April has, perhaps 30 -- 15th to 30th April you saw him every day, at least once a day, at least?
A.	Yes, you had that -- that is correct.
Q.	I just wanted to make sure I got you right.  Now, let's go to the month of May.  Now from the 1st of May to the 31st of May, you saw him at least, at least once a day, save for the period when he was in Nairobi for seven days on mission at a time which you can't remember, but some seven days.  For the rest of that month you saw him at least once every day until the end of that month, sir?
A.	Up until the 28th May, because on the 28th of May before we moved, there was a dangerous situation in Gitarama and I think people left before us.  You could no longer move about because there were bombings very close. 
Q.	So what happened on the 28th; 28th you stopped seeing him?
A.	The 28th and 29th we couldn't go to Murambi, the fighting was coming closer.
Q.	So when was the last time you saw him before the fighting started getting closer, 20-something; do you remember?
A.	I saw him from the 27th but from the 28th I no longer saw him.  But I saw him in Gisenyi upon our arrival on the 30th.
Q.	Okay, so you saw him on 27th, you didn't see him on the 28th, you didn't see him on the 29th, but you saw him in Gisenyi on the 30th of May?
A.	Yes, yes.
Q.	Now, let's go to the month of June.  Did you see him every day from the 1st of June to the 30th of June, sir, at least once a day?
A.	I told you that I saw him not as often as I would in Gitarama, and I would see him once every two or three days in Gisenyi.
Q.	And this was despite the fact that you had to combine seeing him with your duties at the time, which was as you state them to be.  You did your work and you also met with him throughout this 
three-month period, sir?
A.	In Gisenyi, I also said that work was not as regular as it was in Gitarama.  The situation had completely changed.  Even our contact with each other was limited.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
I have no re-examination, Mr. President.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have one question.  

Where was the governor during the period April to May, and May to June?
THE WITNESS:
	He was also in Gitarama.  He would also come to see me from time to time, but I saw him less often.  He would come to see me, he would return to Murambi.  I saw him not so frequently because we had a direct supervisor who -- the controller general who supervised the work.
JUDGE BOSSA:
So both the governor and the controller general were present there and available? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, but the governor and the controller met often.  The controller general would give information from him to us.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I understand a minister of finance to be a political head in that ministry. 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes.  Not only political, though.
JUDGE BOSSA:
But you have stated that the Accused would -- did you say would approve, or look at which 
	suppliers --
THE WITNESS:
	There were contracts.  The interim government had decided to give advances to the suppliers because they could no longer get credit to buy supplies.  So the government asked the banks to give it advances.
JUDGE BOSSA:
So what was the role of the Accused in that as a political head of the ministry of finance? 
THE WITNESS:
	As a political authority, I don't know.  I know what I did with him, but on a political level, I don't know what his responsibilities in that manner would have been.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And what did you do with him?  If you could repeat that for me, please.
THE WITNESS:
	What we did together?  Well, I would only meet him to give him the information he requested, but we would not discuss politics.  Politics was not something I dealt with.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Did he give you instructions on what to do about suppliers and things like that? 
THE WITNESS:
	No.  He only wanted information on the deposits in the coffers.  And he needed that information on -- such information to be able to distribute the vouchers and decide on which suppliers to use.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you have given detailed description of his activities in Gitarama, Gisenyi and Ngoma.  Admittedly, Mr. Ndindabahizi was not you boss, or you were not his subordinate or his secretary.  You were only helping him with financial information under the direction of the governor of the national bank.  Could you tell us --
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, upon instructions of the governor.
JUDGE KHAN:
Could you tell us, how did you get to know his personal day-to-day activities in those cities, such as visiting -- receiving the visitors, suppliers looking for him, and his other personal activities? 
THE WITNESS:
	I would see the suppliers who would go to see him when I went to Murambi.  Regarding his other activities, I said that I would go to give him information but not really to see what he was doing outside of the times I would see him.  I supplied him with the information and he would continue to work with his team.  I didn't know in detail what all of his activities were.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This period from the 15th of April to the end of April, on one occasion you said that, "I used to see him practically every day".  On another occasion you said, "I saw him once or twice every day".  Now, what is exactly the correct description of the frequency, Mr. Witness, in this period? 
THE WITNESS:
	Once or twice.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you ever a member of any political party after --
THE WITNESS:
	Not a member, but I was a supporter of the MRND.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that also after the multiparty system? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes.  But before we were automatically members of the MRND.  After that, each individual could make his or her own choice.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, that's why I asked that question; that's why I asked that question.  So you had no affiliation with the PSD, for instance?  That's the point.  You had no PSD affiliation either?
THE WITNESS:
	No, Your Honour.  I was not an activist either in the MRND, but I did support that party. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  This brings us to the end of your testimony.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to give testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home, and please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much, indeed.
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will now be accompanied out, Mr. Witness, and then we will just have a few technical practical issues at the end.
	(Witness excused)

	1630H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  That was the end of the week, Mr. Besnier, but we have to plan the week in one week.  So could you, maybe, now indicate the schedule for the week in about a fortnight or in ten days?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  For the week of the 10th, 10th to the 17th, we, unfortunately, will not have any witnesses to present.  In fact, we have very few left.  We are waiting for Witness DD who can be in  Arusha on the 17th of November, that would be a Monday, and who can start testifying on that same day.  

We are also waiting for the expert witness, who can be in Arusha on the 17th of November in the evening.  We could like to work with the expert at least for the day, the following Tuesday, so that he would be able to testify on the 18th of November in the afternoon, and I think that one day will be sufficient for the examination-in-chief, and that would enable the Prosecution to cross-examine on the 19th of November, 19th or - - 20th.

After that we will have the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  If we look at our calendar, I think that he can begin testifying on the 24th of November, if my math is correct.  I think that examination-in-chief of Mr. Ndindabahizi should last approximately half a day, perhaps one whole day -- one whole day, perhaps, in examination-in-chief.  

In other words, I should have finished my case by the 26th of November at the very latest. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. And in fact there is some possible room here if you look at period from the 17th to the 21st.  Maybe we would even proceed a bit faster than you just outlined.  But at any rate, DD goes first, then some time, then the expert and then Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
MR. BESNIER:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you very much.  

All right, the parties finished their examination and cross-examination within the estimates they gave yesterday.  Thank you very much.  

Thank you to everyone in the courtroom for having been sitting this afternoon, and we wish you a very good weekend.  Thank you.  
	(Court adjourned at 1635H)
