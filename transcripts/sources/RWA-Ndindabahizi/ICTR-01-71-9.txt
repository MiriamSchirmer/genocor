EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Mr. Witness, where were you living when the president died on the 6th of April l994?
A.	I was living in the Gasero locality.
Q.	Is that place in Gitesi commune?
A.	Yes, it is in the Gitesi commune.
Q.	Now, following the death of the president, did violence break out in your area?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what violence you observed, Mr. Witness, during the first week following the death of the president?
A.	Following the death of the president, our Hutu neighbours chased us out and we sought refuge elsewhere.
Q.	Do you know why your good neighbours chased you from your areas?
A.	They wanted to kill us and then appropriate our property.
Q.	Did there come a time, Mr. Witness, that you sought refuge at Gitwa Hill?
A.	No, it was the Gitwa Hill, and that is where we went.
Q.	Was there a particular reason why you chose this particular place to go and hide, Mr. Witness?
A.	We were chased out of our houses.  We lived at the foot of a hill, and we went on the hill, and those who attacked us, attacked us from the foot of the hill, and we decided to go up to the summit of the hill.
Q.	Can you tell the Court the approximate time you went to seek refuge at Gitwa Hill?
A.	It was around the 15th April l994.
Q.	Did you go there alone or with members of your family, Mr. Witness?
A.	We were many who went there.  I went with my entire family as well as my neighbours.
Q.	When you talk of your family, who do you -- who are the people that are included as members of your family?  Don't mention names, just mention their relationship.
A.	My children, my wife, my big brother's children, as well as my cousins, then, of course, the neighbours.  Everybody left his house and we went to Gitwa.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a person by the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber when you first got to know him?
A.	I got to know him when he was working at the Kibuye Trafipro.
Q.	Can you tell us the period in which Mr. Ndindabahizi was working at the KibuyeTrafipro?
A.	It was in 1980.
Q.	Was it during the first part of the 1980s or the second part just after -- was it between 1980/85 or 1985/89?
A.	In 1985 I used to go to Kibuye in the Trafipro shop to buy some clothing items.  There were people who were working there, but they said that he was the manager of Trafipro.
Q.	During that period, Mr. Witness, were you living in your own house or you were living with somebody?
A.	I was still a bachelor and I lived in my parents' house.
Q.	Considering the year you were born, would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that you were in your 20s during the 1980s?
A.	Yes, I was 23 years old.
Q.	Now, what kind of provisions were you buying - were you going to buy at the Trafipro during that period?
A.	I was going to buy clothes for my younger brothers.  My father had died already, and my mother would send me to go and buy clothes or salt -- or soap, because their prices were low.  So these were the kind of items that I bought from Trafipro.
Q.	Can you tell us now how you knew that Mr. Ndindabahizi was working at that place at that time when you went to buy those provisions?
A.	I should know, because I was living in an urban cellule and when somebody is a bourgmestre or préfet in the area you lived in, you should know.  I was living in the urban cellule in which the tower was located.
Q.	Can you tell us what exactly Mr. Ndindabahizi was doing in Trafipro?
A.	He was manager -- he was shop manager at Trafipro.
Q.	How did you know, Mr. Witness, that he was the shop manager in that shop?
A.	There were tailors who were sewing clothes there, and when I was passing by or whenever I went there to collect clothes, I had the opportunity to know the people who were working there.  That is how I came to know.
Q.	Right.  You have testified that following the outbreak of violence in your -- the locality you lived, you went to Gitwa Hill.  Can you tell us, approximately, when you moved to Gitwa Hill?
A.	On the 15th, that is the day I got to the Gitwa Hill.
Q.	Now, while at Gitwa Hill, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I saw him there.
Q.	How long was it after you had gone to Gitwa Hill, when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I had spent about two days there.
Q.	Now where were you located when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I was at Gitwa Hill, which is close to the road; Ndindabahizi arrived around 2 p.m. in a white vehicle.  There was another green vehicle.  He was holding a grenade, and he had other grenades attached to his belt.  Aboard the green vehicle, there were soldiers and Interahamwe, and there were grenades as well aboard that vehicle.
Q.	Now, can you tell us how many people were in the white Toyota?
A.	Most of the people involved were aboard the green vehicle, and aboard the white vehicle there was Ndindabahizi and the driver.  There were two of them in that vehicle.
Q.	Can you tell us how many soldiers and Interahamwe were in the green Daihatsu?
A.	There were many.  I was not able to count them.  When you are being attacked, you do not have the time to count your attackers.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you described the people who were in the Daihatsu as soldiers and Interahamwe, how do you know they are soldiers and who is the Interahamwe?
A.	The Interahamwe were wearing white clothes, and the soldiers were in military uniform.
Q.	Now, what else was -- apart from people, what else was in those vehicles?  What else did you see?
A.	Grenades were off-loaded from -- grenades and ammunitions were off-loaded from that vehicle.
Q.	What kind of ammunition did you observe, Mr. Witness, and from which vehicle?
A.	These ammunitions were off-loaded from the green vehicle.
Q.	Now, while this was going on, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say anything?  Did you hear him say anything or do anything?
A.	These people came out.  They had already come out of the vehicle, they parked the vehicle and they got close to him, and you understand that a meeting was going to take place there.  When they got close to him, they stood at a distance, and Ndindabahizi then threw a grenade and we dispersed.  There was a certain Jean who was the agronomist of the commune, and he said that, "Has Ndindabahizi also come to kill us?"  We then left, because the Interahamwe were chasing us.

These are the circumstances under which I saw Ndindabahizi.  It was in the afternoon, not in the morning.
Q.	Witness, you have stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi was in a crowd of many attackers.  How were you able to recognise him?
A.	He was the first to get out of his white vehicle together with his driver.  I identified him because I had known him since the '80s.  Well, obviously I hadn't seen him for a long time when he went to Kigali.  I saw him again during the war after the death of President Habyarimana.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement of 6th of April -- of 4th June 2001, you state that you got the impression that Mr. Ndindabahizi was the leader of the attackers.  Did you say that in your statement, Mr. Witness?
A.	When he -- when the attackers got close to him and they got together, since he was a minister, the agronomist -- Jean, the agronomist recognised him and said, "You have to run."  There are soldiers and even Ndindabahizi has come from Kigali to kill the Tutsi."  People were killed.  Children and women were killed.  I managed to escape, and we went to the Karongi antenna, and in the evening we left the place.
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me rephrase my question.  Did anything give you the impression -- an impression that among the attackers --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was in charge of the attackers, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
It was Ndindabahizi, because he was the most influential personality there.  He was a minister, and he was the leader.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is there anything else that gave you an impression that Mr. Ndindabahizi was the leader of the group?
A.	He was leading, he was the minister.  Indeed, he was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead, and he came to his native préfecture to lead the attacks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what the Prosecutor wants to know is whether there was anything in the way he acted during that day which gave you the impression that he was the leader, or whether it was simply because you knew that he was a minister which gave you that impression.
THE WITNESS:
No, there was nothing else.  He was the first person to get out of the vehicle; he was the first person to throw a grenade.  Following that, his men did the same and killed our people.  He was the first to throw the grenade.  If he had remained in Kigali, we would understand, but is it only in Kibuye that there are Tutsis?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after Mr. Ndindabahizi had come out of the vehicle and before the attack, can you tell us how long you observed him?
A.	After he threw the grenade and the attackers ran after us, we all ran, including myself.  I could not stay on the spot, I ran.  People were falling, people were dying.  We didn't know where to go, and we realised that those who were expected to protect us were the ones who were killing us.
Q.	Mr. Witness, my question is this:  Before you ran, how long had you been observing Mr. Ndindabahizi, that is, before he threw the grenade that made you run away?  For how long had you been observing him, that is, from the time he got out of the vehicle and to the time he threw the grenade.  Can you help us with that?
A.	Not many minutes before these people started running after us.  I saw the Interahamwe and the soldiers come out.  They distributed the grenades.  How do you expect us to remain there when we know that the situation is serious?  Some were running faster than others.  We did not have any weapons, so we could not fight back the attackers.  So there was nothing to do apart from running.

Normally, soldiers will ensure the security of the people.  After the death of the president, there were ministers and members of parliament who attacked us.  We had no protection, and the purpose was to appropriate our belongings.  The person who killed the most number of people would be rewarded in terms of our belongings.  Our fate was sealed at that time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you start to run before the grenade was thrown?
THE WITNESS:
I ran after the grenade was thrown, and there were a lot of people.  The grenade was thrown on those people who were close to the one who threw the grenade.  Following that the attackers surrounded us.  Those being attacked spread around, they ran in various directions.  There were even guns.  There was a sub-machine gun positioned at the top of the hill and many people were killed  as a result of the bomb that was thrown.  There were various types of firearms.  A lot of people were killed on that occasion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you wait a little bit, now, Witness?  Can you wait a little bit?  You see, you have a lot of information you want o tell us, but we have to take this step by step.

Now, you just told us that you started to run after the grenade was thrown, and Mr. Kapaya's first question was the following:  "For how long did you observe Mr. Ndindabahizi" --  or the person that you say is Mr. Ndindabahizi - "for how long did you observe that person until you started to run?"  Was it after one minute, more than one minute, less than one minute?  In other words, how much time passed -- I have not finished -- just a minute -- from the time when he got out of the car until you started to run.  Can you please help us with that?
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't say that a lot of time elapsed, maybe one minute.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, did you observe in which direction -- did Mr. Ndindabahizi stay on during the attack or did he leave when the attack was launched?
A.	He went up with the Interahamwe.
Q.	Did you see him again in the course of that day?  Did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi in the course of that day?
A.	It was in the evening.  I ran immediately I could see people falling, and I could not come back.  I continued running to the hill until night.  So I could not come back to the place.
Q.	Now, did members of your family survive that attack, Mr. Witness?
A.	They are dead.
Q.	While at Gitwa, did you observe another attack after --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, these family members, did they die during the attack on that day, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, at Gitwa Hill, did you observe another attack after the attack you just described before this Tribunal?
A.	Yes, there was another attack later on, but the first attack cost -- took the lives of my relatives, and the second attack took the lives of those who survived the first attack.
Q.	How long was the second attack from the first one?  How many days passed before the second attack took place?
A.	I would say three days.
Q.	Did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi during the second attack?
A.	On that day I did not see him.
Q.	After the second attack, Mr. Witness, did you stay at Gitwa Hill or did you go to some other place?
A.	The second attack eliminated everybody and there were only dead bodies on the hills.  And the very few survivors on the hill, together with myself, went to Bisesero.
Q.	Can you tell this Tribunal when you went to Bisesero?  About after how many days or weeks after the second attack did you go to Bisesero?
A.	I stayed in the bush for four days, and the attackers started burning down the bush and chasing us with dogs, and the few survivors were running so as to escape from the Hutus who were looking for us.
Q.	What part of Bisesero did you go, Mr. Witness?
A.	I went to the Muyira locality of the Bisesero region.
Q.	Now, while at Muyira, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	No, on that day I did not see him.  Many soldiers and Interahamwe and Hutus carrying clubs and machetes came, accompanied by members of the presidential guard who had come from Kigali with buses and trucks.  A survivor, who was killed the following day, told me that he saw Ndindabahizi.  On that day the Interahamwe had encircled the hills and we did not know where to go.  There were so many attackers that we could not move.  There was even no bush to hide in.  I did not -- I therefore did not see the Accused at that place.  If I had seen him I would have told you.  However, I have told you that one Kayinanura, who died subsequently, told me that he saw the Accused.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have talked at length about Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Can you kindly describe his physical features, the way you remember he looked at the time you saw him?
A.	He is a man of average height, with a short nose.  And his hair extends all the way to his forehead.
Q.	Would you say -- how would you place his age?  Would you say he is an old man, average, young man?
A.	But I am not his father to know his age.
Q.	Now, if I asked you to look around in this Chamber to see whether he is around: can you do that, Mr. Witness?  Can you recognise Mr. Ndindabahizi if you saw him today?
A.	Yes, I would know him.
Q.	With leave of the Chamber may the witness, Your Honour, stand up and look around and see whether he can recognise Mr. Ndindabahizi?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you kindly stand up and look around and see whether you can see anybody resembling Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	I can see him there at the back to that side, but what I am saying here is not a fabric of lies.  I am talking about facts.  I have never lied about anybody.
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, how he is dressed?
A.	He is wearing a white shirt, and I can see that the colour of his vest is the same as that of my pullover -- almost the same.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour may the record reflect that the witness has identified the Accused person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. BESNIER:
I would like to mention that the Accused is the only person of the male sex who is black and who is in civilian clothing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted.
MR. KAPAYA:
That is all I have for this witness, Your Honour.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Now, Witness, this attack at Muyira Hill, how many days passed from the last attack at Gitwa Hill until this Muyira Hill attack?
THE WITNESS:
I didn't quite follow, you know, it is as if I had lost my head.  The situation didn't lend itself to -- I was trying to survive as much as I could and I was living from day to day, waiting for my death.  So I wasn't able to follow so that I can give you an exact duration.  I was living on a hill on which there were many, many dead bodies, and we were not counting days.  The situation continued to be what I have described to you until the arrival of the French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you said in your testimony that, "I stayed in the bush for four days."  And what I want to know now is whether this attack at Muyira did then take place, rather, immediately after those four days or a certain number of days after those four days, so that we could have an approximate idea as to when the second attack was, this one at Muyira.  Can you help us with this, please?
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to the period when I was in Bisesero?  I spent four days at Gitwa and many people were exterminated there.  So we went down to the other hills, lower down where there were ruins.  In fact, most of the people had been killed at Gitwa, and there were very few survivors at Gitwa.  It was the few survivors who then went onwards to Bisesero, and in the ruins we were able to find something to eat.

When the Hutus of all the secteurs met, they decided to burn down the bushes and to chase away the survivors with the help of dogs.  So after the four days following he attack on Gitwa, the night of the fourth day, the few survivors went by night to Bisesero, and therefore, to Muyira.  And when we got to Muyira, what happened I have already described, and then the French found us there.

So that is how the events developed. Subsequently, at end of the war, we were settled in the various communes and the Interahamwe -- the Hutus who had chased us were arrested by the soldiers in the bushes where they were hiding.  They were arrested and put in prison.  We were then able to go back to our ruins.  That is how the events occurred.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So after those four days, then you moved on to Muyira Hill?  And would you say that the attack at Muyira Hill took place then in April or did it take place in May?
THE WITNESS:
That attack took place in May.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the attack at Muyira Hill, the second attack where someone said that he saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, that was in May.  Is that your testimony, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was in May.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Defence, please.

MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  I am going to ask you a few questions.  I am the lawyer for
 Mr. Ndindabahizi, and I am seeking some clarification from you.

I will begin with the continuation of the question put to you by the President.  How long did you remain in Bisesero, and or specifically, at Muyira Hill, Mr. Witness?
A.	I remained in that place until the end of the war.
Q.	Is it correct to say that there were several attacks on Muyira Hill?
A.	Yes, there were many attacks.  We were flushed out of the bushes until the time when the Interahamwe stopped attacking us and Hutu civilians took over in order to look for the few survivors in collaboration with the bourgmestres and the conseillers of the secteurs.  They set the bushes on fire and those who were lucky enough were not burned, and the French came at a given point in time to evacuate the wounded and take them to Zaire.  We were assembled in the same place, we were fed and were put on a vehicle and we were transported to a place known as Gitarama.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Please listen carefully to the questions.  It is not necessary for you to go into a long explanation, just please be precise and give me short answers.  I would appreciate that.  Did you see at Muyira, that the attacks at Muyira Hill were of a larger scale than elsewhere?

Did you notice that?
A.	At the time when we were chased from Muyira, the following day the attackers dispersed us from Muyira I can say that on those two occasions those were large-scale attacks, but, otherwise, there were several attacks and the whole hill had dead bodies on it.
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember approximately the dates of these two wide - large-scale attacks on Muyira Hill?
A.	We had kind of lost our heads, Counsel.  We didn't have a calendar to keep track of dates.  We didn't have a specific programme.  We were living waiting for death.  So we didn't have a heart to be keeping track of dates.
Q.	Subsequently, the newspapers, television, refugees associations spoke, in particular, of two attacks at Muyira.  You didn't even notice what those dates were, even subsequent to the events themselves?
A.	Is that referring to the month of April?  I am speaking about what I saw.  You are talking about newspapers, but I don't know about newspapers.  I am telling you what happened, and I was there in that place.  I didn't leave that place.  From the time I left Gitwa, I remained on Gitwa until the end of the war.  So I am explaining to you what I saw.  I didn't seek refugee anywhere else apart from Muyira.
Q.	Very well.  One small clarification -- one small point of clarification.  At the beginning of your testimony, you mentioned one Jean, the agronomist, who allegedly said that Ndindabahizi came to Gitwa.  You also spoke of Bisesero and you said that one Jean Kayinamura had said that he had seen Ndindabahizi.  Would that be the same person?
A.	There are two different people, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember having made any written statements before the Tribunal's investigators, and if so, how many did you make?
A.	Well, people would come and question me.  I didn't count the number of statements which I made.  The investigators would come to see me, they would tell me, "You know, one day you may be asked to testify in Arusha."  So I didn't count the number of times the investigators came to see me.
Q.	Do you recall having seen the Tribunal investigators on several occasions?
A.	I wouldn't really say many times.  I think that I saw them on three occasions, and today's occasion is the third - is the fourth occasion.
Q.	Very well.  In any case the Defence has two written statements which you made before the investigators of the Tribunal.  Would that situation seem to you probable or correct that they are indeed two statements?
A.	I think that you should have three statements.  I made three statements.
(Pages 1 to 11 by Regina Limula)




















1500H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  The Defence only has two, and we have worked only on those two.  There is one which is dated 4th June 2001, and the second is the 26th April 2001.  So, in other words, just a little more than one month elapsed between the first and the second statements.  Was it you who asked to be interviewed again by the investigators after your first statement, or is it the investigators themselves who asked you to return?
A.	They came back of their own initiative. 
Q.	Very well.  I'm asking you the question, Mr. Witness, because in your first witness statement -- in other words, that of the 26th April 2001 -- you said that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was simply watching the fighting at Gitwa, but in the second statement you state that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in the fighting, threw grenades and distributed machetes.  Why did you wait for a whole month for you to make that revelation to the investigators?
A.	I'm still insisting on what I told the investigators from the first time that they came to see me.  I don't know what you are talking about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, do you think your representation to the witness concerning the first statement is absolutely correct; in other words, whether the statement of the 26th of April is absolutely clear as to how you summarised it? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  In fact, I'm going to quote from that statement in order to be specific.  In the statement from the 26th of April the witness said in the middle of the statement --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel please indicate which page?
MR. BESNIER:
Page 172 of the French version and page 169 in the English version.  Now, on page 172 -- 173 in the French version the witness says:  "Throughout the attack Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was there, he was present, watching the fighting between the two belligerent parties".
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is a free translation, because the interpreter has not yet found the English equivalent.  I'm sorry, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This French version, Maître, what are the first four words in French there on page 173?  Is it "Pendant tout la durée de l'attaque"?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, you are quite right, sir, it is "Pendant tout la durée de l'attaque".

MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So this would then be the last sentence, then, at the middle of the page; namely, counsel is drawing our attention to the English version, "The same afternoon", but then he is focusing on the last sentence of that paragraph which in English starts, "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack watching the fighting between the two adversaries". 

Mr Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  In the same paragraph, the third sentence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Without reading it out now, you are now drawing our attention to the third sentence in that paragraph? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  Actually it shows that what counsel has represented to the witness is not correct.  It shows that Mr. Ndindabahizi didn't simply watch what was taking place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So maybe we would have to see the whole paragraph in context.  I suppose that is the solution here. 
MR. BESNIER:
I'm not sure that I have the same version as the Prosecutor and the Judges.  I am referring to the document which is K0180696, that is my French version, and I do not seem to find the same paragraph in the English version.

Oh, yes.  I am at the sixth paragraph of the English version on page 169, paragraph 6.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And what Mr. Kapaya is drawing our attention to is the third line in that paragraph, and possibly also the first sentence.  So that is the problem if you focus on the last sentence.

Could you please proceed, Maître, in a way which takes into account these elements? 
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	So, now, in the first statement, Mr. Witness, you stated that two vehicles, including that belonging to Mr. Ndindabahizi, arrived transporting Interahamwe.  You also stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi came down from the vehicle with a grenade in his hand.  You also said that the two vehicles, including the one Ndindabahizi was in, were transporting the Interahamwe.  You further say they started attacking the refugees, first with grenades before they opened fire.  You stated that the survivors sought refuge to the top of the Gitwa Hill and that the attackers remained until 4 or 5 p.m. and they withdrew between 4 and 5 p.m., and then you end up by saying in that paragraph that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack, watching; in other words, looking at the fighting between the two adversaries. 

Right.  I think I have faithfully reproduced what you said.  And can you confirm that you did make such a statement to the investigators in the first instance?
A.	Yes, I did say as much. 
Q.	Very well, thank you.  Now, in the second statement, that one which is dated 4th June 1994 --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  I'm sure he means different.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	-- you say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi distributed machetes and that he himself threw a grenade.  So these are two pieces of information which do not appear in your first statement.  The question was -- please wait for my question.

The question is:  why did you wait for a whole month and the return of the investigators to say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi himself threw a grenade and distributed machetes?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may I come in again, because in the statement of April the witness says quite clearly that after Mr. Ndindabahizi had disembarked from the vehicle with a grenade, he started attacking the refugees, which is the same as what is stated in the second paragraph.  So it is not true that there are contradictions or discrepancies between the two statements. 
MR. BESNIER:
There is, however, a difference in having a grenade in one's hand and coming down from a car and throwing a grenade, and I think it would be up to the witness to tell us what the difference is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, that is the question.  The question is:  why did you in one statement say the following:  "He disembarked from the truck" -- that is Mr. Ndindabahizi -- "with a grenade in his hand", whereas in the second statement you say, "I saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, holding a grenade and then throwing it towards you".  Why is there two different formulations there? 
THE WITNESS:
It's not a contradiction.  He waited for the occupants of the green vehicle to approach him so that he can have a meeting, a small meeting with them, before moving into action.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Another question:  in the passage which I read to you, which I shall read again, you state -- this is the document of the 24th (sic) April 2001:  "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack, watching the fighting between the two adversaries", and you testified here that you only saw Ndindabahizi Emmanuel for one minute, so how were you able to say that you were able to observe Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout the attack?
A.	No, I didn't say that about that specific attack.  I said that when people started to kill us and throw grenades at us, I ran away immediately.  Had I remained, I would have been dead. 
Q.	Consequently you think that when you stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi was present throughout the attack, your words were misinterpreted by the investigators?  Is that what you are trying to tell the Court?
A.	They obviously misunderstood what I told them.  I never changed my statement.  I'm telling you what I told them.  And with regard to what I said about the Accused, that is not a lie. 
Q.	Another question on your statement of the 26th April 2001.  In that statement, at the end of that statement, let's say four paragraphs before the end, you state:  "Both at Gitwa and Muhira, Tutsi women were raped and subsequently killed, apart from the woman that you heard yesterday, all the women -- apart from the one you interviewed yesterday".  How did you know that a woman had already been interviewed by the investigators?

Do you want me to repeat the question for you, Mr. Witness?  You spoke to the investigators about a woman who had already testified to them on the eve of the day when you yourself were interviewed by the investigators.  How did you get to know this piece of information, that a woman had already testified before -- had already been interviewed by the investigators?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I think there is a technical problem.  Maybe the witness is not hearing what the interpreter is saying.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Can you hear my questions, Mr. Witness?
A.	Are you speaking to me?  I don't know anything about this woman.  I don't know anything about that woman. 
Q.	I'm not asking about her name, but I was just saying, how did you know that a woman had already been interviewed by the investigators and that she told them about rapes on Muhira?
A.	With regard to the women on Muhira and rapes, women were raped when we were fleeing.  Furthermore, others were speared at, immediately they were raped.  Others were crucified.  The person called Jean, the agronomist, his one ear was cut off, and another man was killed and decapitated.  At that time it was one Kayishema who was our prefét, and people would come and he would be shown the people whose heads had been cut off, and the people who had committed those crimes were rewarded.  So, you see, we were victims of serious forms of cruelty. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question now is -- many, many terrible things happened, of course, but the question now is, to whom did you refer?  How did you know, how did you know that one lady had been interviewed by the investigators the day before you were interviewed on the 26th of April 2001?  That is the question from Defence counsel this time.  Please. 
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about the investigations?  Well, I don't know this woman involving the preliminary investigations.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in your statement to investigators there is a sentence, and I will read it out to you now.  Now, I'm only quoting what is in this statement.  It reads as follows:  "Both at Gitwa and Muhira, Tutsi women were raped and subsequently killed", and then comes the part Defence counsel is interested in.  Here it comes:  "All the women were killed there", and then, "apart from the one you interviewed yesterday".  And his question is, how did you know that there was one interviewed the day before your interview? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know this woman you are talking about.  I really don't know him (sic). 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Witness, had you, during the investigation of the Tribunal, or before you came here, spoken to other survivors of Kibuye, other survivors of 1994 from Kibuye?
A.	Nobody.  Nobody. 
Q.	Between 1994 and today, have you been called upon to testify in the Rwandan courts on the 1994 genocide?
A.	I testified against those people who killed members of my family, and that before the court of first instance, and the accused persons have been put -- have been imprisoned, but following presidential pardon the accused persons confessed that they killed members of my family and they have been freed, and they are living in their houses now.  However, they confessed that they killed members of my family. 
Q.	Have you testified before the Rwandan courts -- or, had you testified before the Rwandan courts before you were interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR or after?
A.	No.  It was before I was interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR.  Besides, I was interviewed after the case had been -- a decision had been rendered in the case before the Rwandan courts. 
Q.	Had you ever told the Rwandan courts that you saw the former minister Ndindabahizi lead attacks on Muhira, throw grenades and participate in attacks together with the Interahamwe?  Did you tell them that?
A.	Do you think I will testify against somebody that I cannot see?  I can't do that.  If I had seen him, I would have testified against him, because he killed members of my family.  I could not accuse him, because he was not there.  But if I had seen him, given the fact that he killed members of my family, I was going to bring a complaint against him.  But I could not see him.  You cannot bring a complaint against somebody who is not present. 
Q.	You did say that you got to know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1985 at the Kibuye Trafipro.  Is that correct?
A.	I said, in 1980.  From 1985, I did not see him again. 
Q.	How many times did you see him between 1980 and 1985?
A.	Since 1985 I have not seen him again. 
Q.	Yes, but the question is, how many times did you see him between 1980 and 1985?
A.	I told you I didn't see him again.  I saw him -- I only saw him again during the war when we were on the Gitwa Hill.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not the question, Mr. Witness.  The question is the following:  based on your examination-in-chief, it is our understanding in this courtroom that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at the Trafipro, and we are under the impression that you first saw him in 1980 and that you did not see him after 1985.  Is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
From 1985 I did not see him again, but I used to see him in 1984, and I saw him after the death of Habyarimana when he came to Bisesero.  I could not have been -- I would not have been able to recognise him because of his age, but Jean said, "Do you see that even Ndindabahizi has come from Kigali to kill the Tutsi?"  And this Jean was the agronomist of the prefecture, so they used to meet in Kigali, but I never went to Kigali; I was a very ordinary citizen, and I stayed with my family.  That is why Jean said, "There he is.  There are no Tutsis to be killed in Kigali, now he's coming to kill people of his native region".  And he asked us to flee, and the attackers ran after us with grenades, and they were firing at us.

Why should I lie about him?  I have no -- I have nothing against him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And no one is accusing you of lying here, Mr. Witness, no one at all.  But what Defence counsel is about to ask you now is your observations of this person around '84, '85.  Now, listen carefully to his question, please.  Here it comes. 
THE WITNESS:
I have nothing to add to what I have already said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what is the question by Defence counsel?
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, how many times did you see Ndindabahizi before 1985 and after 1984?  This is the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I used to go to Trafipro to buy some items, so I cannot count the number of times I saw him.  My parents would send me to go and buy provisions.  So I was not interested in knowing the number of times that I saw the Accused.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, you said a while ago that in 1984 -- 1994, in Gitwa, you would not have been able to recognise Ndindabahizi, but it is Jean, the agronomist, who told us -- who told you that "Ndindabahizi is here".  Was it Jean who announced the presence of Ndindabahizi at Gitwa Hill?
A.	No.  I knew him much earlier.  I knew him, but Jean was talking to those who did not know him, but I was present there and I knew him.  Jean was talking to those people who did not know him, and you see, even here I can recognise him.  From where I'm sitting, I can recognise him.  And besides, since the end of the war, I have not seen him.  But I haven't  asked anybody to point out Ndindabahizi to me, for me to be able to identify him.  I am here, and he is on the other side.  

Why are you -- do you want me to -- do you want me to give a false testimony?  I'm saying I was present and I saw what happened. 
Q.	Witness, we will move faster if you give direct, precise answers to my questions.

Another question:  when you used to go to Kibuye Trafipro and you used to see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, what was he doing?  Was he selling goods?
A.	He was in his office, but there were shop assistants who were in charge of the selling. 
Q.	Very well.  Let's move on to events of 1994.  In your written statement you stated that you remained in your native cellule, but that you moved a bit to the hinterland of the country for reasons of security, particularly to Gitarama and Massango.  I want to know if Gitarama -- by Gitarama, are you referring to the prefecture or the secteur which is in Kibuye?
A.	It is Gitarama, more specifically Massango, where the French took us, and there the Inkotanyi were present and they were in charge of our security. 
Q.	But when did you move to Gitarama?  Was it in April, May or June 1994?
A.	It was in July, beginning of July. 
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court the exact date on which you arrived at Gitwa Hill?
A.	When you are fleeing and someone is chasing you, it is difficult to keep track of dates, because you become virtually like a mad person.  The attackers are destroying your houses, taking your belongings and chasing you around; you will not have the courage to keep track of dates, because you become like a mad person. 
Q.	Perhaps you could tell the Court approximately on which date you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the Gitwa Hill?
A.	It was around the 15th, 15th April, that is, middle of the month of April.
Q.	But you do not recall the date on which you came to Gitwa Hill, but you remember that it was on the 15th of April that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	This is just an estimate.  It was towards the middle of that month.  I did not specify the date. 
Q.	In your written statement, Witness, you said that you were attacked by the Interahamwe on the Gitwa Hill between the 13th and 14th April 1994.  Did you have a clearer memory of these dates then than now?
A.	I told you that this is just an estimate, because the Hutus started chasing us out of our houses soon after the death of Habyarimana, and people were fleeing and leaving behind them their cattle without taking anything with them.  So I am unable to tell you, because here you are fleeing with your children, you have abandoned your cattle; you will not have the courage to keep track of dates.  And in that kind of situation you have children who are crying and you have nothing to give them.  It is difficult to keep track of dates.  It is really difficult to recall dates. 
Q.	I understand that clearly, Witness.  Therefore, you will agree with me that this attack could have taken place on the 13th or 14th April?
A.	Around those dates, around those dates, because some time elapsed after the death of Habyarimana.  And besides, before we fled to Gitwa, before the Interahamwe attacked us, the Hutu people chased us, took our goats, and we left with our cattle.  Later on we had to leave our cattle and take refuge on the Gitwa Hill without taking our cattle with us, because our cattle had been taken by the people.  The Interahamwe came later on, and we had assembled on the Gitwa Hill.  Besides, they came to Gitwa after we had spent three days there on that hill.
Q.	Listen to me, please.  Can you hear me?
A.	Yes, I can hear you, Counsel.
Q.	Please answer my questions briefly and concisely, and don't go into -- don't develop them.
A.	I believe I have answered you.  I have not added anything.
Q.	Did the attack occur in the morning or in the afternoon?
A.	The attack took place in the afternoon.
Q.	Did the attack that Ndindabahizi participated in take place in the morning or in the afternoon?
A.	The attack took place in the afternoon. 
Q.	In your written statement of 26th April 2001 you said that "On either 13th or 14th April around 9 a.m. a large number of Interahamwe armed with machetes, grenades and knives attacked us, the Tutsi".  Was this in the morning or in the afternoon when this attack took place?
A.	There was an attack in the morning, but this attack was launched by the Interahamwe, and around 11 a.m. the attackers left, and in the afternoon Ndindabahizi came with soldiers.  But during the morning attack, there were no soldiers.  The soldiers came in, in the afternoon, together with the Accused and two vehicles.  The Interahamwe went back at 11 a.m., and another attack took place in the afternoon, and that attack was led by the Accused.  But I would say that the Interahamwe came to scout the field.

Do you think I can give a false testimony against the Accused?  I have nothing against him. 
Q.	Very well, Witness, thank you very much.  Please avoid comments.

You did say that during this afternoon attack Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and the other attackers were at the foot of the hill and the refugees were at the top of the hill.  Is that your testimony?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, besides the vehicles in which you said there was Ndindabahizi, before then were there other attackers or people who were at the foot of the hill?
A.	Yes, we were on the hill.  It's not a very high hill, it's close to the road.  However, the attackers of the morning did not come to fight because they didn't have weapons, they were not carrying weapons.  They came, and when they found a roadblock, they went back.  They came to scout around, to see the number of refugees on the hill.  It was to study the field.
Q.	Well, my question was this:  when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, according to you, came to the hill, were there already people present at the foot of the hill?
A.	No, it was not at the foot of the hill, it was on the hill.  There were a lot of people sitting on the hill.  It was a large crowd.  I would not be able to give you an estimate.  It was all the secteur.  I would say all the inhabitants of the secteur of the Gitesi commune who had met on this hill. 
Q.	Were there also Hutus who were waiting for Ndindabahizi who possibly participated in the attacks later on?
A.	During the afternoon attack there were only soldiers and Interahamwe, there were no civilian population.  There was no civilian population. 
Q.	Were all the soldiers and Interahamwe come in vehicles together with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, or some of them came on foot?
A.	They all came in vehicles.  However, in Ndindabahizi's vehicle he was alone with his driver.  Otherwise the others came with their Daihatsu, the green Daihatsu pickup.
Q.	And all in all, how many attackers were there in that vehicle?
A.	Do you think I would have been able to count the number of people aboard that vehicle; in addition, people who were coming to kill you, wielding grenades and guns?  I could not have counted them.  Even if -- granted that you are an officer, but I think sometimes you want to make life difficult for us.  You find yourself in that kind of situation, it is difficult. 
Q.	Yes, but give us an idea of the number.  Were there 10, 20, 50, 100 people?  Just give us an idea.
A.	I'm unable to give you an estimate.  There were many people who attacked an entire population that had gathered on a hill, and there were so many dead bodies.  I have nothing more to add to what I have already told you.
Q.	Now, the refugees on the hill, how many were they?  Hundreds, thousands?
A.	There were very many, and I'm unable to give you an estimate.  The refugees were killed, and the killing lasted till late in the evening, and the following day the attackers came to finish off the rest, and so you'll understand that there were many.  I saw the attackers kill, and the bodies were all over the hill. 
Q.	Among the refugees, were there some carrying weapons?
A.	No, nobody.  Where do you want them to get the weapons from?
Q.	In your written statement of 26th April 2001 you state that, in reference to the morning attack, on the side of the attackers one soldier died.  How did he die?
A.	When the refugees see Hutu attackers, they throw stones at them, but they did not have weapons.  If they had weapons, they would not have been killed.  The refugees did not know of this plan to kill, so they were the victims of the killing. 
Q.	Now to summarise the situation, would it be correct to say that in the afternoon two vehicles arrived, only one of which was carrying soldiers and the other one was carrying Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the persons who were aboard that vehicle, soon after they got there, attacked the people; is that correct? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which -- just a moment.

Which vehicle did that question relate to? 
MR. BESNIER:
I'm referring to the two vehicles that the witness referred to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, in the English version we got the persons aboard "that vehicle", so are you referring to those vehicles, Defence counsel?
MR. BESNIER:
Two vehicles.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So that is the question.  Could you repeat it, please?
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Well, would it be correct to say, Witness, that the persons who were aboard those two vehicles very quickly attacked the refugees who were on the Gitwa Hill?
A.	The attackers regrouped, got close to Ndindabahizi and his driver.  They stood there for a while, and the vehicle was further on.  They first of all got close to Ndindabahizi, and next to him there were people.  Then the Interahamwes ran quickly and threw grenades at us.  This man also threw grenades at us.  He also had two grenades attached to his belt and one in his hand.  At the time they were throwing the grenades at us, we were able to escape.  At least in that first phase, there were soldiers who were shooting at us.  At the top of the hill there was a big gun that had been fixed -- that had been positioned at the top of the hill, and there were people who were falling on the opposite hill, and there was a distance between the two hills.  Others were chasing the victims.  Regarding the big gun which was positioned at the top of the hill, we couldn't even see it.

So, in the evening, as I said earlier on, the killings abated, and so I have nothing more to add to this attack that was mounted by this man.  I have nothing to add to what I have recounted with regard to that event. 
Q.	Were grenades first thrown or there were gunshots first?
A.	This man was the first to throw a grenade, so the grenades were thrown first.  Subsequently there were gunshots. 
Q.	Where were the refugees when the first grenades were thrown?
A.	These refugees were on the hill.  At the foot of this hill there was a road.  We were at the top of the hill.  Some were closer to the road, and when you take that road, it takes you towards the Karongi antenna, and the road continues towards Gisovu.  So it was close to the road that goes to Gisovu.  I'm talking about the Gisovu commune.
Q.	What was the distance between you and the attackers when you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Not far, a short distance.  Not far. 
Q.	Taking this courtroom, using this courtroom, are you able to indicate to the Court the distance between you and the Accused?
A.	I would say -- I will start from the wall on the other side, and we were at the other side of the room. 
Q.	Are you referring to the two opposite walls of the courtroom?
A.	Let me start with the steps on the side.  But since we were on the hill, it was uphill, so we were uphill from them and they were downhill, so our position was relatively uphill in relation to them and their position was closer to the road.  We were therefore at the top of the hill and they were at the foot of the hill, close to the road.
Q.	Very well, Witness.  But regarding the distance, are you able to assist us any better?  Are you able to give the distance approximately in metres?
A.	I have never been an agronomist to indulge in exercises of measurement.  I can tell you that the person I saw was that far or that far, so I've never been engaged in exercises of measurement.  I am an ordinary person, so how do you want me to measure in metres?  Maybe you should better put that question to somebody who is an agronomist.

When I see somebody at a distance, I can see him, but I would not attempt to give you the distance in terms of metres. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.  It is difficult to estimate in metres; we all understand that.  But if you could just try to explain to us by using this courtroom as the measurement, approximately the distance between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi.  So, if you were sitting there where you are sitting now, can you point to anything in the courtroom and say, "I was here where I am sitting now, approximately, and he was, say, at a distance equivalent to where this or that is"?  Can you do that again to us, please, so that we have an idea?  It is important to know for the Court, you know, approximate. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't think one can make a comparison between a level -- a place which is level, and a slope.  When you are uphill and there is one person, the other person is downhill, they are not at the same level, so it is difficult to transpose that to a level place, a level ground.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We also understand that.  We know this.  So, you are not able to say whether the distance was less than this courtroom, was it, or more than this courtroom, the length of this courtroom, bearing in mind that you were not at the same level, but that there was a slope?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I could.  The position was not level in relation to where the Accused was. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and if you made that attempt, approximately, what would you say then, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, if we were on the field I could have given you an estimate.  I cannot find a place here that I can compare to the place in question.  If I were taken to an area with a similar topography to the one on the hill, I would be able to give you an estimate, but given this level ground, I am unable to give you an estimate.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	So we do not know the distance between you and the Accused, but at least we know that you were uphill in relation to him.  My question then is as follows:  when the Accused threw his grenade, he threw it -- he threw it from his position downhill to your position uphill?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Because we were uphill from him, as I said, so he threw it uphill.
Q.	Was there no risk for the grenade to roll back to him?
A.	Why, how is it possible, except that he does not handle it the way he ought to, unless the grenade does not explode. 
Q.	Now, during that brief attack that you referred to when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi briefly, would you say that he was a military expert?
A.	Well, I ran immediately he threw the grenade.  I ran immediately.  I did not -- I did not stay there.  People were getting killed.  People who were hit by the grenade died instantly, and if I had not run, I would also have died. 
Q.	Is it not correct that the refugees ran towards the top of the hill?
A.	Are you talking about climbing up?  There were many, and there were many dead bodies.  There were many.  There were many attackers, they chased the refugees, and they ran over a distance of one kilometre, and then there were a lot of dead bodies in the place.  If you cannot run, somebody will shoot you, and when grenades are thrown, it explodes and hits a lot of people.  It is not an attack using bladed weapons, they were using projectiles.  When guns are shot, it is over a long distance, so how can you escape from bullets being shot from sub-machine guns?  I saw a sub-machine gun at Mugina, it was positioned on a hill, and they were shooting at people who were at a very long distance. 
(Pages 12 to 24 by Trish Greig)





























	1600H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, I am not talking to you about sub-machine guns, I am talking about the actions of Ndindabahizi.  Let's take the sequence of events.  You see two vehicles arrive on the road; the occupants of the vehicle, the passengers in the vehicle get down; people assemble around Ndindabahizi, and then they take weapons; and at that stage they start attacking you.  That is my understanding; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How long, to your knowledge, what was -- how long was it between when the vehicle stopped and the first grenade was thrown?
A.	Not several minutes.  They immediately started running after us.  They were running after us, killing.  Some people were falling.  You know, people don't run at the same distance (sic), some people got killed in the process.  Elderly women, children, cannot run as fast as young men.  So, the speed of young men is not the same as elderly persons, and the attackers were generally young men, and women and children were victims, because they could not run as fast as the attackers; we were able to run away from the attackers.
Q.	Witness, let us concentrate on the duration.  You said there was a minute between when the vehicles came to a stop and when the attack started.  I now want to know at what time did the refugees on the Muyira Hill try to escape from the attackers?  Did they wait to be attacked with the grenades or they started -- they started moving back as soon as the soldiers arrived?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say Muyira Hill or Gitwa Hill?
MR. BESNIER:
I am sorry, it was my mistake, Gitwa Hill.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can counsel repeat the question?
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	I would like to know if the refugees on the Gitwa Hill tried to run away as soon as they saw the Interahamwe or they stood there and waited for the Interahamwe to start the attack before running.
A.	When they got down from their vehicles, they stopped for a while.  Not too many minutes elapsed before the grenades were thrown, and at the time they were thrown on those people who were close to the electric pylon which was there, people run.  Those who were able, were able to escape, others were hit with bullets.  So people spread around on the hill in all directions.  People were running; they were shooting at them.  So this is a description of the situation.  These people were chasing us and killing.
Q.	Yes, but I want to talk about the sequence before the shooting, because later on you said you left immediately.  So what I am interested in is what you saw in relation to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  So let me reformulate my question:  the refugees who were on the hill, the Gitwa Hill, did they get close to see -- did they get close to the vehicle to see what was happening or did they stand there, or on the contrary, was there movement of the crowd and flight, because the refugees understood they were coming to attack them, and fled immediately?  That is my question.
A.	I'll answer that question for you.  When the vehicles arrived, in the first instance there was the white car belonging to Ndindabahizi, and the driver parked the vehicle.  The second vehicle did the same, and when they came down, when they disembarked from the vehicle, they took the weapons and they came close to Ndindabahizi and his driver, and after a few minutes they ran after us, and in our turn we also ran, and as we ran, they were killing us.  So that is the description of that incident.  If you still haven't understood, I don't think you will be asking me the same questions on the same subject.
Q.	Very well.  But one last question, nonetheless.  So you were on the hill at a certain distance from the Accused, other people were around the Accused; you yourself were on a hill where there were many refugees, so how can you be sure that you recognised Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, whereas you had only seen him, rare -- rarely previously, and more than ten years from that time, and you also claimed that you saw this incident for one small, short minute?
A.	You cannot fail to recognise your paternal uncle or your neighbour or your own father, someone whom you already know; you cannot fail to recognise that person, even after one or two years, someone who was a neighbour, who works at a place which you know, to which you regularly went yourself.  Let me give you an example:  nine years ago the war took place, but I never asked anyone to show me this man; I recognised him immediately.
Q.	I have no further questions, Mr. President, for this Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Any redirect? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, one question; one or two questions.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from the time Mr. Ndindabahizi embarked from the white Toyota car to the time you observed him throw a grenade to the attackers, how long did you say that was?
A.	When he threw the grenade, the Interahamwe did the same and we ran.  Some people were hit and fell, the others who were not touched continued to run.  That's what happened.
Q.	I am interested to know the time span.  It's important for me to understand how long it took from the time you disembarked from the vehicle to the time the attack started.  Can you please try to tell us, give us an idea of the time span, the time it took?
A.	Several minutes didn't pass.  I would say two minutes, one, two minutes, not any more than that.
Q.	And finally, you testified here that you were on a slope and Mr. Ndindabahizi was on -- by the roadside.  Now, can you help us with the distance please?  Can you estimate?  We know you are not an agronomist, you cannot measure, but can you tell us roughly what you think was the distance between where you were hiding and where Mr. Ndindabahizi's car was parked by the road?
A.	It was a place where there were -- there were steps.  All I -- I'd never been in that place before, and all I did was to try and run.  I never tried to remain in one place, as myself, like the other young men, we ran, and people were shooting at us.  There were no bushes; grenades were being thrown at us, and bullets were being shot.  Some people were hit, and they fell, and we ran, because there were no bushes in which we could have hidden, and since it was in the open there were many deaths.  Many people were killed.  There were no bushes for them to hide, and grenades were thrown on the refugees.  That is the description of the facts. 
MR. KAPAYA:  
That's all, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  I would wish to tender as an exhibit the two written statements made by the witness.  On the one hand, there is a matter of dates, which is an important issue for the Defence, because we are going to be developing a defensive alibi based on the dates which we have seen in the statement.  As for the second statement, I am not very happy with the reasons given by the witness for the additions made to the statement, and thus, I would wish that the two statements, in English, and in French, be accepted, admitted as Defence exhibits.  Your Honours, by your leave.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So the first Defence exhibit will be the statement of the 26th of April 2001.  That is D - registry?
MR. MUSSA:
Twelve.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twelve.  So, D12A for the French, which is signed by the witness, and D12B for the English.  And then the next exhibit -- is under seal, of course.  
(Exhibit Nos. D12A and D12B admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then the next exhibit, D13 of the 4th of June.  Here we have D13A, English, signature of the Witness, and D13B, translation, both under seal again.  So these are the exhibits.  Thank you. 
(Exhibit Nos. D13A and D13B admitted, under seal)

JUDGE KHAN:
We would -- Mr. Witness, we would seek a little clarification.  In your statement you said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was known to you well before the war, being a manager of a Trafipro store where you went to make purchases.  In reply to your question, put by the learned Defence counsel, you said when you used to visit the store in connection with the purchases, "The Accused was in his office."  How could you see him, whether he would come out of his office to see you, or whether you would go and meet him in his office? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't have to go and see him.  I didn't have any reason for so doing.  I went to that location in order to purchase several items.  His office was next door; sometimes he was in there.  But since his office was close to the place where the sales were done, I could see him.  As for his -- as for the clothing, I would buy material or fabrics from which I had children's clothes made; sometimes I would wait throughout the day while waiting for their clothes to be made.  You know, when you stay in a -- you stay for a day in a place, in a particular place, you can't fail to see the people who work there.  Those are the conditions under which I got to know that man.  There was a tailor who was there, and when I would -- I would spend some time with the tailor.  You wouldn't be unable not to know the people who work in at that place.  I would spend -- spend some time there, and I was quite close to them.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I would like to come back to the white car which you observed at Gitwa Hill.  Which make did you say that car was?  Did you recognise it? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a vehicle of the Toyota make, which had bars.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has now come to an end.  Thank you very much for coming to Arusha and giving evidence.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the Witness could then be accompanied. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, would it be useful with a little break now and then we have the next witness after the break?  Would that be the way to proceed? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that would be well appreciated, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We'll then take the 15-minutes break and then we start with the next witness whose pseudonym is, please? 
MR. KAPAYA:
CGL. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 

Court is adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1615H to 1640H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, or good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT :
You will be referred to as Witness CGL in these proceedings, and you have to tell the truth.  

The registry will now make the necessary arrangement to take your solemn declaration. 

Please. 
(Declaration made by Witness CGL in Kinyarwanda)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have a document in front of you there?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your signature there at the bottom of the page?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the personal information on that sheet is correct?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  P18, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P18 admitted, under seal)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, please.
MR. TAFAH:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  

Your Honours, might we have that document admitted as exhibit of Prosecution?  Obliged. 
WITNESS CGL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you at any time after the death of President Habyarimana in April 1994 see Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Where did you see him?
A.	I saw him at Rubengera.
Q.	Where in Rubengera?
A.	At the market.
Q.	What is the name of this market?
A.	It was the Kibirizi market.
Q.	In which commune?
A.	At the time it was known as Mabanza commune.
Q.	When did he -- did you see Ndindabahizi at this market; when? 
A.	It was in 1994, in May.
Q.	What time in May, Madam Witness?  Was it the beginning of May, mid-May, towards the end of May?
A.	It was at the end of May.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  How did you know it was Ndindabahizi when you saw him at the market at the end of May 1994?
A.	It's because I knew him even earlier.
Q.	How long had you known him earlier?
A.	It was from 1993 that I had been seeing him.
Q.	Where did you see him in particular in 1993?
A.	I had seen him in Kirambo.
Q.	Where is Kirambo, Kirambo?  Kirambo is spelled K-I-R-O-A-M-B-O (sic).  
A.	Kirambo is in Gitesi commune.
Q.	Can you describe how you saw him in Kirambo in 1993?
A.	He came to that place.  He found me there.  He spoke with a certain number of individuals, and it was then that I came to know him.
Q.	How did he come to the place, Kirambo?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	How many times did you see him in 1993?
A.	I saw him twice.
Q.	Was it at the same Kirambo that you saw him twice or you saw him at Kirambo once and somewhere else once?
A.	It was at that same place.  I had family in that place and I was going there to visit the family, and it would be on those occasions that I would see him.
Q.	On this second occasion you saw him, how did he come to Kirambo?
A.	I was then with people who are older than me, and these people said, "There is Ndindabahizi, who is greeting someone, and who is standing over there with the person he is greeting."  
Q.	So on the two occasions you saw Ndindabahizi at Kirambo, he was identified to you by some other people who were present.  Is that your testimony, Madam Witness?
A.	No, when I got to know him the first time I knew him, you understand.  It's not necessary for him to be pointed out to me again, whereas I had already met him.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  So it is your testimony that the first time he was pointed to you by some older -- other people who were present, but the second time when you saw him, you already knew him?
A.	Yes, I already knew him.
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement to the investigators of the Tribunal, you did not state these circumstances that you had known Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, before the occasion you saw him at the market.  Why did you not state this to the investigators?
A.	The reason is that I wasn't asked any questions connected to that.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

On the day you saw Ndindabahizi towards the end of May 1994 at this market, what time was it?
A.	Since I wasn't wearing a watch, I wouldn't be able to tell you the specific time.
Q.	So was it in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening or in the night?
A.	I would say that it was between 11 a.m. and noon.
Q.	In your statement to the investigators of ICTR you say it was around noon; is that correct?
A.	You can understand that I wasn't wearing a watch.  It was only an estimate of the time I was making.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Madam Witness, can you describe the man, Ndindabahizi Emmanuel, you saw on this day at the market; describe the person you saw that day, as you saw him?
A.	Are you referring to the occasion about which we have already spoken?
Q.	I am referring to the May 1994 occasion at the markets, Kirimbi (sic)?
A.	He was a man whose complexion was between dark and light.  His nose is more or less large and he is of average size.
Q.	How was he dressed on that day, if you know?
A.	He was wearing a black suit.
Q.	Apart from Ndindabahizi, did you see another person?
A.	There were other people.
Q.	Apart from other people you saw, did you see light vehicles?
A.	Yes, there were vehicles.
Q.	How many?
A.	Two.  There was one vehicle of the Daihatsu make and a saloon car.
Q.	Were there people in these vehicles?
A.	No, there was no one in the vehicles.
Q.	When you saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, Madam Witness, on this day, what was he doing?
A.	When I arrived, he was together with other people.  Actually I was going to the market because I had been sent to make some purchases, and when I arrived there they told me, "Let's go and listen to the minister who is speaking to people at a meeting."  When I arrived, I realised that it was Ndindabahizi and that he was someone I already knew.
Q.	Do you know how many people were at the meeting?
A.	I didn't really count the people there, but I would say that there were between 50, five zero, and 100; and let me repeat that I did not count the people who gathered there.
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement to the investigators of ICTR, you said there were over a hundred people.  Can you explain that?
A.	I was only making an estimate, I didn't count the people.
Q.	Thank you very much.  

Where -- how far were you, Madam Witness, from where Ndindabahizi was standing?
A.	It's like the distance between where I am, up to the point where the Judges before me are seated.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the distance between the witness and the Presiding Judge is, according to the courtroom measurements, 4.50 metres.
MR. TAFAH:
Pleasure.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, at what point were you standing at that place?
A.	I was standing behind those people.
Q.	On that day were you able to hear Ndindabahizi say anything?
A.	Yes, I heard some of the words that he said.
Q.	What did he say?
A.	He said, "In Kigali Tutsis have already been all killed, including Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men."
Q.	Before I go to the next question, Madam Witness, why were you standing so close to Ndindabahizi?
A.	I wasn't that close to him.  I was behind the other people in attendance.
(Pages 25 to 33 by Judith Baverstock)































	1700H
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, what is your ethnic group?
A.	I am Tutsi.
Q.	You are Tutsi.  Were you not afraid that they would recognise you and kill you as they had other times?
A.	Since in my native village my parents had already been killed I had left my native village to go to a place where no one knew me.  Moreover, my looks don't enable people who do not know me to identify me as a Tutsi.
Q.	Is that all the reasons why you were standing so close to Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel?
A.	Yes.  In fact, I'm not a native of Rubengera.  The inhabitants of Rubengera do not know me.
Q.	So you were not afraid because you didn't come from that area, you came from a different area, a different locality.  Is that what you are telling this noble Court?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	In your testimony you told this Court that Ndindabahizi addressed the people telling them that Tutsi in Kigali have been killed, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men.  When he made that statement what happened?
A.	The Interahamwe got onto the vehicle and they took off the machetes which were in there and put them on the ground.  People then shared out those machetes under the watchful eye of the Accused.
Q.	Who asked the Interahamwe to take out the machetes?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did anyone?
THE WITNESS:
It was Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did anyone ask the Interahamwe to take out the machetes, Madam Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Ndindabahizi, he was the one who told them to get into the vehicle and to take out the machetes.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	In which vehicle were these machetes?
A.	In the Daihatsu.
Q.	Do you know how many machetes there were?
A.	No.  I do not know.
Q.	In your statement to investigators you stated that there were 15 -- I mean 15 machetes were distributed to Interahamwe.  Can you explain that, Madam Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the sentence reads, "I also saw the machetes being distributed to 15 Interahamwe militia," which is slightly different, huh?
MR. TAFAH:
Obliged, My Lord, that is exactly what I wanted to state.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement you stated, "I also saw 15 machetes being distributed to 15 Interahamwe militia".  Can you explain that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the sentence is, Madam Witness, "I also saw the machetes being distributed to 15 Interahamwe militia."  That's the sentence in your statement.  Did you say that to investigators?
THE WITNESS:
No, I said, regarding the machetes, that it was not the Accused who distributed the machetes, the machetes were offloaded, they were put on the ground, and then he called out to the people who were there so that they could take the machetes, and each person who was in that place was able to take one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the question now is the number, that's what Prosecution wants to elicit from you.
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't be able to give you the number of the machetes, because I didn't count them.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Did you know the number of Interahamwe?
A.	No, I did not know the Interahamwe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is did you know the number of Interahamwe leaders, that's what he's asking.
THE WITNESS:
No, I didn't know them.  I do not know who their leader was.  Maybe it was that man who gave them the weapons with which to go and kill people.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, you did not count the Interahamwe?
A.	I do not know the number of those Interahamwe.
Q.	So what you stated was an estimate, not the exact number?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that was a little bit leading, wasn't it?
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, what role did Ndindabahizi play in the distribution of these weapons?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did Mr. Ndindabahizi play any role in the distribution of these weapons, Madam Witness?

THE WITNESS:
Yes, he played a role in the distribution of those machetes, because these machetes were in his vehicle, he was present when they were offloaded from the vehicle, and when the machetes were distributed to those in attendance he was present.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	After Ndindabahizi saw that the machetes were distributed as per his instructions, what happened?
A.	He was applauded, and that was a sign which showed that the people were happy.
Q.	What did he do, then, Witness?
A.	He, too, was happy.  He rejoiced together with the members, the people who were there.
Q.	After that what happened, Madam Witness?
A.	Subsequently -- actually that's all I saw, and then I left after having seen the incident I just described.  I went back home.  I went to where I was living.
Q.	Who left that place first; was it you or Ndindabahizi, Madam Witness?
A.	I left first.
Q.	Why did you leave?
A.	I had just heard instructions he had given, and I was saying to myself that people were going to scrutinize the area and would attack anyone, and that's why I decided to go home.
Q.	At the time you were at that meeting point where Ndindabahizi was addressing this population distributing weapons, did you observe him properly?  Was there anything obstructing you from seeing him properly?
A.	I saw him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was there anything or anybody between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi?
THE WITNESS:
But I saw him, and when the people got to the place they said they were coming to see the Minister Ndindabahizi, and I myself when I got to the place, I immediately saw him.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	How long were you at the place before you left?
A.	Thirty minutes.
Q.	You say when you left the place you went to where you were hiding.  Where were you hiding -- or where you were living?  Madam Witness, did you say that when you left that you went to the place where you were hiding or where you were living?  Let me clarify this to the Court.
A.	It was to my hiding place.
Q.	Where were you hiding?
A.	It was close to the market place, which we referred to.
Q.	Were you hiding in the bush?  How can you explain it?
A.	I was hiding in a house belonging to a family friend.
Q.	A family friend.  What was the ethnic group of the family friend?
A.	He was Hutu.
Q.	Madam Witness, you testified to the effect that you left your locality to go to this locality, to this area where you saw Ndindabahizi.  Why did you leave your area?
A.	I left my locality because of the war.  The attackers had killed my parents and members of my family, and our house was destroyed.
Q.	In which commune was your locality?
A.	It was in Gitesi commune.
Q.	You say your house was destroyed and there was a war.  Can you explain for us what was happening in your locality before you escaped, Madam Witness?
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you very much.  I'm asking, you say your house was destroyed and there was a war.  I want you to explain further, when you say there was a war in your locality.
A.	Well, I meant the attacks mounted by the Hutus against the Tutsis, and we were the Tutsis, this is the war I'm referring to.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, do you know whether Mr. Ndindabahizi was once Minister of Finance?
A.	No.  I do know that he worked in the Ministry of Finance, but I do not know that he was a Minister of Finance.
Q.	When do you know he worked in the Ministry of Finance; was that before the death of Habyarimana or after the death of Habyarimana, the president?
A.	This was before the death of the president.
Q.	Do you know where he lived, before the death of the president?
A.	Well, you will understand that I was still very young and I didn't know where he lived.  I didn't know where he lived.
Q.	You've told this noble Court, Madam Witness, that he worked for the Ministry of Finance before the war.  Where was that, the Ministry of Finance?
A.	The Ministry of Finance was in Kigali.
Q.	How long did you stay at your hiding place after you left the marketplace where you met Ndindabahizi?
A.	I didn't understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	I'm asking how long you stayed in your hiding place with your Hutu friend after you left the market where you met Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel?  How long did you stay there?
A.	After I saw Ndindabahizi and the plans he had I went back home where I was hiding.  I left what I was sent to go and buy and I went elsewhere.
Q.	Why did you leave that your hiding place?
A.	I left because I had just heard the plan that had been drawn up.
Q.	And how did you survive thereafter?
A.	I continued hiding and I was changing hiding places continuously until the French arrived in Rwanda and they took me to the place called Nyarushishi.
Q.	Do you know when was that, Madam Witness, when the French arrived?
A.	I met the French in July, but I cannot recall the exact dates on which they came to Rwanda, because I was not in a position to know.
Q.	Madam Witness, how many of your family members were killed?
A.	Five persons.
Q.	Madam Witness --
A.	They were my brothers and sisters, my siblings.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Madam Witness, do you know whether some people were killed after this meeting by Mr. Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, at the market and the distribution of weapons?
A.	Yes, people were killed, because the killings continued in our locality until June.
Q.	So you said you lost five members of your family, brothers and sisters.  How many survived?
A.	None survived except myself.
Q.	Let's come back to this day toward the end of May 1994 when you saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel.  If you see the man, Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, that you saw on that day, in this Court, would you identify him, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I can identify him.
MR. TAFAH:
Your Honours, I will be seeking your indulgence for the witness to stand up and look around the court to see if she can identify Mr. Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will you stand up, Madam Witness, and see if you see anyone you know in this courtroom.
THE WITNESS:
I have identified him.  I have identified him.
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Can you describe where he is, what he's wearing, how he looks like?  Mr. Ndindabahizi is in this court?
A.	He's seated at the back next to someone wearing a uniform, and the uniform has buttons that look white.  That person is sitting next to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
	(Pages 34 to 38 by R. Lear) 






	1730H
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	What is he wearing, Madam Witness? 
A.	He's wearing a jacket, a tie, and a shirt, a white shirt.  I believe the shirt is white.
Q.	Madam Witness, is that the person you saw towards the end of May 1994 at the market Kibirizi?
A.	Yes, he is the one, because if I had not seen him at that time, I would not have been able to recognise and identify him today. 
Q.	Please take your seat, madam.  Please, thank you. 
MR. TAFAH:
Would the records, Your Honours, reflect that the witness has identified the Accused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, here I would like to refer to Article 6 of the European Convention.  Since the beginning, the identification of the witness is unfair, given the fact that in the courtroom coloured people are either in legal robe or in uniform.  Only the Accused person is in civilian uniform, and this is a violation, a fundamental violation of the European Convention in relation to what we will refer to as a fair trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This goes on the record.  Thank you. 
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you at any time discussed your testimony you have given to this Court with anybody? 
A.	No, I have not discussed my testimony with anybody.
MR. TAFAH:
That will be all, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Defence, please. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, it's Mr. Marçais who will conduct the cross-examination, but I would like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that we are moving away from the indictment.  Nowhere is Mr. Ndindabahizi accused of having made a speech or having gone to the Mabanza commune.  I don't know where the Prosecution is going with this testimony, but I thought it was necessary to draw the Court's attention to this, that this testimony does not correspond to any paragraph of the indictment.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that remark.  I'm sure the Prosecution will come back to that in due course, and so will you in your closing arguments.  Thank you very much.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you able to recall to the Court how you are able to remember on 27th of May, 2001, that is, seven years later, the Accused, and for the first time, given the testimony -- or the statement that you gave, not in your residence but in another place, that is, Bethany in Kibuye? 
A.	I was not living with my parents. 
Q.	Initially, did the investigators from the ICTR come to your parents or to your house? 
A.	The ICTR investigators came where I was living. 
Q.	And it is at that time that they told you that they were bringing a case against Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
A.	Yes, it is the investigators who worked on that case. 
Q.	Was it the investigators who told you that they were bringing a case against Mr. Ndindabahizi and that they were inviting you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	They invited you to come to Bethany guest house in Kibuye to give a statement? 
A.	Regarding my testimony, my statement, I kept that in my heart.  They were not the ones going to tell me what to say in my statement. 
Q.	Have you ever testified -- had you testified in the Rwandan courts, in any of the courts of first instance, Gacaca court, before this interview? 
A.	Yes, I did testify in the court of first instance. 
Q.	Had you already testified before the Gacaca court? 
A.	No, I never testified before any of the Gacaca courts. 
Q.	When you testified before the court of first -- the Kibuye court of first instance, were you a victim or did you indicate to the court that you had been a victim of the events of 1994? 
A.	Which criminal events are you referring to? 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have just told me that you already testified before the court of first instance in Kibuye.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, I want you to indicate the acts that you denounced and the fact that you did not speak about the alleged acts of Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
A.	In any event, I was testifying, an accused before that court.  At that time, it was not Ndindabahizi.  Today it's the turn of Ndindabahizi, and that's what I am doing.
Q.	So you waited for the -- can you look towards me, Madam Witness?  Don't look elsewhere.

So you waited for the investigators of the ICTR to come and invite you to the Bethany guest house to testify and to recount the acts that you are recounting today? 
A.	In my testimony before the court of first instance, Kibuye court of first instance, I gave -- I made the statement -- I gave that testimony before (sic) the investigators of the ICTR came to interview me.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you repeat under oath what you have just said?  Can you repeat what you've just said under oath, with the knowledge that you are under oath? 
A.	Which answer are you talking about? 
Q.	Please listen to me.  You just said that you testified before the Kibuye court of first instance after testifying -- after you gave your statement to the ICTR investigators.  I want you to repeat that with the knowledge that you under oath. 
A.	My testimony before the Kibuye court of first instance was done after my statement in relation to Ndindabahizi.  So I made a statement in relation to the Ndindabahizi case, and then I gave my testimony in the Rwandan courts, in the Kibuye court of first instance. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
The Defence reserves the right to enter on the record a document indicating that witness is not telling the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that something you are going to distribute now? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
It's a document that I have only in the Kinyarwanda, which I will have translated.  It was forwarded to me recently.  I will have it translated into English and French, and it demonstrates that the witness is not telling the truth, and this under oath.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if that's the case, I think you should show that document to the witness because she reads Kinyarwanda, of course, and then she can comment upon it. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I would like the registry to show this document to the Court and the witness for her to indicate if this, indeed, is her. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Here there are two yellow markings.  Are you referring to those two yellow spots, Defence counsel? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I am referring to the surname which has been highlighted in yellow, which is supposed to be the surname of the witness, and I want to know if that indeed is her name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see number 20.
MR. MARÇAIS:
I do not have the document.  I don't have a copy, Mr. President.  I have only that copy which was given to me recently. 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This is really, really below the belt.  This is so objectionable.  It is untrue.  My learned friend has deliberately laid an ambush for the witness, and it turns out that there is no relationship between this name and this witness, and he knows it.  He knows it, too.  There's absolutely no relationship whatsoever between the name here and this witness. 

Every other name mentioned here has a first name.  Now, a first name is mentioned here that bears no relationship with this witness, and I ask that the Defence be sanctioned and disciplined.  It is absolutely unprofessional behaviour to lay an ambush in such a manner, and we'll be looking to enter this as a Chamber exhibit, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, look at number 20 there.  That seems -- don't mention that name and don't read it out loud, but is that your name in that document, yes or no? 
THE WITNESS:
That is not me.  No, that is not me.  This does not refer to me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Could we see this paper once again? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
(No translation). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kinyarwanda booth, what does mwene mean, M-W-E-N-E?  What does it mean in English and French? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it depends on the person involved.  It could be daughter of or son of. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see, all right.  That was, in itself, useful.  If you could bring that back to the Defence, then. 

And we note the witness's answer, and we also note the Kigali booth's translation of the word mwene, and we note paragraph 8 of this witness's particulars.

Please proceed. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
The issue is simple on this matter.  Investigations will be conducted.  We've concluded on that issue.  The witness has already testified before courts -- the court of first instance. 

BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, in the trial in which she testified, is it concluded today? 
A.	This case is not yet concluded, but I have given my testimony, and I went back to live at home. 
Q.	I repeat my question -- withdrawn.  Let me move on to the next issue.

You did say a while ago, Madam Witness -- if I quote exactly what you said, are you able to clarify the following sentence which I find in your written statement:  "I knew Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as a minister of finance in the government of President Habyarimana"?
A.	I did not say he was a minister.  I said he worked in the ministry of finance.  I think the person who recorded my statement made a mistake.  That was not my statement. 
Q.	I realise I'm referring to your written -- your written statement, which is signed. 

What is your field of study, Madam Witness? 
A.	I have not had any.  I did not have any studies.  I don't have any educational standard. 
Q.	In April 1994, were you a student? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	(No translation)? 
A.	I attended the school called *************, but to my knowledge, there was nothing special about that kind of training. 
Q.	You confirm what you said in your written statement, that you were still in the primary school in 1994? 
A.	Yes, in 1994    ***********************************************************************************************, which is referred to as*************. 
Q.	Your statement said, "When I was in primary school in 1994."  I'm only reading what you wrote -- what you said. 
A.	Can't you see that those who recorded the statement made a mistake?  Were there students going to school during the war? 
Q.	Well, I'm trying to understand your statement.  You wrote, "I knew Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as the minister of finance in the government of President Habyarimana." You said I was wrong, it was wrongly recorded.  "When I was in primary school in 1994," and you said that was wrong.  The investigator got it wrong. 

Well, I think regarding this investigator, I think the Prosecutor needs to give us some instructions. 
A.	You understand that I saw him when I was still in primary school; however, in 1994 I was in the school called ****************.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's move on to your meeting with Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Well, there are three questions here: where, when, and on what occasion; that is, which date and what occasion? 
A.	We meet in Kirambo.  Regarding the date and the month, I do not recall that; however, I recall the year.  It was in 1993.  That is when I met him. 
Q.	Madam Witness, on how many occasions?  Once?  Twice? 
A.	Are you referring to the pre-war period? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel needs to pause, and we missed the beginning of his question. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	I would like to know where in Kirambo, when, and how many times, and on what occasion? 
A.	There was a health centre at that place, and he was greeting the people there. 
Q.	On how many occasions in 1993 did Mr. Ndindabahizi come to that health centre? 
A.	The only occasion -- the only occasions that I -- I saw him only on two occasions.  If he came there on other occasions, I am not aware. 
Q.	In what capacity did he go there, to your knowledge? 
A.	I don't, I don't know in what capacity he went there. 
Q.	Madam Witness, this gentleman allegedly came to the health centre.  I don't want to put -- ask leading questions, but what did he come to do there?  Was it to visit someone?  Was he on mission, a mission that had been assigned to him?  Explain yourself, Madam Witness. 
A.	How do you expect me to know the mission that he came to accomplish in that place?
Q.	What was his function at the time? 
A.	I know he worked in Kigali.  Beyond that, I don't know.  I have no details on that beyond the fact that he worked in the ministry of finance. 
Q.	Were you introduced to him or was he introduced to you?  On that question, did you see him among other persons or was he introduced personally to you, still based on your own assertions? 
A.	There was someone who was with me.  We were in Kirambo, you see.  That's a health centre.  So the person spoke to him -- spoke about him to me, spoke about him to me, and I knew about whom he was speaking. 
Q.	Did he speak to you personally, Madam Witness, or did he -- or did you speak to him personally? 
A.	No, he didn't speak to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This health centre, Madam Witness, what kind of centre was it?  Why did people go there? 
THE WITNESS:
People go there to be treated.  Maybe some people go there to meet people who work there, I believe. 
(Pages 39 to 44 by Diane Hermann)





	1800H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you go there to be treated?  Yes or no, no details.
THE WITNESS:
	 No.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Do you have any indication whether Mr. Ndindabahizi went there to be treated or was he there for some other reason?
THE WITNESS: 
	He wasn't there to get treatment.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	How you do know?
THE WITNESS: 
	I was also there, but I didn't see him go into the consulting room for consultation.  He was standing with people; he was greeting them.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	All that seems to be surprising, Madam Witness.  Did he work with the ministry of finance or the ministry of health?
A.	Do you think that someone goes to a health centre because he works in the umbrella ministry, the ministry of health?  One can also go there for some other reason.
Q.	Is a health centre, which is several hundred kilometres from the capital, a place to go and take a walk, somewhere which is so far from one's place of work?
A.	Since he is a native of that commune, there could be people whom he wanted to visit.
Q.	So he was visiting the people who were at this health centre?  Is it a health centre where one would be an in-patient in order to have treatment?  Is it like a hospital?  Do they have beds there for people to sleep in?
A.	Well, in any case, I can say that he was a native of that area.  Maybe he had relatives or family members whom he wanted to visit, I don't know.  Those are the possibilities.
Q.	It's for my own information.  My question is, was it somewhere like a hospital where one can sleep, where one must sleep if one is receiving treatment? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. Prosecutor, allow me to conclude my question.
MR. TAFAH:
(Previous translation continues...) answer this question.  I don't know.  My colleague is just going around and around.  The witness has answered the question.
MR. MARÇAIS:
	Non, non.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	No, but it's -- answer that question, Witness, because that particular question hasn't been answered.  
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, there is a hospital.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	So, there is a health centre; it's not only a dispensary or where you can get out-patient treatment.  Maybe it's also a place where you can receive treatment over several days.  That's my question.  Do you understand it?
A.	Yes, I told you that it was a health centre; however, there is a hospital where seriously ill patients can be hospitalised before they are transferred to the central hospital in Kibuye.
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  So you do not know specifically on what occasion, but you have just given us some clarification on those theories.  Madam Witness, you're a Tutsi, are you not?
A.	Yes, I am.
Q.	Can you please tell us the following:  You stated that you went to the Kibilizi market, but now I want to know, on what date did you go to the market?  I am specifying on what day -- date did you actually travel to that market?
A.	You see, it's quite likely that I do not recall that date.  It was a long time ago.  Moreover, given the circumstances of the time, we were not even thinking that we would have to report on these incidents; therefore, I don't remember the date very well.
Q.	Madam Witness, this date is very important for me.  I do understand your difficulties, but you did indicate that you lived in Gitesi and that you were going to the market, the Kibilizi market in Rubengera commune.  Now, what I want to know -- I am not asking you about the date or day that you travelled there, that you be exact, but I want to know when it was that you travelled to Kibilizi market in Rubengera.
A.	I do not remember the date.
MR. MARÇAIS:
This is a question which is very important for the Defence.  I don't want us to accept some kind of vagueness, and the Tribunal should take due note of this.  The events of May - April 1994 are of such importance that such imprecision about this date should not be allowed.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We know that the witness has said end of May.  Next question.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, Mr. President.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Can you please tell me, Madam Witness, where you stayed in April and May 1994?
A.	I was staying in Mabanza at this specific place known as Kibilizi.  Actually, are you asking me about this specific place where I lived?
Q.	Yes, but also about people who provided you with shelter.
A.	There is the Kibilizi area and then there is the stadium.  There was also Gitwa in Karongi area.  It was in those places that I hid until the end of the war.
Q.	When you went to the Kibilizi market in Rubengera, did you take any particular precautions?
A.	I do not quite understand that question, Counsel.
Q.	All right, Madam Witness.  You were changing your commune.  You travelled for more than 15 kilometres.  The maps that the Tribunal has -- were there any roadblocks?
A.	Yes, there were some, but I don't go by those roadblocks.  I would, rather, go through the bushes.  I didn't have any authority to go by the roadblocks.
Q.	I wouldn't say prudent, but wasn't it very dangerous to travel around these areas?  You mentioned the place near the market.  Wasn't it a bit dangerous on your part?
A.	At the time, in order to get to the Kibilizi market, in fact, I was nearby that place and it was a place which -- at which no one knew me, and the fact that those people didn't know me enabled me to get rid of my fear, and that is why I was not afraid. 
Q.	You don't even mention that in your statement, but a moment ago you said that you were hiding with Hutu friends, and now you're telling me that you're hiding elsewhere.  What is the truth?  Could you try and edify us?
A.	You are speaking about other places.  What other places are you talking about?  I am talking about Kibilizi, and the person in whose house I was, was in Kibilizi.  Now, as for the stadium, when I refer to the stadium I am telling you that there's no house.  And then in Karongi as well, I was hiding in the bushes.  But, now, when I was hiding in someone's house, a Hutu, that was in Kibilizi.
Q.	Madam Witness, when did you move from Gitwa to Kibilizi?  I need to know that.  Approximately, to the nearest day possible if you cannot --
A.	When I left Gitwa, I didn't go directly to Kibilizi.  You see, I cannot remember the date, and I have told you that.
Q.	Give us the period or the specific date on which you left Gitwa to Kibilizi, during this period of time which was undergoing so many difficulties?
A.	When I left Gitwa, I didn't go immediately to Kibilizi.  I hid elsewhere, someone -- someplace other than Kibilizi.
Q.	It's unfortunate for the Defence, for us, not to obtain more preciseness about this movement, despite our thousand and one questions.  

Where was the rest of your family when you went to Kibilizi?
A.	The members of my family were already dead.
Q.	So why were you at the Kibilizi market making purchases?  For whom did you go there?
A.	It was for the owners of the house in which I was living.
Q.	People who are of Hutu origin are hiding you because you are in danger, and then they send you to the market?
A.	These people were not worried about that particular issue because they knew that I was not a native of the area; consequently, they thought that I was not in danger.
Q.	That's not my question, Madam Witness.  These people thought you were in sufficient danger for them to want to hide you.  Is that true or not?
A.	Yes, they were aware.  They themselves knew the place from which I came.
Q.	I am putting my question to you back again.  So, these people are aware of the danger you -- risks you were running and they agreed to hide you, but they send you to the market in full view of the rest of the population living around?
A.	I think I have given my explanation on that, the reason why that was done.  I have told you that I could move about because I was not a native of that secteur.  It's only the person who was hiding me knew my origins.
Q.	Now, in that house, no one would have been able to denounce you as a Tutsi.  The people who lived in that house or the neighbours couldn't have done that, could they?
A.	There was no mention anywhere that I was a Tutsi.  Given my features, it's -- they are not different from those of others.  And furthermore, I didn't have any identity papers.
Q.	At the marketplace, you say you had already met Mr. Ndindabahizi who may have recognised you, if we were to believe you.  Now, you hear Emmanuel Ndindabahizi threaten Tutsis with death, and you continue to remain in that market for 30 minutes.  Is that what you did?
A.	I made reference to the 30 minutes, and that's when he held the meeting, after I had reached the place, but that does not include the duration which elapsed after the meeting was held.  Moreover, he himself did not know my origins as a Tutsi.
Q.	I am not specialist, but I think Hutus and Tutsis know one another.  

In your written statement you state, "I was able to note that the majority of the attendants were of Hutu ethnic group."  Let me repeat:  "I was able to note that the majority of the attendants were of Hutu ethnic group."  How were you able to do that?  How would you have known that the majority of the people there were of the Hutu ethnic group?
A.	During that occasion, no one else was suspecting except -- no one else, except for Hutus, could attend such meetings.  Had a person from another ethnic group appeared at the meeting, that would have cost him or her his life - his or her life.
Q.	If a Hutu came to such a meeting, he would be risking his life; is that what you are saying, Madam Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Is the translation correct there?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe so, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Did you say -- what did you say? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I was repeating the question -- the witness's answer in the form of a question.  Maybe I made a slip of the tongue. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	You said that if a Hutu (sic) person had ventured at that meeting, that person would be killed.  Is that what you were trying to say, Madam Witness?
A.	No, you are attributing -- you are putting words in my mouth.  I didn't say that.  The persons who would have been killed were Tutsis, because it was the Tutsis who were targeted by the killings at that time.
Q.	You say, Madam Witness, that the majority were of Hutu ethnic group.  You used the term "majority."  Can you explain that term, please?
A.	What do you want to know with regard to that term "majority"?  I do not understand what you are looking for.
Q.	Madam Witness, you used the term and I am repeating your sentence.  I don't have any comment on it.  "I was able to note that the majority of the attendants were of Hutu ethnic group."  So, I have two questions for you.  How were you able to realise that difference?  You gave me an answer, and I am inquiring from you to explain to me the word majority, which is not the same as the totality of the people who were there.  So can you please explain that for me?
A.	Let me give you an example.  I was there as a Tutsi, whereas the others were Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The wording, Madam Witness, does this imply that you saw any Tutsi there, apart from yourself?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, on that occasion there was also another person of Tutsis origin who was with me, and it's possible that we were not the only ones to have been at that specific moment.  Maybe there were other persons who were Tutsis whose features did not enable one to identify them as such.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	So you recognised at least one other person who was of Tutsi origin.  Did you know that person, individually as a person?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you write that person's name on a piece of paper today for us, because we may wish it verify what you are saying.
A.	You understand that this was during the war.  The war was ongoing at that time.  So, we were together in that place, but that person died subsequently.
Q.	Very well.  Furthermore, you say, Madam Witness, that Ndindabahizi spoke to two Interahamwe.  Can you specify and explain to the Court how you came by determining that they were Interahamwe?   Were they wearing uniforms?  Were they carrying any weapons?
A.	At any rate, I found them in a place where the meeting was taking place, and amongst the people who were there, I could distinguish between those who were Interahamwe and those who were not.  
Q.	How did you make that distinction, Madam Witness?
A.	First of all, they were happy of the fact that the Accused had just given them weapons, and I could see that they were happy.  I could hear what was being said.
Q.	Were they wearing any uniform, any disguise or any particular type of clothing for you to be able to identify them as being Interahamwe?
A.	At the time when they were going to perpetrate the killings, they were wearing banana leaves.  Now, they had come to attend a meeting.  You understand that war attire is different from what one wears when one is going to attend a meeting.
Q.	My question is, on that day, were they wearing banana leaves?  So I'll repeat my question:  Since that day they were not wearing banana leaves, how were you, from the outset, able to identify them as being Interahamwe?  Was it because they were carrying weapons and the type of weapons they may have been carrying, if they were?
A.	I was able to determine that they were Interahamwe because I had seen that their spirits were at their highest when they received the weapons.
Q.	So you identified them.  You understood or concluded that they were Interahamwe afterwards, but you didn't identify them previously, as you had indicated in your witness statement. 

Another question:  Is it the reaction of satisfaction which makes you understand that they were Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, it's true.  Add to that the fact that they left together with the machetes.  They took the machetes away with them, and why would have taken those machetes with them?
Q.	Did these Interahamwe not have machetes already, at least some of them?
A.	Maybe they had some, but at that time they had come to attend a meeting.  They hadn't come to perpetrate killing, so they did not come armed with their machetes.
Q.	But you did not recognise the Interahamwe by the weapons that they were carrying or the uniforms that they were wearing?
A.	I knew them.  They were indeed Interahamwe.  Tell me, if they were not Interahamwe, why did they then take those machetes?  Why did he give them the instructions he gave them?  Wasn't it because they were in a plan and they knew what they wanted to do?
Q.	At no time whatsoever were these machetes given to the persons that you identify as Interahamwe?
A.	No, according to what I saw, those people whom I saw were the only ones who received the machetes.
	(Pages 45 to 50 by Petrus Chijarira)


	1830H
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Am I correct in saying that you found people who were not in uniform, not armed, at a marketplace, and you say from the outset that -- and also it's a commune where you are not native, and you immediately jump to the conclusion that they are Interahamwe?
A.	But, you see, there were other people at the meeting place and they did not take the machetes.  So why were these persons taking the machetes, whereas others who were also there did not take the machetes?
Q.	So you would define an Interahamwe by the fact that such a person takes up a machete?
A.	No.  I myself can take a machetes, someone else can take a machete without it being necessary that we be Interahamwe, but these people were Interahamwe.  They carried out murderous expeditions and they had passed by where I was.  I have told that you that was not my native region and people did not know me, and I could see everything that was happening, and I could see the actors, the perpetrators, and I was seeing them with my own eyes.
Q.	Now, let's go to cars or vehicles, Madam Witness.  Do you know types of vehicles, makes of vehicles?
A.	No, not really.  I did not study mechanics or sciences of automobile, if there is any such type of science.  I did do some primary education and I'm from a rural area, but I tried to identify the vehicles that I saw.
Q.	(Not interpreted) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, we only got half of that question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat your question, Counsel? 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	What was the make of the vehicle in which Mr. Ndindabahizi sat?
A.	When I got there, there were two vehicles parked there next to where the people were; the people who were at the place were standing.
Q.	You claim you saw a car and you said it was Mr. Ndindabahizi's car.  Can you tell the Court the make of the car?
A.	The make of the car?  Well, I don't know it.  I don't know.  I know it was a saloon car and I know its colour, but I don't know its make.
Q.	You don't know makes of cars very well?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, when you stated -- when you stated that the car was blue, was it suggested to you that it was a Daihatsu?
A.	How can you say that?  You think the investigators would ask me questions and then they think in my place? 
Q.	No, I was just asking you if the investigators asked you whether the blue pick-up was of a Daihatsu make. 
A.	They asked me the following question: "What was the make of that vehicle?"  And I answered that it was a Daihatsu and that is the vehicle that I saw.
Q.	It is because a while ago you indicated that you did not know makes of cars and does not -- does that not look like a contradiction?
A.	You are talking about make.  Maybe I don't know what you mean by make, but I know Daihatsu.
Q.	Are you sure that you are not getting it wrong?  There were all sorts of pick-ups; there is Toyota, there is Daihatsu.  You did say that you don't know makes of the cars or models of cars but that it's a Daihatsu. 
A.	Yes, because I know Daihatsu.  But when you say in French the marke, meaning the make of the car, I don't know what you mean because I don't understand that kind of French.
Q.	Madam, Daihatsu is not a French word, it's a Japanese word.  I asked you a question a while ago about makes of cars and you said you didn't know about makes of cars and then suddenly you are talking about makes of cars.  I think the Court will assess that evidence.  That takes me to my last questions.  

Do you confirm that Mr. Ndindabahizi himself was not carrying a weapon?
A.	From what I saw, no.
Q.	(Not interpreted)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Beginning of counsel's question, please.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	What were the provisions that you bought?
A.	Well, I was asked to buy provisions and that is what I did.  I bought provisions which I was asked to buy.
Q.	Do you recall which provisions you bought?
A.	I don't think you need to know that.  I don't find that necessary.
Q.	I'm not asking you if it is necessary, I'm only asking you if you do remember.
A.	I do not remember.
Q.	Are you sure, Madam Witness, that during the tragic event of May 1994 that the Kibilizi market was operating, that farmers would go there and sell their produce?
A.	Yes, those who had the authorisation to go there and were not targets of the killings could go there.
Q.	Am I right to say that the market was operating and that those people who were not targeted for killing could freely go to such -- to the market?
A.	Yes, people were going to the market.
Q.	You went to the market to buy provisions and then you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.  You got close to him, and then you went back home.
A.	Yes, I bought my provisions, then I went back where I was hiding.
Q.	In the house belonging to Hutus; that is correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you brought back the provisions that they asked you to buy?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How soon thereafter did you leave?
A.	I left that family immediately and I went to hide elsewhere.
Q.	(Not interpreted)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Beginning of counsel's question.  We can't keep guessing what counsel is saying with each question. 
THE WITNESS:
	Given what I've just heard, I felt in a situation of insecurity.  I felt insecure.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	It is therefore based on the statement of Mr. Ndindabahizi, end of May 1994, that you decided to flee because you felt you were in a situation of insecurity?
A.	Yes.  I felt threatened.  I was not feeling safe in the area in which I was hiding and I thought it was no longer proper for me to hide in that area.
Q.	And you confirm one last time that this was towards the end of May 1994?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court when you left this Hutu house next to the market where you went?
A.	I went to the Ruragwe secteur, R-U-R-A-G-W-E. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I would like to request once again that the written statement of the witness be entered as an exhibit in relation to -- given the fact that the contradictions between the written statement and the oral testimony are extensive.  I'm done, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Something coming out in my headphones but you want this exhibited? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, that is my request, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the English version is the "A" version and the French is the "B" version, and the number is 14.  14 A and B then, under seal. 
	(Defence Exhibit Nos. 14A and 14B admitted, under seal)
MR. MARÇAIS:
I have concluded, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Any re-examination? 
MR. TAFAH:
Just one question, Your Honours.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. TAFAH:
Q.	Madam Witness, would I be correct to say that you went to that place where Ndindabahizi was at the market because your facial look does not look like a Tutsi.  Is that correct?
A.	Are you talking to me, Prosecutor?
Q.	I'm talking to madam witness, yes.  Can I repeat the question, Madam Witness?
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I was asking you that am I correct to say that it's your testimony that while you stood at the meeting place where Ndindabahizi was and you were not afraid, it was because you do not look like a Tutsi, your facial look is not like a Tutsi.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
MR. TAFAH:
Your Honours, I would pray Your Honours to remind themselves of the appearance of the witness throughout these proceedings.  Most obliged.  That would be all, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you were a stranger in this area and you had no identity papers.  Is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
	 Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't that a dangerous situation to move around without an ID paper in an area where you were not known? 
THE WITNESS:
	Given my age, one could not suspect that I was of age where I needed to carry an ID document around with me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you say that?  I'm aware of the year when you were born and we know that this was in '94, why do you put it that way, please; can you help me? 
THE WITNESS:
	I was short and one would take me for a child, and one cannot guess my real age.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ah-ha, so you are saying you looked young.  Is that your statement? 
THE WITNESS:
	That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ah-ha, I see. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Madam Witness, could you tell us, why did you go to the health centre where you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi?  What made you to go to the health centre? 
THE WITNESS:
	I accompanied somebody who was going to consult -- who was going for medical care.
JUDGE KHAN:
Was that person Hutu or Tutsi? 
THE WITNESS:
	That person was a Tutsi.
JUDGE KHAN:
You were not afraid of going to the health centre, both you Tutsi, in such a dangerous situation? 
THE WITNESS:
	But, Your Honour, this was in 1993; this was not in 1994.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did you finish primary school?  At what age did you finish primary school, Madam Witness?  How old were you when you left primary school? 
THE WITNESS:
	You mean when I finished primary school?  Well, I was 14 years old.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was quite some time before you visited the health centre, wasn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
	I did not understand your question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There were many years between the last year in primary school and when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at the health centre in 1993.  Is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Yes, I was sufficiently grown up and sufficiently intelligent to be able to recognise him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this other education -- did you say that you attended the *************, was that where you then moved to?  What was your next educational step, please?
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I attended ***************.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Just give us an indication what that is or at least the spelling of it.  Could you do that, please? 
THE WITNESS:
	****************************.  It's like a vocational school where you l*****************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And for how many years would one usually spend?  How many years would you usually be at that training centre until you have finished school there? 
THE WITNESS: 
I did only one year at *************** and I -- after that I did not continue with my training ********* is
**********************
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you had then finished primary school at the age of 14, and then you went on for one year at the ***********.  Is that so? 
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you would then be 15 years old when you finished the ***************? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But did I understand you to say that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi when you were at the beginning of your post-primary education; in other words, at the beginning of the ******************?  Was that what you testified?
THE WITNESS:
I don't think I understood the question clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you saw the person at the health centre who may have been Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1993, were you then in primary school? 
THE WITNESS: 
At one point in time, I left school and then I went back, such that while in school I was virtually an adult.  Such that in 1993 I was, as I said, undergoing a training **********************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This may not be significant, Madam Witness, but I do not understand this.  First I understood you to say that you finished primary school at the age of 14, and that you then started immediately afterwards at ***************, and that would bring us to 15.  But previously it was my understanding that it was during your education at primary school or ****** that it was that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, what is it that I do not understand? 
THE WITNESS: 
It was at the beginning of ************* that I saw him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And didn't that start when you were 14? 
THE WITNESS: 
In fact, I do not recall because I had to repeat some classes, and at some point in time my parents withdrew me from school.  In fact, I was -- I didn't think clearly about the years when I was answering.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So does this imply that you are not quite sure of the year you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi or are you maintaining that it was in '93?  Are you uncertain about the year you saw him? 
THE WITNESS: 
It was in 1993.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, thank you very much for coming to the Tribunal.  Your testimony has come to an end.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, too.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could just wait for a little moment while we wind up here for about one minute.  

So this was the third witness?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This was the third witness, Your Honour, and in relation to this witness we do have an application to make to the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the presence of the witness? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not necessarily.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  

Madam Witness, if you could -- Registry if you could kindly assist the witness.  

Yes, Mr. Phillips. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Grateful, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, I make a very quick application under the provisions of Rule 46 of Rules of Procedure and Evidence of this Tribunal.  The basis for my application is that counsel for the Defence's conduct in this courtroom this evening warrants a warning under that rule, and that the trial Chamber is at liberty to consider sanctions as may deem appropriate.  

The factual basis for my motion under Rule 46 is as follows: that today, the 16th of September 2003, during the cross-examination of Witness CGL, a witness called by the Prosecution, counsel for the Defence put improper questions to that witness in cross-examination.  

We submit, respectfully, to Your Honours that the questions put to Witness CGL were not put to her in good faith, and more importantly, they were not made in the legitimate -- with the legitimate objective of impeaching Witness CGL's credibility.  Rather, we submit to Your Honours that those questions, those improper questions, were posed to slander that witness, to destroy her reputation before this Trial Chamber and, more seriously, to mislead Your Honours into believing that that witness had made false representations before this Chamber.  

We say that the representations were not made in good faith because counsel for the Defence had witness statements before them.  In that regard, I refer Your Honours to paragraph 1 of page 176 of your witness bundle.  You would find there a witness statement dated the 27th of February 2001 in English, and if you are looking at your French bundle it would be paragraph 1 at page 180 of the French version.  It clearly states the witness's name.  

I further refer Your Honours to paragraph 8 on page 177 of the English bundle, and paragraph 8 of page 181 of the French bundle, which refers to the particulars of her parents.  My learned friend for the Defence had a document in his hand which clearly indicated not only the witness's name but, indeed, that of either of her parents.  We there say -- we therefore say that having been faced with such material, it was improper and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Trial Chamber to represent falsely to both the witness, Your Honours, and, indeed, the Prosecution, that the witness had indeed made a false representation.  

We ask Your Honours to consider the sanctions available under Rule 46A, B and C of the Rules of Procedure of this honourable Court.  Those are my submissions, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Defence, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Very respectfully, we do not believe that Mr. Marçais had conduct which was offensive or harmful to warrant a warning pursuant to Rule 46A.  Therefore, we are relying on this rule, but no warning has been given to Mr. Marçais; however, we are in a trial which is very special, Mr. President, Your Honours, one in which we need to determine on a daily basis and on an early basis, the evidence.  And we also -- it is up to us to determine the credibility of the witness.  That is our duty.  Sometimes we do this rather hurriedly.  And it is true that we have obtained this morning a ruling on this matter, but what is the harm done?  

The witness had the opportunity to express herself and verify and to tell us that the name was -- her name was not the one on the statement in question.  It is also a possibility that the Prosecution does make mistakes from time to time and the document -- and sometimes they say that the witnesses they have not arrived.  

Mr. Marçais was trying legitimately to carry out he is duty in relation to this witness and he did not have the intent to be offensive or misleading and he did not wish to mislead the Tribunal either.  And I, therefore, on that basis, wish to you to dismiss the application made by the Prosecutor because it has no basis whatsoever.  I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And did the Defence, when these questions were asked, know that he word Umwena means son or daughter of? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for counsel, please.
MR. BESNIER:
The answer is no, Mr. President.  We only knew it a few -- we only received the document a moment earlier and we had not had the opportunity to have it translated and, therefore, we were misdirected possibly by the similarity in the names -- of the surnames of the witness and the name on the document we had in hand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Further misrepresentations as these proceedings go on.  Counsel for the Defence who cross-examined Witness CGL obtained that document from his assistant, a Kinyarwanda-speaking gentleman, who sits right in this courtroom.  It is an absolute misrepresentation of the facts on the record for him to suggest, again, before the Trial Chamber, that he was not aware of the content of that statement.  And I will just leave it at that because it gets worse by the minute.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  This brings us to the end of today's proceedings.  We will look into the matter.  

Any good news about witnesses, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Unfortunately not, Your Honour.  We have three witnesses -- three factual witnesses and an expert witness left.  We hope that they would bring them at some stage between Friday and Monday, preferably Friday.  And the next witnesses will be number 10 on your list, number 11 on your list, and number 14 on your list, and then number 19, Madam Des Forges.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this, again, that's the third week we have been haunted this time, haven't we?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Certainly have, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- but the next week is the last week? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Hopefully, Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's the end of this portion of the trial.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Yes, this phase of the case; yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So that's where we stand.  We are losing days again.  For the Trial Chamber is it -- it's not so terrible because we can hopefully fill in with the Military trial.  But we will then meet again on Monday afternoon and I'm sure everyone will do their very utmost to ensure that we get the witnesses and as many as possible so that they can be heard as soon as possible in the beginning of next week.  

Thank you very much.  The Court is adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1910H)
