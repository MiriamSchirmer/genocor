MR. PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  Good afternoon to everyone.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 

Just a practical matter.  Now we are 12 minutes late because I understand the Accused arrived too late; yesterday we were 10 minutes late because a staff member arrived too late; and last week I think we lost 30 minutes because of some handcuff episode.  Now, I have still not received a report on what went wrong with the handcuffs, and I asked for a report on that.  I haven't got it, so that must be submitted immediately.  And at the same time, we want to know why these delays are occurring.  So, Registry, make sure that this happens now. 

Now, you were in the middle of examination-in-chief.  Please proceed. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BERNARD LUGAN,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Expert.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Expert, yesterday we were talking about a meeting that was supposed to have been held or that was held on the 8th of April 1994 at the ministry of defence in Kigali, and you had said that at that meeting the PSD did not attend.  Do you confirm that?
A.	No, the PSD did not arrive at the beginning of the meeting, it did not participate in the negotiations concerning the setting up of the government.  The PSD came after the government was set up.  So my answer is yes and no; PSD was not there at the time the government was being set up, negotiated, the PSD only arrived at around 3 -- 3 p.m., 3:30 p.m., when the die was cast.  That I can confirm, in the present shape of affairs of my scientific knowledge, sir. 
Q.	Perhaps you can help us with one point, Expert.  Now, we know that the PSD members that came at the ministry of defence on the 8th of April were appointed as ministers of that government, so how could they have been appointed ministers without having taken part in the meeting that was supposed to distribute the portfolios, the ministerial portfolios?
A.	If my memory serves me right, Counsel, I believe I answered that question.  I told you that they were put before a fait accompli, and they were compelled to fight for their survival.  The posts were distributed, the appointments were made, so that they were faced with a fait accompli.  They had not a solution, lest they risk their lives.  If you know what happened in Kigali on the 7th and the 8th, you would understand the fears that they experienced. 
Q.	Very well.  All the same, I believe there is a small contradiction between what you are saying today and what Alison Des Forges told this Tribunal when she testified.  If I refer to her report, her expert report, page 60 in the French version, where it says about the interim government, Alison Des Forges states:  "After some delay the PSD members, Hyacinthe Nsengiyumva Rafiki, François Ndungutse and Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, came into the meeting -- joined the meeting".  So that Madam Alison Des Forges is saying that those three personalities came to the meeting, and you have just said that they did not participate in that meeting.  What are your grounds for that assertion?
A.	I believe, Counsel, that we have information that is quite clear.  In the chronology of events of that very important day, since the government was going to be set up, in the chronology of events we have a benchmark on which we all agree.  The meeting began early in the morning.  There is an intermediary point on which we all agree:  the PSD members were not there.  And then there is a point on which Filip Reyntjens and myself do agree, that is about the arrival of the PSD delegation at around 3 p.m.

Now, Mrs. Alison Des Forges is not very clear in her formulation.  In English it says "After some delay", "Following some delay", "After a certain time lag".  Now, the problem is very important.  I did say so yesterday, Mr. President, I am preparing a book on the history of the genocide and its origin.  The book will be published within the next coming weeks.  I was saying that I was not directly interested in this particular question of timing as far as the day of the 8th was concerned, so that when I received the report of Alison Des Forges that you sent me I raised a question.  I undertook some enquiry, because there was a contradiction.  The historian's work is to underscore the contradictions.  You cannot just write anything.  "After some delay"; could it mean half an hour, one hour, two hours?  "After some delay" could be 7 to 8 hours, because the PSD came at around 3 p.m.

So that, please remember, I turned to you, Counsel, and told you that I had a problem, because that particular point was of crucial importance to me, and I had no serious data to enable me to go further into my enquiry. 

Now, you then sent me a document which is a document that came from the Tribunal.  Mr. President, the Tribunal's documents court number or reference is TPI ICTR-2001-71-T, Ndindabahizi, 30th of November 1996, 8-11 July 1997 and 16 July 1997.
Q.	Just a minute, Expert.
MR. BESNIER:
This is Exhibit P. 25 of the Prosecutor.  P. 25.
THE WITNESS:
Now, what does this document say?  If I interpret it correctly, it talks about a certain number of testimonies, a certain number of testimonies from Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, I should like to draw your attention, Mr. President, to one particular element.  To date -- and let's be very clear on this one -- to date all that I have said to you was scientifically documented and verified.  

Now, with this document, of course, we are talking about a statement made by the witness, that is the Accused.  Now, if I look into this statement carefully, it would appear to me to be coherent and I would say that it is reflective of the chronology, the timing of things done on the 8th.  Now, is that sufficient?  Is that sufficient enough to base -- to use it as grounds for assertion testis unus, testis nullus?  So that I turned back to you and said that I had a problem because that testimony was coherent, it was logical, but that I could not take the liberty of committing myself on the basis of a simple testimony, and I asked you, "Do you have any testimonies that would enable me to cross-check, from outside, such and such a point in the statement made by Ndindabahizi so that I would revise my inquiry?"  You said yes.

Now let me draw your attention, Mr. President, to the document I mentioned.  That is not in my report, of course.  Why?  Because it is a confidential document and Mr. Besnier confirmed this to me.  He said to me, "I confirm this to you, on condition that you do not mention it.  It is a confidential document".  Even the name of the witness that I couldn't, but use Witness KA3.  This is why I didn't mention it in my report, and I used that report on the basis of those conditions. 

Now, what did KA3 say?  He says something very interesting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid we have to stop a little moment here.

Now, Mr. Besnier, are we now in P. 25? 
MR. BESNIER:
We are talking about two documents, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the expert goes on, I think if you could kindly now direct us to the right documents so that we have them in front of us.  Could you -- because you know the codes we are using inside this courtroom, even if the expert also may have them.  So, please, first reference was made to P. 25.  We have that in front of us.  Which page do we look at? 
MR. BESNIER:
Well, I believe that the expert is using -- is relying on the first page of that document, more specifically, the first two paragraphs, that is the interview of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the 8th to the 11th of July and from the 1st to the 3rd of August 1997.

The document mentioned by the expert, it is page 1, there is a paragraph, second paragraph that begins with, "The 8th of April 1994, I spent the night at Rafiki's".
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So, what is relevant here is the paragraph starting "Le huit d'Avril 1994" and then onwards.  That is one document.  What is the other document he is referring to then, please? 
MR. BESNIER:
The second document, Mr. President, is the testimony that was recorded by the Defence several months ago but which was not submitted to the Tribunal.  So that in truth I didn't know whether the expert was going to mention this document today.  This having been said, I do have a copy of it.  I am rather uncomfortable, because we are talking about a protected witness who has not testified, but of course I can serve this document to the Tribunal and to the Prosecution.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what is the pseudonym of this witness?  Is that a protected witness in this case, but a witness that was not called in the present case? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  He was not given any protective measures because we didn't say that we were going to call him, so that he didn't enjoy the usual protective measures.  So that I do have the name of the witness, and the written testimony mentions the name.  This having been said, I shall serve it to the Tribunal.  It will be an exhibit under seal, if we may, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, are you aware of which document we are talking about now, the second document?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, we are not, and we would actually object to the production of a witness statement in lieu of calling the particular witness, unless the provisions of Rule 92 of the Rules of Procedure are complied with, otherwise we may not have a witness statement as an exhibit pursuant to the provisions of those Rules.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it is up to you, Defence Counsel, whether you want to lead this through the expert or whether it is unexpected that the expert is coming up with this.  That's up to you.  This is your expert.  I leave that to you.  But if at some point you wish to tender this as an exhibit, then you will first have to, of course, give a copy to the Prosecution so that we know what we are talking about, and the Bench would also have to familiarize itself with this document so that we know where we are. 

All right.  So now we know, Mr. Witness, that you are talking about two different documents. 

Should we start maybe with P. 25, which is the simple one and which is the document which we have in front of us here, and that is then a summary based on a meeting with Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Yes?  What do you want to say about that, please? 

THE WITNESS:
The document, what date is it of, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now talking about -- I think, based on what you said, that you are referring to a document in French called "Report of the Meeting of the Minister of Finance (no interpretation)" ... obviously conducted by Mr. Gandhi Shukri and some other investigator.  Is that the same document?
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  Interview with Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel.  Very well, I am not going to come back to that because I have talked about it.  It is a document on the basis of which I built the chronology of events of the 8th concerning Ndindabahizi, so that I am not going to come back to that.  I am just trying to cross-check the documents at this time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what are the relevant paragraphs here referring to the timing of the arrival of PSD at the 8 April '94 meeting?  Can you help us with that, please?  Where shall we -- do you find any support in this document for the fact that PSD arrived around 3 o'clock and were not part of the morning meeting?  I don't know which significance this has, but just to be clear. 
THE WITNESS:
It is not on this document that I am relying on to say that the PSD came at 3 o'clock, it is on the work of my colleagues, especially Filip Reyntjens, and on the literature.  Now, this document that I am using -- let's be very clear.  When I read Des Forges' report, this particular point concerning the chronology of the events of the day appeared to me to be very important.  I didn't raise it beforehand because it didn't appear to me to be important.  I noted a contradiction between certain specialists and researchers and what Madam Des Forges was saying.  There appeared to be some imprecision, and it did not tally with what we knew about the timing of the arrival of the people of the PSD.  I therefore talked to Mr. Besnier and asked whether he had any information, because I was quite sure -- I was not quite sure.  Mr. Besnier communicated that document to me, so that I am not coming back to that document, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we know, I understand, that P. 25 doesn't really assist us here.  Isn't that the case? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then you have referred to Filip Reyntjens on a few occasions.  I think that is a different reference, and that is also a document which you have produced, Defence Counsel, but which has not yet been entered as an exhibit.  And this is this document. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is the document.  I thought that it had been produced and served.  If that is not the case, we should like to tender it as an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, very briefly, Mr. Expert, are you relying on Reyntjens' book when you enter into this chronology?  Just very briefly, yes or no, please.  And then I have a few other questions afterwards.  Is Reyntjens' book of relevance here when it has come to the chronology, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Reyntjens' book is very relevant and Reyntjens' book, as far as the three days are concerned that changed history, it was on those three days that this document becomes relevant.

Mr. President, let me come back if I may -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, which page is it in Reyntjens's book that we should look at now?  Is it page 88? 
THE WITNESS:
Page 88, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So we are talking about the same page.  Do we all have that in front of us now then?  It is page 88, and it is the paragraph which starts, "Il faut ensuite procéder".  C'est bien ça, n'est pas?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, we quite agree.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  What do you want to draw our attention to there, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to this confidential witness who is going to enable me to cross-check as to whether --
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Expert, the President wants you to point to the relevant passage in Reyntjens' book concerning the meeting of the 8th of April.
A.	Let me point out the passage, Mr. President.  Page 88:  "Then the new government was to be set up" -- this is in French, for the interpreters, this is the first paragraph on page 88.  Are you with me?  It is the paragraph that begins with, "The new government was to be set up.  It was confronted with the problem of the representation of PSD.  It was therefore decided that two members of the political bureau be invited, François Ndungutse and Hyacinthe Rafiki, who arrived with an escort at around 3 p.m.", end of quotation.

That is the passage I wanted to refer you to, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And where is the link to the morning meeting in the passage you just read out? 

THE WITNESS:
It is the same meeting, Mr. President, that is dated the 8th, and that points to the arrival of the PSD members at around 3 o'clock.

The preceding page, Mr. President, the preceding page, that is page 87, in note 154, that is the bottom of the page, we see the following:  "In reality several politicians of the presidential group already met with Bagosora from around 9 o'clock in the morning", and it points out as being of 9:30, that is the arrival of General Dallaire.

Mr. President, let me open a parenthesis.  Unfortunately you do not have the book written by General Dallaire in Arusha.  I saw a photocopy of it, and General Dallaire told me that he was at the ministry of defence and that Bagosora was there and certain members of the Hutu Power were also there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this footnote, 154, doesn't that -- that is footnote 154, isn't it, and isn't that referring to the first sentence, "That is why the first working session which started around 1 p.m." --
THE WITNESS:
When the working session began at around 13 hours, the die was cast, because the politburo, if I can so say, met at around 9 o'clock with the personalities mentioned, and from that time onwards the entire chronology of events was mere formality.  All the more so as for the PSD people who arrived at 3 p.m.; at least for them things were already over. 

Very well, may I proceed, Mr. President? 

Now, I was saying, Mr. President, something about the historian's responsibility.  I happen to know Madam Des Forges through her work, and Mr. Reyntjens was my colleague in Butare, and who is a very serious personality.  

Now, on this particular point I did not work on in detail, and I saw some contradictions therein, and I turned to Mr. Besnier and asked him whether he had documents to allow me to forge ahead in my work.  It was on that occasion that he gave me the documents that we mentioned earlier on, that is, the three interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi that you referred to. 

Now, by going through them, they appear to me to be coherent, they appear to me to be logical, they appear to me to be acceptable, they appear to me to be reflective of what happened, the chronology of events, during that day.  But as a historian, please understand me, I cannot rely on the statements of Mr. Ndindabahizi, even if they are coherent, to make an assertion.  I turned back to Mr. Besnier and said, "Well, this is interesting, but I cannot use it".  And Mr. Besnier told me -- I'm sorry, I asked him, "Do you have other data that would enable me on this and that point to confirm such and such an element in which Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke?"  He said, "Yes, on condition that you don't mention it in your report".  So that it is that confidential witness that is mentioned in the document given to me and is referred to as KA3.  So that I do not know who he is, and I simply would quote what does the witness say.  "In 1994  **********Emmanuel Ndindabahizi --
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Expert, just a minute.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have a question here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you were given this document, and asked kindly do not mention it in your report.  That is a written report.

Now do you want this witness to refer to it in his oral statement now, Mr. Besnier?  Is there something you want to introduce as evidence or as supporting documentation, or is it not? 
MR. BESNIER:
No, sir.  No, Mr. President, I'm not asking that this document be tendered as an exhibit, it was some information for the expert, from the expert for more information, but I'm not saying that it should be an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is the situation, Prosecution.  They are not demanding it exhibited. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, we understand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Please proceed. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You may proceed.
A.	Could I mention this document, just mention it?  Now, Witness KA3, and I quote:  "In 1994  
            ********** Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  On that 7th of April at around 11 o'clock *****************stayed there for one and a half hours or two hours and then he went away to see a friend, and I never saw him any more.  He told us that he was going to see that friend at Kicukiro".  This was dated Kigali, the year 2000, 5th of January.

Now what is the importance of this document?  This document doesn't do anything for us, but it was the departure point of the testimony of Ndindabahizi. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Can I say that the Defence is now trying to enter that document through the back door, because what he is testifying to appears to be the contents of that very document which he says he is not going to enter as an exhibit. 
MR. BESNIER:
No.  Mr. President, there are two things here.  The first thing are on the sources that the expert has for his report, some information, some data and some testimony.  Now, the testimony that has just been read is part and parcel of those pieces of information, so that I didn't even know that that testimony was going to be used by the expert in his testimony.

The second thing that should be taken into account is the probative value of the testimony.  We are not saying that this testimony be tendered as evidence, we are saying that along with the documents the expert took cognisance of certain information, and this is only one of the pieces of information.  That is all.  It does not have probative value, it will not be tendered to the Tribunal, we shall not use it for Ndindabahizi's purposes.  It will merely be a source of information, that's all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are stopping here? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  The statement has been made by the witness.  I understand that that is where this is going to stop, because you are not eliciting further information from the witness, the document will not be tendered, the Court will not have it in front of it, and, consequently, that is all we are faced with.  And this may have a bearing on the weight to such a non-seen document. 

So, proceed then, and I understand that this is the end of this matter.  Yes? 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, let's move to another subject.  You told us that Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was, in spite of himself, designated minister of finance.  Could he have refused that post?
A.	Counsel, I think this is the third time I have answered this question.  No, he could not have.  He could not have.  I don't want to bore the Court by saying it a third time, but I maintain what I said yesterday and earlier today; no.  It was life or death. 
Q.	On which date did the government take the oath?
A.	The official date is established, it is the 9th, the next morning, at the Hotel Diplomat.  This is established.  There is no doubt about that. 
Q.	Do other researchers confirm that date of 9th April as the time when the government took the oath? 
A.	Yes, absolutely.  These are official texts that this is based on. 
Q.	Have other historians talked about this date of 9th of April as the government -- as the date when the government took the oath?
A.	Yes, everybody; Filip Reyntjens, myself, Des Forges, everybody. 
Q.	If we look at Mr. Reyntjens' book, can you tell us where in that book he talks about this ceremony?
A.	In Filip Reyntjens' book it is on page 90, nine zero -- no, I'm sorry, 91, nine one.  But Counsel, this is an official date.  The government was sworn in on that date, officially. 
Q.	Yes, thank you, Mr. Expert, I don't need to go any further on that.
MR. BESNIER:
I just would like to ask that this document be tendered as a Defence exhibit.  It is excerpts from Filip Reyntjens' book, pages 86 to page 92, Mr. President, with your leave.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we enter that document, have you had the chance to read the CV of the witness now, Prosecution? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, we have read it, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we can then enter that as the first exhibit?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, we have no objections to make.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  So the CV is D. 50 and this document is D. 51.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 50 and D. 51 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert, I only have a few remaining questions.  Now, regarding that government that was sworn in on the 9th of April, can you tell us if that government effectively governed the country or really governed the country?
A.	Mr. President, I think -- I don't know if this is really legal what I'm doing, but I will come back to the book of Mr. -- General Dallaire.  It is a very exciting book.  General Dallaire in his book that I talked about yesterday, that you should have next week, no doubt, said -- this book is coming out very soon.  He talks about the prevailing environment.  It is very surprising.  And it shows the surreal atmosphere in which all of this took place.  Page 357 of General Dallaire's book, he says the following -- it is the 9th of April in the morning.  The 9th of April he goes to the ministry of defence, he learns that everybody is there at the Hotel Diplomat because they are getting sworn in.  This confirms the date of the 9th.  And I cite:  "Once I arrived at the Hotel Diplomat I met a certain number of ministers and their family members.  They were packing their suitcases.  They were putting the goods into their cars.  Nobody wanted to stop to talk to me".

I am speaking too fast.  I will begin again.

"Once we arrived at the hotel I met a certain number of ministers and their family members.  They were packing their bags.  They were putting their goods into their vehicles.  Nobody wanted to stop to talk to me, each person was very busy to get out, trying to get out of the city.  Later on I learned that they were moving towards Gitarama, some 60 kilometres south of the capital, to be in a safe place.  This scene made me think more and more about the fall of Saigon, the installation of a government determined to take control over the country".

Here we have an atmosphere that is very surprising, baffling.  These are the last days of Pompeii.  It is chaos.  It is the final fall.  Everybody is trying to save their own skin, and that must have been what this government was. 
Q.	Yes.  Let's go further with these thoughts.  Can we say that the government is made up of political ministers or technical ministers who have work to accomplish, or is it both?  What is your feeling on this?
A.	You are asking me to make a value judgement.  I'm a scientist, a researcher.  I can't say anything different.  I studied a bit of constitutional law, I know what the continuity of the state means.  Let's leave the political ministers aside.  In this government, there are technical ministers, I must say; I think so.  Among those technical ministers, I see three or four.  The one who interests us here is the minister of finance.  He is the prototype of a technical minister.  For the continuity of the state, the administration must continue to work, and generally when there is great difficulty and exodus in the country, which we saw in France in 1940 in June, there were two types of ministers, technical ministers and the rest.  These are the ones who ensure the continuity of the state.  The minister of social affairs is also, in this case, a technical minister.  This is a large -- there was a large refugee problem, the need to feed people.  That is a technical ministry as well, with work to accomplish.
(Pages 1 to 11 by Trish Greig)










	1450H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
But I can't go any further than that; I am going beyond my area of expertise and beyond my area of scientific certainty.  I hope you understand this, Counsel.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Yes, I do, and I thank you.

Let's suppose that a witness came before this Tribunal and stated the following:  that the simple fact that the civil servants were paid by that government, was for them encouragement to commit genocide.  What would you say about that assertion?
A.	That's total speculation.  That is speculation.  The historian turns towards the lawyer.  This just corresponds to my previous answer.  We have to talk about the continuity of the state.  The civil servants are paid up to the point that the state disappears.  The state disappears when the coffers are empty.  We are in a period where the state is retracting, but it is still there, even if it is an embryo, even if it is a political facade.  I don't see a link between paying drivers or gendarmes or different civil servants, a link between that simple fact and an encouragement to commit genocide.
Q.	Thank you, Expert.  Thank you very much.  Regarding the research that you have conducted, do you have an idea of the number of deaths caused by the genocide of 1994?
A.	Regarding those -- those tragic numbers, people have been excessively cautious.  To be certain as to not distort reality, estimations, if we can speak of estimations, or macabre counting, if we could at the highest estimations, it's more than one million, perhaps 1.2 million.  If you look at the lowest estimations, it's around 800,000.  Unfortunately, in reality, it is probably one million.

It is true, though, we will never know exactly know how many people died, and that is because people were displaced.  We didn't find all the mass graves.  Even if we had found them all, not everybody was buried inside of them.  There must have been ten of thousands of cadavers that were brought away by the Kagara, that were lost in the papyrus groves.

So I give you between one million, 1.2 million, I would say about one million.  Don't ask me more, though.  I don't know the exact statistics.  However, I did work on a very important document.  It's essential, in fact, and I have had it for some time.  This document was published in February 1996 by the minister of higher education and scientific research, one of my colleagues at the University of Rwanda.  Basing my assertions on that document, I can say that those figures are more or less exact.
Q.	Is this the document called "Preliminary report of the identification of genocide sites of the massacres between April and July 1994 in Rwanda"? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is indeed the document.
Q.	This document speaks about a large number of victims; is that correct?
A.	Yes, this is a very interesting document.  It's a document that counts the mass graves and the victims and also counts the names of the killers and also gives -- and this a very important -- the dates when the genocide began in each of the different communes.  This is a fundamental document for historians.  I used this document very much to -- when I used -- when I made the maps that I put in book that will come out very soon.  This was research conducted by my colleague at the University of Rwanda, and this is a primary source to any historian.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you ever see the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in that document?
A.	I have had the document for several years.  When I was preparing a report on Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the PSD party, naturally I went back to everything that concerned Kibuye préfecture.  I went through the document and looked at everything that concerned the communes in Kibuye.  I was doing my work as a historian, and, in fact, no, Ndindabahizi's name is not found anywhere in the document.

I don't know if the Tribunal knows of this document.  It is an essential document because it gives a commune by commune account of the researchers' work.  They go through and give the names of the killers, those who ordered the killings, the date of the genocide, the number of victims, the number of mass graves.  It is a document, in fact, that will be used to create memorials for the victims of the genocide, and in this document, Ndindabahizi's name is nowhere to be found, unless I am making a mistake or not remembering.  Unless it is a serious mistake, I have not seen his name anywhere in that document.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Expert. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, we have a copy of the said document.  It has been disclosed to the Prosecution.  It is very important, as you know, since the witness has just spoken of its importance, and we would ask that it be tendered as the next Defence exhibit, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, do you know if massacres of civilian Tutsis began before or after the swearing in of the interim government?
A.	If I base my information on this document, we have fundamental points that can make us be certain, that tells us that it began before the interim government was sworn in.  For example, I have taken four pages that give examples of four communes, pages 21 -- must I cite the pages, Mr. President?

Now, page 21-089, 21-089, "Kigali préfecture, Kanombe commune:  Killings begin on the night of the 6th of April" --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	You are now referring to this document for preliminary? 

THE WITNESS: 
	Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we don't have page 21 in that document---.
THE WITNESS: 
	I will give you two references, Mr. President, two references:  page 183, 183.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Did you just refer to page 21? 
THE WITNESS: 
	No, Mr. President, it's page 183, 183.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That's found.  We have that one. 
THE WITNESS: 
	"Kanombe commune, Kigali Préfecture:  The massacres begin on that same night, 6 April 1994."  

Page 201, 201, "Kigali Rural préfecture, Rubungo commune, Kiningi secteur, page 201:  "The first massacres begin on the 7th".  In Gashura commune it is the same. 

Page 225, 225, "Ruhengeri préfecture, Nkuli commune, Nkuli commune:  "The massacres begin on the 7th of April".

Page 176, 176, "Kanzenze commune, Kigali Rural préfecture:  The massacres begin on the 8th of April".

There are other examples, Mr. President.  I haven't given them all to you.  This was only to demonstrate to you the first -- what the first dates of the genocide were.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I think you have gone beyond our expectations in that answer.  Thank you very much.

I only have two remaining questions for you, Mr. Expert.  You said you that you were preparing a book on the genocide of Rwanda; I am sure that you have researched many different things and questioned resource individuals.  Can you tell the Tribunal if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's name has ever been mentioned or if you have ever read Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's name in the documents that you used to prepare your book, and, if it was mentioned, was it mentioned as somebody who incited or encouraged the genocide of 1994?
A.	The current state of my research, the current state of my research, would say no.  Ndindabahizi's name is nowhere to be found.
Q.	Last question, Mr. Expert:  Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi went to Kibuye on 3 May 1994.  Was Jean Kambanda, the Prime Minister, at that meeting and were other political personalities present at that meeting?  This was a public encounter, a public meeting.  Some witnesses asserted that Mr. Ndindabahizi made a speech during that meeting.  I will sum up what he was said to have said in that speech.  According to witnesses, Ndindabahizi allegedly said; first, the PSD is not an accomplice of the PRF.  Second, the PSD is not the accomplice of the RPF, and I prove it because the PSD is supporting Jean Kambanda's government.  Does that possible statement of Ndindabahizi prove that he intended to support a policy of genocide, whatever that policy may be?
A.	Which date, Counsel?
Q.	3 May 1994.
A.	I don't know that document, Counsel.  I am going to talk about a summary that you gave me of the document.  I am just responding off the cuff here.  We have to look at the historical context.  What was the context at the time in Kibuye?  Kibuye, one of the worst massacre sites.  He was at a meeting with the prime minister -- we are talking about Ndindabahizi -- amongst people who, of course, belong to the Hutu Power wing, the extremists, and they are against the PSD for all of the reasons that we spoke of yesterday.  The PSD was considered by many politicians, many Hutu politicians, as a true accomplice, an objective accomplice of the RPF, therefore the Tutsis.  

There again -- and I must repeat myself over and over, I always say the same thing -- here again, we have to talk about a survival strategy.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, well, I don't find it surprising, that, Mr. Ndindabahizi would say such things to get himself up, but what he said is not maximalist, it's the minimum he could have done to avoid a machete on the top of his head or a club over the head.  He is still in his survival strategy.  And so if you interpret the words as that, as those that he said, I don't see anything more than a willingness to try to gain some time, and, in rugby, just trying to make a pass.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Expert.  Thank you very much for your cooperation.   I don't have any further questions for you.  We do appreciate your coming before the Tribunal to speak with us, and I believe that the Prosecution probably has some questions for you.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have two more documents to tender, two more documents; first, the CV of the expert, the signed version.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	All right.  That will then replace the present D. 50.  The signed version will replace the document which we entered as D. 50 a few minutes ago.

Yes?
MR. BESNIER:
The last document is the expert report itself that the Tribunal already knows about.  It was disclosed several weeks ago.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So you want, first, the preliminary report dated February 1996 from the commission concerning genocide and massacres to be entered as D. 52 first; that is the first document.  And then after that one, you would wish the expert report itself to become D. 53, the French version being D. 53(A) and the English D. 53(B).
MR. BESNIER:
That is it, Mr. President, indeed.  Thank you very much.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 52 and D. 53(A) and (B) admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, did you -- did you refer to Mr. Prunier also?  Did you, in connection with this meeting, refer to a document by Mr. Prunier?  You remember that I tried to find out your sources for the events on the 8th of April, and we have now gone through Alison Des Forges, page 230 of her book, page 14 of her expert report; that was one thing.  Then we went through P. 25, and we took note of what was in there.  Then, thirdly, we have looked at Filip Reyntjens' book, in particular page 88.  Now, did you also did you also refer to Mr. Prunier in that context yesterday, as far as the chronology on the 8th is concerned?
THE WITNESS: 
	In his book, Mr. Prunier does not speak of the day of the 8th of April.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is fine.  Thank you very much.   

Cross-examination?
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Professor Lugan. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Professor, I am going to ask you a few questions pertaining to -- pertaining to your testimony yesterday and today.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Prosecutor kindly repeat the question, please, for the interpreter?
MR. KAPAYA: 
I was saying I am going to ask him a few questions pertaining to his testimony yesterday and today, and to the contents of his report.

BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q:	Now, Professor, when I look at your report, I note that except on the introductory part where you talk about the origins of the ethnic groups, you don't -- you do not provide any references or bibliography for the conclusions that you make from pages 5 to 20.  There are of course, a few footnotes scattered here and there, but these are basically explanatory notes.  They are not, as such, references to the materials you used in reaching your decision.  What do you say to that?
A.	Counsel, indeed, that bibliography was given to you in large part during the hearing itself.  It was a photocopy and references.  Counsel, I thought that it wasn't a really university academic work that should be referenced as an article or a university paper.  I was asked to give a presentation of the general framework and the chronology.  Of course, I can give you a detailed bibliography, especially since I'm working currently on this issue and a bibliography is very important when you do such work.  I think that from the beginning, maybe, it was a bad direction, but this bibliography, I can give it to you.  And, in fact, yesterday I talked at great length about it and even earlier today during my testimony.
Q.	So you agree with me, Professor, that your report, the way it stands, is insufficient to support the conclusions that you have made?
A.	I do not have the same feeling, Prosecutor.
Q.	So you are saying the report as it is, without a bibliography, without references, without sources, you want this Tribunal to believe what you have put there even without those basic documents to support your findings?
A.	I didn't mention the bibliography.  It was a question of works that you were not cognisant of and works that were not in the purview of the Tribunal.  We talked about Prunier, we talked about the report of Madam Des Forges and various books by Reyntjens.  We have talked about all these works that you have which, for me, were considered as being in the public purview and that of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Also, I did point out certain works that are very precise but that are not in your own area of speciality that shed light on the issue.  I don't think that I needed to expatiate on all of these issues for the benefit of the distinguished members of this Tribunal.
Q.	Yes, thank you, Professor.  Now, still on your report, on pages 1 and 2, you assert there are very clear racial distinction between the Hutu and Tutsi.  You say that the Hutu and Tutsi are categorisations that are racially determined at birth, like sex, and that they cannot be changed.  Now, do you still maintain that theory?  You didn't talk about it in your oral testimony.  Do you still maintain the contents of that theory as contained in your report?
A.	Prosecutor, thank you for that question, because yesterday I didn't want to bother the President, and I did try to be succinct concerning this part.  But it gives me the opportunity of doing so, and I will do so and I will probably go beyond that, and I will rely on the works that I am going to mention, that is, works on genetics, quite recent now, that will corroborate what we know linguistically, ethnographically and historically.

Now, let us be clear.  At the origin, at the origin, we are dealing with two different populations from two different areas of Africa.  It did happen that in the course of the centuries, blending did take place. There was blending and alliances, so it is impossible today, unless one is farcical scientifically to say that there is a Hutu typology and a Tutsi typology.  But what I am saying, what I am maintaining is that we are dealing with two different populations from the very onset, from the very origin.  Have I covered that question, Prosecutor?
Q.	I am being rather specific, Professor.  I am saying, do you still maintain that racial theory as contained in your report, very briefly, that the sources, the origins of Hutu and Tutsi -- I mean, the distinction is racial rather than socially constructed; that when you are born, you are born a Hutu or you are born a Tutsi?  This is not something that you construe socially, I mean in society.  Is that your theory, because that is what you appear to be propagating in pages 1 and 2 of your expert report?
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  Your question is very clear.  I do quite understand very clearly.  Yes, absolutely.  Here we are dealing with sole theories, sole theories.  For many, many years, researchers are divided into various categories.  Some categories concerning this issue of origins -- I hope I am not going to bore the Tribunal, but since you are giving me the opportunity I shall expatiate on this.

For some researchers, usually researchers that are in the Marxist or post-Marxist era, we are faced with economic distinctions; for other researchers, we are dealing with ethnic distinctions.  Now, the two are erroneous.  Why?  We are not dealing with ethnic groups in the semantic sense of the word.  I said so yesterday.  What is the definition of an ethnic group?  It is cultural, it is linguistic.  It's not racial.  The linguistic and cultural element determines the ethnic group in Rwanda, both for the Hutus and the Tutsi.  We are talking about people who talk the same language, they have the same culture, they belong to the same state, they are aware of the fact that they belong to the same political world.  So that, by definition, these are not ethnic groups.  In certain research, we are talking about castes.  And all these elements are fundamental and they will explain the genocide.

They are of fundamental importance.  Why?  Because either one belonging to one world or the other is final, just as sex, and it is from birth, or it is mobile, just as any economic speciality.  The Tutsi are rich, the Hutu are the poor.  A poor man can become a rich man and a rich man can become a poor man.  No, that is not the case in Rwanda.  In Rwanda one is unfortunately either Hutu or Tutsi, and 1 million people died, and this shows that that tragic reality is the historic reality, is the social reality.  

I will not transgress that, Mr. Prosecutor, because I can dwell upon on this for hours and hours on end, and this is my thesis of 1,700 pages.  I shall not talk as a specialist here, but I can tell you that I am one of those historians that believe that, apart from particular cases of blending here of one climbing the social ladder, it has happened in the past.  We know some of them.  There was on the one hand a Hutu world and on the other hand a Tutsi world.  There were ladders here and there.  During the colonial period those ladders were cut off.  The passages were religious, because those two worlds were not opposed to one another during the pre-colonial period.  There were quarrels between dynasties, et cetera, but there was no place for the extermination one of the other as we saw in Rwanda in 1994.  There were safety valves here and there which are such that through blood alliances, through religious cults, all these things disappeared with the missionaries.  The missionaries forbade alliances.  When in the battlefield, there were Tutsis here and Hutus there, the Hutus fought together, and if there was an alliance between Hutu and Tutsi, it was done, and that was often beyond the ethnic fact.  And so there was solidarity here and there.  There was marriage, for example.  Marriage, inter-marriages were eliminated.  

Now cults, traditional cults, they were there not as Hutu or Tutsi, the cults transcended the realities.  They were eliminated as being pagan by the Christians, Catholics or Protestants.  So that those bridges disappeared.

Very quickly, I talked about three categories that are chiefs:  the chief of the land, the water, et cetera. Some chiefs were Hutu, and after the government scheme in 1921-1924, these bridges disappeared. So that there were two elements:  one was one, a Tutsi, one was one, a Hutu, one didn't become a Hutu or a Tutsi because of the number of cattle.  My thesis is entitled, "Between the hoe and the ownership of cattle", and this is my final position, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, if it were put to you that whether you were a Hutu or a Tutsi, leaving aside whether you call it race or ethnicity or whatever, in the final analysis, depending on whether you have an "H" or a "T" on your identity card, if that was in practice the test, would agree with that, and if so, how would that coincide with the irreversibility doctrine on page 2?  I think that is linked to Mr. Kapaya's question.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that is the question he is indirectly asking, I think.
THE WITNESS: 
	Mr. President, could you be clearer as to your question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it were put to you that whether you were regarded as a Hutu and a Tutsi because of intermarriage, same religion, same culture, living together for centuries, very difficult to find often really big differences, even if you have the two-finger-in-the-nose test, et cetera, et cetera.  Now, because people were so similar, maybe therefore that what it really boiled down to, whether you were conceived as -- or perceived as a Hutu or a Tutsi was whether you had an "H" for Hutu or "T" for Tutsi on your ID card.
Now, would you agree that that was the position, and if you agree, how does that coincide with the doctrine that it was irreversible?  In other words, once you were Hutu, you were a Hutu, because people might change their ID card.

Now, what would be your comment to that, not to elaborate it, please, but just, I think that is what the Prosecutor is trying to put to you indirectly.
THE WITNESS: 
	My answer - I will be very short -- I do not agree at all with your position.  Is that brief enough, 
Mr. President?  I do not follow your reasoning, because you are trying to make me say what I am not saying.  I stick to my guns scientifically.  I can spend the whole afternoon explaining this, but this is what I am saying.  I believe I am one of two or three specialists in the world about this, and we can discuss it all day.  I am prepared to discuss it. 
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	Professor, very briefly, you - it's your position that you still maintain the racial theory, don't you; yes or no, maybe, to cut the matter short?
A.	I maintain the fact that to be Tutsi or to be Hutu is as final as sex.  Even if you are in the Belgian period at the time when ID cards were made on the basis of the moment, some Hutus will say they are Tutsi, some Tutsi will say they are Hutu, depending on circumstances, depending on relationships here and there.  But I am talking about definitions that are the original definitions, these are the basic definitions.  I am not talking about exceptions; we can find exceptions.  I am talking about the general basis, and I am formal on this, Prosecutor.  You haven't heard that very often here, but I am confirming and I am upholding that position.
Q.	Professor, that's exactly what I wanted to find out, and actually you have propagated these views in several newspapers like Real Afrique, you know that paper in France, then there is Identities, L'Afrique, Minute La France, National Hebdo and Present.  Are you aware of those papers and have you written extensively in those papers about this particular theory?
A.	What do you mean by particular theory?  If I refer to the general history of UNESCO and the preamble section of the general history of UNESCO, it says, "We do not reject the word of 'racial difference'."  I see what you are trying to drive at.  Let us not talk about race.  I am not talking about race.  Let us talk about genetic differences and we will all be happy.  I am happy to see that my modest view in Real Africa is known to people as honourable as the Judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  This is an honour for me, and I am very proud of it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I am not aware of that article, but the Prosecutor was referring to it, I think, yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yes, Professor.  Actually what I'm asking you is that this particular racial theory which you have advanced in relation to the Hutu-Tutsi relationship in Rwanda, it's something that you have -- I mean, you often write about, and you have written it in these papers which I have just quoted to you, and I will show you -- I will show some of the articles.
	(Pages 12 to 21 by Petrus Chijarira)



































1530H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is that so, that you have written extensively on the subject?
A.	Indeed, I have published about 15 books.  I published several intense articles in Rwanda.  My letter of officials so, a quantity of maps, of Atlas, in all languages.  I'm an author that is very well read, and I am quite happy and proud about it.  I was -- worked in collaboration for several réveils and over the last 10 years I have my own réveil called The True Africa, which is a very elitist review.  It is limited in dissemination through subscription.  And the reviewers get talking about things that one doesn't talk about.  We talk about -- with people from some political schools of thought and this is about a certain vision of Africa which may be different from the vision I have.  I'm not an ideologist.  I believe I have shown that I had a little knowledge about Rwanda, and I had little knowledge about the issues here, and I wanted to create my own réveil in order to delve into the problems of Rwanda, because one cannot be interminably right about Rwanda.  But in réveil, the issue does not belong to one. This is why I have my réveil.  I can give you a copy.  If -- you may not have a copy, although you mention it.  I can make a copy available to you.  It's in my briefcase, Prosecutor.
Q.	Professor, you have also written several books on South Africa in Defence of that policy of Apartheid, have you not?
A.	Prosecutor, there are -- you are not properly informed.  This is the fault of the Internet.  You took the name of Lugan from the Internet and then you went on the sites of people whose profession is calumny and, as the Prosecutor, the above act is a good historian.  He didn't go to the source.  He is now disseminating rumours that I had to pay for 14 trials that I won.  Do you want us to embark on this road about calumny, Prosecutor?
Q.	Professor, the University of Lyon 3, is their representative for the revisionist theories.  Is that not correct, where you teach.  You teach at the university of Lyon 3 in France.  Now, that university is renown well over for the revisionist theories.  Is that not correct?
A.	Prosecutor, you are manipulating syllogism with a seeming innocence that would make the academy laugh.  We are, at the university of Lyon 3, we are legal experts, economists, philosophers, people of art.  We have about 12 to 15 faculties.  We have 4,000 lecturers.  I do not know what you are talking about, because indeed, when one talks about revisionism one talks about Lyon 2, not University of Lyon 3, the other university of Lyon.  

Mr. Prosecutor, this is where the Internet fails, once again, because documentation based on the Internet without any criticism gives rise to calumny and not to scientific debate.  I thought we were here to talk about Rwanda and the PSD.  Now you are telling me rumours that were taken to Court, and I won 14 of them.  And now I refuse to be dragged into such a debate, and I will not say anything further.  Let us be scientific here, if we may, and not talk about rumours, the type that is merely meant for recreation, if I may so say.
Q.	What I'm telling you now is that on the transcripts on the testimony of a witness, Professor Chrétien, in the Nahimana case -- these are proceedings dated the 5th of July 2002 -- he was asked about you and these are his comments, your fellow professor.
MR. KAPAYA:
Now, let me provide the others with the material I'm talking about and the professor for his comments. 
THE INTERPRETER:
If the interpreters could be availed a copy, please.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, then professor, and members of the Defence, this is a set of documents, they are transcripts and downloads from the Internet which support the basis upon which I'm asking the professor these questions.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Professor, I would ask you to take some time, if you don't mind, to go through them and make a comment, if you don't mind, on those documents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe that is not such a practical issue.  Now, if you would just glance quickly through these documents and acquaint yourself with them.  And some of them you may have seen and others not.  

And then I think you should go document by document, if you so wish, Mr. Kapaya; otherwise it becomes too general and the discussion may become a bit complicated.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Professor, I refer to you the first one, it's the transcripts in Clement Kayishema, whenever you have them before you.  Do you have them?
A.	I have it before me.  Yes, I do have the documents there.
Q.	This is the 5th of November '97.  The witness who was testifying here was Professor André Guichaoua.  I don't know whether you've heard about this man.
A.	Yes.
Q.	On page 11 there is a question.  Do you know the words of Bernard Lugan?  He said Logan but what he means is Lugan.  It's a two-page document, Professor, the very first one which I have handed you.
A.	I don't have it.  No, I can't find it, page 11, number 11.  I don't have it.
Q.	Okay, there is a question there.  "Do you also know the works of Bernard Lugan?"
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Now, and this was Mr. Besnier who was asking questions to Professor Guichaoua.  The question reads" "You also stated yesterday morning that there is no real history on Rwanda.  Do you know about the works of Mr. Lugan, his scientific approach to the history of Rwanda?  Do you not think it is sufficient in its approach?"  Guichaoua says, "It is always very difficult to make very appropriate statements about the works of my colleagues; nonetheless, I feel that with regard to his works and, in particular, to those made by Bernard Logan, I do not agree with the theories he has presented."  Have you found that?
A.	So (interpretation unintelligible) very well.  We can talk about it.  He doesn't agree with my theories.  What's his curriculum vitae as compared to mine?  I'm ready to talk to anybody.  I do not use these foul methods.  

Yesterday you saw that I do have -- I gave you the impression that I knew the history, of  Rwanda.  Probably I gave you an impression that is different.  I am suddenly of an opinion different  than his.   We are talking about -- I'm from the French academe.  I'll go back to academe.  The problem is very clear.  We are dealing with a problem of two schools of thoughts, Africanese, the French Africanist -- this is a very Franco French problem.  He defends the theory that there's no Hutu -- no Hutu.  He is saying Hutus and Tutsi were created by organisation.  I'm saying no.  The Hutu and the Tutsi were not created by organisation.  They were there before.  Not only were they there before but they are two elements, but they are different.  

On that basis, and nothing more, came tumbling down on me and you were here to weaken my position, my scientific position, to attack me on areas that I'm not scientific.  I am sorry to say so, this is not cricket.  We may very well talk about science, but to talk about persons that gave into them, these are not articles, they are interviews or interpretations of interviews.  I've always accepted it is the work of the university man or research worker to use what he has been able to discover, what he has been able to observe, and a university teacher-research worker should be able to talk to a panel as different and, as possible, I've done this in all areas, in all forum.  

I can tell you about the news that you haven't heard.  Internet doesn't give you everything.  For calumny, Internet is excellent; but for scientific work, there is less of that.  I can talk about (interpretation unintelligible).  For example, if a journal is a newspaper, it is not politically committed.  I worked with Figaro, it's an economic newspaper, a centralist newspaper in France.  I work with economic reviews.  Now you discard all of that.  You discard all my interventions.  

You should remember that you are face to face with an expert who is a professor at the school of Lyon in France, (interpretation unintelligible) studies professor in all the main military academies.  Now all the people you are talking about are nothing.  They are in the establishment of politically correct, indeed, but I am in another secteur.  You can talk about economic jealousy in France, perhaps it's different elsewhere, but all this is to say that I am disappointed.  I am disappointed on coming here.  I have about 450 students first year, 250 students second year.  We have my I exams in one and a half months.  Do you believe that my university allowed me to come here for eight days to come here to explain foul calumny that you are passing on me?  I am here to give you my conviction, to teach you about my realities and what I know about Rwanda.  When you talk about rumours, where is the justice, where is the fate of the Accused?  This is ridiculous.  I am not saying anything further on this issue.  No use you asking me any further questions on this, Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the witness has responded to the first document.  What is your next document?
MR. KAPAYA:
My next document, Your Honour, is transcripts in the Nahimana case.  That is page 58, line 12 to 14.  We have here another professor, Professor Chrétien.  He was asked about the reputation of Lyon 3 University in France and this is what he says. 

"Lyon 3 is a university which is very well known for the importance of their negationist theory", and then on page 39 he goes on to say, "The Minister of Education in France had to launch a kind of audit on this university, and this was because of the furore which had developed around the teaching of that university.  And I'm saying that Mr. Lugan avers to that way."  That is page 39, line 29.  These are the transcripts recorded before this Tribunal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you answer that question, Mr. Witness, let me say that this is the only question put to you by the Prosecutor.  But the Court, of course, is quite aware that there may be -- now this is the question put to you by the Prosecutor and you are now free to respond to that, but before you respond, in view of your previous answer let me simply say that the Court is, of course, aware that there may be difference of opinions between scholars, and that is normal.  So we are aware of that.  So this is not extraordinary in a trial, and it is not very dramatic, but this is the questions from Mr. Kapaya.  So what is your answer when this is being put to you?
THE WITNESS:
Chrétien is not one of my colleagues.  He's not an academic.  He never had the chance of being integrated into a university.  He's a researcher from the CRNA.  He is totally incapable of speaking before an amphitheatre.  That's why he was never recruited to be in a university, he's not part of my world.  I'm a teacher and researcher.  He's a researcher at the CRNA who works in his office alone and I'm in contact with many students every day.  He is not my colleague.  Reyntjens, on the other hand, is my colleague.  Guichaoua is my colleague.  Prunier is my colleague.  Chrétien is not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to put more documents to this witness, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, they are in a sequence there.  The next one is in French, this one is dated 30th October 2001, (no interpretation), something like that.  It has a photograph of a lady on top of it.
	This is the one, Your Honour. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Professor, this is the one, if you would care to look at it.
A.	I have that document, Counsel.  Yes, this is an excellent document which reflects exactly my thoughts.  This is the document to which I have nothing to add, especially when I explain to the population of central Africa this is a document which corresponds absolutely to my thoughts.  Ethnicism is a reality in Africa.  This is very good.  This is exactly what I said.  I agree with this.  Very well.  For the rest it's not correct, for this professor.  I don't know if in Anglo-Saxon countries you have Carnival or Shrove Tuesday.  Do you know Shrove Tuesday in the Anglo-Saxon world?  Well, I'm at the University of Lyon.  That is where we celebrate Carnival and we have a tradition of celebrating Carnival.  

We have two kinds of professors, from the old school there's one type who are afraid of their student and for them they wouldn't disguise themselves or put on a costume for carnival.  But I'm very easy going, and I put on a costume with the students every year.  The students, 150 of them, come in the amphitheatre and put on costumes.  And I do as well, and it's not something we take very serious.  That is a festival of liberty.  The king could be a commoner and the commoners could be king.  And we do this one time a year with my students, and we put ourselves on the same level.  We sing together, they put on costumes and I put on a costume and we sing together.  I like to sing old songs from the French navy, the colonial, and we put on costumes.  And speaking of costumes, because in this article it's talked about, this has come all the way to Arusha.  I'm a celebrity now.  

I had put on a costume of an officer from the 6th Regiment of Britain in Bengal with a beautiful uniform that comes from my family.  And there's the officer's stick that all the officers have.  I just saw today Tanzanian officers who had their stick.  I had a whip in my hands, they called me the "Whipped Professor" and I came in a costume of the 6th British Regiment in Bengal who went into India in the 1880s.  

Now we're on a very funny level, now, Mr. Prosecutor.  I didn't think I would come before the ICTR to talk about all of how we celebrate carnival in France.  Are you satisfied with my answer, Prosecutor?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Reading subject matter of this document is it -- is that really the subject matter?
MR. KAPAYA:
I don't know whether he has -- we are replying to the same document, actually.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Professor, I asked you to refer to this one.  Would you kindly look at it, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't that the document?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the one I'm talking about.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, of course, at the end of the document they talk about the professor with the whip.  And in the file before me you have another one on page 4, a document that talks about the colonial whip-wielding professor, and I'm talking about both documents at the same time, because they are talking about the same thing in parts.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But leaving aside this small thing about which I totally agree with you, Professor, that that is totally not the point here.  So let's leave that aside.  That's not what is interesting here.  I think the interesting thing is the substance.  That's what you are trying to put to the expert, isn't it, Mr. Kapaya?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Actually on this document, Witness, the one I'm holding now, I want to refer the professor to the fifth paragraph of this document.  Would you kindly look my way?
A.	The title is Biblimont.
Q.	From the (no interpretation)?
A.	Yes, absolutely.  Yes, yes.
Q.	Can you kindly read that in the record, please, and give us your comments on that?
A.	The fifth paragraph?
Q.	Back to the fourth?
A.	You are asking me to read it?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Myself?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Of course I will.  I will specify that I did not write this.  You're making me read an article that never came from me.
Q.	I just want you to read it and then make your comments.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The procedure now, Mr. Expert, is the following:  Since this document only is in French and this is a bilingual Tribunal, for some in the courtroom it is necessary to have you translate it.  That's why.  And since you speak such a beautiful French and Mr. Kapaya, with all his wonderful capacity, does not enjoy that.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So help us with the fifth paragraph.
A.	Very well.  I will read it by specifying that I did not write it. 

"Following his racist arguments", that is false, "the French academic, author of Philanthropic Colonisation to Humanitarian Colonisation, claims that pre-colonial Africa ignored writing, use of wheels, of pulleys, and animal traction."  This is completely false.  I wrote a history of Egypt.  I never said that pre-colonial Africa ignored writing, use of wheels and pulleys and animal traction.  I said that one part of Africa did.  I did not say pre-colonial Africa, as a whole. 

Regarding racists argumentation, that is a value judgment.  Shall I continue, Counsel?
Q.	Yes.
A.	"Publication of the thesis of Bernard Lugan has provoked controversy in the university world and the immigrant community of African origin living in France."  That's completely false.  Every week I hold conferences before associations of young immigrants and whenever I speak to them about the origins of the Berber peoples and the large cities in the Swahili world and the Trans-Saharan commerce they see, through me, not only someone who knows his history but also someone who loves this continent.  So this is not part of academia, Mr. President.  

Shall I continue?
Q.	Let's go to the next document.  I want your comment on each one of the documents.  Can you pick another one now before you, Professor?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, where are you now?  Are you on the --
MR. KAPAYA:
Corlander (phonetic).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, that one.  Do you have that, (no interpretation)?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have that one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you want us to look at there, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
I would like him to look at that document and just tell us whether he agrees with the substance of what is contained therein.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this time you don't have to read it.  You can just read it yourself, but you do not have to read it out loud, please.
THE WITNESS:
I know this document.  In fact this document enabled me to make a lot of money.  This document -- in fact, the author of this document had to pay me 400,000 French francs plus damages -- 800,000.  This is an article written by Didia Denard called 'Didia Denounced'. Didia the Denouncer.  He's a professional denouncer that I brought to trial.  If we can speak about the gist of this denunciation and we are coming back to perhaps an academic debate.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not so sure, really, Mr. Kapaya, whether we are -- isn't the brief version of the story here that this is probably one of the 14 trials and you won your case?  That is your answer.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, of course, Mr. President.  Of course.
MR. KAPAYA:
That would suffice.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, let's go to the next one.
A.	In fact, all of these documents have resulted in a trial I won.  This is the problem of the Internet, people are accused on the Internet, but whenever you win a trial that's never mentioned on the Internet.  So we are arriving at this problem today, where you are trying to discredit the serious and important things that I said yesterday and today under the pretext that the guy who saw the guy, who saw the guy, who saw the guy, is making syllogies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you will probably be able to come up with some other documents and the answer will be the same from the witness, that this is unfounded allegations and following lawsuits he won, and if that is the case could we maybe now leave that and proceed to the substance again?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Professor, I would like to ask you another question.  Do you support Mr. Le Pen and the nationalist political parties in France?
A.	Not at all.  My response is so spontaneous.  I'm what they call a right-wing anarchist.  I have no label, whatsoever.  I'm a free man and because I'm a free man I have the luck of being free because I'm a university professor.  I'm free because of my family situation.  I won't continue.  I had parents born before me, which is completely unequalled, but gives me great comfort in my existence.  This has helped me to refuse compromise.  I'm from a Protestant family.  Protestants don't laugh about these sorts of things.  We are rigorous people.  I have my moustache and my ways of living, but there are some limits we must not go beyond, Counsel.
Q.	So, Professor, you agree that your view or your academic interpretation of things does not agree with quite a number of your fellow academicians?
A.	Counsel, without being pretentious, I don't know if Newton was on the same terms with all of his colleagues, if all his colleagues agreed with him.  I don't know what the others think.  What the others think, I'm a researcher who knows Africa very well.  I've published many works.  I don't know just a little small part of Africa, as some of the researchers that you've cited.  I have the advantage of being a man who covers long distances and long times.  All of my university works always start with a very precise topic and enlarge it.  I'm a man who works on big major periods, linking periods.  It's these links that explain the rest of history. 

My scientific career, my publications speak for themselves.  My university title speaks for themselves.  What I told you yesterday, let's agree, Counsel, I don't believe that you can consider me as a joker from yesterday, what I said yesterday and today.  Perhaps through jealousy or any other reason for criticising my work, those people do what they want.  This is not serious business, Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, I must be a little bit firm here.  We are really not interested in this part anymore.  We've heard the questions and we've heard the answers.  Now, could we kindly move on to whether there are any comments on what the witness said in substance yesterday?  You have very rightly now, Mr. Kapaya, referred to one issue in the report, that was page 2, and that was commented upon.  Are there any other comments in that report or in relation to the oral testimony that you would like to focus on from now on, please?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Professor, I would refer you to page 3, the fifth paragraph, English, in your report.  I don't know, I think it's page 4, 4 in the French, where you write that, "Violence against the Tutsi in 1973 was started by PARAMEHUTU trade to try to obtain power." 

Now, what is the basis of you saying this?  What is your proof?  Do you have any proof for that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the English version.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
MR. KAPAYA:
English, page 3.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Paragraph?
MR. KAPAYA:
Fifth paragraph.
MR. PRESIDENT:
"Soon started a purge policy", that's the one.  Is that the paragraph, the relevant paragraph, "soon started"?
MR. KAPAYA:
Fifth paragraph, the active is in the last sentence, so, "In the first week of February 1973 they had for Tutsis scattered".
MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we have identified the sentence in the paragraph, yes.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel.  May I respond, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, sorry to tell you that in 1973 the PARMEHUTU had been out of power for 20 years.  You mean 1973?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yeah, that's what you write, Professor?
A.	No, 1973, not 1993.  The PARMEHUTU was chased out of power in 1973 on the 5th of July.  Not in 1993.  In 1993 this is the Arusha agreements, this is the MDR.  We are speaking of the PARMEHUTU from the first republic, correct?
Q.	I think there is a translation problem.  The paragraph in your report, the last paragraph in the English report says, "So in the fifth week February 1973 the hunt for the Tutsi started."  Now my question is, is it not an equally forceful explanation to say that the Habyarimana challengers for are the ones who attacked the Tutsis, not necessarily the PARAMEHUTU?  Why do you attribute it to the PARAMEHUTU?
A.	Counsel, in 1973 Habyarimana is not in power.  Habyarimana arrived in power in 1973, July.  We are speaking of February.  I don't understand your question.  I think, Counsel, that you have mixed up the dates.
Q.	All right, let's go to paragraph 7.  Paragraph 7, paragraph 6 in the English.
A.	Which page, Counsel?
Q.	Seven, paragraph 6 in the English part of this report.
A.	May I please have an English version?  I don't have an English version to be able to compare to the French.  There's no problem.  I understand English.  Let's work with the English text, that way we'll have no understanding issues or problems with dates, which should not come up into this type of historical debate.  Which page, Counsel?
Q.	It is paragraph 6, where the last paragraph says, "President Habyarimana, who lost his powers in and constitution even had to resign from the army."  Now, do you mean that when Habyarimana resigned from the army as general he lost his powers, is that your contention?
A.	Not at all.  Not at all.  I simply wanted to say that in the short term, the new constitution, he could -- there could no longer be a confusion between military and civilian power.  General Habyarimana had already reached the age of retirement.  General Habyarimana became a civilian.  He was president.  They went away from this policy, which was the authoritarian policy where generals maintain themselves in power.  We were, in a new system moving towards democracy, opening towards democracy.  Habyarimana, in this system, would start to lose his military label.  At any rate he had already reached the age of retirement described by the military.
Q.	Go to page 10, paragraph 2, where you talk about dissent in the political parties.  And you say that there were no dissents in the PSD.  Now, Professor, have you not read of a Mr. Nungura, a member of the PSD political bureau, in Butare, who was a very good friend of Nzirorera?  Isn't he one of the people who you said defected from the (interpretation unintelligible)?
A.	In the PSD, Counsel, there was no Hutu Power wing.  The party did not break up.  There were fractures within the party.  There were many resignations.  There were many -- there was much frictions in camps and sub-camps, and that was in the other parties, not in the PSD. 

The PSD is not an army regiment with a monolithic vision.  Every man has his own sensibilities.  Of course here or there you will find the exception, but as the Hutu opposition broke out against Habyarimana in that exploding world, which would implode later on following the RPF Tutsi attack and the assassination of President Ndayaye, what happened in the PSD is something we could call remarkable stability, compared to what happened in the PL party, in the MDR party, and compared to what happened in all the other opposition parties.  It's very clear.  That's the exception of the PSD.  It's too bad that that party wasn't more important, because it is a party of balance, a party that had a calling and had a programme and it had ideas that went beyond all of those old divisions of the past.
Q.	Okay, on page 11, the English version, the second and third paragraphs, you give the impression that it was from the 8th of July '93 when the RTLM was formed when Tutsi were officially labelled as accomplices.  Is that what you are saying there, Professor?
A.	Let me look at my French version for a moment to be sure of this translation, to make sure that this translation is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are still on this, "except for PSD"; that's where we are still?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where are you now?
MR. KAPAYA:
I'm now on page 11, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of the English version.

MR. KAPAYA:
Second and third paragraphs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
"From this moment on."
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, the translation in English is very good, but it seems to hack up my thinking.  In French, yes, yes, the meaning is there, but the nuance is absent.  What do I say?  

In French I say the following:  "In Rwanda the -- 
THE INTERPRETER:
Could the interpreters be given the paragraph, this is for the English for the interpreter, please.  Could he repeat the beginning of the paragraph, please, in French?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, settle down.  Exactly on where we are now, we disagree exactly on where we are now.  Now, you have, haven't you, Mr. Kapaya, referred to page 11, second, third paragraph in the English version.  Isn't that so, does it start with "From this moment on", or "In Rwanda"?
MR. KAPAYA:
It says -- you are right, Your Honour, it is the second and third paragraphs, but we start with the third paragraph.  To have meaning, one has to read in the context of the second paragraph.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I understand that.  But if you could kindly repeat the first word of the paragraph where we should start reading.  Is it "In Rwanda"?
MR. KAPAYA:
"In Rwanda".
MR. PRESIDENT:
So "In Rwanda"  And for the booth, then, have you found it?  That is page 11 of the French version (no interpretation), isn't it, at the bottom there, (no interpretation) is found?
THE INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we all have it.  

And, Mr. Kapaya, your question, Mr. Kapaya, which sentence do you want us to focus on here?
MR. KAPAYA:
The sentence I want the witness to focus on is the third paragraph.  He says, "From this moment on the Tutsi population living in Rwanda became hostages of the extremists because they were publicly and officially designated as RPF accomplices."  Now I asked him whether this was the first occasion - this was the occasion when Tutsi were now labelled accomplices of the RPF.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
THE WITNESS:
It's from that date that we truly noted the amplification of the denunciative process against the Tutsi as a whole, but let us declare, the massacres began well before that.  They began, as we said yesterday, advanced as soon as the advent of RPF entered the Kibiro region in October with massacres all over the country and that were to be accentuated in various stages of the chaos.  But it is clear from the time when the explosion, the disintegration of the opposition came about, from the time that the disintegration of the opposition gave rise to the alignment of the former adversaries or part of the former adversaries of Habyarimana with the CDR, for example, that we started seeing the policy of pointing the finger at Tutsi beginning to be useful in the political tools of those people. 
	(Pages 22 to 34 by R. Lear)

























	1615H
THE WITNESS (continuing):
It was the arguments they used.  

What were the arguments of those people they call Tutsi extremists?  Their argument is that they are the Hutu.  They said, "We Hutus are divided; it's a matter of course.  We don't have the same political approaches; we do have our own old quarrels; we hate each other, perhaps, but we are Hutu.  Now, how do we assert the fact that we were Hutus in the face of the Tutsi, in the face of the Tutsi, of the RPF, who are attacking us, in the face of all the Tutsis that live in Rwanda, that they are our accomplices that are going to rise against us when the RPF comes here?"  And this is very important, and this is why I entitle this paragraph B, "From the United Hutu Front to Hutu Power", because here we are dealing with the crux of the problem.  We had three forces in play: the RPF -- the RPF, the government and all that is around it, and then the Hutu opposition; three elements.  

Now, the political game that is going to divest Arusha of its entire meaning, is that we are going to be faced with two forces: the Hutu element disintegrated, and part of it went along with the CDR.  So that here we are faced with a bipolar world.  And in the bipolar world, the justification of this bipolarity is pointing at the enemy, and the enemy pointed at has always been pointed at.  But here it is really put in the forefront.  You see, "We, the Hutus, good patriots, who were lost because of the Arusha (interpretation unintelligible).   We were lost in supporting RPF because we thought RPF was a normal party.  Now things are clear.  We go back to where we belong, better late than never, and we are going to do that, because in spite of everything, we are Hutus.  We are Hutus in the face of the enemy".  That is the teaching; that is the ideology.  

Mr. President, have I covered the question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have absolutely, and if you could be a little bit briefer, that would be extremely helpful.  

Now, what is your next question?  Do you have many questions from the report, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
Just a few questions, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Professor, you said that you were a lecturer at Butare University from '72 to '83, right?
A.	No, no.  There were no grades.  There were no grades in the University of Rwanda.  I was a lecturer in Lyon since 1985.  In Rwanda we used North American criteria.  In the Canadian system, for example, there was classification.  I had a contract on the basis of French cooperation, which was one of assistant.  I was 25 years old.  I was working at the University of Rwanda as a lecturer in geography and history, but I was never a senior lecturer.  This is, very specifically, French.  There is a chair, and of course there are very few chairs in African universities.  One of them you mentioned.  I am a senior lecturer, so to speak, but in the other university, this is a different system.  

Have I covered that question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you have responded to the question.   
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, actually that was not my question.  I was not talking about grades.  I asked him whether he was a lecturer at Butare.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now listen carefully to the question: were you a lecturer in Butare?

Is that your question?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, between '72 to '83.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I think maybe Mr. Kapaya is asking this question because of the CV.  

Are you?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, I want to connect it with the Accused person, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, precisely.  I do not think that the Accused attended my lectures because he was not in my faculty.  I taught in Butare, in history, from 1972 to 1981 and in Ruhengeri from 1981 to 1983.  And of course, I taught at Butare at the same time. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So at the time you were a lecturer at Butare, he was a student there, right, for three years?
A.	Now, let me tell you that I do not know Mr. Emanuel Ndindabahizi.  I do not know him.  I believe that he studied economics -- not with me.  I was teaching the history of Africa.  And I had the happiness of being associated with Abbé Kagame, who has nothing to do with General Kagame.  He was a respected historian about Africa and Rwanda.  He ran one of the volumes of the UNESCO history.  He associated me with those lectures because we had intellectual community on certain elements concerning the history of Rwanda.  So that I only taught history.  A little bit of geography, but mainly the history of Africa.  That was my contract.  That is what my contract said, at any rate.
Q.	Now, Professor, we agree that, I think, that the interim government was formed on the 9th of April, and not on the 8th, when negotiations were going on, right?
A.	The swearing-in ceremony took place on the 9th at about ten o'clock in the morning.
Q.	And you allege that Mr. Ndindabahizi had joined the government as a matter of -- as a survival strategy.  Now, as a survival strategy, do you agree with me that he had to support the massacres in order to live?  I mean, did he have an alternative in that?
A.	I am not saying that at all.  Especially, I'm not going to make any gratuitous speculation.  What I can say I can demonstrate, and what I cannot demonstrate I cannot say.  As I said, when I speak about certain reports that I mention, these are not reports that I can corroborate (interpretation unintelligible) 100 per cent.  I have a scientific démarche; I do not speculate.  

What I want to say is that Ndindabahizi was taken hostage.  He was taken hostage at the ministry of defence, and he could not refuse that seat, that administerial portfolio.  Everywhere people had been killed.  There were dead bodies everywhere.  The massacres had begun, and we were in an atmosphere -- I'm sure you understood it yesterday -- an atmosphere of hell.  People had to make options very quickly because of survival.  And I am convinced there, and this is a conviction that I have no grounds for other than my own personal knowledge of Rwanda and the context 
historical (sic).  What the historian needs to, one, not to make any mistake about chronology; two, no mistakes about context in history.  

Now, from a historian, it is not objectivity.  It is to place himself in the context of the moment, because we are not people without bodies.  We are not (interpretation unintelligible) mechanical parts.  We are human beings; we have options to make in life and for survival.  And I am saying that Ndindabahizi had an option to make which would commit his family and people around him.  He could not have done otherwise.
Q.	Professor, are you aware that in the morning of the 9th of April, before the swearing in, 
Mr. Ndindabahizi borrowed a car from a friend, drove around in town to go and see where his wife and kids were, and then drove to the swearing-in ceremony, and actually was the last to be sworn in?  Now, if this was a person who was taken hostage, why didn't he simply drive away at this opportunity?  Why didn't he simply drive away with his family towards Gitarama and flee, if he didn't decide to take part voluntarily in this government?
A.	At the time, roads in Rwanda were as open as between here and Moshi.  There were bars everywhere; one could stop and have a drink, et cetera.  That was totally different at the time.  We were in a time of war.  

Now, I believe you'll be talking to Ndindabahizi.  It will be up to his counsel to ask that question.  I don't know what you are talking about.  I am talking about what I know.  I am a scientist, and that is an issue you should discuss with Mr. Ndindabahizi, not with me.
Q.	In mid-May, Mr. Ndindabahizi attended an ADB meeting in Nairobi.  Why didn't he simply choose to stay there if he didn't want to serve in the interim government?  He had that opportunity.  Why did he come back?
A.	Same answer.  Where was his family, by the way, at that time?  Ask him, I don't know.  I'm not Ndindabahizi's lawyer.  I'm here as an expert to try to explain what the PSD was as compared to PARMEHUTU, as compared to Hutu Power.  I didn't study the life of Ndindabahizi.  I don't know him.  I'm not going to stand here and speak as his lawyer.  I'm not his lawyer.  I'm here to shed light on the historical context.  We drifted into realm (interpretation unintelligible), et cetera, et cetera.  But that question I cannot answer.
Q.	I'm asking you this question, Mr. Witness, because on page 19 of your report, the first paragraph, and then on paragraphs 3 and 4, you say, "This man was taken hostage".  Where do you get -- I mean, where do you get that?  What's the basis of you saying that?  And you are saying he was trying to -- that at night they were kept at the hotel, probably to avoid flight.  So if you can speculate in your report, as you have been doing, why can't you speculate now?  Why can't you speculate now as to why he didn't (sic) stay there, why didn't he run with children?
A.	Because in the night of the 8th and 9th -- I'm not speculating at all; I am talking about facts.  This is not speculation.  In the evening of the setting up of the government, the army did take -- assign the new ministers to the hotel.  This is not speculation; this is a matter of fact.  The second question is speculation, and I'm not going to speculate.  That is not my area. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that's all the questions I have for this witness.  And I request to tender as Prosecution exhibits the bundle of documents as shown to the witness for his comments. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the first document you want to tender is the Kayishema, Ruzindana transcripts.  But there you can simply say, and I think it follows from the -- do you want to tender it, or will you be satisfied simply to have it -- it's public record and it's page 11.  But you want to tender it as a matter of convenience. 
MR. KAPAYA:
We would like to tender it, Your Honour, to tender them as exhibits in the way that they have been arranged.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, then.  P. 47 for the Kayishema transcripts.
MR. KAPAYA:
Can they simply be 47(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), Your Honour? 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  That's 47(A) for Kayishema.
MR. KAPAYA:
(B) for the Nahimana transcripts.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you see, (A) Kayishema, English, (B) Kayishema, French, (C) Media, English, (D) Un universitaire français défend la colonisation, (E) le négationnisme, (F) affaire Lugan, (G) biblio monde, and (H) demasque.  All right.
(Exhibit No. P. 47(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G) and (H) admitted)
  MR. KAPAYA:
      Yes, sir.  Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I can't object to these exhibits, but I deplore their political nature.  But I heard the expert say that verdicts were handed down.  Perhaps those verdicts should be heard for fairness to the expert.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's open, if so tendered by any party.  But the Court has noted that, as you will have noted from the Bench.  

We indicated that we were particularly interested in the substance of this report, and we also said that, when we came to the last documents, that as we understand it, Mr. Expert, these are the documents which we sorted in the 14 trials, which, according to the expert, he won.  So the Court has noted this. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  It was an order to prove that assertion and to confirm it, that when the time comes, I shall like to produce those verdicts.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)...that is, of course, perfectly all right.  So you will be free to do so, of course. 

All right.  That was 47.  Any re-examination, Defence? 
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, no additional questions. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Witness, good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 

JUDGE BOSSA:
I would like to refer you to this exhibit, which you already have before you.  I don't remember the number.  Is it 25?  And a book written by Gérard Prunier on the Rwanda Crisis, History of the Genocide.  Are you conversant with it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we talked about it earlier on with the President.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  Now, I would like to quote from both the exhibit and this book.  This book, its page 170, and what I'm quoting is produced under the sub-heading, "Negotiations Feed the Rise of Extremism".  Now, on this page the writer has this to say:  

"In the short term, the extremists' main preoccupation was how to stop the growing dynamics of peace, both in the country and at Arusha.  The MRND" -- D in brackets -- "kept protesting against the lack of consultation in signing the negotiations, while the CDR, in a more aggressive style, was demonstrating in the streets and fighting it out with MDR and PSD militants". 

Now, coming to this exhibit, which is interviews with the Accused, on page 8, the last paragraph on that page, it is stated there as an answer that the PSD was in opposition.  It was an opposition party.  "At certain moments, there were problems within our party and other parties.  Certain members were being accused of being too RPF, while others were being accused of rapprochement with the MRND, two parties recruited for the PSD and the MRND.  Previously, we had a party which was very united with MRND, which wanted to accede to power through the ballot box.  Our party was affected by the problem of division".  

Now, you have come here, to use your own words, "to explain what the PSD was", and you have said that there were no factions in this party.  I would like to have your comment on what the Accused says about this and what this writer has to say about these extremist factions in the PSD.  That is my fist question. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, Your Honour, the originality of the PSD in this context -- which is not the usual type of political context, that was before.  Here, we are dealing with splintered groups and disintegration.  The PSD is the only party that had no splinter groups.  I'm not saying that there were no quarrels.  There were no splinter groups, whereas all the other parties experienced splinter groups.  Now, the MDR, for example, when the militants fought with machetes, when Agathe was taken away, when Faustin was thrown out of the party, in the liberal parties they were at each other's throats.  Nothing like that happened in the PSD.  They didn't, probably, agree 100 per cent, but they had the wisdom -- because their political origins were different -- they had the wisdom to maintain the unity of the party.  Of course, we're not talking about a soviet-type party, with a directive from the politburo.  

What I am trying to say is that, whereas all the parties were breaking up, the PSD kept itself in unity.  This is a moot point.  We can discuss it.  Was it far-reaching, in-depth unity or artificial unity?  All I've seen is that there was no splintering PSD.  Now, let us count.  Tragically, PSD killed; they were to think, as some people have thought -- some people have said so.  The number of people dead -- wanted to show that the PSD was not seen as a party along the lines of Hutu Power.  There was no disintegration of the PSD.  We can talk about it for one or two hours, more than that, to say that this man or that man thought this way or that way.  The thing is, the party stayed united.  

Have I covered your question, Your Honour? 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  That will suffice.  

I have another question.  You have studied the history of Rwanda, as you have told us, and you have been shown the map which was tendered by the expert Des Forges.  I think this is the map.  I don't remember the number of the exhibit.  It showed political parties of bourgmestres in 1994, whatever interpretation is to be put on that.  

Following multi-partyism in 1992 and the enactment of the coalition government accommodating more parties, would you say that the bourgmestres, the appointment of bourgmestres, reflected the support of the party in a particular place to which they were appointed? 
THE WITNESS:
The question is very important, and I answered it yesterday -- not totally, because what you are saying goes beyond what we were saying yesterday.  As a matter of fact, the bourgmestres were appointed.  Some of them would be appointed by local assemblies, but they were very few and not very important.  And those bourgmestres were indeed going to join the political party.  Some of them would not change; that's why MRND would remain MRND.  Everybody was MRND before the multiparty system came.  Some will remain MRND; others would go to the PL, MDR or PSD.  

What one does not allow one to say is that the inhabitants of the commune were members of this or that party.  There is the leader, the one in charge of the commune, but that chooses to join this or that party, but the population is not concerned.  

Now, this map would have been useful if it were an election for the election of the bourgmestres, and the bourgmestres will stand on the basis of political lists, PSD, MRND -- PSD.  And if inhabitants voted for PSD here, PL there, one could say that the majority of the inhabitants of such-and-such a commune belonged to this party.  And this is not the case as far as this matter is concerned.  

Have I covered your question, Your Honour?
JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes, thank you.  Finally, you did say that -- well, you've given us an analysis of why the Accused joined the government, the interim government.  You have analysed his actions before joining.  I don't know whether you did bother to analyse his actions after he joined.  That is one leg of the question.  

The other one is that we had a witness here who was a PSD member, who was a protected witness, and he told us that the members of the PSD had three choices, only one wasn't a choice, really, because unfortunately some of them were killed, but they had a choice to run or to join.  And he was one of those who ran away, actually.  What is your comment on that one?  

Those are my last two questions.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
In a situation of conflict -- I don't know whether you have experienced one -- there are options, of course.  And very often there is the choice of survival, which is the least of the problems that will take you away from danger.  But usually, when you take that option you are opting for more danger, for a more dangerous option.  It's just like the hunters who go to catch birds.  They use strings, and if the bird puts a foot in that trap and the trap will hold it; but the bird would not put its foot in the trap, although it came to the point.  And that was the same case as Ndindabahizi.  Ndindabahizi was there at the pond; he had to make an option.  

I don't know Ndindabahizi.  I met him here.  I didn't even know how he looked.  He was in the same situation.  I don't think he was my student in Butare.  I don't know, probably he knows.  I don't know anything about that, so I cannot give you any answer other than the one I have just given you.  It is the instinct of survival.  If you morally have a knife on your throat, your first reflex is to push it away.  If you push it away, and you fall in a hole, what you are looking at is not the hole; you are looking at the dagger of a knife on your throat.  This is not a matter of option.  You don't look back to see whether there is a hole; you have the knife on your throat.  

Is that acceptable, madam?
JUDGE BOSSA:
But I wanted to know whether you also analysed the reasons why -- his actions after he stayed on.  You analysed the decision to stay, but did you analyse his actions after he decided to stay on, so that you can also give us an opinion on that? 

THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I'll be very clear.  I have no scientific evidence which would enable me to give you a rigorous answer.  I have some guidelines on the period that would follow the formation of the government, but other than that, I am in a complete fog.  That question is probably better put to Mr. Ndindabahizi, because putting it to me, I am incapable of answering that question, Your Honour. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  That's all. 
THE WITNESS:
Merci, madam. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we thank you very much for having appeared before this Tribunal as an expert witness.  Thank you also for having come the long way to Arusha.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, indeed. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thanks to the Bench, and goodbye, Mr. Prosecutor, as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is no need or time to begin anything new today.  But on Monday, then, Mr. Besnier? 
MR. BESNIER:
We are ready to begin on Monday, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  So we will start on Monday at two o'clock.  Court is adjourned.
