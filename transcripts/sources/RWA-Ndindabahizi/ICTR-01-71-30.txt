Thank you, Mr. President.
EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, yesterday we were talking about the afternoon of the 8th of April.  You were explaining the circumstances under which you were appointed as Minister of Finance for the interim government.  Can you take it up there again and tell the Tribunal what happened following that meeting on the 8th of April, that afternoon, 8th April 1994?
A.	Yes.  I was saying that on the 8th of April 1994, in the afternoon, at around 3 p.m. we were at the defence ministry in Kigali.  When we left, we went to the École Supérieure Militaire.  There the political parties, the representatives of those parties, met with the crises committee, and they did so to close the day's work.  That's it, Counsel.
Q.	Did you yourself participate in that meeting with the crises committee?
A.	Yes, I was there.  After giving the names of the PSD ministers, it was decided that we would stay in Kigali, and that for security reasons, therefore, I did not leave.  I remained with the others, and I was in that meeting.  That meeting was very short, however.  After that, we spent the night at the Hotel Diplomate.
Q.	Tell us briefly, what was the purpose of the meeting with the crises committee.  Was it to decide the guidelines of the government's policies, the broad guidelines, or was there something else?
A.	No.  We wanted to put a closing to that day's meeting, that meeting which was meant to set up the government.  The political parties had to say that the interim government was set up and that work was done and that the next day there would be a swearing-in ceremony.  That was the purpose of that meeting, if my memory serves me well.  If my memory serves me well, that was the only purpose of that meeting.
Q.	Where did you spend the night from the 8th to 9th of April?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on to the night -- now, this meeting in the Ministry of Defence, you arrived at the meeting at three o'clock, you told us yesterday, hum, isn't that correct?

THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you left the meeting when?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was in the evening, after we had finished that meeting.  It was from about 3 to 4 p.m.  After that we went to the École Supérieure Militaire.  So this was after the meeting that took place at the Ministry of Defence.  After that meeting we went to the military academy or ESM.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but what I want to know now is exactly when the meeting at the ministry ended.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I couldn't tell you I know the exact time.  I would be lying if I told you an exact time, but I know it was the evening, because when we left we went to sleep at the Hotel Diplomate.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But for how long did you participate at the MINADEF meeting, was it from 3 to 4 or was it from 3 to 7?  When did that meeting end, approximately? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was about 2 p.m. when we finished that meeting, because when we arrived the meeting had already ended and in a few minutes the names were given and nothing else.  The meeting after that was closed.  After that we went to ESM.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what came out in the English translation, now, was that you finished the meeting at MINADEF at 2 p.m.  What I heard previously was that you arrived at the MINADEF meeting at 3 o'clock.  So let's take this again.  When did the meeting at the ministry start, and when did you leave it?  Can you assist us with that, approximately?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
We arrived at the Ministry of Defence, the PSD delegation that is, at around 3 p.m., and our stay there was not very long.  The meeting was over when we arrived.  The PSD was simply asked to give names.  There was no more meeting, and it didn't take very long.  But telling you it's 2 p.m. or otherwise, I can't give you the exact time.  I would be telling you a lie if I tried to give you an exact time, but it was at about that time.  And after it was finished, we went to the Ecole Supérieure Militaire, but I can't give you the exact time, and please pardon me for that, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's all right.  But will you estimate the time you spent at the ministry at about half an hour, 15 minutes, one hour, leaving aside the time.  But how long were you there -- that's what I want to find out -- before you went to the École?  Can you help us?

THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I think it didn't last more than 30 minutes after our arrival.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we come to the ETM meeting.  And when did that one start, approximately?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was between 1 and 6 p.m.  But, Mr. President, I can't be exact.  I can't tell you exactly when the meeting at ESM began, but I do know that it immediately followed the meeting which was held at the Ministry of Defence.  I know that it was after.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And approximately for how long did that second meeting last?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It didn't last very long.  It was only a question of a closing to the day's work.  Just to sum up what was done that day.  There were no discussions, in fact.  It was just to report what was done for that day, and we finished and went to sleep.  I, anyway, went to sleep at the ESM, that's where we were lodged.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Ndindabahizi, the question I wanted to put to you was the following:  Where did you spend the night of the 8th to 9th April?  You said earlier that you stayed at Hotel Diplomat.  Now you are saying École Militaire.  Have you made a mistake?
A.	Yes, I did make a mistake.  We did not sleep at ESM, we stayed at the Hotel Diplomate.  It's right next door.  They're right next to each other.  I'm sorry for that, Counsel.  Thank you.
Q.	Very well.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I need some clarification from the Accused person.  About this second meeting -- was it the meeting at ESM -- was it a meeting of the crisis committee with members of the parties?  What was it all about?  Who were meeting, who?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The participants in that meeting included the members of the political party committees, those who met on the 8th in the morning, or during the day during the 8th, and also the crisis committee.  Those were the only participants in that meeting.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And who were the members of the crisis committee?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It is difficult to answer your question.  It was soldiers.  I didn't know them all.  I knew two of them who were leading the others.  Those were Colonel Bagosora and General Ndindiliyimana and they represented the others, but the others were also there but I don't know their names.
JUDGE BOSSA:
That is all, thank you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, now it's the 9th of April in the morning, you are at the Hotel Diplomat.  What did you do in the morning, the 9th of April?
A.	On the 9th of April in the morning I woke up, but I had a problem.  In fact, since the 6th of April I had been separated from my family and, as I told you yesterday, I believe my wife and two children had fled towards Kicukiro.  I had three other children who had spent the night with another family, of friends of ours.  On that morning of the 6th I thought that I should try to do something to get my wife back with me, as well as the two children who were with her.  I borrowed a car from François Ndmbutse (phonetic).  He had a small car.  I knew how to drive.  I also had a gendarme accompany me, so  I could go and get my family in Kicukiro.  We were asked to stay at the hotel for security reasons, because the names of the future ministers had already been made public.  We were told to stay at the hotel for security reasons, but I ignored those orders because I was very worried.  I was worried about the fate of my family.  I absolutely, whatever the cost was, had to find them, and I knew I was risking a great deal.  I went to try to find them in Kicukiro.  My wife, in fact, before the telephones were cut off on the 8th, on the 7th, therefore, of April, she called me to tell me where exactly she was in Kicukiro.  So I left to look for my wife in Kicukiro, and I went to the place she told me where she was.  She was at a convent.  I didn't know that convent, but I asked around and people told me where the convent was.  I saw the manager of the convent, who told me my wife had left that night.  But she said she didn't go very far.
JUDGE KHAN:
What do you mean convent, by a school or what is this?  You just mentioned convent.  What was this?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was a place where Catholic nuns lived.  There's a convent of the Catholic Church, which housed Catholic nuns.  There was a nun managing that convent, and that was who I went to see. 

No, it's not a school, it's a place where the Catholics -- I think Catholics know what that is.  But it's a place where young girls who have given themselves to Jesus's service, who don't get married, and they live there and the church houses -- the Catholic Church lodges them there.  I'm a Protestant and I don't know too much about all of this, the other church so I can't give you all the explanations I would like to.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Your Honour. 

So the manager of that convent told me that my wife had left the night before.  She was very nice to me, and she accompanied me to go to Kicukiro, to the technical school, where there were many refugees there.  She thought that perhaps my wife had gone over there.  There were Belgian soldiers guarding that place.  I asked the soldiers at the roadblock, at the entryway, if I could go in but I was sure to leave the vehicle and the gendarme a bit further away.  I did not find my wife there at the technical school.  I continued to look for her and in the end I found her.  She was on the road towards Mibilizi.  She had spent the night on that road.  I saw the child, also.  I asked, "Where's your mother?"  The child went to call mother, and very quickly we all got into the car.  I dropped off the nun manager at the convent, and then I immediately went back to Kigali.  It was at the very last minute, just before the swearing-in testimony; in fact, it had already begun.  I was the last one to come into that meeting.  They were looking for me.  They hadn't found me.  I came in.  They immediately gave me a piece of paper and on that piece of paper the oath.  The text of the oath that I had to take was on that paper, and I took it immediately.

But in the morning, that is what I was doing.  And the last thing that happened was the taking of the oath.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Two questions come up regarding this morning of the 9th of April.  The first, there must have been a combat zone in Kigali and even crimes must have been perpetrated against honest people.  How could you go from the Hotel Diplomate, where you were, to Kicukiro, and return unhindered?  How is it possible to do that unfettered?
A.	Well, it was very early in the morning.  At about 8:00 the situation had calmed a bit.  There was no shooting.  It wasn't too far.  I think it was some three kilometres, not more.  But you must understand me, also, I knew there were risks involved, but I also knew that I had to save my family, even if I was risking a great deal.  On that morning, though, there was a bit of calm in the air, nobody was shooting at us, the RPF was next to Amahoro stadium.  And on the road towards Kicukiro there were still gendarmes walking about, government gendarmes; this was still in the government controlled zone.  That road was still protected and guarded by the gendarmes.  I saw them there.  I couldn't have done anything differently.  Without my family, I wouldn't have had nothing.  I took the risk.
Q.	Very well, the second question that comes up is that you found your child and your wife, you were in a car, there's a gendarme with you, why didn't you flee right then and there, instead of falling into the trap of the government?  Why didn't you just flee on the spot?
A.	You've asked me that question since yesterday.  And counsel for the Prosecution also asked Lugan, the expert Lugan that question, "Why didn't Ndindabahizi flee?  He had just gotten a car, he was protected by a gendarme, he should have taken advantage of that occasion to flee."  What I tell you to that is that if you knew what was going on in Kigali where we were, if you knew what was going on, on the road that I was travelling on -- do I know what is going on everywhere throughout in Kigali, because to get out you have to get out of Kigali.  The RPF was present; they had surrounded the city.  There were killers running about the city killing people.  There were roadblocks erected by those killers and by Presidential Guard soldiers.  I was running a risk of running into those people.  Once again, it was total insecurity. 

And then a friend, a member of our party, who gave me his car -- he was with his wife and his children.  He stayed at the Hotel des Diplomate.  So, was I to leave with his car and abandon him there with his children?  That would be too egocentric.  He gave me a vehicle.  Did he do it so that I could flee?  How much petrol was still in the tank?  With that much petrol how far could I go and with a gendarme, a gendarme assigned to me by Rafiki?  If I decide to flee, will that gendarme agree to accompany me as I flee?  Would he agree to do that?  I don't know.
THE INTERPRETER:
There's some static in the microphone and apparently it's the paper in front of the microphone.  The French interpretation is asking that -- no, no it's just because the paper, as you are touching it, is making noise.  It's not that there is something written on it.  That's not what we are saying.  It's just that the noise comes through the microphone.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
He's saying that I'm handling the papers.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, remind us where and at what time you took the oath of office.
A.	I took the oath of office at the Hotel Diplomate at about 9 or 10 in the morning, but I can't give you an exact time.  I remember it was in the morning, 9 or 10 in the morning. Let's say 10 o'clock, 9:30.
Q.	Now, following the oath of office, you became the Minister of Finance.  Did you decide to go to the Ministry of Finance on that day?
A.	Well, we were sworn in on the 9th, and on the 9th, if my memory serves me right, it was a Saturday.  It was the beginning of the weekend.  So I did not go to the ministry.  What would I do at the Ministry of Finance on such a day?  I did not have any keys to the ministry.  I didn't have any work to do there.  It was the weekend, so I did not go to the Ministry of Finance.
Q.	Tell us when the new government met the first time.
A.	I believe it was on that day of the 9th.  It was on that day of the 9th, there was a small meeting, but I do not have the minutes of that meeting, just as all the minutes of the meetings of the cast of ministers were not supplied to us.  But on that Saturday there was a small meeting, the first meeting of the government.
Q.	Now, during that meeting, did the government talk about the violence in Kigali and in the rest of the country?
A.	I believe that what was discussed was what was happening in the area we were, because we didn't know what was happening in the rest of the country.  We didn't know anything about what was happening in the rest of the country.  Violence in the city of Kigali was known to us.  This was all we knew, and that was what was discussed.
Q.	Did the government decide to take measures to get those -- that violence to cease?
A.	Yes, indeed.  That was what was said.  That was what was decided.  It was decided that the minister responsible for security -- they requested to take measures to stop the violence.  The minister for security affairs, that is the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, to those ministries it was said something should be done.  And seems we thought that the youth of the MRND was involved.  We also asked the leader of that party to do something to intervene, so that the situation could be put under control.  People are told to calm down, and prevented from committing crimes.  But that was only for Kigali city, because outside Kigali city and in the hinterland of the country we did not have any information as to what was happening and, indeed, there was not even a telephone available.
Q.	Now, you yourself, as Minister of Finance, did you deal with state finances during the time the government was in Kigali?  Did you deal with state finances?
A.	Now, I did not get your question, Counsel, concerning state finances.  I did not get the question.
Q.	Now you were Minister of Finance.  As Minister of Finance, did you deal with financial affairs concerning the state?  Did you begin to do your work as Minister of Finance during the time the government was in Kigali or did you do something else?  In a nutshell, what did you personally do within that government?
A.	Now, Counsel, I told you that we were on a Saturday, that was Saturday, the 9th.  It was a weekend and the next day was the 10th, a Sunday.  So I do not see why you are asking me whether I did have anything to do with state finances.  What finance are you talking about?  What national affairs are you talking about?  This was a weekend.  There were no activities.  All that there was was what we heard that was happening in town, the war, the crisis, so that there was nothing else to think about, in terms of financial management.  There was no time for that.  It was not possible for me to do anything.  Perhaps you could make your question clearer.
Q.	Yes, perhaps I did not understand your response.  Did you attend any of the meetings with other members of the government at the time the government was in Kigali?  We are not only talking about the 9th of April, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  We are talking about the day during which the government was still in Kigali.
A.	Only 10th, that is the next day, there was yet another meeting of the government  council and I participated in that meeting.  

On the 11th of April there was another meeting, and that meeting was held with the préfet of the préfectures, and I did take part in that meeting as well.  So that in a nutshell there was a meeting on the 10th and there was another meeting on the 11th.
Q.	What was the agenda officially of the meetings mentioned?
A.	The meeting of the 10th, I do recollect that it was a question of obtaining information concerning the security situation within the country.  It was decided -- it was decided to call in the préfet to discuss the security situation.  The préfets, therefore, came the following day, that is the day after, that is the day after the 11th, and the purpose was to discuss the security situation.  There was no other purpose, other than that.  There was nothing else to do, because the country was engulfed in fire and blood, especially in Kigali, so that it was absolutely necessary for us to be put in the know as to what was happening in the country.  That was the purpose of the meeting of the 11th.
Q.	So how long did the government remain in Kigali, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	The government remained in Kigali up to the 12th of April in the morning, the morning of the 12th of April.
Q.	And why did the government have to leave the capital then?
A.	The government left the capital on the 12th in the morning; but, to my knowledge, no reason was adduced for that.  So that I went to see my children, who were at a friend's at Kiovu, that was at around 500 metres from the hotel, and when I came back I realised that everybody had gone away.  I left.  I asked as to what was happening.  I was told that they had left.  So, there was no official information as to the reasons why the government left Kigali.  The government left Kigali without I (sic) being told what was happening, and we simply took note.  It was later on that we were told that it was for security reasons that the government left.
Q.	Where did the government go after that?
A.	The government went to set up in Murambi, that is in the Gitarama préfecture.  The Gitarama préfecture, Murambi, that is the headquarters of the préfecture.
Q.	Now, how did you do to get to Murambi itself?  What did you do?  How did you get to Murambi itself?
A.	I did say to you that in the morning of the 9th I had borrowed a vehicle.  I borrowed a vehicle, because I had none myself.  There were two vehicles at the house, though, the driver, a car and the official car, and I had left them there at the house when I was on the run on the 7th of April. 

When I was to go and get my wife I had to  borrow a vehicle, but to leave Kigali I always had to resort to arrangements because, once again, I had to use a vehicle that I had to borrow.  A vehicle I borrowed from Pastor Twagiariayezu, who was the bishop of the Presbyterian church.  His wife was the godmother of one of my daughters and one of my daughters was there between the 6th and the 9th.  He was not there on the 9th.  He had gone to Kibuye.  When the plane of the president was shot down he was unable to come back.  It was, therefore, his wife who gave me the keys to his vehicle, which I used to take my family from Kigali to Gitarama.  I hope I have covered your question.
Q.	Were you accompanied by other persons to Gitarama?
A.	I told that family -- yes, I told that family that I was leaving and that the government had just left and that the family of Faustin Michel Twagirayezu was there, and I told that family to leave, because there other vehicles, and they used those vehicles.  So we left in a convoy.  On the way I was given some children by another family that I loaded in the vehicle, and I went on with them to Gitarama.  That was in the morning.
Q.	Why did that family, that woman, in particular, hand over children to you?
A.	The woman -- I knew her, and then when I met her on the road in between Gitarama and Kigali I stopped to see what was happening, because there were people on the road.  There were many people who were leaving, because in Kigali there was fighting and people were leaving, were beginning to leave Kigali in great numbers.  So I saw the lady and I stopped.  She was crying.  She was crying, and I asked her what was happening.  She told me, "Listen, my husband has just been killed."  I also knew the husband, but in the vehicle there were no seats available.  She decided to give me the two children that I loaded on the vehicle and we went along together.  So she gave me her two children.  She had one child on her back and another on foot, these were very small children, and she asked me to help and I accepted to help.  She even told me that the husband and her father had just been killed around Gatsata; that is on the road from Kigali to Byumba.  But it was in the neighbourhood of Kigali that they were killed.
Q.	What was the ethnic group of those children?
A.	Those children were Tutsi children, but the mother was -- the father was Tutsi and the mother was Hutu.  So they were Tutsi.
Q.	Please tell us, what were your first assignments in Gitarama as Minister of Finance.  Try to give us a picture, very briefly, as to what you did day after day.  What were your tasks, your duties as Minister of Finance in Gitarama?
A.	Well, really, to tell you, as Minister of Finance, with the terrible situation that obtained at that time, to tell you that I did anything was to say probably too much.  I cannot -- what can I tell you?  I'm a Minister of Finance.  Perhaps even the other ministers, was there anything for them to do?  I came to Gitarama and the government set up in Murambi, and at the same time there were many civil servants that had left Kigali, they also came to settle down in Gitarama.  So that the first thing that was there to be done, the first question that was put to the Minister of Finance, was to determine how the people were going to survive and live.  People had left Kigali on the 6th, that is the 12th, some of them left the 6th, others the 12th, and normally salaries are paid out at around that time and the salaries are paid through accounts, and civil servants did not cash their monies, because of the unfortunate events that cost us the life of President Habyarimana.  And upon arrival at Gitarama, people had nothing.  They had no money.  Some of them came here without their clothes, so that I was asked to do something about it.  Those that were to settle down in Murambi will have somewhere to stay, but what were they going to eat?  What were they going to do?  This was what I was asked to do.  And I tried to find some money to help all those people and to try to see to it that the banks opened, at least the banks at Gitarama are open, to be able to serve those that had accounts and money in their accounts.  That was the first thing I was asked to try to do, and that was the first thing I tried to do. 

Now, I do not know whether I should recount my day-to-day activities, because the government council had even asked me to secure state funds so that state funds were safely kept.  And I did precisely that.  I ensured that the governor of the national bank would do that, and he did that.  The banks came to settle down in Gitarama, and they opened for business, and they started serving the customers that had monies deposited with them.  The customers were served, those that were to be paid.  We didn't take into account the fact that the money was to go to accounts, we simply gave out instructions that monies were paid out on the basis of lists established, because there were the various ministries in Gitarama and the managers of the various ministries were in Gitarama, and it was easy to establish salaries because managers of the ministries, for the Minister of Finance, for example, was responsible for the salary distribution on the basis of lists established by the various ministries.  

That is a quite tedious type of work because of the disorder that obtained and at the time we had to know who was entitled to be paid, and payment was not only made in Gitarama, there were teachers and there were civil servants that were not in Gitarama.  That's why elsewhere in the country we had to serve them as well and all that had to be supervised.  And then, of course, there was the problem of the purchase, the procurement of food and supplies and contracts to be passed with suppliers that supplied various commodities.  There were advances to be paid to all the suppliers.  The Ministry of Finance, who was solicited to a great extent during that period, since the other ministries -- the other ministers -- because of what happened, had been done to the Ministry of Finance.  I cannot tell you I signed this order or that order on this day or that day.  I do not remember the secrets with which I worked.
Q.	Up to what time did you stay in Gitarama,  Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	Could you be clearer, we arrived at Gitarama on the 12th, and we stayed for the month of April and for the month of May, and that was May.  It was at the end of May that we left Gitarama.
Q.	Could you tell us the conditions under which you left Gitarama, you, yourself?
A.	Okay.  Counsel, please be a little bit clearer.  When you talk about leaving Gitarama, do you mean leaving Gitarama once and for all or leaving and coming back?
Q.	No, I mean leaving once and for all.  You said that the Government stayed until the end of May.  You had gone to Gitarama, you wanted to make headway.  We want to know the conditions under which you left Gitarama?
A.	Well, it was still the same set of circumstances.  We left Kigali precipitously; Gitarama too.  It was one morning that we were told that the RPF was in the vicinity of Kabaya and everybody started running away.  I ran away with others, and where did I run to?  How did I get away?  I had some in-laws in Gitarama, in this city or the town Gitarama, I had in-laws and it was right in that city the fighting was going on, and I was happy I came to take over that particular town.  And it was not easy for me because I had to evacuate that family -- that is the family of my in-laws -- with many, many members, about 20 of them.  I had to evacuate that family, transport them to Kibuye, and then I had to go back to get my wife to be able to move onto Gisenyi the following day.  
This was what I was able to do.  Probably you want some more details, so this is how we got to Gisenyi.
Q.	What itinerary did you use to get to Gisenyi?
A.	The way to Gisenyi -- I hope you remember the road network in Rwanda.  I left Gitarama and went up to -- that is on the Kibuye road, I went up to Rukabano and came back to Gitarama to collect the rest of the family and drop them at Rukabano.  I left that family at Rukabano with a friend, and I did know that my family was in Kirinda, because in May I had sent my wife and my children, and also the children of the préfet of Gitarama, I sent all of them the Kirinda, the state of Kirinda.  So I had to go and get them in Kirinda, and drove them to Gisenyi through Ruhengeri, that is the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road.  The next day I got to Gisenyi with my wife and the children, the five children and the children of the préfet Uwizeye Fidéle, that is the préfet of Gitarama.  We arrived there on the 3rd of June, I believe.  That is the way we arrived at Gisenyi and tried to get accommodation, and we tried to locate the government, while I tried to locate the government and rejoin the others in Gisenyi.
Q.	Why are the children of the préfet of Gitarama -- why were they with you?
A.	Now, the préfet of Gitarama -- in May -- that was when I came back from Nairobi, at around the 20th of May, there was serious tension in Gitarama.  We felt pressure from the RPF, and I wanted to evacuate my family, to put it away from the town.  But since my family was living with the préfet in Gitarama, when the préfet's wife saw that I was evacuating my family, they postulated that I had some other means, and they said, "Well, can you take our children along with you?"  Well, I believed that was not a problem.  I said that the children should stay together and, therefore, I sent them to Kirinda upon the request of their parents.

	1500H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  So that in the final analysis, where did you settle down in Gisyeni?
A.	In Gisyeni, I tried to look for accommodation at the Meridian Hotel, but the family was not with me.  I looked for a small house, where I placed them with the family of another minister; that is, the minister of social affairs, Minister Ramaneza (phonetic).  They tried to get the two families together.  We tried to get the two families together for greater security.  So that I spent the night at the hotel, but the families were put up together to facilitate their protection in the town of Gisyeni. 
Q.	What did your work in Gisyeni consist of?
A.	It was the same as in Gitarama: paying salaries, procurement, supplies.  We even had to try to get up the banks, because when we left Gitarama, the banks left as well, to set up shop in Gisyeni.  It was practically the same thing as before.
Q.	Very well.  How long did you remain in Gisyeni?
A.	We arrived there in early June, and we remained up to the 13th, 14th of July, something around those dates.
Q.	Where did you go after Gisyeni?
A.	Gisyeni signalled the end of things.  After that we fled.
Q.	Where did you go?
A.	We went to Goma, just next door.  To Goma, some two kilometres away.  It's just next to Gisyeni, but it's in Zaire.
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, we've gone over all your activities since the 6th of April 1994 up till the government fled to Goma.  Now, I want to ask you more specific questions about specific events, events that are mentioned in the indictment or that were brought up by certain witnesses. 
A.	Very well, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, between the 6th of April 1994 and the end of June 1994, did you participate in a meeting, a political meeting in Kibuye?
A.	There was a meeting in Kibuye on the 3rd of May, I believe.
Q.	Third of May 1994?
A.	Yes, 3 May 1994, yes, there was a meeting in Kibuye.
Q.	Where did the meeting hold -- where exactly?
A.	It was in the préfecture building.
Q.	What was the purpose of that meeting?
A.	It was for pacification.
Q.	How did you go to Kibuye, to go to that meeting?
A.	You mean means of transport, Counsel?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	It was in a car.
Q.	Where did you leave from?
A.	We left Gitarama.
Q.	Did you leave the same day as the meeting or earlier?
A.	On the same day.
Q.	At what time?
A.	In the morning, very early in the morning.
Q.	Who asked you to go to that meeting?
A.	These meetings had already been planned by the government.  Everyone knew where they had to go.  That's how it was planned.  I was told that I would be accompanying the prime minister to Kibuye with other persons.  But this was all planned.  We didn't go where we were told -- where we weren't told to go.
Q.	Was there an agenda for that meeting?
A.	Yes, the agenda was just that, pacification.  That was it. 
Q.	Did the participants in that meeting prepare their speeches ahead of time?
A.	There were no speeches to prepare.  There was a document that the prime minister had prepared, and that document was the basis for the meeting.  That was the only document to be presented.  And he was head of the delegation, and he had to present the document.  The other people were not obligated to prepare speeches.
Q.	Who spoke first at that meeting?
A.	Well, it's very normal; the first person was the préfet.  He welcomed and opened the meeting.  He was the first person to speak, and that was exactly how it happened.
Q.	Did the prime minister speak during that meeting?
A.	Yes, he spoke right after the préfet, and he talked about the contents of that document that he had.
Q.	Can you tell us the central theme of the prime minister's speech during that meeting?
A.	It is difficult, Counsel, but the document exists.  You can always refer to it.  The préfet welcomed the prime minister and then welcomed the participants.  He spoke of problems of insecurity that existed in the préfecture in 1992 and 1993, and that there were also security issues throughout the country in April of 1994, but that security was being restored.  And that activities had rebegan (sic), but there were problems.  There were problems of abandoned property that people wanted to divide up amongst themselves.  He spoke of those types of problems.  And that's all I really remember.
Q.	Did members of the public ask questions of those who were participating in the meeting?
A.	Yes, people did ask questions.  Yes, they did.
Q.	Were there any questions about the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the préfecture?
A.	Yes, the bourgmestres asked questions to that effect.  They asked about the infiltrations of the RPF.  Others were saying that there were people with blood on their hands, who had killed people.  There were people who were asking for weapons to protect themselves.  And the prime minister responded to all of those questions, to all of those people.
Q.	Were you informed during that meeting of massacres that had taken place at the Gatwaro stadium and the Saint Jean church?
A.	Informed?  You mean during the meeting or before we went to the meeting? 
Q.	It's the same for us.  On the 3rd of May, did you know that massacres had taken place?
A.	Personally, I did not know anything about those massacres.  I don't know if there were others who didn't know, but I don't know who knew and who didn't know.  But when you ask me, I didn't know that those particular massacres had taken place before I arrived.  And even during the meeting, I had no information to that effect.
Q.	Weren't there traces of massacres or combat on the roads towards Kibuye?
A.	There were no corpses on the road, because when we arrived -- there's only one road you can take to get to Kibuye.  When you come from Gitarama to Kibuye, into the city, there's only one road; there's not several.  On that road, there were no corpses.  I didn't see any of them on the road.
Q.	Now, did you speak during that meeting?
A.	Yes, I think -- I believe I did.
Q.	Did you speak spontaneously or were you talking in response to a question put to you?
A.	There were people who spoke before me; they made speeches.  There were things that I had to react to, and I reacted after hearing what the others had told me, what the others had not told me, but what they had said in their speeches.  There was information that compelled me, as a member of the PSD, to say things -- clarifications that I had to give as a member of the PSD.
Q.	First, try to tell us what the nature of the speeches were that made you react. 
A.	Well, the prime minister spoke, and he talked about the 27th-of-April document.  The MRND also spoke.  The MDR also took the floor.  And that at one point during their speech, I heard that they continued to repeat that there were accomplices.  The MDR said there will be no more accomplices within the government.  

Now, I knew that people were being massacred and they were being accused of being accomplices.  I thought I had to react to that.  I reacted, saying, "We're not accomplices".  Somebody else reacted after me, someone from the same party -- from the other one, the other person who was in the MDR.  That person also reacted.  "Ndindabahizi's just said this and that".  I think it was Rwabukwisi who said that, who was repeating what I said.  So I reacted to that, to try to calm people down.  I said, "Trust me.  We're not against you, we're not going to kill you".  

These people were afraid of the RPF.  The RPF was advancing, and as the RPF advanced, they thought they would find accomplices and they would react against them.  So I had to react to that, Counsel.  That is what I wanted to say, Counsel.
Q.	But deep down, why, at all costs, did you not want to be considered as an accomplice of the RPF before the 6th of April?  Was your party close to the RPF or why did this come about?
A.	Yes, it was close to the RPF.  That's why people were immediately killed, starting on the 6th of April.  Our party -- and we were accused of being with the enemy, being accomplices with the enemy.  That was it.  

It was very dangerous for us and for me if people would continue to say, "There will be no more; we will not allow the RPF's accomplices to be in our government".  Because the RPF's accomplices in the government, who were they?  How many governments were there in Rwanda that had RPF accomplices in them?  In the previous government, how many parties were there which were accomplices to the RPF?  I only think there was one, that one which fell on the 6th of April.  And we knew what became of them, what fate awaited them.  These people continued to say, "RPF accomplices, RPF accomplices".  This was very dangerous, and they called the PSD accomplices.
Q.	Yes, I understand.  Now, how long did that meeting last?
A.	I think it lasted until 3 p.m.
Q.	Did you go back to Gitarama the same day?
A.	Yes, on the same day.  I went back to Gitarama on the same day.
Q.	Did you go through Gasharu, your native hill, on your way back?
A.	No, I did not go to Gasharu.  I went immediately back to Gitarama.
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, did you ever go to Gasharu, your native hill, between the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994?
A.	I went to Gasharu in June 1994, yes, in June.  That is when I went to Gasharu. 
Q.	If you remember, can you tell us the exact date when you went to Gasharu?
A.	When I stayed in Gasharu?  I didn't stay in Gasharu; I didn't stay there.
Q.	Well, when you went.  Not when you stayed, then, when you went.
A.	It was on the 26th of June, 26th of June 1994, if my memory serves me well.
Q.	Why on that day did you go to Gasharu?
A.	Well, my destination wasn't Gasharu, but I passed through on my way to Kibuye.  I left Gisyeni to go to Kibuye, but before going to Kibuye, I stopped in Gasharu, and I stopped to see my sister who was living there.
Q.	Before and during the genocide, did you ever go to Gasharu to see your sister, to have news from your family, to see how things were going on your native hill?
A.	No, before I didn't go there.
Q.	Very well.  Now, on that day of June 1994, how did you get to Gasharu, by what means of transportation?
A.	I was in a minibus.  I was with children that I was supposed to bring to Kibuye.  So we were in a minibus, a Nissan EuroVan.
Q.	Who were the children you just spoke of?
A.	You will remember I spoke about them.  These were children from the -- they were -- the préfet of Gitarama's children, Uwizeye, who had accompanied us on the 20th of May of 1994.  I said that when my family left Gitarama, the préfet had given me his children for safety reasons.  So in June I decided to bring his children back, because he was in Kibuye at that time.  I knew he was there, so I had decided to go to see him in Kibuye to bring his children back to him.
Q.	Where did you leave from?
A.	I left Gisyeni.
Q.	Very well.  You said you were supposed to go to Kibuye, but you stopped in Gasharu; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you first go to Gasharu, or did you first go to Kibuye?
A.	No, first I went to Gasharu, because Gasharu is before Kibuye on that way, ten kilometres before, something around ten kilometres.
Q.	Do you remember at what time you arrived at Gasharu?
A.	It was in the middle of the day.
Q.	What do you mean "middle of the day"?  Can you be more specific? 
A.	Middle of the day.  Well, if you have 12 hours in the day, it's about noon or 1 p.m., between noon and 1 p.m.  That is what we call middle of the day.  It's not in the morning, it's not in the afternoon, it's right in the middle: noon, 12:30, 1 p.m.  But, Counsel, I can't give you the exact time.
Q.	Were you driving yourself or did you have a driver?
A.	There was a driver, who was a gendarme.
Q.	When you arrived at Gasharu, where did you park your car, or the vehicle?
A.	You don't arrive via Gasharu, you arrive at a small market, a small road that you have to walk on to get to the house, a small path, really, you have to walk on.  

One of the Prosecutor's witnesses said that there was a road up to my place, and there is none.  I left the car at the base and I walked up.
Q.	Now, you left the car at the market, or the commercial centre.  What's it called?
A.	It's called Gitaka, G-I-T-A-K-A, Gitaka.
Q.	Did you see a roadblock at Gitaka upon your arrival?
A.	At that time I did not see any roadblock.  I didn't see one, but when they said that the roadblock was between the house of Karara and further up, I decided to leave the vehicle at Gitaka.  To get to my house, it's not between those two places; it's some 20 or 30 metres below.  So I stopped the car there and I walked up the hill.  And I think we looked at the photos that we talked about in this courtroom.
Q.	Did the situation seem normal in Gitaka when you arrived?
A.	No, it was abnormal.  It was abnormal.
Q.	Why was it abnormal?
A.	When I arrived, there were people on the road, and when they saw me, they seemed to be very concerned, worried.  They talked to me about their concerns.  The houses on the hilltop -- and you can see them from Gitaka centre -- were desolate.  I told you Gasharu is mostly inhabited by Tutsis.  Probably 80 to 90 per cent of the inhabitants were Tutsis, so you can only imagine what the hill looked like.  And in Gitaka I could see that many houses were destroyed.  

So the situation was very much abnormal, was not normal.  People were cold.  I came across problems I had never seen before.  Such problems had taken place in the 1960s, but the people who were there were mostly young people.  There were a few elderly, but most of the people had never seen such serious tragedy.  They were worried.
Q.	You told us you went to Gasharu to visit your sister.  Were you able to see her on that day?
A.	Yes, I walked up to the top of the hill, and I saw my sister there.
Q.	What did she tell you?  Did she speak of the situation in Gasharu?
A.	Yes, of course.  But what could she tell me that I didn't see?  She told me.  She told me what had happened.
Q.	Did she give you any news about members of your family?
A.	News about members of my family?  What do you mean "members of my family"? 
Q.	Your nephews, your cousins, your parents.
A.	Yes, yes.  She told me there was a problem with the children.  She told me that she was hiding some of the children.  Some of them were still alive.  And she asked me what to do.  And I said to her, "Well, you should allow the children to remain where they are".
Q.	Now, on that day, in Gasharu, how long did you stay with your sister?
A.	I did not stay long on that hill.  I was there for about -- I looked around, and I went down.  After 30 minutes I went back to the centre, that is the Gitaka centre.
Q.	And what did you do when you got back to the Gitaka centre?
A.	At the Gitaka centre I yet again met a certain number of people, a certain number of people who had gathered there.  And I talked to them a little because some of them put certain questions to me.  I also asked certain questions.  I do remember a person, an elderly man that I knew, who was telling me that there was a woman that he had hid somewhere and was asking me what to do.  I told him, "Listen, why do you want to kill people, innocent people, just like that?  Who gave you the right to do so?"  And he asked me, "What am I going to do?"  No, he asked me, "Couldn't you tell these people to leave my wife alone, so that she can come out of hiding?"  I told those people, "Listen, leave this woman alone; let her come out alive".  I did say so.  

I also talked to Karara, one Karara -- he didn't come here.  For a long time, I thought Karara was in charge of a cellule, but I've always thought that he was in charge of a cellule.  I also knew that he was a friend to some members of my family, so that I thought that he was still in charge of Gasharu.  So I asked him to tell me what happened, but he didn't tell me; he didn't know what to say.  So in anger I loaded him on the vehicle.  
I was also told about one boy who allegedly killed about ten women.  So that when we were talking, I was trying to see what I could do because he was dangerous.  He had disappeared at that particular point in time.  So that I had told the people, "Listen, you should not kill".  But they were telling me that that was not the problem.  It was not the people of Gasharu, that created the problem; it was people from the neighbouring cellules, the cellules neighbouring Gasharu that created the problem.  Because when I told you about Gasharu, I told you that Gasharu was a hill inhabited by Tutsis, mainly.  But all around, on the other hills, those hills were inhabited by mainly Hutu.  So that that was the picture, and it was thus that I left Gasharu. 

In the afternoon, it was that I left Gasharu.  I left Gasharu with that man called Karara.
Q.	Just a minute.  Just a minute.  Let us go back a little, and one or two questions.  You talked about a killer that had killed some ten women.  I did not get that clearly.  Were you told about it or did you see him?
A.	Well, I was told about him.  I was told about one Gatete (phonetic).  People were saying "Gatete".  That was a man, a rather unpleasant man, who was about 20 years old, but he was unkempt.  He was a dirty man; he looked like a vagrant, and upon looking at him you'll see that he didn't even wash his hair. 
Q.	So you saw him yourself?
A.	No, he was pointed out to me.  I was told, "Here is Gatete.  He was the one that was killing".  And when people started to say that he was the one who was killing, he disappeared.  He disappeared, and he went away.  

But Karara did not try to hide or to run away.  He remained with me.  And I went on in the same vehicle as him.  And I told myself that he was going to give me explanations.  But the other one disappeared.  Karara was with me.
Q.	Now, during the discussions you had with the people around there, did you make a speech or was it a chat?  What happened?
A.	Counsel, what do you mean by a speech?  You get to a place, people are unhappy, people tell you this and that happened.  Unfortunately, that was not a political rally.  I talked to them, and many of them knew me.  Those were old friends, people who lived all around the hill, some on the hill.  So that there was no place for any speech.  One cannot say, "Ndindabahizi, Great Ndindabahizi is here; he's going to make a speech".  No.  I came and talked to them, just as anybody would talk to brothers.  I had no political speech to make.  But I told them that, "Look, this is what I want to tell you: please do not kill".  

I even went much further.  I said something that I should not have said, perhaps.  I did say, "If somebody kills, that person should also be killed".  And that was not what I wanted to say -- really meant.  I told them to stop killing innocent people, and I asked them to tell me who authorised them to kill innocent people.
Q.	Now, between the time that you stopped at Gitaka with your vehicle and the time you left with your vehicle, together with Karara, how many minutes or hours did go by?
A.	No, I did not stay for a long time at that location.  When I came down, I talked to them about 20, 30, minutes.  So that in Gasharu, all in all, I could have stayed for one hour, one and a half hours, something like that.  Because I was on my way to Kibuye with the children of Préfet Uwizeye that I had to return to their parents.  So that I had to proceed with the rest of my trip.
Q.	Now, what did you do with Karara that you talked about, who was in your vehicle?
A.	Well, Karara, I took him to the Gitesi commune jailhouse.
Q.	And the children with you, what did you do with those children?
A.	The children -- those were the children of the préfet of Gitarama, Uwizeye, who was in Kibuye.  So I looked for the préfet.  He was with his wife.  And I handed back the children. 
Q.	Did you firstly take Karara to the communal jail or did you firstly hand over the children to their parents in Gitarama?
A.	Well, firstly, we took Karara to jail and then continued, because there were some kilometres that we had to cover.  The préfet was not in the city of Kibuye; he was a little bit farther down.
Q.	Where did you spend the night?
A.	That evening -- in the evening, I realised that I could not reach Gisyeni.  It was about 100 kilometres away, so I stayed at the hotel in Kibuye.  And I was with my ten year-old daughter, who wanted to accompany the Uwizeye children.  I spent the night at that hotel.
Q.	And what did you do the morning after?
A.	The morning after, I saw the bourgmestre; that is, Karara, the bourgmestre of Gitesi.  We talked about Karara; that is, the Karara that I put in jail, and I asked him to take care of his problem.  I told him about what happened in Gasharu and the reasons why I had brought Karara to jail.  And I told him to take care of Karara's case.
Q.	Now, what was Karara the bourgmestre's party?
A.	He was a member of the PSD, Counsel.
Q.	With the bourgmestre, did you have any discussions besides the political situation of the PSD?
A.	Yes, we did talk about PSD's position and situation, especially the issue of representation of the PSD at the assembly.
Q.	Now, this is of interest to me, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  What was the problem of representation of PSD at the assembly?
A.	The problem that was there was that the person that was to go to occupy that seat did not want to do so.
Q.	Who was that person?
A.	It was in Ndindabo.
Q.	And why didn't Ndindabo want to sit in for the PSD? 
A.	Ndindabo, I saw him.  I saw him.  I told you I had gone to Bwakira on the 2nd of June.  I was running away from Gitarama.  It was on that day that I found him at Kalinda (phonetic).  And we talked about it, and he told me that he was in flight and that he was living with Bourgmestre Bwakira, who was protecting him.  He said that his family was also there at the bourgmestre's residence for security reasons, and that for security reasons he had left Kibuye.  

So we discussed that problem of representation of the PSD at the National Assembly, and he was saying that he could not take an oath, go to take an oath and leave his family in Kalinda in a situation of insecurity, and that he had abstained from going to the swearing-in ceremony.  We discussed the matter.  

Ndindabo was my deputy at the préfectural committee.  He was my deputy, so that it was easy for us  to talk about all those problems.
Q.	Just a minute.  You are saying that you met Ndindabo well before you met the bourgmestre you are referring to at around the 26th or 27th June; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	So that at what date and where did you meet Ndindabo?
A.	I did say that it was on the 2nd of June when I went to fetch my family at Kalinda, and it was then that I saw Ndindabo, at Kalinda.  He -- I do remember he said he was with friends.  I said, "Which friends?"  He didn't want to give us any names.
Q.	Just a minute.

	1545H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Just a minute.  Kirinda, where is Kirinda?
A.	Kirinda is in the Bwakira commune.
Q.	In which préfecture?
A.	Kibuye préfecture.
Q.	And now you're saying that during the conversation, it was Ndindabo that informed you about the fact that he was no longer in agreement about he is being sworn in for the national assembly; is that correct.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But what was your own thinking as far as that issue was concerned? 
A.	Well, Ndindabo had been appointed when I was chairman of the PSD, and it was quite natural that I go along with the decision it made -- that was made for Ndindabo to represent the PSD.  The parliament -- there was not a position I could take, apart from respecting that position, but as far as he was concerned, for reasons for security, said, well, I had to go away.  My family is here, I can't go anywhere else.  I am going to stay here.  I cannot go to a place where there was insecurity. 
Q.	Did you try to influence him in one way or the other?
A.	No, I did understand his problem and he was feeling quite insecure, but I couldn't compel him to do anything.  I said, "Look, you don't want to go.  What do we do, because we cannot leave that seat to somebody else?"  That is the seat of the party.  And it is necessary that in Kibuye -- because that was the only seat we had in Kibuye.  We said that it was necessary to have a representative in Kibuye.  This is what we talked about.
Q.	Now, during your conversation with Ndindabo, did you agree about the name of the person that was going to replace him (Interpretation unintelligible)?
A.	Counsel, there were not many people there that were able to replace him.  We agreed on the name of Bourgmestre Karara, who was a PSD member and partly -- he was a friend of his.
Q.	Now, when you say "we agreed", was it you that imposed Karara's name while he simply agreed, or did you talk about it?  How did it go?  Why did you discuss the issue of Karara?
A.	I am saying that Ndindabo was my deputy in the party.  We talked about it as members of the same party.  We decided together, sir.
Q.	Now, let me come back to the discussion you had with Karara.  Did Karara, at the end of the month of June, get any information about the fact that he was going to become a member of parliament in replacement of Ndindabo?
A.	At that -- at the end of the month of June -- at the end of the month of June, I told him that we will talk about that and I was asked, "What did you talk about with Karara when you were in Kibuye?"  And I said that we talked about that representation of the PSD of the national parliament.
Q.	And how did he receive the news?  Did he take it as a promotion?  What was his reaction?
A.	Counsel, at that particular point in time, with the upheaval that there was, with all the problems (interpretation unintelligible) the area, could somebody really feel that he or she was promoted by having been appointed to the national assembly?  We thought that the sole purpose of (interpretation unintelligible) was to preserve the seat of the party in the assembly, and within the framework of the constitution of the country.  So, I cannot really say that he had any reason to be facilitator of what was going to be proposed.  The proposal was dictated by the circumstances of that obtained and he accepted. 
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, there's one thing I do not understand.  Probably, you don't have an answer, but the country was at a loss.  The RPF had greatly advanced and had taken control of almost all the country.  The government was to leave several days after that to (interpretation unintelligible).  Now, how could you deal with matters as futile as the appointment of a PSD representative of the national assembly, things as futile as that?
A.	Well, I've told you, Counsel.  I believe I've responded to that question.  Now, why is it that when one feels things are coming to an end, one should lay one bare for revenge simply because one would be accused of refusing to go to the national assembly?  Even if things were coming to an end, why would one want to attract any further anger and vindictiveness?
Q.	Now, during your conversation with Karara, you talked about the PSD and the particular case of the person that you had gaoled.  Were there any other issues you talked about with that person?
A.	I do not remember having talked about anything else.  I do not remember almost anything else that was discussed at that particular point in time.
Q.	Very well.  What did you do following the conversation you had?
A.	Following that conversation, I went back to Gisenyi.
Q.	On that day, Witness, or during those two days, did you see the presence of the French soldiers of operation Turquoise?
A.	Yes, sir, they were there.
Q.	Did you see them yourself?
A.	Yes, yes, I did see them.
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, on the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994, did you ever go to a place called Gitwa near, Karongi hill?
A.	Which date did I go to Gitwa?
Q.	I'm asking you whether during the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994; did you go to a place called Gitwa, it is a hill located near the Karongi hill.
A.	No, sir.  No, sir, I did not go to that location.  No, sir.  I told you that I went to Gisharu and Kibuye for the reasons I explained.  I didn't go to Gitwa, for what reason?
Q.	Had you ever been to a roadblock at Gaseke, at the Gaseke hill?
A.	Gaseke, I know.  It's on the Gitarama-Kibuye road, or Gisenyi-Kibuye road.  I told you that on the 3rd of May we used that road to go to Kibuye, and on the 26th of June, I used that road to go to Kibuye.  Now, you're saying that I went to Gaseke?  I think you should be more accurate.
Q.	Okay.  Let us be more accurate.  Did you ever stop, between the 6th of April 1994 to July 1994 -- did you ever stop at a roadblock at a place called Gaseke?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	During that same period, did you ever go -- come by a roadblock at a place called Nyabahanga in Gitesi commune?
A.	Counsel, once again, I'm saying that all these roadblocks that you're talking about are on the same road, one after the other, so, I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  The roadblocks you're mentioning, Gaseke, Nyabahanga, are all on a thoroughfare, on one road.  I didn't go -- I didn't come across a roadblock.  
Q.	Did you stop at a roadblock at one time or the other at Nyabahanga?
A.	No, sir, I did not stop by a roadblock called Nyabahanga.
Q.	Did you stop during the same period at a roadblock at a location called Faye?
A.	No, sir, I didn't come across that roadblock, if that roadblock was ever there.
Q.	Now, for the occurrence -- did you ever go to Bissesero?
A.	Once again, for what purpose, Counsel?  I didn't go to Bissesero.  These are vendatious (sic) assertions.  I never went to Bissesero.
Q.	Had you ever gone go to the Kibirizi market?
A.	I did not go to the Kibirizi market.  I was not there at that market.
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, have you ever left the Rwandan territory between the 6th of April 1994 and July 1994?  Did you ever leave Rwanda?
A.	I did, sir.
Q.	At what particular time?
A.	It was between the 11th of May and the 18th of May; I went to Nairobi, Kenya.
Q.	For what reason did you go to Nairobi?
A.	I was on mission.  There was a meeting that I had to attend.
Q.	What was that meeting, that conference?
A.	It was the assembly.  There were two conferences: one was a national -- general assembly of the African Development Bank, the ATB; and then the yearly of the free trade, the professional trade area, the PTA. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this question is part of defence (interpretation unintelligible) concerning the presence of Ndindabahizi in Nairobi from the 11th to the 18th of May 1994.  This document is already part and parcel in the bound document that Defence has submitted to Your Honours before the hearings, which now I would now like to tender it to Your Honours.  

Mr. President, these are the bills.  The bills are hotel bills.  One from Hilton Nairobi from the 11th to the 17th of May.  We have the original copy here, which we would like to tender as an exhibit, Mr. President.  And these are copies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. 62.
(Exhibit No. D. 62 admitted)
MR BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  We also have a copy of the passport of Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi that shows his exit from Rwanda on the 11th of May 1994 and his return on the 18th of May 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D.63.
(Exhibit No. D. 63 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
We also have two documents that show that Mr. Ndindabahizi, on the 17th of May, changed money in Nairobi, 17th of May 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D.64(A) for the one with 6,590 Canadian dollars, and D. 64(B) for the one 36,843.00.

I'm just selecting a figure at random to identify the documents.  I didn't select any important figure.
(Exhibit No. D. 64(A) admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. 64(B) admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  That is all. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have a few remaining questions for you.  Let's try to move ahead.  Let's go back from your -- to your departure from Gisenyi in July 1994 and your move to Goma in Zaire.  Where did you go in Goma?
A.	There weren't many homes in Goma.  Everybody -- practically everyone had left Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  Those areas were empty.  There were two or three million Rwandans in a city of 200,000, that housed 200,000.  So we needed a place to stay.  We were looking.  I went to a small hotel called Mask for a few days.  I felt that in the hotel it was more unsafe than outside, and so I went out and stayed with a Zairian friend in Goma.
Q.	Now, up until which date did you remain a member of Jean Kambanda's government?
A.	Can you say that that government existed, that it still existed outside of Rwanda?  When we left, most of the ministers had disappeared.  We were in the government by title only, but you didn't see anyone.  Everyone was on their own trying to lodge their families somewhere and the governor wrote us an official letter even, saying that the former dignitaries of the Rwandan regime had to leave the border area of Rwanda and Zaire; that is to say, Goma.  Everybody practically had left and had to leave.  I stayed, though, up until August, but really, when you say "a member of the government", if I was a member of the government while I was there, or even after, it would be saying too much.  And at any rate, my duties -- people continued to call me the minister of finance because we had deposited money in Zairian banks, and I was asked to continue to closely follow developments of that case.  The money was frozen.  That was it, basically, Counsel.
Q.	You said that you remained up until August 1994, you remained in Goma?
A.	Yes.  If I remember correctly, yes, August 1994, or perhaps September, Counsel.
Q.	Where did you go when you left Goma?
A.	I went to Bukavu after Goma.  Bukavu is another city in Zaire in the Kivu region, but it's in the south.  It's south of Goma, some 200 kilometres south of Goma.
Q.	Did you remain in Bukavu up until the ICTR investigators and officials arrested you?
A.	No, I went to Nairobi.
Q.	Before being arrested?
A.	I had already left Zaire, and I had also left Nairobi.  I was arrested in Belgium.  What do you mean by "investigators" though, Counsel? 
Q.	Well, wait, we'll talk about that later.
A.	Do investigators really arrest, Counsel?
Q.	Well, just a moment.  When did you leave for Nairobi?
A.	That was in 1995, Counsel.
Q.	While you were in Nairobi, were you in hiding?
A.	I was never in hiding in Nairobi.  I never was never in hiding.  I was always visible.  I moved about in Nairobi.  I spent a lot of time there, in fact.  For five years I was very visible, I was never in hiding.  I had nothing to fear over there.  Why would I have gone into hiding? 
Q.	Didn't you fear being arrested by the Rwandan authorities or being prosecuted by the Rwandan authorities, or even by the international authorities?
A.	I had information according to which those jurisdictions didn't want to arrest me, I had information.  I was sure that I would never be arrested, so I wouldn't have been in hiding.
Q.	Did you have any contact with ICTR investigators?
A.	Not only contact, Counsel, I was with them most of the time; whenever we wanted to see each other.  I wouldn't really call it "in contact with".  I was with them, I would say, all of the time.  Whenever they wanted to see me, whenever I wanted to see them.
Q.	When did you start seeing ICTR investigators?
A.	Well, the first time I met with the investigators was in September 1996.  Two people who said they were from ICTR, and they were accompanied by a Rwandan, came to see me.  The Rwandan contacted me to put me in touch with those two persons who were coming from Kigali, and they said they were members of the ICTR staff.
Q.	Can you write down the name of the Rwandan who you say put you in contact with the ICTR staff members?
A.	Yes, please give me some paper.  Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, at this stage, I must remind you that the person whose name appears on that document, was Witness DX.  Witness DX was the subject of a motion by the Defence on the 27th of October 2003.  We filed it under 92 bis under the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  We filed it, the said motion, under 92 bis (E), respecting the time delays, 14 days ahead of time.  And it is accompanied by the written testimony of Witness DX.  There was no opposition on the part of the Prosecutor under 92 bis (E).  Any opposition had to be served within seven days.  Consequently, we believe that there is no obstacle to the admission of this written testimony as a Defence exhibit.  This written testimony will confirm Ndindabahizi's statements regarding his meeting with ICTR staff between 1996 and 1998: '96, '97 and '98.  That written statement also contains other information regarding the circumstances, political and historical, of the genocide.  It also deals with the morality of the Accused person.  DX's written testimony is in conformity with 92 bis (A)(e) and (a) and (b) and also (c).  

Lastly, the testimony that we have presented respects the provisions of Article 92 bis (B).  Consequently, and since the Prosecutor did not oppose the admission of that document seven days ahead of time, I think it is the right time to ask the Chamber to admit this written statement as the next Defence exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The date of this motion was, Mr. Besnier? 
MR. BESNIER:
27 October 2003, 27 October 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Should we first now maybe gather the documents written by the witness; namely the name of the person with whom he met?  That could then be -- may be D. 65?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So then that's admitted, the handwritten declaration, we just saw the name of the investigator or the Rwandan. 
(Exhibit No. D. 65 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Under 92 bis (B), Mr. President, there's also an affidavit from a notary.  This is just a form.  I don't know if this affidavit should be filed separately or at the same time as the written statement.  I think for good form, it should be filed separately.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this the last exhibit that you are tendering?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  The Chamber hasn't got this motion in front of us now, so I think we would like to recapitulate and have a look at your motion and we keep that issue floating, and we will come back to it.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Ndindabahizi, what did the investigators want, the ICTR investigators?
A.	The first team was a two man team, and the third person was the Rwandan I spoke about.  And they came in September to see me.  The Rwandan introduced them to me, and he told me that those investigators wanted my cooperation in the investigations on certain files that they were investigating, certain investigations that they were conducting; that is what I was told.  We didn't immediately decide what to do.  They said that they would come back after.
Q.	Did you accept to cooperate with those investigators?
A.	Well, first we discussed the conditions.  So the Rwandan who brought them to me told me that those conditions -- they accepted, and after that I was not opposed in any way.  But I only gave them some conditions and they accepted those.  It wasn't cooperation in the sense you understand it here, outside.  Prosecution staff said first, you know, you can plead guilty and then we'll collaborate.  That's not the kind of collaboration or cooperation I'm talking about.  They wanted me to work as an investigator, in a sense, within their team.  They had an office in Nairobi and that is what they wanted.  So, we had a discussion.  They said, "We're going to Kigali and when we come back, we'll tell you what our decision is".  And towards the end of the year, in November, but I don't remember the date.  Starting in November, we began to meet and that Rwandan, that I mentioned, was also there and he was their collaborator.
Q.	During those meetings you had, were you -- ever made written statements?  Were you heard as a suspect or a witness?
A.	No, as a witness.  I was not a suspect.  They told me they had verified everything in Rwanda and that there was nothing charged against me.  So they wanted me to integrate into their team and help them to establish the truth on what happened in Rwanda.  So I was not a suspect, they didn't see me as such.  And if they thought me as a suspect, I don't believe they would have accepted the conditions that I laid out, even though they didn't in the end honour those conditions later on.  But at any rate, we had a verbal agreement, and that was not respected.  But I was not a suspect, Counsel.
Q.	Now, the written statements that you gave them, those written statements that were presented before this Chamber, were they read back to you?
A.	I was surprised to see those here before this Tribunal.  Other witnesses who came before this Chamber, before presenting their written statements, are asked if those are signed and if it's their own statement, if the signature at the bottom of the document is their true signature.  When I was given the document, I found that it was abnormal.  I read it, and what I found inside it should have been corrected.  I was never told that they were recording or that they were taking notes.  I don't know.  I don't know how that document was introduced before this Chamber without me seeing it beforehand, and without me having an opportunity to verify whether it was true or false.
Q.	Now, did those investigators ever invite you to look for the assistance of an attorney?
A.	No, Counsel.  I was not a suspect.  We worked together as collaborators, but I was not a suspect.  I think the problem with that document is that when you re-read it, you don't even know who wrote it.  The names of the investigators aren't even on the document.  Some of the dates of the interviews are not there.  There are blanks in the hand-written document.  Who put those blanks in?  Perhaps, it's the problem of the translator who is supposed to translate.  There are just contradictions and things I did not say.  For example, "You were at the meeting in Kibuye presided by President Sindikubwabe".  If I was given that document in Nairobi, so that I could be able to correct it and even sign it and make it my own, it would have been better, more desirable.  But here, I've been brought here, and references made to that document and this a problem.  But that issue of an attorney, no, I was never assisted by an attorney.  I was not even being told that I was being recorded and if I was asked if the conversations could be recorded, I said, "No".  It was not an investigation on me that they were conducting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, did you say that you started meeting with the investigators in November?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I say before that, because when we met for the first time, it was at the Hilton Hotel and nothing was written down, nothing was put down on paper.  It was just the first visit.  They just wanted to see who I was and we talked on a hotel balcony, but nothing was written down.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year did these interviews start with investigators, please?  And which month?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
In 1996, Mr. President, towards the end of that year.  One was called Gilbert and the other Haruna.  They had set up their office at a hotel in Nairobi, the Nairobi Safari Club.  It's just next to the Nairobi University.  That is where they had set up their offices, and we would see each other on a regular basis.  And the content of that document was not what was said.  They said I was with them from '76, November -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 1996, 1997, 1998.  We were always together during those years, all the time, until we separated for reasons that I could give.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, which documents are we talking about here?  The Chamber has this file introduced with another Ndindabahizi.  That's one document we have, and the other is reference to a meeting at a certain date in '97, and a reference to something that may have been recorded in '96.  The names of the investigators are not the same as those just referred to by the witness.  So which documents -- you said, "I was surprised to see documents not signed by me when I came to the Tribunal".  Which document are you referring to, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, may I have that document with me so I can tell you which document I'm referring to, because in this bound document there are several documents.  I think it is P. 25 of the Prosecution, if my memory serves me right.  P. 25, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Register P. 25, that is the one I have in front of me, yes.  And that's the one we're talking about?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
(Pages 21 to 29 by Roxane Lane)






















	1630H
MR. BESNIER: 
	Yes, Mr. President.  
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	The first document I am referring to is document 3, document 3, which says we had on this day of 3oth of November 1996, from 1620H to 1900H, 1900H, we still had Mr. Ndindabahizi, former minister of the interim government.  This is a document that contains erasures hand-made erasures, Mr. President said that the names of the investigators, I just gave are different from these ones. I am saying that this document of the 30th of November 1996, doesn't show the names of the investigators.  I do not even see my signature.  I see that the document was corrected by hand; these are mistakes or the anomalies that I have pointed out.  And, this document that I am referring to, I know this document even if some of the contents that are to be corrected because I did not see it and I did not sign it.  It was Mr. Gilbert - - Mr. Haruna that were with me so that their names should be mentioned here together with my signature had I seen the document beforehand.  As far as the others are concerned, for the other document since there are other documents are in English and French, the other document is the minutes of a meeting of the former minister of finance, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the 8th to the 11th of July, 1st, 2nd and 3rd August 1997 by Shadely and Drack (phonetics) and I do not know these people but I know that there were people who came to see me in Nairobi but, and who were members of the team that was working in Nairobi and who were telling me that they wanted some information concerning funding of finances, how we managed our funds in 1994.  And it was that team that was working with Cherebe, and it was Juveal, who was in charge of the Nairobi team.  He was the one working within that Rwandan, and he was the one that brought in the other teams that were specialised in one or the other respect.  That is it, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And now we have identified the two documents and these are the two we are referring to now.  Isn't that so?  There are no other documents from interviews that you are referring to, these are the two? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Mr. President, is that question for me?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We want to make sure that we are on the same wavelength now because you started talking about interviews and documentation.  And now after this useful exchange I am asking you whether you are actually referring to these two documents and those are the ones and no one else.  These are the results of the interviews with the investigators; is that so? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	The problem, Mr. President, is that I did say that I was with those people from 1996 to 1998 and that they only opted for several dates to introduce as evidence against Ndindabahizi here.  Perhaps they were all the interviews that should come in on cross-examination, and I don't know why they chose only these documents here.  They were the ones that took notes.  Perhaps I would have also tendered manuscripts that I prepared because I was taking notes.  I did not know that they were recording me; they did not even afford me the opportunity of checking what I said.  Those people never gave me the opportunity and they made use of the fact that I assisted them to accuse me by using documents I had prepared myself.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So, Defence Counsel, just to avoid lack of clarity now, these are the two the Chamber knows about;  isn't that so?  We don't have anything else so far.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Mr. Ndindabahizi is saying that he took part in interviews and that documents were prepared subsequent to those interviews but he doesn't know how many documents all in all were prepared because he was not invited he was given the opportunity of checking them on and signing them.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I did not need to have an explanation of what Mr. Ndindabahizi is saying.  He was crystal clear. Thank you.  What I am just saying is that what the Chamber has, and I am talking to you now as an officer of the Court, that what we have so far is what we have in front of us; isn't that so?
MR. BESNIER:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And who made these changes on that document KO184935, the document where there are no investigators' signatures?  Is that then investigators' notes, or do you know that Mr. Ndindabahizi where these corrections come from, the handwritten ones?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Mr. President, I believe that it is the Prosecutor that tendered this document.  He should answer that question.  It is the Prosecutor that tendered this document.  He should be allowed to respond to that question if the response is not correct.  I should beg leave to intervene, but I believe it is the Tribunal's investigators that prepared this document.  This is not my handwriting, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That was the point.  So that was not your handwriting. Thank you very much.  This clarifies the matter.
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, I will have two or three questions, so I will try to finish this up.  Now tell me, when did these meetings with the investigators cease, and for what reason did they stop?
A.	We held troubled times in the course of all of that.  At times the person that I mentioned on that piece of paper did take the floor to level out - - to iron out differences between us so that for the two years I was with them they were times at which personally I decided to go away from them because you would bear with me, Mr. President, they were honest with me because the commitments they made, they did not honour and when they did not honour their commitments, they looked for ways and means to compel me to leave.  They started by threatening me.  In 1998, I do not have the precise date; it was in 1998 that they started threatening me.  They told me that I could be arrested, that they could get me arrested that - - well, that is it so that they threatened me, they threatened me that they could get me arrested, Mr. President.
Q.	You are talking about commitments on their part.  What commitments did they make to you?
A.	Well the commitments are initially, they said to me that I had taken refuge there, "Your family is not in security.  If you accept to work with us the first thing by the way, is that we put your family in a safe place. Tell us a country of your choice that is safe where we can send your family immediately?"  

The second thing because I did talk to them about the security of my family that was back in Rwanda and was my brother and they told me that they worked in Rwanda and they would ensure the security of those people that remained in Rwanda and that therefore there was no problem.

The third thing they said that, "Well as far as we are concerned, investigators are paid, and you are not going to work free of charge.  We are not going to ask you to work free of charge we have salaries as investigators."  And they told us that for that purpose that they needed a written contract which they said they were preparing.  So that were the promises that they made to me and each and every time I reminded them, they told me, "Well, please wait, we are waiting for the person who was responsible to finish what he was doing".  So they asked me all the time to wait.  

Now when the time came for them to ask me where the, "The trouble, well, Mr. Ndindabahizi you are no longer too useful to us because we have people that can tell us what you can't tell us."  So that I changed, they said that we want a statement from you according to which Bagosora appointed you as minister, "We want that statement from you," so that I understood that things have started changing since they wanted me to state that it was Bagosora that appointed me as a minister.  I said to myself, "Well, I do not understand."  I went back to my friend who was the go-between and said, "Well, what is happening?"  

He went to see them and they said that there was no problem but he had a concrete agreement with them and that they were even doing something in Rwanda.  And that they would call to talk about the problems so that we can continue working but at the end of it all, it didn't work out.  Then they told me, "Look, Mr. Ndindabahizi that is all.  You didn't want to sign the statements according to which it was Bagosora that appointed you minister.  You know, by the way that the Rwanda government is looking for, you know that the Tribunal is looking for you.  You know that the government of Kenya has not given you asylum.  You should therefore look for protection.  If you do not want to be protected by signing this statement according to which Bagosora appointed you minister, well, it is up to you.  And moreover the Tribunal has no money to pay for these things so that if you do not want to fulfil the conditions, we are laying down, we have other people that are more interesting than you and that is the end of it."

I saw that that was the end of the road with those threats and finally they came out and said before leaving, it was on the 12th floor of that hotel in Nairobi.  We were six that was presided over by Gilbert Morrissete and they told, "Look Mr. Ndindabahizi you should know that they had just arrested people in Nairobi that they call 'Operation Naki'".  They said to me, "Mr. Ndindabahizi we arrested some people in Nairobi.  Now, on the next list, your name will be there.  Get ready full stop."  

Then I reacted rather badly because I told them, "Look, I am with you here.  Why don't you arrest me now?  I have been with you why should you wait if I am a criminal?"  And they asked me to go away from their office.  And, and that was the last difficult moment I had with them apart from the fact that they called from the telephone.  Later on they called again to say, "Could you sign this paper and bring it back to us according to which paper Bagosora appointed you as a minister?"

I did not do so.  Prosecutor is here but I do not remembering signing any such document.  It was at time that I told my friend, "Look things were all wrong.  And that the people I was dealing were not honest with me."  I talked at length because you asked me to explain.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi, I think we have spent a lot of time of this issue.  Now, following those contacts with the investigators, did you remain in Nairobi?
A.	Following those contacts, Gilbert had told me, was that what he was going to do was to see me in prison for the rest of my life.  He said, "For the rest of your life, you will be in jail because you did not want to corroborate".  So I stayed in Nairobi, and later on, I went to Belgium to seek asylum.
Q.	Why did you take refuge in Belgium?
A.	Now, I followed my wife who had gone there to seek political asylum.  She left in 1999 and in the year 2001, first of all, I waited for Shereha to come and jail me for the rest of my life, and it was four years '98, '99, 2000,. I said to myself, "Well, I must move on, I must go to Europe. And in Europe and in Belgium, I will not be in hiding.  I would not go to Europe to hide myself. I went in seeking asylum."  And I sought asylum and I was on verge of seeking asylum because I was arrested in my house just as I had obtained provisional documents to stay in Belgium, at least provisionally.
MR. BESNIER:
This is all the for the examination-in-chief, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you very much.  
Mr. Ndindabahizi, so the period with the investigators went from September 1996 until - - until when you stopped cooperating, or when they stopped cooperating? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	The first contacts were in September 1996 and it ended in 1998, 1998 it was not all the time that we talked, sometimes they would call me over the telephone, but it was during that period that it was between 1996 and 1998 when it all ended.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And apart from the trip outside Rwanda, in 1994 from the 11th to the 17th of May, did you travel outside Rwanda apart from those six days? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Outside the country, Mr. President, it was only from the 11th to the 17th of May 1994, Mr.  President. As for the rest of the year, I remained; that is up to the month of July 1994, I remained in the country, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry.

Prosecution, is the question coming back to what may become D. 66 here?  Mr. Besnier mentioned a 92 bis statement, and I can see that it seems to be dated the 24th of September 2003.  What is the position of the Prosecution there? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
I have never seen the motion or the accompanying documents.  I have never seen them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have never seen it?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, neither has anyone in my office.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I am quite surprised because I filed this motion through the registry on the 27th of October 2003, and was recorded by the registry.  The stamp of the registry is dated 27th October of the year 2003, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This document exists only in French for the time being. 
MR. BESNIER:
To my knowledge, sir, yes, Mr. President, unless it was translated in the meantime.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's in the document, no one of us recalls seeing this document.  It's in French anyway, so it could have gone somewhere else.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So if the registry could just double check a little bit what happened to this document to which it was -- to whom it was distributed the channels it followed et cetera.  The Prosecution will look into the Prosecution files, and, I think, Mr. Phillips, if you could ask your French-speaking colleagues in the Prosecution to glance through it all night and that would be helpful.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then, and we can clarify the matter tomorrow, maybe.  That's good, and we know that this is a pending issue.  

Coming now to D. 64, D. 63, and D. 62, these are very legible copies they are not difficult to read at all.  But do you have the original of these documents, Defence, maybe in particular the passport.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. I served to the registry the originals of these copies apart from the passport that are in the document of the Prosecutor that is the original.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So if then the Prosecution could bring to the courtroom and to the Bench the original of D. 63 if that is where the passport is now, and the registry will show as D. 62, and D.64, at a certain time, I see it's here.  Thank you very much.  That was helpful

Well it is almost 5:00 we could go on for five, ten, fifteen minutes.  Do you want to start with the first fifteen minutes of cross-examination, Prosecution?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
As the Court pleases, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.

Thank you, Defence.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good evening, Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Microphone, please.  
   BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Let me start off by asking you some questions concerning your bio data as you testified in the Court yesterday.  Do you understand me, sir?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	We recorded the name of your father, that of your mother, and the fact that you have four sisters and two brothers; is that correct?
A.	I believe that is correct, sir.
Q.	In the course of your testimony yesterday, whilst talking about your sister who is known as Mukayeze, you testified that she had two sons; didn't you, sir?
A.	Yes, I did say so.
Q.	One of them was in indeed a witness for the Defence in this case, and the other person who you described as Boniface, do you recall saying that, sir?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Now, I didn't catch the family name or the second name of the person whom you described as Boniface.  Can you help me with that, sir?
A.	I gave his name.  I wonder why it was not noted.  I said it was Ngabo, Boniface, N-G-A-B-O, Ngabo, N-G-A-B-O, and Boniface.
Q.	Pardon me for not having taken due note of that.  Sir, if I asked the document to be handed over to you and the Court, can I --.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Can I have some assistance from the registry please because this will probably be the only thing we are able to get through today because it's substantial?  I have enough copies for everyone.  If you just give that to the Defence and Their Honours.  And the translators, there is enough to go around.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	I have been, as you can see, Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have been doing some, some sort of design work trying to configure how indeed your immediate family is constituted.  Now, I want to start with that list and I want to take you through this list and this is something that I have been drawing myself.  So if I have anything wrong, please feel free to correct me.  

Now, you testified that your father had one brother and two sisters.  Is that a correct recollection of your testimony, yesterday?
A.	Well I don't know whether you properly noted; who are the two sisters?
Q.	Now, let ask you?
A.	Referring to my father's sisters or the sisters, my own sisters.
Q.	Can you just listen to my question, sir?  It's very easy; we have a diagram before us there.  Now how many siblings did your own father have?  Start with that, please.  
A.	I said that he had one brother and two sisters.
Q.	Now, your father is the man I describe there as Hanyurwa; isn't it, sir?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Now, let me describe how that diagram works with you, was to you sir; now those four people under the word "grandparents" are the children from those grandparents.  Okay?  So your father and his brother, the daughter and the last person there, Nyirakaje are all the children of the people upstairs as grandparents.  Do we agree on that, sir?  So your father's parents had four children, your father and three others?  Are we agreed so far, sir?  Can you just look at what I am talking about and not the whole document, sir, otherwise we won't go home?
A.	Yes, I clearly see.  Well, I am the one who told you that my grandfather had two -- had two daughters and two sons including my father.  I told you that.  There are -- I don't see any complications or do you see any complications, sir?  Or what do you want?  Just tell me what you want.  If not I can see the family tree.  First you have --
Q.	Sir, you are not very terrible to either me or this courtroom, if you don't take time to answer my questions.  I'm not asking you for a commentary.  I am asking you for a simple question.  Now, do you agree, sir, that your father had a brother and two sisters as it is indicated on the first row, yes or no?
A.	That is what I told you since yesterday.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Ndindabahizi, Mr. Ndindabahizi, everything is easy and fine so far.  We have realised what you said yesterday and Mr. Phillips is simply starting his overview by making sure that you are on the same document and the same line.  So there is agreement on the first line.  What is the next question?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
Mr. President, is there a copy of this in French?  I have an English version.  Can I have a copy in French of the same document? 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Q.	These names, Mr. Ndindabahizi and if you listen to me, we would go through that document and I would give you a copy in French when I come here the next time.  Now, your father married --
A.	But, pardon me, Counsel, but the trial has to be in a language that I understand.  So I would like to have a copy of this in French.  This - - the difficulty in this is that I have a copy in English a language I do not understand.  Please give me a copy in French.
Q.	Very well, sir.
A.	Otherwise, my grandfather, my grandfather had two sons and two daughters.  That is what I said, but please give me a copy in French, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I think would be the smartest way to proceed now is that we ask one of the interpreters to kindly to assist Mr. Ndindabahizi at the close of this session.  You will see that there are not very much to translate.  There are only some words like son, daughter, grand parents and so far, but if one of the English translators could just go through the document and give Mr. Ndindabahizi a document with a handwritten French explanation of the few words in English which are not Kinyarwandan names and then he can look at this overnight and feel comfortable with the document. 
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sir, your father then married your mother Nyiramuruta; is that correct, sir?
A.	Yes, yes.
Q.	And between that union, they were blessed with four children; were they not sir, your parents, sir?
A.	I said seven.
Q.	Seven children, and of the seven children, I have mentioned four of them on that list and they are as follows: Yourself, sir, your humble self, your brother Seyeze, your sister, Mukayeze,  and your other sister whose name I wouldn't even venture to pronounce, but is on there.  Are we agreed so far sir, so I haven't mentioned three names, three bodies?  Are we agreed?
A.	We agree.
Q.	Very well, sir. Now you are married, your humble self, you are married and you have been blessed with five children.  We agree there also, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Your brother, Seyeze, sir, he is also married.  Is he not, sir?
A.	Yes, he got married. 
Q.	Unfortunately, I do not know the name of his wife, but would I be correct in saying that his wife has a brother by the name Elie? 
A.	Elie, I am not sure.  You have to look at the other second name.  Elie might be a different person, but you have to look for the other name, the second name.  But, it is a fact he is married.  I won't confirm Elie because you didn't give his second name.
Q.	But you could at least confirm, sir, *************************************, wouldn't you, sir?
A.	If it was accepted when you asked me questions.  It's in the transcript we shall see that.
Q.	Sir, we agreed with that part of the events.  Now let's go on to your sister, Mukayeze.  Now she has at least two sons, does she not, sir?
A.	Yes, yes, that is correct.
Q.	Those sons are fathered by two different men, are they not sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And Witness DG's father is the name that I would not venture to pronounce but which I have also written there, sir and indicated as being the father of DG in English, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
A.	Yes, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), that is correct.
Q.	My assistant has just done a translation for me, and you can have this, to help you through this tedious process.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Can you give that to the witness, make sure you show it to the witness, please, and Their Honours first to make sure that there is nothing underhand going on.  Just try to improvise a little bit,
Your Honours.  You will get the--
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for the one doing this quickly.  Wasn't there a witness protection issue there, Defence, in connection with the name of a Witness DG.  Don't you think you should strike that, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, the issue really is that it doesn't become a witness protection issue unless attention is drawn to it.  On is own -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But you see you just said the father of DG and then you told the name and that is the problem.  So we will have to strike that.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful for that observation, Your Honour.  I wasn't putting that to the witness, please - -
MR. PRESIDENT:
So be careful with the court audio system and I see.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  So that is stricken from the court record.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So the man you described as Boniface, he is born to the man I have indicated there as Pascal; isn't it sir?
A.	Yes, yes.
Q.	Eh, so we have agreed so far and that's the part of your side that I am interested in.  Now I want to go to your auntie now, the lady Nyirakaje, your father's sister.  Are you with me so far, sir? 
A. 	Yes, I am with you.
(Pages 30 to 39 by Petrus Chijarira)










	1710H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	She then married a man named Gayshema, as you testified in this courtroom yesterday, didn't she sir?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	That union gave rise to at least two sons, at least, to my knowledge, a man called Cyprien Karegeya and another man called Kagygara.  Is that correct, so far, sir?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now --
A.	But there are other children that aren't listed on this chart.  They're not the only one.
Q.	Yes, I know that and that's why I said at least two sons, I'm only interested in one of these two children, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  You are correct, there are more children, just like you have more brothers and sisters.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now, based on experience, when you get down here --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I know, I have to be careful.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So no pseudonyms.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
	********************************************************************************************************************* *********************************************************************  ******************************.  
           Okay?  Is that correct, sir?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Let's look at the first name, now, the one on the left.  That person is the mother of that witness on there, DH.  Is that not correct, sir?
A.	Okay.
Q.	And the second wife, her name which I will not mention but which is shown on there, isn't it the mother of the other witness, DI, isn't she?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And then, finally, Witness DV has the relationship that I've indicated there in English with Witness DI, does he not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Okay.  Now, so that I can come back tomorrow with a nicer document, I haven't put three of your siblings down, have I?  I've left three of your brothers and sisters out.  We've agreed on that, so I can put three little boxes. Is that correct, sir?
A.	Okay, very well.
Q.	In relationship to your auntie, Nyaracage, and her husband, how many children did they have together?  I've indicated two, how many more did they have, so I can put those auntie boxes there as well?
A.	Counsel, you said you put the names for the persons whom you're interested in.  You're not obligated to put down the names of the person who are of no interest to you.
Q.	Very well I was just trying to be politically correct, sir.  Now, very quickly, we've only got ten minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You now have only got one minute.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just enough time to enter as the next Prosecution Exhibit, Your Honour.  And if I can, since I've been told that I don't really have to indicate -- Your Honour, I think I'll leave it.  We'll leave it for now, and maybe when we come back we'll have the three little boxes and then we'll enter it as a Prosecution exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Ndindabahizi, your testimony continues Thursday morning.  You know there is a Muslim holiday tomorrow, so the Court will not sit, but we start again on Thursday at two o'clock. Thank you, very much.
