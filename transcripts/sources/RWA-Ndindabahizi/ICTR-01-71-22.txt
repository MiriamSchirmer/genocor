MR PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to everyone in the courtroom.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did we hear the witness's response into channel one?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I am sorry; I believed he said it in English that's why I didn't interpret it, but you're probably on a different channel. Indeed, he said, "Good afternoon".
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very good.  Now, you will now be cross-examined by the prosecution, Mr. Witness.  Please proceed.

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for the Prosecutor, please.  Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us when you were arrested for the offences for which you are now detained?
A.	I was arrested on ***********************.
Q.	Has trial in your case started, or it has not?
A.	No.  It's still underway.  It began in 19 -- in 2002.  I'm sorry, 2002.
Q.	Yesterday, in the course of your testimony you alluded to a meeting that was held in Kibuye on the 3rd of May '94; do you recall that?
A.	Yes, I remember that.
Q.	This is a meeting you testified to in the Niyitegeka case as well, did you not?
A.	That is true.
Q.	In fact, you had four days testimony in the Niyitegeka case; that is the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th of June 2002 was centred almost exclusively on this meeting; was it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And are you aware also that the Trial Chamber was very impressed in its judgment about your testimony in the Niyitegeka case; are you aware of that?
A.	That, I did not know.
Q.	And are you aware, also, that the Trial Chamber found you in a better position than an expert to interpret the meaning of words used by the radio speakers at that meeting?  Are you aware of that?
A.	No, that I didn't know either.
Q.	So, if you read paragraphs 247 and 249 of that judgment, you will see those findings.  Now, were you present at that meeting from the beginning to the end?
A.	Yes, I was there.
Q.	And that meeting was called by the prime minister; is that so?
A.	The meeting was called by the prefét, but he said that it would be chaired, indeed, by the prime minister.
Q.	Right.  Would you say that the meeting was well attended?
A.	Yes, there were many people there.
Q.	Can you estimate about how many people attended that meeting?
A.	Well, it would be difficult to give you a number, but I think that that question was put to me in the affair I spoke about earlier.  But the room that we're in, in any case, was full, so I would say 100 or so people.  The room was full, so I would say 100 or so, but I don't know the exact capacity of that room.
Q.	Now, the prime minister, did he come with other people from Kigali?
A.	Yes, he came with a strong delegation and I gave some names, but there were other people who I did not know.
Q.	Was Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi part of the PM's delegation?
A.	Yes, he was there.
Q.	Now, was that meeting broadcast on Radio Rwanda?
A.	Personally, I listened to the entire taping on Radio Rwanda, so, indeed, it was broadcast.
Q.	Would you be in a position to know whether it was broadcast simultaneously as it was taking part, or it was broadcast a few days later?
A.	Well, if it was simultaneous, I wouldn't know because I was in the room itself.  All that I can confirm is that I listened to a broadcasted tape on Radio Rwanda, so obviously that was afterward.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you help us with the agenda?  What was the agenda of that meeting?
A.	On the invitation it said it was a security meeting.
Q.	And did you stay at the meeting from start to finish, or you left before it ended?
A.	That is correct.  I was there from beginning to end.
Q.	Now, sir, did you see any Tutsi at that meeting, any Tutsi you know?
A.	No.  The meeting was on the 3rd of May and, as we said before, there were massacres.  Even in April, there were massacres, and those massacres targeted mostly Tutsi persons, so those persons could not have been there.  So, if that meeting took place, it means that it was a hidden, or secret, rather, meeting.  So, no, in answer to your question, I did not see any.
Q.	Any why, sir, to your knowledge, were Tutsi sought after in this period?
A.	They were targeted.  What people were saying at that time was that they were considered as accomplices of the RPF.  It was a way of targeting them and the members of the RPF -- as members of the RPF.
Q.	Now, the first person to speak at that meeting was the préfet; do you recall that?
A.	I believe so.  I do believe so.
Q.	And the theme of his speech was that the préfecture, Kibuye préfecture supported wholeheartedly the interim government; do you recall him saying that?
A.	Well, I believe that first he spoke of the security situation in the préfecture, and that was mostly what he spoke of.  If he said that all of the population was behind the government, it's possible, but I cannot confirm that for you here.  I don't have the minutes, if you will, to that meeting.
Q.	And do you recall how he described the security situation in Kibuye préfecture?
A.	I can't give you the details of his speech, but the general idea was that in Kibuye préfecture, the situation was going to get better.
Q.	Now, following Mr. Kayishema, it was the prime minister who took up the podium.  Now, the theme of the prime minister's speech was security, was it not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, he spoke about the needs to review the Arusha Accords and to increase the influence of the Rwandan government in those Accords; did you hear him say that?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	He also spoke about the ability of the interim government to meet the Inkotanyi and elect the previous or the Habyarimana government; did you hear him talk about that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	He also asked the people to be vigilant against the infiltrators who he described as Inkotanyi; did you hear that?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, sir, did you understand Inkotanyi, accomplice, or enemy to cover the Tutsi in general.  Was that your understanding of those terms?
A.	I didn't see it like that personally, but according to what was being said at the time, in general, what people were saying was that, indeed, but my personal opinion was not that.  But within the population, the general idea, and even of the assembly, I think, it was indeed that idea.
Q.	What you're saying, Mr. Witness, is that you understood that Rwandans in general would interpret the word "Inkotanyi" to refer to all Tutsi who inhabited Rwanda, and who were outside.  Is that what you're saying?
A.	Yes, that's what I said, but I specified that was a general idea, that doesn't include everyone, and it certainly does not include me.  That is not how I saw things, but that was the general idea, that was what was being heard.  That is what people in general understood by -- in that vocabulary.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you are taking some -- you're going -- it pays to distance yourself from what the general population think.  Could you tell us what you understood -- what you personally understood those words to mean?
A.	Inkotanyi, normally, is the RPF with its armed wing, and they were fighting on the war front.  That's what I understand by Inkotanyi.  Others, you don't call them Inkotanyi.  Those who were targeted within were more accomplices of the Inkotanyi, but not Inkotanyi.
Q.	Very well.  To your knowledge, there were no Inkotanyi in Kibuye as of 3rd May '94; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Inkotanyi being used in the significance, RPF soldiers?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Right.  As I said in the previous trial, there were no Inkotanyi in Kibuye.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	But at that meeting some people, particularly the bourgmestres of Gisovu, Gishyita, raised issues pertaining to - raised complaints about RPF attacks in Bisesero; did they not?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have an objection, an objection to this question.  I did not, in my examination-in-chief, talk about what was said at that meeting of 3rd May.  I didn't speak of it at all.  Furthermore, everything regarding that meeting of 3 May was withdrawn from the indictment; it was Article 24 in the indictment.  Mr. Ndindabahizi is not being indicted for participating in that meeting.  We've been speaking about it for 20 minutes.  I did not bring up this issue in my examination-in-chief, and I think that the Prosecutor would do well to move on to a new subject.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, please.  Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the 3rd of May meeting was a subject of a long discussion by our expert Alison Des Forges and it is contained in her expert report. 

Secondly, this very witness was present at that meeting and as we will go further, Your Honour, it will show that even the Accused person was present at that meeting, so we will tie up what the prime minister said and what the -- our expert says in the general context of proof of our case.  So, it is my humble submission, Your Honour, that this meeting is very relevant to our case and, actually, the witness alluded to it in his testimony, and we said, further, under Rule 90(G) a party cross-examining a witness has a (inaudible) or right to raise issues which go to the credibility of the witness, and also to issues that advance the case of that party.  So, for those reasons, Your Honour, I submit that Mr. Besnier's objection should be overruled.

MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine.  Mr. Kapaya, you can proceed.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We grant.  And the exception under the relevant Rule, having heard your explanations, bearing in mind, as you said, that this is time consuming, but something may come up.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, my question was that you have testified that as of 3rd May '94, there were no Inkotanyi or RPF soldiers in Kibuye, but some bourgmestres raised the issue that there were attacks in the Bisesero area made by RPF soldiers.  Now, how do you explain this phenomenon, if you can call it that?
A.	It is difficult for me to explain what people said, what someone else said, especially the Gisovu and Gishyita bourgmestres.  There were people who were extremists, and who talk of Tutsi and Inkotanyi in one breath.  In general, the terms that were used, he spoke of Inkotanyi in Gishyita, perhaps in order to give more strength to his argument to justify what happened in Gishyita, but what was really said, or used, rather, was accomplices, but I'm sure in Gishyita there were no Inkotanyi.  So, if he spoke of Inkotanyi in Gishyita, there were none; and I even spoke of this in the trial that you mentioned earlier.
Q.	So briefly, when those two bourgmestres referred to Inkotanyi in Bisesero, what they were referring to actually were Tutsi, is that not so; Tutsi civilians?
A.	That is how I see things. 
Q.	So when Mr. Kambanda made up that speech, he was aware that killings had occurred in Kibuye, many killings had occurred in Kibuye at the Catholic church, the Home St-Jean, and at Mugonero Hospital, Mubuga, Nyange, and like places, was he not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	He was also aware that the killings in many of these places involved not only civilians but gendarmes and other members of the armed forces; is that correct? 
A.	The details of how those crimes were committed were not discussed during that meeting, but since the intelligence services gave him information, from that I understand that he must have been in position to know exactly what happened and who committed exactly those crimes. 
Q.	Did he make any reference to those killings?  Did he commission, for instance, anybody, say the bourgmestres or the préfet, to find out who was responsible for the killings in those places?  Did he do that?  Did he mention that? 
A.	No, he did not do that.
Q.	So even after that meeting, would you say that the killings stopped in Kibuye, after the 3rd of May?  All right, let me put it this way:  Even after the 3rd of May, killings did not stop in Kibuye, did they? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	For instance, Tutsi survivors at the Kibuye hostel were killed after the 3rd of May, were they not? 
A.	That is true.
Q.	Children who were at the hostel, Kibuye hostel were also killed around the 4th or 5th of May?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	(Microphone not activated) ...at the Gasharu cellule, were they not?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Prosecutor repeat the name of the cellule?
MR. KAPAYA:
Gasharu, G-A-S-H-A-R-U, Gasharu cellule. 
THE WITNESS:
Gasharu, what secteur is that in? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	It's in the Gitesi secteur.  Gasharu is in Gitesi secteur. 
A.	No -- well, yes.  Now I see where it is.  Gasharu in Gitesi, there were not massacres before the meeting -- there before the meeting of the 3rd.  What I was able to observe is that the massacres there took place well before.  At the end of April I held a meeting to try to improve the situation, and so those massacres took place well before the 3rd of May in that place. 
Q.	Is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that after 3rd of May, no Tutsi were killed in Gasharu cellule? 
A.	No, I can't specifically mention Gasharu.  What I can say is that massacres didn't necessarily stop after the meeting or because of the meeting of the 3rd of May. 
Q.	Right.  There were large-scale attacks on the 13th and the 14th of May at Muyiro (phonetic) in Bisesero, right? 
A.	Where? 
Q.	Muyiro.
A.	Can you specify where, Counsel? 
Q.	I said in Muyiro hill in Bisesero area.  Did you hear of large-scale killings of many Tutsi who were seeking refuge in those hills on the 13th and 14th of May? 
A.	That I don't know.  I only know that in Bisesero, the massacres did not stop, but I don't know exactly which region or which hills.  But in general, the massacres in Bisesero that began in April continued on through May and June; they did not stop. 
Q.	And in fact, many of the leaders who attended the 3rd of May meeting took part in the Bisesero attacks, did they not, to your knowledge? 
A.	According to the Gishyita and Gisovu bourgmestres' testimony, it proves that they participated.  Their statements proved that they took part. 
Q.	People like Kayishema, Musema, Ntakirutimana, we talked about at that meeting, were convicted of taking part in the attacks in Bisesero.  Have you heard of that? 
A.	I've just heard about it, yeah, from you. 
Q.	Now, the other speaker at that meeting was Mr. Ndindabahizi; is that so? 
A.	Yes, he did before. 
Q.	And he spoke on behalf of the PSD party, did he not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke basically on the relationship between the RPF and the PSD.  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Could you tell us, Mr. Witness, what precisely Mr. Ndindabahizi said, if you can recall? 
A.	Yes.  To begin with, to give you a bird's eye view of the statement, at this time I cannot say -- I cannot confirm that it was a message from the PSD or just a stance he was listing, vis-à-vis an intervention just made before him by one of the participants.  I do remember that there was someone that was at the meeting that raised a question that tended to point out the PSD as an RPF agent, and that the people -- members of that party were not credible.  That was a question they put to the prime minister, and I don't know whether it was because of that question that he took the floor.  But Ndindabahizi did take the floor to show and justify that the PSD was not an RPF agent, and that the members of the PSD should not be considered as RPF accomplices, and that they are -- they were in the government, just like the others, who were not RPF.  It was along those lines that I understood his statement, and it was thus that I could interpret what he said. 
Q.	You've made -- you made a statement to ICTR investigators on the 15th and 16th of May '96, did you not?  Do you recall that?  Do you recall making such a statement? 
A.	Could you show me that statement? 
Q.	Now, sir, have you got that statement I was referring to? 
A.	Yes, the document is before me here. 
Q.	This is a statement -- this is a statement you made to ICTR investigators; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, could you kindly turn to page 6 of that statement, on the penultimate paragraph, the second paragraph from the bottom.  Have you got it?
A.	Yes, I can see it.
Q.	Now, it says there, this is what you said, and I read, "In the name of PSD, a speech was made by Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, the minister of finance.  He said that his party used to be pro-RPF, but now they were supporting the government in its policy." 

Is that what you said, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can see this statement. 
Q.	So, Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech went further than just distancing the PSD from the RPF but supporting the interim government.  Isn't that a reasonable construction of your statement? 
A.	Well, if you take these two lines, just these two lines that I said to the investigators, it could be interpreted in that manner. 
Q.	I now --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But are these two lines correct, Mr. Witness?  Is this your view?  Is it correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.  The issue is when we were answering questions and when we were summarising the statements made, those lines were included.  They were recorded in the statements, but they do not totally reflect my understanding of the statement made by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. 

If I were to explain this, sir, I do remember that he was there.  There was a statement made by Jean Rwabukwisi, who attacked the party openly, and its members, at the meeting, and that had to be dealt with.  He therefore talked about the PSD that was considered as pro-RPF, but that they did not attack the government.  That means that they were not pro-RPF. 

So this is the manner in which I wanted to put it.  It was a position typed on a statement that was made at that meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that statement was made by whom, please, if you could just repeat.  This is a reaction to a statement made by someone else.  Who was that someone else, please? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, the name was one of the participants in the meeting, Rwabukwisi, Jean.  He is a businessman who stood up and pointed at the PSD party and its members as not being credible, and that -- that the RPF was still present at the conference, thanks to the PSD.  So that's -- in reacting to that statement, Ndindabahizi took the floor.  This is why (sic) I interpret his intervention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you could have this name spelled, please, of this other person who made the initial observation, please. 
THE WITNESS:
R-W-A-B-U-K-W-I-S-I, Rwabukwisi, first name Jean, who was also at that meeting, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) ... Mr. Ndindabahizi, then? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, that is the question mark and the reservation I formulated.  Now, during that meeting, if I remember what happened, there are some things I can remember.  I do remember this person speaking, pointing at the PSD and its members.  I do remember Ndindabahizi's statement.  I am saying that I do not quite remember whether he made a statement as a specific statement of the PSD, or whether he was reacting to that question.  But in my mind, in fact, what I understand, I believe that it was in reaction to that statement.  This is why I am saying that he took the floor and explained PSD's position vis-à-vis that person that had made the statement and vis-à-vis the government in place. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
According to you, Mr. Rwabukwisi made a speech during that meeting or had an intervention during that meeting. 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are not absolutely certain as to when he made that intervention? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  That is what I wanted to say, Mr. President. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, sir, let me divide my question into bite-sized chunks.  One, did Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech, was it -- was Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech, did it consist entirely of reactions to people's questions, or did he make a speech on behalf of the PSD, to begin with? 
A.	Yes, I do understand the question.  Now, I cannot at this time confirm that he made a statement that was prepared beforehand to be made in public.  This is why -- this is what I said in my reservation concerning the statement I made.  But it is a matter of fact that he took the floor.  He took the floor at one particular time to react, and I believe that he was reacting to a question that was raised. 
Q.	Sir, I have with me here the minutes of that meeting.  They've been produced here.  They've been tendered in this Tribunal as Prosecution Exhibit P. 30.
MR. KAPAYA:
I would ask the registry to kindly refer the witness to these minutes and see ...
(Pages 1 to 9 by Roxane Lane)













1445H
MR. KAPAYA: 
Now, that document is a summary, it contains the minutes of the meeting of that day. It's in French, English, and Kinyarwanda.  It is also a list of the participants.  Now, would you refer now to Mr. Ndindabahizi's statements and tell us -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech, any language you prefer.  It's on page 12 on the English version of the minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want the witness to find this speech as such?  Do you want the witness to find the speech of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
MR KAPAYA: 
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you found it, Mr. Witness, in any language?  You say that it was page 12 in the English one? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it's page 12, Your Honour, in the English, at tab 3.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's also 12 in the French, if you prefer that one, Mr. Witness.  

The K-number of the French version, Mr. Witness, would that assist you?  If you see the K-number on the top of the pages, it is K0246612.  That's where the French version of Mr. Ndindabahizi's speech starts.  Have you found it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I've found it.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	There are about ten points -- ten paragraphs attributed to the speech Mr. Ndindabahizi made.  Have you seen them?
A.	Yes, I can see it.
Q.	Would you say that the issues contained in these ten paragraphs were made in response to the question raised by Mr. Rabou Kizi, or Rabou something?
MR. BESNIER:
Objection.  Firstly, the witness should be asked whether he remembers whether Ndindabahizi talked about all these ten paragraphs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will go step by step.  Now you have found the speech from page 12 onwards, haven't you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you glance through these few pages, do you recognize the substance as you remember it when you were there?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, perhaps I should read the paragraph in the record and request the witness to make a comment on those paragraphs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is an alternative way.  Let's just see whether he is through now because this is actually less than two pages, so since we have been waiting now for a little bit of time, he can just be given the time to finish that exercise and then you can start with your method afterwards. 

Are you through with these two pages now, Mr. Witness?  Have you glanced through them?
THE WITNESS:
No, not yet, Mr. President.  

I have run through it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We realise, all of us, that it's difficult to approach such a document on the spur of the moment.  Now, Mr Kapaya is going to go paragraph by paragraph and ask for your comments.  

Please go ahead.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	On page 12, Mr. Witness, there is the paragraph which is, "The RPF claimed that the Rwandan Government had prevented them from returning to their mother-land.  It has now become clear that this is a lie because Rwanda has never prevented them from returning home.  The RPF also claimed that there is no democracy and when Rwanda accepted to organize elections so that the will of the majority may be shown through democracy, the RPF was at a loss."  

What do you say to that paragraph?
A.	You want my opinion as to whether the text is correct or not?  I do not know what you want from me.
Q.	I want from you to explain faithfully whether you heard something akin to this spoken by Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Secondly, I want you to tell this Tribunal whether he spoke it as just a PSD representative or in response to a question from a member attending that meeting?
A.	Is it possible to find in this passage all the statements, Raubo Kizi's and the others?  I see that it's a message, but that was a reaction of one of the participants that pointed to the PSD.  I'm wondering whether the statement of that person is in the summary, too -- in the minutes, too. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we will come to that, but do you want to pursue this point by point first?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  That is what I intended to do.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we will look at other parts of this document later on.  So this, you say -- this is a speech, you say.
THE WITNESS:
That's correct.  Now, so far as the occasion of the statement is concerned, I do not know whether it is a reaction to an intervention or simply a message.  All I know is that Ndindabahizi spoke and that a question was raised along those lines.  This is all I can say.  

Now, as to the contents of the context of the first paragraph, that is what I said, because I confirm that at his intervention he wanted to show that the PSD was not an accomplice of the RPF and it was the government and that was a testament to the fact that it was not of the RPF, so that that is the line along which I wanted to interpret the statement he had made.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q. 	The second paragraph reads, "The RPF had intended to reject negotiations.  It resumed hostilities after killing the President of the Republic.  Documents were found with its members which showed how the war in 1993 and that of early 1994 were planned.  At that time, we Rwandans had put our hopes in the Arusha Peace Accords, they were planning and preparing a war to exterminate us."  

Did he or did he not say this?
A.	I say that this is a continuation of the first paragraph and I believe that the one who summarised the statement did not imagine the words.  It is a summary made by somebody, and I cannot call that into question as to what he has written, this person who made a summary.
Q.	The third one reads, "They secured accomplices in the main political parties and caused these parties to split.  It has become clear that the RPF never wanted power sharing but rather wanted all the power for itself.  During war preparations, the combatants had taken up war hero names so that outsiders would not recognize them if they called each other." 

Did he say this, the reference to Inkotanyi?
A.	What does panégyrique in French mean?  This is part of the statement.  It is a part of a statement that describes the RPF, and eliciting as tenants vis-a-vis the  RPF.  I don't know whether I can say, or if he said or he did not say.  All I can say is that this is an excerpt of his statement.  That is all.
Q.	Okay.  The third one reads, "The RPF wanted the Rwanda government to remain paralysed from December 1993 up to the time when it would seize power.  In the meantime however, it would be making preparations to take over the country.  This became clear through the previous government."  

Mr. Witness, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say or did he not say these words, and, if so, in what context?  If you can recall, tell us you recall; if you don't, say you don't.
A.	Well, so far as I'm concerned, the answer is the same as to the one I offered earlier on concerning the other paragraphs.  This is a political speech and whether they are political statements by Ndindabahizi, I do not have the entire texts with me or in my head.  All that I can say is that he made a statement, the statements which I commented on, and this is only a summary of a statement made in the course of the discussions that took place at a meeting and, of course, it is part and parcel of the statement, so that I'm not denying that he did not make a statement in the course of that meeting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you remember actually now what he said, Mr. Witness?  When the Prosecutor is now putting these sections to you, he wants to know whether he said it or not.  That is the first issue, and are you able to remember whether he said it or not?
THE WITNESS:
Sentence per sentence? Is that what you mean, Mr. President?  It's a bit difficult for me.  Do you mean sentence per sentence if this indeed was the statement of someone?  That seems difficult, but if you mean the general idea that came out of it, to say that it was the exact statement he made when this is a summary, I don't know, but I do know that this was broadcast over radio.  You could even see tapes that you probably have, console tapes that you probably have, but to confirm whether or not this summary is complete and whether or not there are mistakes, I'm not in a position to guarantee that.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	In the course of his speech, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say something along these lines, the fourth paragraph: "No Rwandan leader will ever again be negligent.  If there had been no accomplices among Rwandan leaders and if they had been Interahamwe, Rwanda would not have fallen so low"?

Do you recall him saying anything along those lines?
A.	Yes, he said such things.
Q.	Then it reads, "It is no longer a secret, as evidenced by retrieved documents, that the RPF had soldiers in each Commune whose objective was to exterminate us one day."  

Did he say this?
A.	That I cannot guarantee.  First, there were no soldiers in Gitesi, they were not in Kibuye, no.
Q.	Another summary reads, "What happened, happened, but no leader will ever work for the enemy again."  

Did he say that?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And by this statement, he meant that if the PSD was associating with RPF, it would not associate with RPF again, right?  Or do you have a different interpretation?
A.	Yes, that's true.
Q.	The other paragraph reads, "The RPF has now become too confident about its strength.  It has openly stated that it wants a Ministry for Tutsis, that of Justice.  He called upon the PSD party members to join others in fighting for the country's security, even if many accomplices were from their party.  This was also the case in many other parties, which did not mean that these parties would stop working.  He called upon Abakombozi, PSD party members, to register for civil defence in big numbers."  

Do you recall that summary?
A.	First, he did speak of accomplices within the party.  That the youth wing would join the civil defence, that, too, he underscored.
Q.	And finally, it reads -- the statement is, "In ending the PSD party's message, Minister Ndindabahizi called upon members of the population to point out early enough any leader who might lead them astray because it was now clear which side each of them supported, between the RPF and the Rwandan people's government."  

Did he say that or did he not say it?
A.	In fact, what is underscored here, to denounce authorities who were responsible, that is why I was against this.  This is a reaction to a question that was asked.  The question underscored this aspect, that there were authorities who were not credible, who were not good people within the population.
Q.	The message here is that the PSD -- the PSD position was clear between the RPF and the interim government, so is this a message that the PSD was supporting the Rwandan government -- the interim government, actually?
A.	No, to say that the PSD -- this PSD situation with regard to the RPF is clear, I don't agree.  The PSD never worked for the RPF as the population said it did.  However, it is true this position was similar than the RPF.  That's why people said that the PSD was working for the RPF, but by saying that they support the transitional government, that is what he wanted to say, by saying that they are in the government, they work in the Abatabazi government.
Q.	So the message is that formerly the RPF supported -- the PSD supported the RPF, but now it's changed its position, it's not supporting the RPF government, isn't that the position?
A.	There is a position that I don't understand.  There is one position and name you give to one party, and that I explained.  The party was in the government even before the RPF came into the country, but the people called them accomplices.  What I am sure of -- and I was a member of the party -- is that we did not work for the RPF, but we were assimilated as doing so.  We always worked in the government within the country.  That is why that he takes this position, to show that the RPF, and not PSD members, are working for -- as accomplices of the RPF.
Q.	Mr. Witness, we shouldn't spend too much time on this issue because I think it's clear from this statement you say, you end your statement in -- you met with investigators on the 10th and 16th of May, that Mr. Ndindabahizi made it quite clear that formerly the government, the PSD was pro-RPF, but now it was supporting the interim government and its policies.  Is that not what you summarise is what Mr. Ndindabahizi said at that meeting?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you notice the question just posed?  The Prosecutor is now going back to your statement and he's putting that sentence to you.
THE WITNESS:
Well, the summary that I have here seems to take up what is in the summary or is contained in the summary, that's correct.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness.  Now let's move to 16th of May.  Do you recall that there was a meeting on the 16th of May in Kibuye?
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President.  We are no longer speaking about the report of Alison Des Forges.  We have spent an hour and 15 minutes on the May 3rd meeting, and now we are speaking of the 16 May meeting which I did not mention at all in my examination-in-chief.  We have already spoken for long enough about issues that were not brought up in my examination-in- chief, so I now figure it is time we go to issues brought up in my examination- in-chief, and not on these other issues.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Comment, Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, this matter relates to credibility of the witness.  It is contained in the witness statement, and under Rule 90(E) I'm entitled to ask questions of this nature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are now moving from page 6 to 7 of his witness statement, isn't that so, this declaration to investigators?
MR. KAPAYA:
 Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But was Mr. Ndindabahizi present during the meeting on 16th of May, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that is what I'm interested in in asking these particular questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, why don't you ask that question?  It's a leave question, and its credibility, but we see the need now to go to the main portions of the examination-in-chief. 

Did you get the question from the Prosecutor, Mr. Witness?  We are now dealing with the 16th of May meeting briefly.  So what is your question?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you attend that meeting?
A.	I was there.
Q.	Was this a prefét security meeting and that representatives of various political parties were required to attend?
A.	Yes, they were invited all the way to the level of representatives of the prefécture.
Q.	What was the purpose of that committee?
A.	It was a visit of the head of state at the time who visited the prefécture.  It convened a number of people, especially heads of sections, divisions, and bourgmestre and people -- authorities in the prefécture, so it was a meeting with the head of state.
Q.	Did the president come with Mr. Ndindabahizi as Minister or representative of the PSD?
A.	If my memory serves me well, I did not see Ndindabahizi there.
Q.	You are saying he could or could not have been at that meeting?
A.	I'm saying that if my memory serves me well, I did not see Ndindabahizi in that meeting, nor did I ever say so in any investigation or interview that I had with the investigators.
Q.	The president at that meeting said that the prefécture of Kibuye had done very well and there were no problems concerning security.  You heard that, did you not?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't need to hear you on that, Mr. Besnier.  Now I don't see any need to go on, Mr. Kapaya.  You have to explain that, because now the witness has said that he can't remember that the Accused was there.  Why do you want to go on?  One thing is credibility, but what is the relevance to the case now? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The relevance, Your Honour, is that the person who I'm asking the witness to respond to, if it was the president of the republic and whatever he said represented policy of the government generally.  Now, the government is one where Mr. Ndindabahizi and this witness, and -- sorry, Mr. Ndindabahizi said, so it's important to explain the policy in which the accused person said it, and the question actually pertains to any issue which -- when we get the witness's response, you will see the relevance of it, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence.  

MR. BESNIER:
Does the Prosecutor wish to ask the witness to speculate about Ndindabahizi's reactions to a meeting that he wasn't at, or is the witness being asked to know whether or not, in his opinion, Sindikubwabo's words committed all members of the government?  Can we have a more precise question then?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that is a question or matter of interpretation as to whether what was said there binds everybody, but what I want to know from the witness is the interpretation of those very words the president used, what they mean to the people who attended there, and this, as I say, is relevant in explaining the policy the government pursued.  Actually, Your Honour, it's the very last sentence in the witness's summary.  It explains everything there, what the witness understood by those words to mean in the statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the statement to investigators?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the other case?
MR. KAPAYA:
It's in this case, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The 15th and 16th of May statement, is that the one you are referring to?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You are on the borderline here, Mr Kapaya, but the question is allowed.  You were just allowed to ask the question. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the president said at that meeting that you had -- the prefécture of Kibuye had done very well and that there was no problem of security.  Now, what do you understand those words to mean?  That was my question.
A.	What I know is that the president did speak in those terms.  We saw what happened at Kibuye.  From that we deduced that he was congratulating the population of Kibuye for all of the crimes that had taken place in that place.
Q.	All right.  Now let's move to another area.  

Yesterday you testified about roadblocks, do you recall that?  Now, do you say that the local government and central government authorities were not responsible for the erection of roadblocks?  Did you say that?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  I said that they were not responsible for erecting the roadblocks in the sense that no orders were given, at least on a local level, to that effect to erect roadblocks.  No monitoring was done to see how it was being conducted.  What we do know, however, is that those roadblocks were being manned by authorities either of the national or local level, so it's part of the propaganda that was going on during that period.
Q.	Now, were roadblocks not part and parcel of the civil defence programme?
A.	No, it's completely different.
Q.	What did you say, Mr. Witness?
A.	It's different.
Q.	On 11th of April '94, do you recall holding a meeting with consiellers -- sorry, let me rephrase this question.  

On 11th of April, do you recall attending a meeting with conseillers in Gitesi?
A.	Yes, I remember that meeting. 
Q.	Do you recall that at that meeting the issue of security was raised and it was decided that roadblocks should be erected between sectors in order to control the population?
A.	No, no decision to that effect was taken.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I require you to consider a document and ask you to look at paragraphs 1, 2, 3 -- the paragraphs I have marked here, and tell me whether they don't refer to the thing I'm alluding to.  Unfortunately, it is in our language?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you be able to introduce this document briefly, Mr Kapaya?  This is a letter dated 13th April 1994.
MR. KAPAYA:
It contains minutes, Your Honour.  It is a forwarding letter.  The offer is forwarding the minutes of the meeting to somebody.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but what you say is here comes a letter dated 13th of April 1994 and, as an appendix, there are minutes of something.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these are minutes from a meeting of 11th of April 1994 and you only have it in Kinyarwanda.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's right, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
But you know what is in there.
MR. KAPAYA:
I do, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How should we know?  You are going to read it out?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I think that is the best procedure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there no translation in English and French in the Tribunal?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, we don't have a translation of this document here. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Would it be possible for the interpreters to have a copy of this document? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, on the first page there -- we don't have it available -- but isn't this a letter in Kinyarwanda dated 13th April 1994?  Now, do you recognize the signature at the bottom of the first page there of the letter, itself?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I recognize this document, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there is an appendix annexed to that document, and you want the witness to look at page -
MR. KAPAYA:
The parts I have noted, Your Honour, and I wanted him just to read those parts.  He can read it aloud so it is interpreted and goes on the record.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I just wanted to find out whose signature it is that he recognized on that document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Whose signature is it, Mr. Witness, on the letter?
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS: 
I don't have the passages, Prosecutor, that you indicated to me.  Which passages?
Okay.  Well, I shall read the text as a whole.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Just the minutes, the minutes, not the covering letter.
A.	No, I'm going to read the passages you indicated.  It is on page 3, the last part of the page.  

"The meeting noted that in general there was suspicion among the ethnic groups because of criminal acts committed in the neighbouring communes of Gitesi, to the extent that the Gitesi commune, itself, was affected by such criminal acts.  

Secondly, the meeting took note of the fact that the bourgmestre, in seeking assistance and securing assistance from the gendarmerie and the communal police force members, may continue to intervene wherever the situation became difficult, so that if any individual were to be arrested because of such acts, that that individual be severely punished.  

Thirdly, the meeting noted that each conseiller in his or her sector should continue to proffer counsel for the purpose of preventing criminal acts.  

4.  The meeting noted that the curfew instituted as from 18 hours to 06 hours in the morning was necessary.  During that period, on the thoroughfares that lead to the city, roadblocks should be erected, night patrols within the city must be ensured by the gendarme, but in the rural areas where such patrols had already begun and where people are co-operating without any problems, that night patrols must continue."

Now, will I go on? 
Q.	Now I move to another area.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, here reference is made to the erection of roadblocks in what you just read out, and we had the impression, listening to you a couple of minutes ago, that there were no roadblocks erected at the local level.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were none, sir, so that I believe that in this passage we are talking about roadblocks that lead to the city.  In other words, we should control, monitor the movement of people going into town so that the propaganda -- I mean, the propaganda comes in force so that movement towards the city should be monitored, so that these roadblocks are gendarmerie roadblocks.  This is why we are saying that the patrols are not initiated by the population, but rather by the gendarmerie.  This is what came out of the meeting of the 11th.  There were no roadblocks in any sectours in the countryside.  This is what I could say concerning the question put to me.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	The question that I had put to you, Mr. Witness, was whether roadblocks were not part and parcel of the civil defence programme, that is the defence that people were asked by authorities to observe, themselves.  Now, in the course of doing that, they were required to build roadblocks.  Now, were roadblocks not within the sanction of the state, the authority as part and parcel of the civil defence programme?
A.	Very well, very well.  Now, let me try and answer that question, Mr. President.  Now, that was the situation prevailing as at 11th of April that emanated from the security situation prevailing in the commune.  The security situation is reflected in this resumè, this summary, the preamble section in the body of the text.  Of course, the entire text is not translated, but all the stages are reflected.  

Now, these are only the conclusions adopted by the assembly in view of the situation that obtained.  Now, there was a civil defence programme that was instituted, recommended by the government, and that civil defence programme was as a result of instructions from the prime minister, who wrote the instructions and communicated them.  Now, if you look at the meeting of 3rd of May, it was there that the idea of a civil defence program was communicated.  It was at that time that the idea was communicated.  

Now, if you want to link the fact of the 11th of April and 3rd of May, I believe that they are not related.  And the civil defence program, it is explained in the decision of the prime minister and the instruction of the minister of the Interior, it was communicated, it was an instruction -- we know it was an instruction and we knew it.  It was an instruction from the month of May and not April, so these are two different things, and in the civil defence program there was no instruction concerning roadblocks.  It was rather one intended to train young people thoroughly so they could support the army and the defence of the country in the event of Inkotanyi attacks in the area.  The instruction concerning the training of these people, these young people, only started after the instruction and in Gitesi started in June.  You can see this summary.  There is another summary that talks about the civil defence program and that is after the 13th of May.  You should have that summary.  

How did we react to it?  That was the one of 13th of May.  That was the decision, the meeting to discuss the decisions and instructions of the Prime Minister.  That is what I can say regarding this question regarding the civil defence program and the setting up of the roadblocks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what you just read out to us in Kinyawrandan, and which was then read into the records in English and French, were excerpts from minutes from a meeting on 11 April in which body, which committee?  Can you put that on the record the name of the committee, please?

THE WITNESS:
It was as it is written out here, it is the covering letter to the summary.  It was the meeting of the communal security council, including members of the communal council, among others.
MR. KAPAYA:
One last question on this point, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yesterday, when learned counsel was leading you on this issue, he asked you the following question and this is your response.  "Now, did authorities mount those roadblocks?  Was there a plan for the setting up of roadblocks in Kibuye?"  Answer:  "To my knowledge, in Kibuye there was no determined plan.  We just saw the roadblocks being set up progressively.  There was no -- there was one set up here and then another and another until such a time that it sort of formed a complete network." 

Is that what you say?
A.	Yes.  The answer to that question is still valid even at this time.  I believe that if you are referring to the decision to erect roadblocks at the entrance of the city, that wasn't part of the gendarmerie.  We requested that roadblocks be set up there.  

Now, you are asking about the roadblocks made by the population that were mounted here and there in the area, so that once again -- perhaps, I see that you have a document.  What the problem of roadblocks, I looked at it properly in the course of a meeting because  the form of barriers of the roadblocks was a problem.  There was no program of erection here and there and getting the population to set them up.  I am not denying that there was a campaign launched by certain authorities, certain parts of the media to set up roadblocks, that is a matter of fact, but to say that this and that authority decided that roadblocks be set up and manned in such-and-such a manner, that is not true.  This is what I said yesterday and this is what I'm still maintaining.
Q.	When it was found out that crimes were being committed at roadblocks, did the authorities order that they be demolished?
A.	Now, let me come back to the answer.  I know, and I'm not denying, that some of the authorities, some of them supported and did push for the setting up of the check points, the roadblocks, and when there were crimes committed at those roadblocks, that generated a problem, so far as I'm concerned, at any rate, and I, particularly, looked into the problem on the occasion of the meeting of the committee, such as the meeting of the 11th, because that was a problem, a real problem that was there, and that was a matter of fact.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified yesterday that Mr. Ndindabahizi was PSD Chairman, Kibyue, right?
A.	That is correct.  That is what I said.
Q.	Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi was not the first chairman, he took over from someone, did he not?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And he had to -- Mr. Ndindabahizi took over the chairmanship because the holder of that position had to relinquish it because he was appointed to another post?
A.	That is not correct.  That is not correct.  That is false.
Q.	Let me show you a name and tell me whether you know this person.  This person was the first president of the PSD in Kibuye, is that not correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	He was actually the founder member of the party in Kibuye, do you agree?
A.	He was not the only one, he was with other people.  Yes, he was one of the founding members.
Q.	In line with the Arusha Accord, he was appointed MP designate, was he not?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And he couldn't be chairman and MP at the same time, could he?
A.	Yes, that is possible.  It is not incompatible.
Q.	But the position in this case was that because he was appointed by the party to hold another post, he had to relinquish the chairmanship to somebody else.  That was a party decision, was it not?
A.	Well, let me explain the situation to you.
Q.	I just want a yes or no answer.
A.	No, that is not correct.  That is not true, sir, so that the post of MP and running the party, these are not incompatible at all.
Q.	Was that person -- now, that person was not -- did not finally take up his position, did he, the position as member of parliament, the person I have shown you on that piece of paper?
A.	Yes, yes, that's correct.
Q.	And that position was taken by somebody else you know, right?
A.	That is correct, yes.
Q.	Who appointed you to that post?
A.	Now, before I answer that question, Mr. President, could I give you background to clarify these questions, the preceding questions especially, as regards the said incompatibility or otherwise or the replacement level of the party or at regional level?  This will allow me to make things much clearer, Mr. President.  

Very well.  Now, what happened, as I said yesterday, was that initially when PSD was created in '91 it was run by a member, or by a provisional committee; that is, somebody was appointed as president or chairman, secretary, et cetera, et cetera.  That was how it happened, and after the members became many, there was a structure put to the party and organs were elected, party organs, as I said yesterday.  At regional level, indeed, the person who was the founding member was running the party at the level of the region up to 1992 or 1993, but somewhere in 1992 there were regional elections, and the elected committee was established and the chairman was Ndindabahizi.  
Now, the person that was in the regional committee, the person whose name you showed me who was the chairman of the party during the interim period, was still on the committee, but not at the level of chairman after the elections -- after the elections.  So that has nothing to do with the appointment as MP.  That was after the Arusha Accords were signed in 1993.  It was then that the parties organised themselves to appoint those that want to represent them in the parliament in transitional -- the interim parliament.  That was 1993 and 1994.  That should be set apart.  

Now, coming back to the issue that was just raised as to who replaced him -- I think that was the question, who replaced him at the level of the parliament as MP.  Now, as I explained yesterday, the appointment of this replacement -- and he took part in it -- it was between the chairman of the party at regional level and the person whose name you showed me who was the vice chairman.  This is why he went to see Bwakira, and at that time -- let me explain, Mr. President.  

Before and during the transitional parliament that was programmed with the RPF, it was 11 members, but with the new parliament without the RPF, we had 13 members.  Now, I do not see why you are saying it was a matter of course or they wanted to replace him.  He was replaced, but there were members to be added to the list.  Now, the question as to why he was replaced, you didn't ask.  You shouldn't put it to me.  Put it to those people who made sure that the name of the person was on the final list.  

These are the explanations I wanted to offer, Mr. President.  Thank you.
Q.	My question to you, Mr. Witness, is very simple.  Who appointed you MP designate leading to your swearing in on 4th of July?  Who appointed you? 
A.	I was appointed by the representative of the party at regional level and by his vice chairman, those two persons, because the committee was unable to meet.
Q.	What is his name?
A.	Who?  The representative?
Q.	What is the name of the person who appointed you?
A.	I said I was appointed by two people:  Ndindabahizi, who was chairman of the party, and the other person that he went to see in Bwakira, so that the decision was made by two persons.
Q.	Did Mr. Ndindabahizi tell you that he was going to tell Sindikubwabo and Kambanda that he ratified that appointment in the place of the person -- the incumbent who was there?
A.	The chairman cannot have any right of ratifying.  It was a party appointment.  It had nothing to do with the other parties or the government.  It was not a ratification process.  There was no such step.  It was a matter for the party. 
(Pages 10 to 24 by Trevor Gerbes)



	1600H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Sir, you were appointed by the party or a committee, but now you were not appointed by the committee as the constitution of the PSD required, you are appointed by somebody who told you that he was appointing you and that he would tell the president and the prime minister to ratify your appointment.  Didn't that happen?
A.	No, no, no.  We are talking about procedures.  As far as the appointment of MPs are concerned, that never goes to the prime minister or the president of the republic, that is a decision that is made within the party, and that is all, full stop.  That is why, if the president were to ratify or confirm, the parliament would have been there a long time ago; it is because it's the parties that appoint their members.  

Now, indeed, my appointment was not made by a committee.  The situation, the conjuncture was impossible.  That is why there was consultation between two party leaders at that level.
Q.	The PSD required that you be elected by a party -- by the party and not appointed.  Now that you are appointed, this is why that happened now.
A.	No, that is not true.  No, that is not true.  Even now, if you look at the parliament that has just been set up in Rwanda in November, how were people appointed?  There were no elections; it was the party that stood up.  They represent certain parties, certain people, and they go to parliament.  There have never been any elections in Rwanda; it was appointments.  Appointments have taken place many a time.  There have never been any elections so far. 
Q.	What was the ethnic group of the wife of the person you replaced?
A.	Tutsi, sir.
Q.	And that person you replaced did not tell you that he was relinquishing that post voluntarily, did he?
A.	Voluntarily?  No.  At the beginning he did not relinquish it.  According to the communications we had, he did not relinquish it, but we took note of it later on.  

But I do not know why you insist on saying that I replaced so-and-on, whereas I am telling you that the list of the members of the party was increased by two.  There were two préfectures that should have been given two members, whereas others had only one member.
Q.	Mr. Witness, why did you choose to serve in a government that pursued a genocide policy?  Why did you not resign, if you were not part of it, part of the game?
A.	Well, that is a question that I would like to dwell on, if I may.  That is always a matter of speculation and interpretation, and you should allow me time to explain this.  Now I am -- and I explained the functions that I performed from 1990 to 1994 -- now, during that period of time the government of Rwanda was to be seen -- could have been seen in four ways.  There was the MRND government, and up to '91 there was a government in which you had only two political parties that only was there for three months in 1991, and now you have a government where there is an agreement between political parties where now we have four, five parties within that government, that is, from 1991 to 1993.  Now, these political parties that took part in that government of the MRND, for example, they were there with their own identities as parties, they were there upon agreement with the government.  Now, these are three governments, and I was in there, I performed my functions, and nothing ever changed.  

Now, I do not know whether the functions I had were absolutely related to the policies of those governments.  If not, I should have been changed each and every time the government changes.  Whereas in those governments the political parties that agreed to run the country -- and those political parties did not abandon their programs, their various programs and their status -- they were there on the basis of government status and together to run a government that is patronised, that is sponsored by the MRND, so that there were groups of parties and the opposition within one government. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated) 
A.	Very well, but the question is very broad as you put it to me; I do not know how to tackle it to be as clear as I could be, as I am trying to do.  I did not decide -- to come to your precise question, I did not decide to serve in a government, a government came and found me in service.  I tried to manage the situation, and that is all.
Q.	All right.

Now, I put it to you, Mr. Witness, that Mr Ndindabahizi used undue influence to remove the MP who was elected by the party and install you as a reward for supporting him in his various activities in Gitesi commune.  What do you say to that?
A.	Now, that is a question that should not be put to me, because I did not appoint myself.  Perhaps the question should be put to Ndindabahizi himself.  All I know is that I do not see any reason why this innuendo should be there to -- or any influence should be exercised so that I get that post.  I do not see any reason for that.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
I am sorry, Your Honours, there are documents I want to tender as evidence.  There are two.  One is the witness statement document by this witness that is dated 15th and 16th May 1996.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that would be P. 41, under seal.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
French and English; English being A, French B, yes?  

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
 (Exhibit Nos P. 41A and P. 41B admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
The second one is the minutes in Kinyarwanda, which were read on the record.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and then we need the entire document, both the letter and the minutes, and that will be P. 42, again under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 42 admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.

And finally, the piece of paper that contains a name, which was shown to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 43, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 43 admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Re-examination. 
MR. BESNIER:
Just a few questions, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, in May 1994 were there any military confrontations between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF forces --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone, please.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	And I add, on Rwandan soil. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, can the witness repeat the answer?  His microphone was not on during the first part of it.  

Pardon me, Mr. President.

THE WITNESS:
The war with the RPF started in April, continued up to July 1994.  It was taking place within different areas in Rwanda.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	That is correct.  

During the 3 May meeting in Kibuye, do you know if Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke as a minister or as a member of the PSD?
A.	When I made my statement about his declaration, I said that he spoke on behalf of the PSD; he was a representative of the PSD party.
Q.	Did it appear surprising to you that this particular PSD member would support a government that he belonged to?
A.	Pardon me?
Q.	Did it appear surprising to you or bizarre or shocking that this member of the PSD, that is to say Ndindabahizi, supported the government that he belonged to?
A.	That question seems difficult to me; I don't understand.
Q.	I'll rephrase.  Was Mr. Ndindabahizi a member of the transitional government?
A.	Yes, he was.
Q.	During the public meeting, should he oppose the government that he belonged to?
A.	No, that would have been impossible.
Q.	During the meeting of 3 May did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi personally, directly or indirectly say things that would encourage the massacres in Kibuye, the massacres of civilian Tutsis?
A.	Indirectly or directly?  I don't understand.  I don't have what he said.  I don't have -- I don't see what he said before me.
Q.	Earlier the Prosecutor asked you who designated you to be in the National Assembly.  You said there were two people; yes or no?
A.	Yes, that is what I have just said; correct, indeed.
Q.	The first person, if I understood, was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; the second was the person -- was it the person that the Prosecutor showed you a name on a piece of people?
A.	Yes, it's the same person whose name I saw on a paper.
Q.	Did you ever meet this second person after Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's visit?
A.	Yes, we often met.
Q.	During those meetings with that second person, did that second person tell you that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi pressured him by underscoring the ethnic group of his wife?
A.	I was called by the prosecutor of the republic of Kibuye to talk about Ndindabahizi.  I was in the same jail with this person whose name was shown to me.  He was also in contact with the prosecutor.  I am sure that those statements never made it to the prosecutor of the republic's office.  If that had taken place, it must have vexed them.  I think that they would have talked -- confronted us about this story if that had happened, or such a statement would have appeared in our depositions before the prosecutor of the republic, because we lived together, that person and I, in 1994.  We lived through difficult times.  Even when he exiled to Zaire, he left his property with me.  When he came back, he stayed for some time outside the country and then he was arrested.  We lived together.  I made these statements when we were together in the prison in Kibuye.  So what I have just here -- heard, perhaps that happened, perhaps these are inventions.  Nevertheless, I am not aware of such pressure of which you speak.  What else?  If there was pressure to designate me, it wouldn't have been necessary in 1994; couldn't have declared that.  They wouldn't have gone to -- from Kibuye to see him.  I think that's the only answer that I can give you to this question.
Q.	That is very clear. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
JUDGE BOSSA:
You talked about seeing the Accused in 1994, in the month of June, that he passed through his own area and came to your house, and he had arrested another ***********************.  What was the nature of the allegations that the Accused made against that person, and when your investigations were made and *******, what were your findings about who the culprit was, about the allegations made by the Accused?  Is the question clear? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, I understand.  

***********, I didn't find any guilt with respect to the allegations as they were communicated to me from Ndindabahizi.  Only I did that after a meeting and after a discussion -- after a discussion, and after an exchange of ideas with Ndindabahizi who had brought him, because he left him in jail ********
But during the discussions -- I then had discussions with Ndindabahizi, so we were able to talk about the situation with regard to this person.  ************88On the other hand, I tried to conduct an investigation into what this person had told me, and that investigation that I conducted, I was not able to complete it because it was very difficult, it was very complicated.  So I let it go until the situation became more calm, so such an investigation could take place.
JUDGE BOSSA:
(Microphone not activated) ... allegations which were made by the Accused against this person, what did the Accused tell you about what that person was alleged to have done?
THE WITNESS:
The Accused -- the Accused had suspended his activities *****, and there was a murder of a person and he was supposed to protect that person, and he must have had a friendship with Ndindabahizi or been a member of his family, but he didn't sufficiently protect a person who was murdered.  And we found that those few facts were not sufficient for that person to be arrested, to say that he didn't protect somebody who was murdered, when he himself was not implicated in the murder.  Just to say that he didn't protect somebody, given the situation in the country, I said, "Frankly that is not sufficient to put somebody behind bars."
JUDGE BOSSA:
(Microphone not activated) ... and the person who was murdered?
THE WITNESS:
It was a cousin of Ndindabahizi, cousin -- at any rate relatives of his cousins, cousins who were massacred, or their entire families.
JUDGE BOSSA:
My next question relates to the meetings of 29th and 30th April.  You testified that one of them was a communal meeting and another one was a central meeting and they related to security in your area.  Now, you testified that in those meetings the Accused was not spoken about because there was no need, there was nothing anybody could do -- correct me if I am misquoting you.  So my question is this.  This was -- the Accused was a minister in the government of the day, ********, he was a native and people were dying -- you say they started dying in April, continued through May -- didn't you see a need *********to at least approach him to bring him on top of issues in your area?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

I did not contact him.  First, we must consider the relationships between civil servants, especially given my position and his position, and given his position, it was difficult for me to be able to contact him for anything, unless I could individually contact him since he was a minister to help me, to try to help me calm the situation.  But on a functional level, it was very difficult.  Communications could not permit such a thing.  
You spoke about the meeting of the 29th; indeed it took place.  It was with the members of the conseiller and members of the security council in the préfecture to see what we could do about the killings, see what measures we could take to try to reduce or completely stop these massacres.  If he was in Kibuye at that time, if we had the opportunity to receive him in Gitesi, we would have invited him, as a minister, to our meeting for his support, but he was not at that meeting.  

The meeting took place.  If he had been there, he would have participated as a minister native to that commune.  We would have invited him and I don't think he would have refused the invitation, and we would have launched him through contributions.  The next day there was a cooperation meeting in the secteur.  If we had contacted him a bit before, if he had visited us before, indeed, I would have asked for his contribution to talk to the population of the area of which he was a native, but I didn't even think of that.
JUDGE BOSSA:
(Microphone not activated) ... Kibuye, 3rd of May meeting, I believe that was just a few days after the meeting you had in your area.  Did you have an opportunity to talk to him about it?
THE WITNESS:
No, the way they were escorted with the presidential guard made it difficult to individually contact a person.  I didn't have any particular meetings with him.  He came; we had the meeting together and his escorts of the presidential guard took him away.  He had very tight security around him.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And did he in his address to this meeting talk about the security situation in his native area, generally in the préfecture and in his native area --
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
-- considering that he commended that particular area for the killings that took place?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  During the meeting of the 3rd, during his speech he did not mention the security situation in his native area, not even in his cellule, or secteur, or commune in general; there was no mention of that.  

As you have noticed, he generally spoke of the party and its position within the government that was there.  He -- the president thanked the people in Kibuye.  That is why when I explained myself, I said that the president in his address was not really discouraging what was going on.  He really was trying to further what was going on.  That is why in my commentary, when he said that, "You've worked well", he really meant that he was thanking the crimes that were going on.  I didn't see in the president's speech anything that was discouraging what was going on.  

JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS
Thank you, Your Honour.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, in 1990, before your appointment as bourgmestre, did you have any political affiliation with the president at that period in time?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  At that time there was only one political party, and in fact, all Rwandans had to, without choice, adhere to that party, and so I was a member of it.
JUDGE BOSSA:
(By order of the Court, this question has been extracted, and filed under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us all remember not to mention the functions of the witness, so that goes also to you, Mr. Witness.  We will avoid references to his occupation.  So, if that could be struck from the record and the video.  

Did you get the question, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand the question.  Should I respond?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

It wasn't for that reason.  As I said earlier, every Rwandan belonged to the MRND party, so I don't think it can be a reference to appoint somebody, because everybody was a member.  So it must have been for other reasons.  First of all, I was a native of that area, and then there was a vacancy coming up and they had to find a replacement, and I probably wasn't the only candidate.  They probably made choices on the basis of criteria that I do not know, until the point where they came down to me, and named me.  But I don't know what the criteria were.  The fact is I was a civil servant and I worked in the ministry, there were people who knew me.  I had training in rural development, and that was the main thing people wanted, agronomists, people who are trained in rural development, people who know social work.  I think that I fit the profile of the person they were looking for, but I don't know exactly which criteria were used, especially since there were probably all kinds of other people who were candidates in the pool.  

I think that is how I could answer your question, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I'm trying to understand the whole picture.  And if we go back now to the 3rd of May meeting, there we have the prime minister who is indirectly almost encouraging killings, because he is not asking people to stop.  That's the situation.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then comes Mr. Niyitegeka who, according to you in the previous case, makes a speech which is containing words pregnant with meaning, and any Rwandan, any honest Rwandan would understand that minister's speech in the same way, almost as some kind of a consent to what was going on, because again, there were no explicit discouragement.  Am I right so far?  That is the second speech.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then comes Mr. Ndindabahizi speaking, as you said it, not as a minister but as a member of the PSD party.  But still no mention is made of the bodies in the streets, of the smell of decomposing persons, the killings, the smell in the town.  These - also, this speech is in a vacuum.  

Now, why is this speech not indirectly a consent to what was going on?  What distinguishes this speech from the two previous speeches?  Can you assist me with this?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, in the different speeches that took place during that meeting there were people who go straight ahead and speak directly of what was going on, who practically incite others to kill.  That is why in my statement, Niyitegeka was unequivocal, was direct, and when he answers to a question put to him, he answers directly.  There are others who give political discourse, who try to beat around the bush, who don't speak openly, who try to perhaps gloss over the situation, who don't want to get in depth, who move around a bit.  That situation is perhaps due to the fact that the government as such, the Abatabazi government, when I see what was going on, there was no measures, no directives, no actions to stop the killings, so that means they're behind them and support them.  And so, when we take action and we try to go around something, we can't go directly, because if you move directly you might fall flat on your face.  

There are people who try to go around things, and perhaps they are doing that because they were just as afraid as I was, or, perhaps, they support what was going on.  Nevertheless, there are people who are direct, who speak openly, who incite others.  And in the meeting, Kambanda or rather Niyitegeka in his speech, he was very direct; perhaps others tried to beat around the bush.  And that's the only thing I can say.  But speaking openly against the killings, nobody would have dared to do so, they would have had to beat around the bush.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, Tharcisse Kabasha dared to do so, didn't he, during that meeting, according to your previous testimony?  And then no one responded. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Kabasha dared to do that; that is true.  But Kabasha, who is he?  A very strong member of the MRND, very strong, very known, with a good -- with a reputation.  Someone else from the PS or PL could not have done that.  He is different, so Kabasha can dare to say something, but others could not.  And he is directly insulting.  Kabasha goes directly, he doesn't beat around the bush; he doesn't need any protection.  Other people who are vulnerable move from one side or the other, but they won't go directly into depth.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, a person from PSD was more vulnerable than a person from MRND, then?  Is that one of the points here, or what is the point? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I want to say that the protection of an individual that he has within the community depends on the party he comes from.  The speech that you make, what you say depends on which party you belong to.  The PSD party had a reputation as being pro-RPF; everyone in that party without distinction.  So in some way they have a label attached to them.  Even in the language used, they're labelled as being pro-RPF.  They are not seen from a good aspect.  

So the attitudes that they have during meetings will be very different from the attitude of someone from the MRND, because the MRND member is already a principal player.  The others, the PSD, are more vulnerable, are very vulnerable.  They're in a very difficult situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did Leonard Hitimana belong to any party?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he was from the MDR.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I see.  Wouldn't a minister be less vulnerable than someone at a lower level?
THE WITNESS:
Absolutely, a minister is a minister, and an official is an official.  But the situation in Rwanda -- you see, if you come from family of the MRND, for example, a bourgmestre, a bourgmestre was very influential, more influential than the préfet simply because they were from the MRND.  They were too influential in the MRND, so that it may happen that as far as security is concerned -- so far as security is concerned, an assurance as such, a man from the MRND may be of a lower rank, but has more poise (sic) because of more influence, so that it didn't matter; once one was from the MRND, one had influence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did anything happen to the PSD after the 7th of April, 6th of April?
THE WITNESS:
Well, in Kibuye, perhaps in Kibuye, the PSD as such was not hunted down, but all its agents were suspected as they were seen with a jaundiced eye.  This is why I talked in the statement -- the intervention of certain people, so that all the people in the PSD were suspected.  If they are Tutsi, that is a different matter.  If they are Tutsi, it is even more serious.  But already being PSD is a problem.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At the central level, did anything happen to the PSD after the shooting down?  Did it change in any way?
THE WITNESS:
Well, what I know is that all the leadership of PSD was eliminated, was massacred after the shooting down of the plane, so that the whole leadership of the PSD, minister or not, all of the leadership without any distinction, saw the members of the party that were in Kigali were killed; others had to hide.  And I heard over the radio a communiqué calling upon the politburo to organise a political meeting in Gitarama.  I didn't respond to that invitation.  

This is all I could say.  That political meeting was to see how to replace people who were killed among the leadership of the party.  There was a communiqué over the radio; I didn't see it on paper.  That was Radio Rwanda.  

Mr. President, that is all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would it be correct to say that there was a split in the PSD at any point in time, factions? 
THE WITNESS:
To my knowledge, there was no split in the PSD.  What happened was that the head was cut off; the head was cut off indiscriminately.  And during that meeting, they tried to reconstitute and put all the pieces together, but the whole leadership of the party was massacred, the ministers, all of them.  

That's it, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's been argued in this case that, all right then, some were killed, but those that were not killed, where did they end up, then?  Could you remain neutral?  Could you remain opposed to the government policy?  Was it possible?
THE WITNESS:
Well, this is what I am trying to say.  To oppose openly the policy of the government, to advocate condemnation of the government, I do not think anybody would dare do that, no.   

Now, what I said was done was that each and every one in his or her own position with the means at his or her disposal tried to appease the situation, tried to discourage what was happening as initiatives, individual initiatives.  It was very dangerous though, but some of them did take such initiatives.  But to make an open speech and advocacy, no.  Which medium would one use, which means? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, one witness came in this case and said that Mr. Ndindabahizi did come to see you and you had a conversation, and one issue was about protecting Tutsi women; in other words, what about Tutsi women married to Hutus.  Now, that is an allegation or a testimony in this case.  Are you absolutely denying that there were ever any such meeting?
THE WITNESS:
First, I said that I did meet Ndindabahizi at a given period in time, but the issues we talked about were only two.  The problems I had, so far as the security, the massacres, insecurities, we did not talk about those problems, those issues.  

Now, as far as the Tutsi women were concerned, May and June that problem was out, the problem of Tutsi women.  And there we are talking about mixed marriages with Hutus, or Hutus married to Tutsi who were also hunted down.  You had Tutsi married to Hutu who were also hunted down with the purpose of exterminating them; that was done away with since April.  This was talked about on other occasions, but not with Ndindabahizi.  But I did touch upon that problem.  There was a problem that we had with them that we managed.  At a given time, we were able to find solutions, we were able to slow down or arrest the massacres, but I did not talk about these problems with Ndindabahizi.  This is a matter that should be looked at within the meetings; they should be put at April-May, I believe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a time when Tutsi women married to Hutu were spared; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Tutsi women married to Hutu?  In certain areas they were spared, but in other areas they were killed.  And indeed, campaigns of incitement were carried out for the purpose of getting all these people exterminated, that is Tutsi men married to Hutu; whole families, from Hutu (sic) women married to Hutu, they were spared at a certain time, but at other times it was a matter of exterminating all of them.  

So that was the problem we had in the commune.  In certain areas we were able to succeed; in other areas we were not successful, one could see Tutsi women being killed, their husbands became widowers, just as you saw Tutsi -- or Hutu women married to Tutsi, whose children were exterminated.  Efforts to appease the situation, appeasement measures were taken to safeguard, to protect some of them, but not in all areas; it depended on the area. 
(Pages 25 to 37 by Judith Baverstock)



































1645H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to indicate a time when there was a shift in the policy?  With other words, in a certain period, Tutsi women married to Hutu were spared, and then in another period, the policy changed.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, at the beginning, Tutsi were being attacked directly.  Now, when the major massacres were almost at an end, they went on to a further stage.  That was around the end of April, and at this stage that I could call "cleansing out", they pinpointed where people were hiding; houses, and individuals were targeted.  One would know, for example, that such-and-such an individual by name was not killed, so they were looking for them.  It was a manhunt.  In May, houses were searched and hiding places were also searched, and that went on and on until June, until their departure to Zaire.  Even in Zaire, I believe it continued.  So that that was around May.  It was probably in June that it slowed down because there was a refugee movement and people were mingled.  One couldn't carry out searching.  One couldn't carry out wholesale arrests, one couldn't block them.  So that it was May, June when it slowed down a little. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you give long answers, the point may get lost.  Let me ask you again.  Are you, then, or are you not able to draw a line between, on the one hand, a period where Tutsi women married to Hutu were generally spared and another period where this was not -- where they were not spared?  Are you able to draw such a line?  You could answer first yes or no; is it possible to draw such a line, approximately?
THE WITNESS:
That change took place in May.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When in May? 
THE WITNESS:
After the major massacres in April -- in May, they began to look for people individually, and families.  As far as dates are concerned here, it is pretty difficult, but I took up this issue on the 13th.  I put up an agenda to look into the questions of killing Tutsi women.  That is when I convened the meeting to look into that problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thirteenth of which month?
THE WITNESS:
May, sir,13th of May.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that was discussed at your initiative at a meeting? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And does this -- had the killing then started of the Tutsi women married to Hutu, on the 13th of May, when you took this up?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, some of them were killed.  And there were rumours that killings would go on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But can you assist us with this general change of policy.  Was it around the 13th, was it after the 13th or later in the month?  Are you able to assist us?  If not, you just say no.  Can you provide any further information?  It has become an issue. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know.  I do not know.  I really cannot pinpoint anything here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, thank you very much for your testimony, having come this long way to the Tribunal to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home and ask you not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much. 
  THE WITNESS:
      Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
(Witness excused)
  MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the registry assist the witness, and maybe we could start first with the next witness, even if we have a limited time. 

While the witness is being escorted or accompanied out, Mr. Besnier, one of your future witnesses is an expert witness?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have we been provided with a report of that witness, in writing?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  It is a document in the bound document, at the end of the introduction of the witness.  It is a report entitled "Report by Bernard Lugan".  It is a 20-page report.  It is in French.  We had sent it several weeks ago to the registrar for translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, of course, yes.  So there was no problem there in relation to deadlines and time limits.  That has been provided well in advance, yes.  So that's the one we have to read before the witness appears in the witness box.  Yes, I've seen it now.  Thank you. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I have a motion on behalf of the expert, or the witness who's going to come in.  He (sic) should like his entire testimony to be closed, that is, in closed session.  That is this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  That's agreeable.  We'll certainly follow that up.  

Now, good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness DA in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness DA in Kinyarwanda)
   MR. PRESIDENT:
      You have a document in front of you there, madam? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your signature at the bottom of that document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, that is my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, is it? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be Defence Exhibit 43, under seal.
 (Exhibit No. D. 43 admitted)
  MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we will start with your testimony now, Madam Witness, but we will not go on for a long time.  But we know you have been waiting out there, and we thought it might be smart to start, and then we will continue tomorrow morning (sic).  So you will first be asked questions by the Defence.  

The Defence has made an application for a closed session.  There are no objections?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There are, Your Honour.  We were not given the chance to make any representations on it.  We have objections.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I was actually looking at you to see whether you had any objections.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your eye, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  I'm looking at you now.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, I'm sorry.  Right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I'm asking you, Mr. Phillips, do you have any objections?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  The request seemed to be based on will and free will.  No particular indication has been shown to the Court why we need to hear this witness's testimony in camera.  At best, a close scrutiny of her anticipated evidence would indicate that, at best, she's giving fourth-hand information.  So what is the need to have her testimony in camera?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  Now, you need to come up with further reasons for this request, Defence.  Why do you want this witness to be heard in camera, please?  And we now have a summary of her anticipated evidence in front of us here, and what are the paragraphs that may cause problems here, please?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, it's her entire testimony.  Actually, I had given these explanations earlier on, but here we're talking about the very near, very intimate relative of the victim, which we talked about.  The family relationship between the witness and the victim comes to the crux of the testimony.  I'll have to question the witness about the manner in which she was informed about the events that affected the relative that I mentioned, and all parts of the testimony will affect people around the witness.  So that to allow the witness to testify without giving her the protection of sitting in camera would be tantamount to easy identification of the witness, because the fact that she is a very near relative that we will have to call by name, for very obvious reasons, and to make things clearer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we have the reasons in favour of the application.  

Do you have anything to add there Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The victim is known to the Court.  And the relationship between this witness and victim is spelt out here.  So what is the need, why is there a need to refer to either the victim or witness by name?  I still fail to see the reason.  We know who the victim is.  We know his identity, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems to me that the Defence point is that when we are describing the events and the victim, then it will easily be discovered who the victim was, even if it's not first-hand evidence, as you've 
suggested -- pointed to.  And in that way it will reveal the identity.  

Isn't that the point of the Defence?  Yes.  

So, of course, the Court always knows the identity of all witnesses.  So can I have your argument on that, your comment on that, please?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The events that happened in the location where they happened are not unique to this witness's -- not to draw a link, but are not limited to the victim.  Thousands of people were killed at that location.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Do you need to say more, Mr. Besnier?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  We're not talking about all events that took place in that location.  We're talking about a victim in particular.  We are talking about one witness in particular.  We are talking about close relationships between this victim and this witness.  The witness personally asked me to be allowed to testify in camera for reasons of security.  She personally fears that she might be recognised.  And I am also expressing the will of the witness to respectfully beg for a session in camera.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the Judges have deliberated, and we unanimously find that we will ground this application for the closed session.  Of course, it's the objective assessment of the Court that is decisive in the final instance, not the wish of the witness, but, having looked at the testimony and bearing in mind previous practice of this Trial Chamber, both for Defence and Prosecution witnesses, when the description of the events can easily narrow down the possible candidates for those that are giving testimony, we wish to be careful. So that is, then, the decision.  

Now, instead, then, of starting, instead of starting, I think we will simply break for now, and tomorrow morning we will start in closed session at two o'clock from scratch.  

So now we have dons the introductory, the formal parts of your testimony, Madam Witness, and tomorrow we will start in a closed session and hear you throughout.  So please do not discuss your testimony with anyone, and we will see you again tomorrow afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Court is adjourned until two o'clock. 
(Court adjourned at 1703H)
