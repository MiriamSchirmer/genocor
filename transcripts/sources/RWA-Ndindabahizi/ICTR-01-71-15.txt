MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  There was a slight delay because of some practical problems, but I understand that they have been sorted out. 

This is the opening of the Defence case.  Is there anything the Chamber should be apprised of?  I see that there are some documents in front of us.  Do you want to introduce them, Maître Besnier? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have transmitted to the Chamber a bound document which is the list of witnesses as well as their identifications -- with their identification forms and their written statements.  You'll also find in this bundle of documents a list of exhibits that we intend to put in to support the Accused's defence of alibi.  It also includes a copy of the statement of the expert witness that we intend to call at the end of our case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now, you have here on page 2 of this document -- I can see a priority list of 1 to 20.  Is that the order in which you intend to call these witnesses? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is the order in which we intend to call the witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will start with Witness DJ? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  If there is nothing else to be said from either side, could we then call Witness DJ, please? 

Do you intend to make an opening statement, Mr. Besnier, before we call Witness DJ? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I think I can make the opening statement before the witnesses are called.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Please go ahead. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, in April, May and June 1994, Rwanda was inhabited by demons.  This sentence is not from survivors or from history books; it was said at 25th October, last 25th October, by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when I visited him at the detention centre.  In April, May and June 1994, death lurked in the hills of Kibuye.  Yet all the Hutus did not become demons, even if all the Tutsis were potential victims.  Several Hutus themselves fell under the true barbarism, others did the best they could under the circumstances to save lives, to preserve their dignity or simply to protect their family. 

It is one of the tasks of the Defence before this Court to demonstrate that the Accused was one of those who went through hell without losing their dignity, those who faced up to their responsibilities, these civil servants who remained at their posts to ensure the survival of the state, without their work, meaning their support for killings, without their signature at the bottom of an administrative document, meaning their signing up to a crime. 

Defence is not obligated to supply evidence; in law, it should simply draw the attention of the Judges to the doubts which attend the demonstration of the Prosecutor, and we believe that at this very stage, the charges brought against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi are not solid and true.  But in the case at bar, the Defence will go beyond refuting the evidence of the Prosecutor. 

We on this side of the courtroom are not afraid to face up to the facts.  And let's keep to the facts.  It is a judicially -- judicially proven truth, since the judgement of this Tribunal on 21st May 1999, in the Kayishema case, that tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed in the Kibuye préfecture.  It is a fact, judicially proven, that a great number of them were collectively killed at the Gatwaro stadium on the 18th April 1994. It is also a fact, judicially proven, that several survivors took refuge in the Bisesero region and were massively exterminated, particularly on the 13th and 14th May 1994. 

The suspects of these killings were sought and arrested by the Rwandan authorities as well as the Prosecutor of the ICTR.  Some were sentenced.  The judicial records of these proceedings cover several thousands of pages, witnesses were heard for hundreds of hours, and in the ICTR, five judgments have been rendered, covering more than 800 detailed information on the Kibuye killings.  But is it not strange that the name of Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, never appeared in these proceedings, not in Rwanda and not in the ICTR? 

In the case that I referred to, more than 100 Prosecution witnesses were called, and they testified against a number of people, outside the Accused, but never this man.  Dozens of businessmen, bourgmestres, low-level civil servants, were accused and names were revealed, their roles were specified in the case of this event, and never was the name of the Minister of Finance mentioned. 

Is it not strange that while -- that according to the Prosecutor, his presence alone will amount to incitement to kill?  Is it not also -- does this not cast doubt on the fact that -- is there not doubt in the fact that this man was accused only seven years after the events, whereas he was regularly in contact, and for several years, with the investigators of the Prosecutor?  Is it not curious to see the Prosecutor, a few weeks before the trial, divest Ndindabahizi of his political position and to retain against him the simple crime of individual responsibility?  Is it not surprising that observers, experts, historians, specialists of genocide and human rights, never mentioned the name of Ndindabahizi, never write his name, whereas they do not -- they always mention individuals whose functions were less important than his?  Even Madam Alison Des Forges, who did not honestly answer the only question I put to her, never wrote the name of the Accused, never once, not even once, in her book, which is an authority,  "Leave None to Tell the Story." 

Are these not objective elements of doubt, even before we start examining the evidence of the Prosecutor, which we are going to be doing at another stage? 

In Rwanda, on the crime sites, names -- which the names are familiar to you -- Gasharu, Gitaka, Gitwa -- nobody accuses Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Preliminary reports on the massacres perpetrated in Kibuye, the first of which was published in 1996 by the Rwandan minister of higher education, does not mention his name anywhere, whereas dozens of suspects are mentioned.  On the hills, nobody does not take serious these charges brought against him, and I do not think that the witnesses or the Prosecutor themselves believe in that.  You don't have to limit yourselves to my assertions.  The witnesses, our witnesses, in the days ahead are going to be called before you. 

The first batch of them are mainly Tutsis, genocide survivors.  Their names or their parents' names are known to you.  They are sons and daughters of persons who have been assassinated and who Prosecution witnesses have already made mention to.  You will then be able to finally put faces to the victims.  Before you, and before the Accused, these people, whose families sometimes have been killed, will tell you what they think about the charges brought against Ndindabahizi. 

Other witnesses are well-placed to know the truth.  They themselves are the killers.  Most of them have pleaded guilty. 

I pray the Court to allow me to bring this evidence before you, because sometimes the recounting of these facts are difficult, but it is a necessary state to finding the truth. 

In April, May, June 1994, death was in the hills of Kibuye, and I did not see the face of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi there. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Besnier.  I have two questions for you in light of your opening statement.  The first question relates to the matter that none of the witnesses in previous cases have referred to Mr. Ndindabahizi.  That sentence, does that refer to the finding in the five judgments which you referred to, namely, the Kibuye judgements, or does that statement refer to their testimony also in the transcripts?  That's one question. 

And the second question was your reference to Alison Des Forges.  There you said that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi's name does not figure in her book.  Her answer was that it didn't figure in the registry, in the registry of the book, in the index, but that she wanted to reserve her position because there may be mistakes in the index.  So your statement, does that imply that you have checked the book itself and that you have not found any reference to Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  On the first issue, we have carefully examined judgements which have been rendered in the case of Kibuye and we realise that Ndindabahizi's name never appeared in these judgments.  We then looked at the transcripts, and witness statements.  I'm not asserting that we have absolutely checked all the transcripts of the testimony of witnesses.  We have gone through some of them and I believe that should account for about half of the testimony, and I'm sure the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein. 

Regarding the second question, Mr. President, we have also carefully examined the totality of 
Madam Alison Des Forges's book and not only the index, and I can assure you that the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein, not even when the expert is talking about the formation of the interim government. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Then I suppose this is the right moment to call the first witness.  Registry, could you please call Defence Witness DJ. 
MR. BESNIER:
Your Honour, so far as the judgement (sic) is concerned, there is something concerning Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence that I should like to mention.  As far as that witness is concerned, she will talk about things that occurred in a small cellule of the Kibuye préfecture.  It's a cellule where she always lived in, and she lives there still, and it's a location of crimes described in the indictment.  Now, the person we are referring to could be easily identified.  That person is one of the survivors, and there are not many survivors from that préfecture -- from that cellule, but I do remember that the Prosecutor, on the basis of these very same circumstances, had applied for a sitting in camera, which was granted.  I shall therefore question the witness concerning the location at which the witness was, and probably these questions may reveal the witness's identity, so that I will be compelled to apply for a sitting in camera for this particular witness as compared to the others.  We shall try to limit ourselves in time to ensure that the sitting in camera is done properly, but I would not be able to assure you that we will exhaust all the questions in this sitting in camera, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, your application for the closed session under Rule 79, does it apply to the entire testimony of the witness, because of the particular nature of the evidence, or are you only saying that you want to start in closed session? 
MR. BESNIER:
I shall try for as much as possible to limit the closed session.  I shall try to finish with the closed session and go on to more general questions, but I'm not quite sure this will be possible, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any problems, Prosecution? 

Could you indicate approximately for how long we would have to close this session so that the public could come back again at a certain time?  Approximately? 
MR. BESNIER:
Well, 45 minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that indication.  

Well, I must say then that we have to close this session in pursuance of Rule 79, but you have heard the indication of Mr. Besnier, and we will open as far as this will be possible in the interests of the witness.  So Registry, make sure that the public gallery is being closed.  Thank you very much. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 37] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 5 by Mark Porter)












1145H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Who informed you of the existence of a roadblock in Gasharu cellule?
A.	It was **********; in other words --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has mentioned the relationship between himself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please remember that we are in a closed session, so you never, for instance, mention names of your close relatives.  Now, please proceed.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	From your observation, Mr. Witness, what did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi do or say during his visit to that cellule?
A.	When he came into the cellule he made the killings to be stopped.  He asked the members of the population why they were killing people.  He even arrested one person, one man, and put him in detention.  And this person was put into detention because it had been said that that person had killed people; Ndindabahizi had been informed of that.  And from that day onward no one else was killed.
Q.	Do you, yourself, remember the date on which you left your hiding place?
A.	I was hiding in two different places.  I left the first hiding place in the beginning of June after Ndindabahizi's departure from the cellule, and I left the second hiding place on the 4th of July.
Q.	In the cellule you were living in, were there any other Tutsi survivors?
A.	Yes, there are.
Q.	Have you had discussions as genocide survivors regarding the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Yes, we speak a lot about these events.
Q.	From the end of the war did you ever hear the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi mixed with killings, or did you ever hear his name being mentioned as being a perpetrator of whatever crimes during the genocide?
A.	No.  Sometimes on the radio one hears that he is in prison, but we are saying that these allegations are false.  His name has never been involved with any responsibility whatsoever for crimes committed during the genocide.
Q.	(By order of the Court, this sentence has been struck from the record and filed under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
Je retire ma question.  Je retire ma question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That sentence will be deleted from the transcripts and from the court video system.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	What I meant to say, Mr. Witness, is that you are indeed a Tutsi, are you not?
A.	Yes, I am a Tutsi.
Q.	And your father was indeed killed during the genocide, was he not?
A.	Yes, he was.
Q.	Are there any reasons why you would wish to be testifying on behalf of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and not necessarily have anything to do with the respect for the truth?
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?
Q.	Would you have any personal reasons for defending Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, despite the fact that you are a Tutsi and that you were nonetheless a genocide survivor?
A.	Yes, I do have reasons, and the reason is that I am defending him because if he hadn't come to the cellule all the Tutsis who survived would not have remained alive.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have no further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, please.  Can you start in open for a while, Mr. Phillips?
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Is it your testimony, sir, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visited Gasharu cellule in the month of June 1994 and not before then in 1994?
A.	Actually, Ndindabahizi visited the cellule in the beginning of June.
Q.	Yes, that's what I thought you said.  How come is it then that the Tutsis alive owed their good fortune to him?  The last thing you said a few minutes ago was that he -- his intervention saved the lives of Tutsi.  Now, at the beginning of June, how many Tutsi who were alive were walking the streets of Gasharu?  Can you help me with that?
A.	After Ndindabahizi's departure, there were Tutsis who were still alive in Gasharu.
Q.	Yes, certainly.  And I'm sure those Tutsis were walking around, walking through roadblocks, were they not, Mr. Witness?
A.	No.  As for moving around, around roadblock (sic), nobody would go there, but in July all Tutsis could come out of their houses.
Q.	Yes.  And that's thanks to Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, as far as you are concerned?
A.	Yes, with regard to our cellule that is indeed my statement.
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, how old were you in 1994, in April 1994?
A.	I think I was 22 years old.
Q.	And you were certainly aware that Tutsis were being sought following the president's death in April 1994, are you not?
A.	Could you please repeat your question?
Q.	Will do.  Were you aware, Mr. Witness, that Tutsis were sought following the death of the president in Rwanda in 1994?  Were you aware of this fact?
A.	Yes, I knew.
Q.	Do you know why Tutsis were being sought at this time, Mr. Witness?
A.	Could you please repeat that question for me?
Q.	Do you have any idea, Mr. Witness, why those Tutsis were being sought in 1994?
A.	Tutsis were being pursued because there was a government which hated Tutsi, but all the government members were not harbouring the same hatred for Tutsi.
Q.	Was Ndindabahizi a member of that government, by any chance?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was he a member of that government from April 1994 until July 1994, to your knowledge?
A.	Yes, he was part of that government.
Q.	Did you have any discussion with him between April and July 1994 as to how he felt about Tutsis?
A.	No, I didn't converse with him on that subject.
Q.	So how are you able to tell us that he was not against Tutsis?
A.	Can you please repeat the question for me, because I think there is background noise which is prohibiting me from hearing you properly?  I am please requesting you to repeat your question for me.  I didn't quite understand you.
Q.	Can you hear me now?
MR. BESNIER:
We do indeed hear background noise which is very disturbing.  We cannot really hear the Prosecutor's questions.  Can the technician please come to our aid?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have that sorted out?  There was a little dash of noise also in the English for a moment.
THE WITNESS:
(Not interpreted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry.  Now, is everything more quiet now?  If we all hear, let's proceed.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, did you speak to Mr. Ndindabahizi between April and July 1994 about his feelings for Tutsis?
A.	As for any discussion whatsoever regarding ethnic groups, I do not believe that Ndindabahizi said at any moment whatsoever when he was sharing a glass with other people that he was against any such group or other.
Q.	You haven't answered my question.  I will ask you that question again: did you speak with Mr. Ndindabahizi about his feelings for Tutsis between April and July 1994; a simple yes or no?
A.	I did not discuss that matter with him.
Q.	Were you, yourself, a member of the cabinet of the government of Rwanda between April and July 1994?
A.	I cannot clearly understand your question.  Can you repeat it?
Q.	Did you work for the government, yourself, between April and July 1994?
A.	No, I was not a leader.
Q.	Did you attend any cabinet meetings between April and July 1994, Mr. Witness?
A.	No.
Q.	You described that government that was in power between April and July 1994 as a government that hated Tutsi and that not everybody in that government hated Tutsi.  How are you able to come to that conclusion?
A.	No.  What you are saying is not true.  I am not the one who said that.  I said that government existed, and I added that not all members of that government had evil intentions towards the Tutsis.
Q.	Wasn't it your testimony in this courtroom only two minutes ago that that government hated Tutsis; yes or no?
A.	Up until this minute that I'm speaking to you, I am confirming that not all members of that government hated Tutsis.
Q.	And you were able to come to that conclusion because you, yourself, in fact, were a member of that government, were you not?  You sat down through their meetings, deliberated with them, therefore, you are able to come to that conclusion, Mr. Witness.  Is that not your testimony?
A.	Relying on what Ndindabahizi said when he came into our cellule, I'm able to assert that all members of the then government were not against the Tutsi because when he came into the cellule he asked them to stop the killings.
Q.	You have only come here to tell us a pack of lies this morning, have you not, Mr. Witness?  You were not at that meeting were you?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which meeting?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The meeting he has just referred to.  He referred to the meeting, himself, and he knows the meeting he is talking about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we in June now?

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no idea.  I am about to find out, Your Honour, if he would answer my question in due course.
THE WITNESS:
I have not lied.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Right.  Now, you said that, based on what he said when he came to Gasharu, you came to the conclusion that he was not against Tutsi.  Is that not what you mean?
A.	Yes.
Q.	All right.  So there was only one meeting, according to you.  Your testimony is that you only saw him once there.  Is that not your testimony; you only came there once in June, in the beginning of June 1994?
A.	Yes, that is my testimony.
Q.	Good.
A.	And he organised a meeting to stop the killings, but not to encourage them.
Q.	Right.  And you attended that meeting from your position in **************************, several metres away, Mr. Witness?
A.	Those who attended that meeting can testify to it, but I did not attend that meeting because I was in hiding.
Q.	So, if you did not attend the meeting, how can you testify as to what was said at the meeting?  Can you help me with that?
A.	Let me try to explain to you: those who attended the meeting -- among those who attended the meeting there was a brother of Ndindabahizi, *****************************************what was said at the meeting and when he was telling me this, Ndindabahizi was with him.  Ndindabahizi *********  ******* and then -- and said that from that day on no one was to kill the Tutsi.  And it was his sister who was telling me what Ndindabahizi told her.
Q.	I understand that, Mr. Witness.  So why isn't that brother of his sitting in the box where you are now, telling us about what he heard his brother saying?  Why are we having to rely on your evidence?  Can you help me with that?
A.	I don't seem to understand you.  Can you repeat your question?
Q.	You said that you based your information on what you were told by Ndindabahizi's brother after the meeting.  Do you understand me thus far?
A.	Yes, I understand.  Ndindabahizi himself *************************************************************that no one should kill the Tutsi, once again, and that, "I do not want people to continue killing the Tutsi".  My impression -- I did not understand the last part of your question.  If you want to repeat that.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you understood every question put to you by my learned colleague for the Defence, did you not?
A.	Yes, I understand your questions, but I just want you to repeat this last one.
Q.	Yes, so that you can think about the answer in your head before you speak it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the question?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm still waiting for an answer to my question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I want the answer -- I want your question again, Mr. Phillips, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you, or were you not, at the meeting that Ndindabahizi addressed in June 1994?
A.	I was not at that meeting and the reason for which I did not attend that meeting was that I was in hiding.  I also told you that the brother of Ndindabahizi attended that meeting and that in the company of Ndindabahizi ****************************************.  Ndindabahizi spoke to the sister, telling her that from that moment on no one was going to kill Tutsi anymore.
Q.	Yeah, right.  And this was in June 1994, was it not?  Just yes or no would do.
A.	That is correct; at the beginning of June.
Q.	It is your testimony that all the Tutsi who survived in Gasharu thereafter owed their survival to this man, Mr. Ndindabahizi, is it not, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, that is my testimony.
Q.	Good.  Now, how many witnesses for the Defence have you met or do you know personally, Mr. Witness?
A.	I did not understand your question.  Are you talking about Defence witnesses, and for which Defence?
Q.	There is only one Defence in this courtroom, and you know it, Mr. Witness.  How many Defence witnesses do you know?
A.	I believe I met seven of them.
Q.	It's a substantial amount of witnesses.  Do you know how many witnesses are in this case, in total?
A.	I cannot know the number of witnesses.
Q.	Isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that there are indeed seven witnesses from the location where you hail from in this Defence case; there are actually seven of you from that location?  I don't want to mention the location, but I am trusting that you understand what I'm talking about; the cellule.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that you had a hand in inviting those seven persons, or six persons including yourself, to be witnesses in this case?
A.	No, I'm not the one who looked for these witnesses.  However, let me give you this explanation: in the search for the witnesses that you are referring to, I saw some white people come who were investigating into the Ndindabahizi case.  They asked me if I knew Ndindabahizi.  I said yes.  I told them how I knew him and they asked me if there were other people who could say the same thing that I was saying and I said, yes, there were people in my cellule who would be able to say the same thing.
Q.	And do you know if any of those seven persons that come from your cellule have any prior relationship with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, relationship either by blood or by marriage?  Do you have any idea if any of those seven individuals had a relationship with him?
A.	*********************************************************************************people have the relationship with Ndindabahizi.  Now regarding the others, out of the seven, they don't have any relationship with Ndindabahizi.
Q.	That's your evidence, Mr. Witness, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now let's go to your location during the events of 1994, April 1994.  It's your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you were **************************.  Is that not so?
A.	(By order of the Court, this answer has been struck from the record and filed under seal)
Q.	That's good enough.
A.	I don't know if you understood my answer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the information we didn't want.  So, Mr. Witness, the reason why the Prosecutor formulated his question in that way was to say it in an indirect way in order not to contribute to any element of information which may reveal your identity.  So please be cautious.  The answer to that question should simply have been yes.  Now, that answer by the witness will be placed under seal and the court video system will kindly strike the answer.

Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And is it also your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you remained at that location until sometime in June 1994?
A.	I remained in that house.  In fact, I told you that, first, I was hiding in the ceiling, and when the situation became worse I came out and I was hidden under sorghum stems in the compound, and I only came out of this hiding place when Ndindabahizi reassured the people, and then I went back to the house and I only came out of that house in July, more specifically 4th July, and that was when I started moving about in the neighbourhood.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, do you remember where Cyprien Karegeya was killed, according to your information?
A.	He apparently was killed in the centre of Gitaka, according to the information I got.
Q.	And, roughly, how far away was that location from where you were located, in distance now?  Don't mention names, just the distance.
A.	Approximately one kilometre from the centre to where I was; the distance was about one kilometre.
Q.	So you are one kilometre away from the alleged crime scene, hiding in a ceiling or under sorghum grass or whatever you call it, and you, to the best of your knowledge, believed that everything that you were told about the death of Karegeya was true and reliable enough for you to repeat it here.  Do you think so?
A.	That is true and I'm ready to swear on that.
Q.	Let's talk about Mukantabana.  Do you know where she was killed?
A.	I also learnt that he was allegedly killed at the Gitaka centre.
Q.	Again, a kilometre away from where you were located, was it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, in your statement you describe that you were an eyewitness to Higiro's death, Simon.  Do you recall saying that in your statement, or was that a mistake?
A.	Let me give you an explanation.  I told you that I saw -- I saw, myself, Simon when the killers were taking him away.  They passed ***********************************.  He was being led to his death.  I see him pass, but I did not say that I witnessed his killing, his execution.
Q.	Were you expecting this procession to pass by where you were, or was this just an accident, you seeing this procession go past?
A.	It was just incidental that I saw the killers led Simon by.
Q.	And you saw this whilst you were covered with dry grass or whilst you were in the ceiling?  In which location were you at this time?
A.	Let me explain to you: when Simon was being led to his death, they had not yet started killing the Tutsis.  In fact, it was the day he was led to his death that they started killing the Tutsis and it was from ****************that I saw Simon passing by with the killers.
Q.	Yes.  But you still haven't told me where *************************you were.  Were you in the ceiling at the time, or standing at the window, or covered by grass?
A.	Let me continue explaining to you.  And I'm saying that I saw him pass by together with the killers, and the day he was being led to his death, the Tutsis were not yet threatened.  It was from that day that they started killing the Tutsi.  It is to tell you that all the Tutsis were not hiding at that time.  I was, therefore, (By order of the Court, these words have been struck from the record and filed under seal) when the killers passed by with Simon.
Q.	Was Simon a Tutsi or a Hutu?
A.	Simon was a Tutsi.
Q.	So why was he being led to his death if Tutsis were not being sought at that time?
A.	I told you that it was on that day that the killing of Tutsis started.  This was about three days after the death of Habyarimana.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The reference to the house, this precise location where the witness observed this, will be deleted both from the transcripts, where it will be placed unseal, and from the court video system.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that the information you gave us as to those who were responsible for Karegeya's death and that of Mukantabana were things that were told to you, the people who were responsible for their death?  You didn't see that; it's just things that were told to you, was it not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Also, you were not present when Ndindabahizi visited Gasharu cellule and, again, his visit was reported to you, was it not?
A.	I told you that I was in the cellule and it is in that cellule *****************is located.
Q.	That's correct.  Sorry; you were not at the meeting that he held with other people from the cellule.  That's what I meant.  Is that correct?
A.	It is correct.  I did not attend the meeting.  But I told you that it was not a meeting to incite killings; it was, rather, intended to stop the killings.  That is one point that you need to understand.
Q.	I certainly, do, Mr. Witness.  Now, how much of the evidence that was adduced in the Prosecution's case were you aware of before you became a witness for the Defence?
A.	I don't clearly understand your question.  Can you please repeat it?
Q.	How much of the evidence of Prosecution witnesses had you become aware of before you travelled to Arusha; in other words, the evidence against Ndindabahizi, how much of it were you aware of before you came here to Arusha?
A.	I have no idea.  I don't know about that.
Q.	When my learned friend for the Defence asked you to mention those Tutsis who had been victims of the attacks in Gasharu cellule, was it then a coincidence that you mentioned only the names of victims that have been mentioned already before this Court?  What do you say about that, Mr. Witness?
A.	Your question is very long.  Can you reformulate it more concisely?  Your question is too long.  Is there no way of shortening that question?
Q.	There certainly is.  Now, when the lawyer for Ndindabahizi asked you about the names of the victims, people who had been killed in Gasharu cellule, you only mentioned the names of Karegeya, Mukantabana and other people who had already been mentioned in this case.  How did you know that those were the names to mention?  Is it a coincidence that you just happened to mention the same names?
A.	If I mentioned the names of these people, it's because these were people I knew and whose names I remember.  You will understand that this happened nine years ago and that -- it would be difficult for me to recall the names of other victims.
(Pages 38 to 46 by Verna Butler)



1230H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	When you were asked to mention the names of those who were responsible for their death, is it also a coincidence that you only mentioned names of assailants who had been mentioned already in this case, or are these just the names that you remembered from your hiding place at the time? 
A.	If I mentioned names of other people mentioned, this will not mean that these were names of attackers; there were many attackers and it would not be easy to mention all their names. 
Q.	You were not an eyewitness to any of the attacks, how come then that you were able to recollect the names of not only the victims but indeed the assailants, Mr. Witness? 
A.	That is due to the fact that when we are in our various cellules, we talk.  We talk about names of persons that killed other people during the events and names of victims for the purpose of reassuring ourselves as to what -- as to whether what we say about the responsibilities of such and such a leader is true or not, because some of the attackers are now in prison or at the time were in prison.  So we try to refresh our memories as to what we say about the attackers, and some of the attackers are in prison and they are said to be guilty. 
Q.	Have you testified against any of the attackers that you mentioned in this courtroom this morning?  Have you ever been to any of their trials and testified against them for the bad things they did at Gasharu; if so, which ones and when? 
A.	Personally, I was a prosecutor's witness for ********************* but that trial had not yet started; the other two Accused pleaded guilty.
Q.	So you say you were Prosecution witness for ***************; is that what you say, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, sir, that is correct. 
Q.	How did you go about being a Prosecution witness when you just told us that you were not an eyewitness to any of these activities?  Can you help me with that?
A.	I do not get the question clearly.  Could you kindly repeat?
Q.	How can you be a witness against *********** at his trial, if you were not an eyewitness to any of the crimes that he committed? 
A.	Now, I am in a position of accusing him because he came to seek me and ****************, and on that day, *********************************. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified that before the events of 1994, Ndindabahizi often visited your location, your location in --
A.	I didn't say that.  I didn't say that he came often.  I said that he did not come often.  I said that he came approximately once a year.  I did not say what you just said. 
Q.	That is precisely my point.  Now in your --
A.	No, sir.  He said that he came often, that was not what I said. 
Q.	In your witness statement, you described knowing him from childhood and state that he came back frequently to greet his family and then you go on and on and describe your relationship with him.  How do you explain that in your witness statement; it is no longer frequently now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which line is this?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have a --
THE WITNESS:
Well, I said that he came frequently but not every year.  The frequency was not the same every year.  On that particular year, he did not come frequently, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Second page, I can see now.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have a different statement in English, there has been a re-text --
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for answering my question.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Any redirect?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, questions, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, you came from your country to Arusha.  Were you alone or were you with other countrymen or women on your journey to this place?
A.	I came with other people. 
Q.	Are you in Arusha guesthouse or a house in Arusha; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct, sir.
Q.	And also those people are housed in the same house.  Are they in the same house, they live in the same house? 
A.	Yes, we stay at the same house. 
Q.	And how many other people are there with you in that house? 
A.	We are eight in that house. 
Q.	Is that the right reason that when the Prosecutor asked you whether you had met other Defence witnesses, you said that you had met seven other people? 
A.	No, it is not that reason, sir.  I didn't get the question very clearly.
Q.	Earlier on, I asked you whether you had met other witnesses for the Defence, and I wanted to know whether you had answered that question because you thought that you met them here in Arusha or probably you may have met them in Rwanda.
A.	Well, we met in Arusha, sir. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
No other questions, Mr. President. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a few questions for you, Mr. Witness.  

What was the relationship -- was there any relationship between the Accused and Karegeya, the father of the ****************?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there was a relationship, a relative. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
How were they related?
THE WITNESS:
They were cousins, madam.
JUDGE BOSSA:
And to what ethnic group did he belong, Karegeya?
THE WITNESS:
Karegeya was Tutsi, madam.
JUDGE BOSSA:
But he was a cousin of the Accused?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have another question.  You stated that you had two hiding places, in the ceiling and in the garden, and that you left one, the first one in June after Accused's visit and the second in July, is that what you said?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam, on the 4th of July.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And when did Accused *********? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand that question clearly.

JUDGE BOSSA:
Did he come at the beginning, middle or end of June, to your place? 
THE WITNESS:
He came at the beginning of June. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And, so that brings me to my next question.  If he stopped the killings as you allege, why did you remain in hiding until the beginning of July? 
THE WITNESS:
After his departure, I left my first hiding place and I went to the house, and nobody came into the house to look for anybody after that.  He had already made the statement and after his departure, we couldn't have been absolutely sure that we were safe.  We could not therefore go out, but what is certain is that after his departure, nobody went around seeking people out in houses any more. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
And initially, you stated that you hid in the ceiling, then you left and went out in the garden.  Now, you are adding that you returned to the house in the ceiling again, or generally in the house.
THE WITNESS:
Well, let me explain.  I didn't go hiding in the ceiling; I was in the house.  I could move around the house but I did not go out of the house.  I went out of the house and remained in the compound.  I remained in the compound.  I never went outside the compound, and after that, I no longer hid in the ceiling as was the case before. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, would it be correct to believe that you survived because *********************** the Accused? 
THE WITNESS:
That is not the reason why I survived.
JUDGE KHAN:
You were **************?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
JUDGE KHAN:
So it means that **************?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, madam. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Were there ****************? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam, some of them, for example, Karegeya's child. 
JUDGE KHAN:
****************; why was he not protected? 
THE WITNESS:
Karegeya had gone to seek refuge in other families, but ********************************************
***************.
JUDGE KHAN:
Who told you about the killing of Karegeya?  How did you come to know about the killing of Karegeya? 
THE WITNESS:
I heard it through ************. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Had she herself seen the killing? 
THE WITNESS:
From her house, you can see the *********** and the killers took us to the centre of Gita
************* never went too far away from her house, but from her house, you could very well see what was happening at the ******************* was killed.
JUDGE KHAN:
You were, I think, in **********.
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that *****************
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is talking about relationships. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this has happened three times.  Isn't it possible to avoid this?  

Now, Mr. Witness, please do not mention where you were hiding in terms of ********* because that could reveal your identity.

Now, could video system -- all the references to the house in which the witness hid will be deleted, same with the Court video system.  Next question, please?  
JUDGE KHAN:
From the house where you were hiding, you could not see the *********? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to me personally?  No.  Personally, I was not an eyewitness of the killing of ********************
JUDGE KHAN:
From the same *********************************************************.  How come that you could not witness the killing? 
THE WITNESS:
**************************************.  You see, I was hiding, I couldn't have seen anything.  I didn't want to show myself. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you mention the name Nkurunziza earlier today?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you mention his name, what was his significance? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I talked about him because I knew him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What happened to him? 
THE WITNESS:
He was also killed during the war, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, did you mention any other names of persons that were killed?  And now we will not talk about Karegeya.  We will not talk about Tatiane, and we will not talk about Simone Higiro.  Did you mention any other persons that were killed when you were asked about victims earlier today? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I gave other names. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat those names, please?  Would you repeat those names, please, in case there was a lack of clarity?
THE WITNESS:
Karegeya.  Mr. President, do you want other names that I did not mention?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, only the names that you mentioned in view of the examination so far.  So you have now mentioned Karegira, Nkurunzira.  Did you mention everyone else today?
THE WITNESS:
Karegeya, Mutemberezi, Nkurunziza, Karegira and Habimana, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So what was Habimana?
THE WITNESS:
Do you want to know his ethnic group, sir? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Habimana?
THE WITNESS:
Habimana was one of our neighbours and he was Tutsi, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was Nkurunziza?
THE WITNESS:
Nkurunziza was also a neighbour, a Tutsi, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you mention the name Mutemberezi?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I talked about Mutemberezi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was he?
THE WITNESS:
He was also a Tutsi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  Thank you very much for having come to Arusha and testify.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  

We may well now have the lunch break.  

The next witness then, Defence pseudonym is?
MR. BESNIER:
The next witness will be DH, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said DH, didn't you?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not sure that we have received the DH documentation so far.  We have some intimation from another witness including DU, but we were -- we will then need DH. I have DG and DU.
MR. BESNIER:
In the document we submitted to the Tribunal, isn't it in that stapled document?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, it is in the main document, like all your other documents, we have it in the main document.  But since your technique so far has been in addition to this binded folder also to provide us with a separate document for exhibiting purposes.  I just draw your attention to that kind of documentation concerning the next witness, we have not received.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I understand.  We tried to situate that the witnesses for this morning, their documents be submitted to you.  That is what we tried to do.  And for this afternoon, the document will also be sent to you before the beginning of the afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable.  So why I am raising this is that in front of us, we have DU and another one which does --  and these two do not form part of this morning's session, and that is why we just draw your attention to the fact that we got, of course, the two documents for this morning session, but we did not -- but in addition, we got something which could appear to be for this afternoon session.  But now, we know that it is DH which is the next one and that is the one we need at 2:30.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Mr. President, what happened was, there was a mistake on the part of witness protection or probably it's on my part.  Witness DU was confused with DJ.  The letter was not clear, this is why there was this confusion error and I should like to apologise for it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The matter is simply to avoid confusion, but we will resume at 2:30.  
So the Court is adjourned until 230. 
(Court recessed from 1255H to 1434H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you are a protected witness and you will be referred to with a pseudonym Witness DH in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now make the necessary arrangements to that effect. 

MR. MUSSA:
Would you please stand up, raise your right-hand and say after me.
(Declaration made by Witness DH in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Witness, we are now in an open session, and that implies that you have to be a bit careful when you respond to questions.  So please do not reveal your identity when questions are being posed which may imply particulars relating to your identity.  Do you have a document in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature at the bottom of the document? 
THE WITNESS:
It is indeed my signature. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence D20, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 20 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, please. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have to request a motion under Rule 79(D) because we are going to have to question the witness closely on his identity.  So we are requesting for a closed session for the next ten minutes of our session this afternoon, by your leave.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are simply asking for about ten minutes. 
Any problems with that, Prosecution?  No.

And we have to grant that motion, but the public will note then that in about ten minutes we will revert to the open session.  And the purpose of this closed session is simply to protect the identity of this witness.  Thank you very much.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 56 to 58] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 47 to 55 by Sithembiso Moyo)


MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session and you must be careful, and do not mention the two persons' names, just refer to the hiding places as we just did.  

Please proceed. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, who took you away from hiding place No. 1? 
A.	My father. 
Q.	Why did he take you to that place, specifically? 
A.	He was a family friend. 
Q.	And you stated that you remained there for two weeks in that hiding place?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Apart from yourself, were other Tutsi refugees hiding in this hiding place No. 1?
A.	Yes, they were.
Q.	How many others? 
A.	Two. 
Q.	Could you tell us the names of the people who were hiding together with you in hiding place No. 1?
A.	There was Mukantabana and her daughter.
Q.	What was Mukantabana's first name? 
A.	I do not remember.  Yes, it was Tatiane.  Yes, Tatiane was the name.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, I am requesting the witness to move closer to the microphone, because I cannot hear him properly.  Thank you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You stated that you remained for two weeks in your hiding places No. 1, why did you have to leave it?
A.	It is because people had just discovered that hiding place. 
Q.	After hiding at hiding place No. 1, did you go immediately to hiding place No. 2?
A.	Yes, that is where I went. 
Q.	Did someone accompany you there or did you go there alone? 
A.	I left together with the members of that family who accompanied me there.
Q.	The Tatiane we referred to, did she also accompany you to hiding place No. 2?
A.	No, I left her in the first hiding place.
Q.	Do you know the ***************?
A.	Yes, I knew the man. 
Q.	Had you known the person for a long time? 
A.	No.
Q.	Was he living in that house in 1994? 
A.	No, ************* 
Q.	Did that person go frequently to that house or to the cellule in which that house was located? 
A.	He would come there about twice a year. 
Q.	That owner whom we are referring to, was he present when ***************? 
A.	He was not there.
Q.	Who was present in that house? 
A.	I think***************. 
Q.	Apart from ****, did you notice anyone else being there when you *******? 
A.	I only found ********there who was also hiding. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, not verbally but in writing, can you also tell us the names of the other persons that you had been hiding with?
A.	Yes, I will do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ask Mr. Witness to write this on a piece of paper.
THE WITNESS:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if you are about to mention two persons, please use numbers.  If you are about to write more than one name, please call it No. 1 and No. 2.  If there is only one name you don't have to use the numbers.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Registrar, can you show the document to the Bench and to the Prosecution?  Could this be admitted as Defence exhibit, Mr. President, Your Honours?
MR. PRESIDENT:
D21 so admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 21 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have written two names on this piece of paper.  The first name that you wrote, does that belong to *******************?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was the second person whose name you have written down doing in that hiding place? 
A.	That person was living with the family, but at that point in time, the person was hiding and was remaining in his or her hiding place. 
Q.	This person you have mentioned as No. 2, was that person hiding in the same hiding place as yourself or somewhere else? 
A.	We were not hiding in the same hiding place; we were not side by side, but we were within the same compound. 
Q.	For how long did you remain at this hiding place, if you can recall? 
A.	I think that I stayed there for a month or for a month and a half.
Q.	Did you know, Mr. Witness, that this house that you were hiding in belonged to a person who was having a high position and that he was Hutu?
A.	Yes, I knew that. 
Q.	Did that not make you feel afraid? 
A.	No, I wasn't afraid.  And I was saying to myself that nothing could ever happen to me.  He couldn't do anything to me. 
Q.	Why did you believe that he couldn't do anything to you? 
A.	It is because this person had very good relationships with my parents; they were friends, so I understood therefrom (sic) that he couldn't do me any harm. 
Q.	Isn't it correct, Mr. Witness, that during the genocide some friends turned against their friends and against people who were close to them, that people even killed their friends? 
A.	That is indeed true, that did happen but I didn't think that could happen to me, and I didn't think it could happen to me because these people welcomed me. 
Q.	During your stay at hiding place No. 2, was that house ever searched? 
A.	The house was searched.
Q.	Do you know by whom? 
A.	It was people whom I wasn't able to know.  I didn't know their names; there were people who were moving around and they were scattered over the hill, I wasn't able to see them, I didn't even -- I didn't know them.  I heard them shouting and making a lot of noise. 
Q.	How is it that these people did not find  you, they did not discover you? 
A.	These people were unable to see me because I was hiding, it is quite simple. 
Q.	Very well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let's now go back a little.  Do you know how your father was killed. 
A.	I was not a witness of his death.  I was only told about the circumstances that led to his death. 
Q.	And what were you told about those circumstances? 
A.	I was told that he was arrested, that he was taken away and that he was killed.  I was told, "Your father was killed", that is all.  I was told, "Your father was killed". 
Q.	Do you know of any eyewitnesses to your father's death? 
A.	I came to know one person, Karara, who was quite close to the place.  I think that he saw the people who took my father away, maybe he would be aware of the circumstances that brought about his execution or his death, but I am unable to tell you anything. 
Q.	In this Chamber, we know of two Kararas.  Now the Karara you are referring to, would that be the former bourgmestre?
A.	No.
Q.	That is quite adequate.  Do you have any information about the place where your father was killed?  Was it within the same cellule, the one in which is located hiding place No. 2? 
A.	Yes, it was in that cellule that he was killed. 
Q.	Would you have had any information on the identity of those who killed your father? 
A.	I was able to know the persons who were in the group of attackers, especially Everiste Baphakurera.  Baphakurera is spelt B-A-P-H-A-K-U-R-E-R-A, Baphakurera.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether someone by the name Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to that cellule that we have been referring to between the beginning of April 1994 and the end of June 1994? 
A.	He came to Gasharu cellule at the very beginning of June, the first days of June he came to Gasharu. 
Q.	Were you an eyewitness to his visit? 
A.	I did not see him; I heard people talk about it. 
Q.	Who told you?  Is it one of the -- if it is one of the persons whose name you have written on a piece of paper, you can say so.  If it is another person, then you can give us his name directly? 
A.	He is the first name on the paper who gave me the information. 
Q.	And this person who gave you the information, did he tell you what Emmanuel Ndindabahizi might have done or said during that visit? 
A.	That person told us that Ndindabahizi told him that, "There are children hiding here.  Can I ask them to come out before the end of the war"?  And he said, "Wait".  But after his departure, we came out but we stayed within the compound, we did not go out. 
Q.	Let's take it one at a time.  Witness, do you have any reason to think that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew that you were hiding there and knew where you were hiding? 
A.	Yes, he knew because that person mentioned it to him and Ndindabahizi asked for explanations. 
Q.	Do you have reason to believe that Mr. Ndindabahizi approved the fact that you were hiding in that hiding place? 
A.	Yes, I believe he accepted it because I didn't have any problem later on, not even after his departure. 
Q.	Do you have reason to believe that you were hiding in this second hiding place, hiding place No. 2, with the agreement of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, he had accepted it.  If he did not, we would have come out of our hiding place. 
Q.	Witness, do you know, to your knowledge, or based on discussion you had with other people, if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to this cellule on other occasions in April or May 1994? 
A.	No, after June he did not come back. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
A question was before, Mr. Witness.  Do you know whether he was there before June in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  No, he did not come. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	When were you able to leave your hiding place? 
A.	It was around the 4th or 5th of July that I was able to come and wander about outside.
Q.	Were you able to walk around outside the house, but you were not able to -- did you come out directly from your hiding place and went outside? 
A.	On the dates that I gave earlier in July, I wasn't going too far.  I was not -- I could walk about within the premises but on the dates that I gave, I would walk about even outside the compound. 
Q.	When you were in this house, you said you were in a hiding place, what was this hiding place? 
A.	I began by hiding inside the house.  It was after his departure that we came out and went into the house, and at the beginning of the month of July around the 4th or 5th, we were able to come out of the compound because the war was over and we were able to walk about outside. 
Q.	Very well.  I wanted to know what was the hiding place in the house, for example, when people came to search, were you in the house or did you have a corner, a particular place where you could hide? 
A.	No, I was not in the house.  I was not in the room, I was in the house.  But if I say it, people might be able to know.  I could put it on a piece of paper, Counsel, if you so wish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, were you inside the house or outside the house, just tell us that first?
THE WITNESS:
I was hiding outside the building not inside the building but within the compound. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now you want to give us further particulars by writing the exact place on a piece of paper; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I want to do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now have that document translated from Kinyarwanda.  Could we have that from the booth, English and French, please.  

While that is being done, Mr. Witness, when was **********killed, please? 
THE WITNESS:
****was killed downhill from the bar which is located near ************
MR. PRESIDENT:
When, can you tell us the month? 
THE WITNESS:
He was killed during the last few days of the month of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any questions while this document is being translated? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, do you know when Tatiane Mukatabana died? 
A.	She died on the same day. 
Q.	Do you know who killed her? 
A.	I was not an eyewitness to her killing but I heard it was one Rukundakuvuga who killed her. 
Q.	And **************, who killed him? I have already put this question to you, but can you repeat the answer? 
A.	It was Everiste Baphakurera. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Now let's come back to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Do you know or did you hear what Emmanuel Ndindabahizi did or say during his stay in the cellule that we referred to? 
A.	From what I was told when he got to Gitaga, he asked the people who decimated members of his family.  Some people ran, but from that day, nobody died and the attackers no longer searched houses of people. 
Q.	Would it not be possible, Witness, that on the contrary, Mr. Ndindabahizi went to that cellule to incite people to kill? 
A.	No, that is not possible; that was not his purpose for coming there, otherwise he would have come to that cellule much earlier than that date. 
Q.	Would it not be possible that he came to the cellule earlier without you knowing? 
A.	That is not possible.  If he had come to that cellule he wouldn't have left before -- without saying hello to his sister and his sister would have been aware. 
Q.	Now, Witness, let's come back to the owner of a hiding place No.2 that we referred to.  Does that person have any blood relations with your father? 
A.	Yes, there is family relationship between that person and my father. 
Q.	And what is the nature of this relationship? 
A.	Counsel, but if I answer your question, it would disclose my identity. 
Q.	Are you able to write the nature of the relationship between your father and the owner of the house on the paper?  We do not want you to mention the name of the owner of that house, but if that can reassure you, write the nature of the relationship between that person and your father on the paper.
A.	I will write it.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Meanwhile, Mr. Witness, have you finished writing on the other piece of paper you have in front of you there?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have finished, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have any other questions?  In the meantime, I think you have to do that.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, when the war ended, did you still remain with the **************?
A.	Yes, I stayed there at the end of the war.
Q.	For how long did you stay there at the end of the war with that man?
A.	Since July l994 up *****************. 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I can see on this paper the description of the witness's hiding place in house No. 2.  And we would like to enter this document as Defence exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No. 22, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 22 admitted, under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
I have still not seen the description of the relationship between -- between the owner of the house and the father.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The document is ready in the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, it's very clear.  I can see that on this paper.  There's a relationship between these two people and I would like to enter this document as Defence exhibit.

MR. PRESIDENT:
No. 23 admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 23 admitted, under seal)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER: 
Q.	I have three more questions for you, Mr. Witness.  Witness, did the investigators of the Prosecutor contact you after the genocide to find out from you the conditions under which *********?
A.	Yes, they contacted me.
Q.	And did you tell them the same thing as what you said before this court?
A.	Yes, that is what I told them.
Q.	Have you ever been called as a Prosecution witness in any trial in Rwanda?
A.	Yes, on one occasion I was called to testify against someone.
Q.	And that occasion you are referring to, did it have anything to do with the ***********?
A.	Yes.  Questions were put to us on the *********, and on that occasion we went to Kibuye.
Q.	In that case in Rwanda, the case you are referring to, did the name of Ndindabahizi come up?
A.	No, the name of Ndindabahizi was not mentioned during that trial.
Q.	Witness, you are a Tutsi, aren't you?
A.	Yes, I am.
Q.	Do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi here present is accused of having very important share of the responsibility in the **************?  Are you aware of this?
A.	That is not true.  I cannot come to testify in favour of somebody who ******************.  It is obvious -- it's not possible that anyone would testify in favour of the person who murdered ******.  It's not possible.
Q.	Would it not be possible, Witness, that the Accused did this without your knowledge by inciting other people to do this without you knowing?
A.	I would have known in any event, because Ndindabahizi has good relations with people and I would have known anyhow.
Q.	Look me in the eyes, Witness, are you sure that Ndindabahizi had no hand in the **************** of ************?  Have you conducted your investigations, and you can say with a clear conscience that you know Ndindabahizi had no hand in ******************?
A.	Yes, absolutely.  What I have said is the truth, Ndindabahizi played no role whatsoever in the death of *************.  He did not take part in *********** because he was not present.  
MR. BESNIER:
No further questions, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Prosecution please?
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Hello, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Prosecutor.
Q.	What do you do for a living now, Mr. Witness?  Tell me whether you work or you are a student, that sort of thing?
A.	I do handwork here and there as ********.
Q.	And are you currently married?
A.	I am married.
Q.	How old were you in l994?
A.	I was 12 years old.
Q.	Did you manage to complete your education?
A.	I finished six-year primary school but one term after it.  That is after only one term of six-year primary school.
Q.	Is it your testimony that both your parents were killed in l994, is that not the case, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	How was your education funded from the year l994, the year you finished?
A.	In Rwanda, the genocide survivors didn't pay fees for education.
Q.	But did you currently live on your own or did you live with someone else from 1994 until you got married?  How did you sustain yourself?
A.	I still lived at the house where I survived.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you lived at house location No. 2, from the age of 12, in 1994 until the present time, is that not correct, Mr. Witness?
A.	At present I live at my parent's but I do have my own house.
Q.	I thought your parents died?  Can you help me with that, which parents do you live with?
A.	I ************** and it is in that ************** that I now live.
Q.	And as a 12- year old, where did you, after your parents were killed, up until you were able to  ****************, that's what I want to know?
A.	It was later on *************.  We were given corrugated sheets and I found doors that I stored and I moved into that house.
Q.	That's correct but in l994 before you were old enough to find the corrugated sheets and move into the house, was it not the case that you continued to live in house No. 2, and, if so, tell us when you left the house?
A.	I stayed at the house in which I survived, but my name was listed among people whose houses had been destroyed.  And before ******************************, I continued to live in hiding place No. 2, sir.
Q.	I want to know when you ceased to live at house No. 2, one year, six months ago, two months ago?  Help me to answer that, please?
A.	It was in March 2001 that I left house No. 2 to move into my house.  It was at the time that I was to get married.
Q.	Yes, that's what I thought, and whilst you lived in house No. 2, you lived there with the person whose name is on Defence Exhibit 20-- let me recall it, 21.  Is that not the case?  The two people you listed on Defence Exhibit 21, you lived in the same house with them, did you not?
A.	Yes, that is correct, I still lived with those two people.
Q.	How many wives did your father have, Mr. Witness?  Just give me the number.  One, two, three, four, five?
A.	My father had *******************
Q.	And how many siblings did you have in total, Mr. Witness?
A.	We had a *****************.
Q.	So ************, is that your testimony or in total, children your father had?
A.	Yes, we were *******.
Q.	Now where is your sister today?
A.	Are you referring to my sister that is still alive?
Q.	That's correct.  Where is she?
A.	My sister got married but she is still in our area, sir. 
Q.	So is it your testimony that she is in your area at the present time as we speak or is she elsewhere?
A.	Yes, sir, she lives in our area.  They left the house of the ****************************** house where they now live.
Q.	Do you recall how old your sister was in l994, Mr. Witness?
A.	The one who died, who came just after me, indeed she came just after me but I can't remember her age.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your father ****************.  Now from that marriage, is it the case that there were one ******************************************?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now that ************ is she still alive or is she not still alive.
THE WITNESS:
She died, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this sister who is now married, living in our (sic) area, did she come from *************** then, is that the situation?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, she is  ****************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There were children, which other children were born *****************?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir there were ********.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that you at some stage sought refugee at the location you described as house No. 1.  Now why isn't that mentioned in your statement?
A.	I did not mention that house because I didn't stay there for a long time.
Q.	And why would you have to stay there at all, if you continued to stay at the house where you survived until very recently?  Why did you bother going to the first house at all?  It's not in your statement.
A.	I did not talk about the first hiding place because I didn't stay there for a long time.  I only mentioned the hiding place where I stayed for a longer period of time, sir.
Q.	The information in your statement is a little bit more intriguing, Mr. Witness, because in your statement, you state clearly that you have no specific information to give about the owner of house No. 1.  Don't you?  You actually speak about the owner of house No. 1 and you conclude your testimony in that regard by stating that you have nothing specific to tell us about him, is that not the case?
A.	I do not have explanations to give concerning house No. 1; indeed, because when the situation got complicated I was no longer in that house.  All I can say is, those who occupied that house accompanied me to house No. 2, sir.
Q.	Isn't it not the case, Mr. Witness, that the reason why you brought up staying in house No. 1 is because you know that that's where Tatiana stayed and you want us to believe that you know about Tatiana and what happened to her, is that not true, Mr. Witness?
A.	No sir, that is not the reason.  As a matter of fact, it was not at that house that she was killed.  She was taken out of the house to be killed.  So, that couldn't have been the reason to prevent me from talking about that house.  No. 1, Tatiana was not killed in that house, she was taken out of that house to be killed outside, sir.
Q.	You are extremely well informed, Mr. Witness, for a man who spent three months hiding under sorghum leaves in a location out of reach from house No. 1.  How do you know this?  Has anyone told you about the evidence in the Prosecution's case by any chance, Mr. Witness?
A.	Nobody talked to me about it, sir, rather, as a matter of fact, nobody told me about the evidence that the Prosecutor's witness is to give or has given here in this court.
Q.	Apart from ************** and the lady you mentioned staying at house No. 1, how many Tutsis to your knowledge, were killed in your cellule during the genocide?
A.	The other Tutsis that died in our cellule were, as far as I am concerned, they were quite many because our cellule was in the majority, inhabited by Tutsi.  I cannot tell you all their names.  I can only tell you a few names, sir.
Q.	That's indeed very correct.  And, therefore, you must be particularly grateful to be alive, Mr. Witness, is that not the case?
A.	Yes, sir, I thank God for being still alive.
Q.	Apart from thanking God, Mr. Witness, and being grateful to God, is it not also that you are also particularly grateful ******************* for saving your life, yes or no?
A.	Yes, I am grateful to those people.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-direct? 
MR. BESNIER:
No further questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the sources of the information about **************** come from Mr. Augustin Karara; is that so?
THE WITNESS:
No, sir.  It was not Karara that told me about the *************.  It was the person that I mentioned in the piece of paper, that person gave me the information, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now that person -- from where did that person on the piece of paper get his or her information?
THE WITNESS:
That person heard people shouting out and said:  "Well, the person has been found, the fellow has been found", and when that person heard people shouting out like that he came and told me, "Look, ************* has been found".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to indicate any name or names of the persons that witnessed the  **************** and then informed the person on the piece of paper who then told you?
THE WITNESS:
Regarding the persons that informed me, the person whose name I mentioned on the piece of paper, that I do not know.  That person on the piece of paper told me that he heard people shouting out the words that I have just repeated here before you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the person on the piece of paper did not inform you who actually witnessed the killing of *****  *******. Is that so?

THE WITNESS:
That is true.  That person only heard people shouting out.  That person did not witness the killing of *************, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has now come to an end.  We would like to thank you for having come a long way to Arusha to give a testimony and wish you a very safe journey home.  And please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a document relating to Witness DI, in front of us, Mr. Besnier; is that correct?  
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, it is DI.  Witness DI, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, registry if you can make sure that Witness DI is being brought in, please. 

Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you are a protected witness and you will be referred to as Witness DI in these proceedings.  Please be careful as not to reveal your identity.  Did you have that piece of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have this piece of paper in front of me, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you see a signature at the bottom of that document?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature? 
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence Exhibit 24, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 24 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, please.

We have to swear in the witness first.  Madam Witness, you have to tell the truth.

The Registry will now make the necessary arrangements to take the solemn declaration
MR. MUSSA:
Madam Witness, please stand up, raise your right hand and say after me.
(Declaration made by Witness DI in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you will now be asked questions first by the Defence and then by the Prosecution.
MR. MARÇAIS:
The Defence would like to make the same application as just before.  We would like a closed session for ten minutes, lest we make the witness easily identifiable.  I am worried about justice and we shall simply go to particulars that is addressed -- certain particulars and immediately go on to open session, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to grant that application but we know that it will only be for ten minutes, and then we are back in open session again.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 73 to 74] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 65 to 72 by Judith Kapatamoyo)











MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are now in open session.  So now you have to be careful.  Please proceed.  
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Witness, could you remind us and tell us how you learnt about the death of President Juvernal Habyarimana?
A.	I learnt about it over the radio, Counsel.
Q.	Do you remember approximately at which date that was, Witness?
A.	I do not remember the date, Counsel.
Q.	Do you remember the  -- what are the events -- what happened security wise during the day following the death of the president, what happened as far as security was concerned?
A.	Now in the day following the death of the president, in our area people started killing cows, destroying houses, burning down houses and killing people.
Q.	Do you mean that looting erupted and massacres as well of people?
A.	Yes, the massacre of the Tutsi.
Q.	Now more precisely, who were the victims of such crimes?  You are saying that those that belonged to which ethnic group?
A.	The Hutu were killing the Tutsi, sir.
Q.	Now to kill the Hutu - rather, to kill the Tutsi, one went to seek them in the houses or in the countryside, which is which?
A.	First of all, the houses were destroyed and people ran away to hide in the bush.  It is there that they were found or sometimes they were found in neighbour's houses.
Q.	My questions may rather be brutal compared to the compassion that you may need.  What were the arms used to kill the Tutsi, madam?  What sort of weapons were used?
A.	They used machetes, clubs and even daggers.
Q.	Could you tell us as far as the Gasharu commune was concerned, where did the killers come from?
A.	The killers came from the Kayengi sector among others, sir.
Q.	The killer came from Kanyegi, were there killer that came from any other areas?
A.	They came from all the areas.
Q.	Could you tell us as far as you were concerned, face to face with those killings since you are Tutsi, could you tell us what you did to avoid being killed?
A.	I hid myself in the bush initially and then late a neighbour of mine hid me in his house or her house until the end of the war.
Q.	You hid in the bush alone or with members of your family?
A.	Initially I was with my mother and my younger brother and then later when my mother was killed, I stayed with my younger brother, and then much later my younger brother was killed and one week after that, I met the assailants that took me to the Gitaka centre.  A neighbour called**********paid money to the assailants for them to spare my life.  So that since day I went to that neighbour's house where I stayed.
(Pages 75 to 76 by Judith Kapatamoyo)




































	1600H
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Now, let us go over this chronology again, ma'am.  It is correct to say initially you hid in the bush with your mother; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And your younger brother?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And then very quickly, initially your mother was found, caught and killed?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Your younger brother and yourself were able to escape?
A.	We stayed together in that hiding place.  And one week after that, my younger brother was arrested.  He was taken to the Gitaka centre.  He was ***************** -- into a cell that *********** was going to pull him ******************.   And for that matter it was the same people that pulled him ****************and killed him.
Q.	Do you mean that because they feared that ******** would save your younger brother they withdraw him ****** in which they had thrown him and then killed him?
A.	Yes, they were afraid that ******, who was a friend of the family, may save my younger brother.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when was your mother killed, in which month?
THE WITNESS:
April, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was she killed in the first half or the second half of April?
THE WITNESS:
In the middle of the month of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now this incident with your brother, did that also happen in April?
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, it was in April; there was one week between the two events.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	So your brother and yourself were taken to the Gitaka village centre -- I'm trying to reconstitute the events  -- this is after you were flushed out of your hiding place, then comes in what you just told us about regarding how your brother was killed.  He was removed *************** and then killed, and you -- well, what happened to you, Madam Witness?
A.	They arrested my brother but I was able to escape from them.  But later on I said to myself that it would be better for me to go and look for him.  And on my way I met a group of assailants who also took me to Gitaka centre.  And it was at that point in time that*********** gave money to the leader of the attackers.  They released me, and they said they were going to come back for me the following day to kill me but they didn't do so. 
Q.	What happened to your father, Madam Witness, during this period of time?
A.	During this period of time when I reached this neighbour's house, *********'s home, my father came there and I was able to see him.  And about two days later I learned that he too was killed.
Q.	If I were to recount the event, would I be faithful to your retelling of the story that the death of your mother is placed in the first half of the month of April or even -- 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Who is the witness; who is testifying here, the witness or counsel?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I presume --  I think that when the witness answered my question she didn't really say the first half, so even if you are trying to recapitulate you must do it accurately.
MR. MARÇAIS:
So there were the death of three persons, Mr. President, the death of her mother, her brother and her father.  All I'm trying to do is place these events, which I believe all took place in the month of April, and I wanted some specifics in terms of chronology.  Even if that is disturbing the Prosecutor, we need to establish what the chronology of events is. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you please specify to me regarding these three events, the death of your mother, the death of your brother and the death of your father, I want you to tell us about them chronologically speaking?
A.	There was space of one week between the three killings.  First of all my mother was killed, then my brother and finally my father; and between one event and the next there was a week.
Q.	A moment ago --
MR. MARÇAIS:
Can I ask the following question, Mr. President, Your Honours?
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	The death of your mother, you placed it a moment ago in the middle of April.  So, where would you place the death of your younger brother, would that be the third week of April, and the death of your father the last week of April; would that be correct, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You did not witness your father's death, so how were you --
A.	It is true, I was not an eyewitness of my father's death.
Q.	How were you then informed, and by whom, of your father's death?  How were you informed?
A.	I was at *******'s house and it was ******* who told me that my father was dead.
Q.	Did ***** -- well, without going into detail, did he tell you how your father was killed?
A.	He told me that my father had been arrested and that he had been clubbed to death.
Q.	From what ******** said or through investigations that you yourself may have made, do you know who killed your father?
A.	Yes, I know that my father was killed by Évariste Bapfukurera.
Q.	And where was he killed?
A.	He was killed at the Gitaka centre.
Q.	Does that mean that he was found at the Gitaka centre and killed there or was he brought there to be killed?
A.	He was found in the bush where he was hiding and he was taken to the Gitaka centre, and that is where he was killed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this *********, what was his position in society?
THE WITNESS:
 ********* was a farmer and at the same time he was a trader.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	And throughout these events of April, May 1994 did you lose any other members of your family, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I lost other members of my family, in particular my paternal uncles.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know the Accused, Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	The last time I saw him I was very young; I'm not sure I would be able to recognise him today.
Q.	Did you see him during the events of any 1994?
A.	I heard it said that he had come.
Q.	Can you be a bit more specific, Madam Witness?  You heard it said that he came when, Madam Witness, when did he come?
A.	He came in the beginning of the month of June; that is what I was told.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that this was more than one death -- one month or at least one month between the death of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) and the arrival of Ndindabahizi at Gitaka?
A.	Yes, he came after my father's death.
Q.	So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do now have to delete the reference to the name.  So the reference to the name of the person killed will be deleted from the Court video system and it will be placed under seal in the transcripts.  Please be careful.

Yes, please proceed.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Madam Witness, you were told about the presence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the beginning of June, 1994.  Were you also told about Mr. Ndindabahizi's reaction to what had happened, to what was happening and the questions that he asked?
A.	I was told that he came and that when he reached the Gitaka centre he was saddened to learn that people had been killed, and he had asked why people were killing others.  He was shown a man known as Gatete and he ordered that the man be arrested, but that man was able to escape.  At that point in time there was another man called Karara, and Mr. Ndindabahizi arrested this Mr. Karara and took him away for him to be imprisoned.
Q.	Am I correct in saying that Mr. Ndindabahizi was angry when he learned of the deaths committed against Tutsis?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Am I correct in saying that he had tried to bring about the arrest of those who had killed Tutsis?
A.	Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this ************, is this the same ************ that you referred to previously in your statement or a different one?
THE WITNESS:
It was the same, one and the same,*********.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Madam Witness, in your written statement you said the following to the investigators, and I am quoting:  "It is absurd to state that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi can have any kind of responsibility whatsoever in the crimes committed in our region."
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you confirm that what you said about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi being accused of such crimes would be absurd?
A.	For me they are lies.
Q.	You also state that you yourself and members of your family, your parents and some of your brothers and sisters, were victims of the genocide.  And you said that you've heard mention made of that, yet you say Ndindabahizi was innocent of the crimes or the allegations made against him.
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	After the war a certain number of investigations were carried out; was Ndindabahizi -- was Ndindabahizi's name ever mentioned regarding the genocide?
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel; can you repeat it for me, please?
Q.	I withdraw that question.  

Madam Witness, your family -- you are from a farming family.  What are the traditional tools agricultural tools used by Hutu and Tutsi farmers, traditionally?
A.	Rwandan cultivators use hoes and machetes to tow the land.
Q.	One last question, Madam Witness; do you think it is reasonable to say that in April, May, 1994 a Tutsi woman could go on foot, even in hiding, from Gitesi to Kibirizi?
A.	That was not possible.
Q.	Is it reasonable or possible for a Tutsi woman to make purchases at a market place during this period of time in 1994 and particularly in Kibirizi?
A.	That was not possible.
MR. MARÇAIS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Counsel, please.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Do you know why Tutsis were being sought in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Tutsis were being sought because of their ethnicity.
Q.	Did you carry an identity card in 1994, Madam Witness?
A.	I didn't have one.
Q.	Do you know how Tutsis were identified in 1994 apart from the use of identity cards?
A.	For those who had identity cards, they were checked, but for those who didn't, they could be identified because they were known.  It was known that this person or this child was a Tutsi; that was the only way of identifying anyone.
Q.	Could Tutsis also be identified by their facial attributes and features in 1994, as far as you know?
A.	When you reached a region which was not your own and if you didn't have an identity card on which it was said that you were Hutu, you could be killed because of your physical features.
Q.	Would you describe yourself, Madam Witness, as having typical Tutsi features?
A.	All people look alike.
Q.	Is that a yes or a no to my -- answer to my question, Madam Witness?
A.	I told you that all people look alike; there is very little difference between individuals, so one cannot say that one person is Hutu and another is Tutsi on the basis only of physical traits.
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, you were 17-years old in 1994, were you not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And since the genocide, would I be correct in saying that you have moved on with your life and gone on to do other things, including getting married?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying that following the death of your parents, the unfortunate death of your parents in 1994, certain individuals assumed responsibility for your upkeep; could I be correct in saying that?
A.	Yes, there was a neighbour, that neighbour took me in and took care of me until I got married.
Q.	Now, can you tell me who that neighbour is without actually saying it out, if you could write it down or something; or is it somebody we have talked about already?  Can you answer me that way if it is?
A.	Are you referring to the person who took care of me after my parents died?
Q.	Yes, I want to know, Madam Witness, but I don't want you to say it out if you can avoid that.  Please, can you write it down for me?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you help her in doing that, please?
THE WITNESS:
Please give me a piece of paper, I will give you the name.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, the name you have written on here, does that person have any relationship with the ********************?  And I just want you to answer me yes or no.
A.	Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We enter this document, Your Honour, please, as the next Prosecution exhibit -- actually, before that, Mr. Registry, can you give it to the witness to spell out the relationship.  I don't want her to say and I don't want to take the chance, write it in Kinyarwanda and we will have it translated.  I think I know -- we can have it translated, we think we know.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, thank you for helping me with that exercise.  Now, would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that having sought refuge at *************'s house, you also sought refuge at the house of the person who you wrote down on that piece of paper in 1994?
A.	After the war when life was becoming more and more difficult for me, I went to this lady's house, the lady whose name I mentioned, but that was after the war.
Q.	Yes.  And at the time you went to the lady's house -- the lady you mentioned on that piece of paper, would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, ****************************************at that lady's residence, was living there?
A.	Yes, ******************** that lady's house.
Q.	And it was -- it is, therefore, your evidence that this lady took care of *********************************** following the death of your parents until *********?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, you then got married, Madam Witness -- is your husband also a witness in this case, and by that I want you to answer yes or no?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, I want you to write your husband's name on this same piece of paper.  Can you draw a line, can you give it to me, please -- write it on the reverse, actually, just write your husband's name for us, please. 
(Pages 77 to 83 by Donna M. Lewis)

































1630H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, for helping with that little exercise. 

Now, can you tell me whether your husband is Tutsi or Hutu.
A.	He's Hutu.
Q.	Okay.  Now, when I asked you to write the relationship that you have or had with the first person you wrote, whose name you wrote on the paper, you described that person as your sister.  Is that correct?
A.	Who are you talking about, Counsel?
Q.	If you look at me, Madam Witness.  Look at me.  This name you've written here, do you recall telling us that that person is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
A.	No.  I said (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  You asked me about the relationship between that person and Ndindabahizi.  You asked me the relationship between the two persons, the person on the paper and Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Pardon me, Madam Witness, yes, that is indeed correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So then we will delete this as well. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last reference to the link between the Accused and the relationship, but under seal.  Please proceed. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, why do you think that the man you describe as*************, why do you think that person allowed you to stay at his house during the genocide?
A.	He allowed me to live in his house because he was a neighbour, he was a family friend.  And when he was in a position to shelter me, he did so.
Q.	And do you have a relationship with that man's wife?  Is that man's wife something to you?  And just answer me yes or no, initially. 
A.	Whose wife? 
Q.	********.  A relationship with his wife.
A.	No, no relation.
Q.	Okay.  Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that whilst you sought refuge at *********'s house you never left the premises to go elsewhere during the genocide; is that correct?
A.	I used to take refuge in his house and sometimes he would take me to his trading place, where he conducted his trading activities, and come back.
Q.	How was he able to do that without risking your life, Madam Witness?
A.	We used to move during the night.
Q.	The trading centre was open at night, Madam Witness?
A.	We would go through the bush along the road and then we would get to the centre.
Q.	And whilst you were at this centre, did you only operate your business at night or did you do it in daytime?
A.	You mean, for me to hide at the centre? 
Q.	I don't know what you were doing at the centre.  You help me with that.  What were you doing there?
A.	He used to take me there and keep me in a house.  In fact, it was a trick to hide me and people did not suspect that I could be hiding there.  So he would keep me in a house, and when people heard that I was in that house at the centre, he would take me away from there to his house.
Q.	So you criss-crossed between ***********'s house and the centre throughout the months of April, May of and June?
A.	Yes, that is what we did.
Q.	Why did Mr. ******** go out of his way to protect you at this time and have to ferry you from his house to the centre?  Why did he go out of his way to do that?
A.	He knew I was being sought, and if he didn't do that I would be killed.
Q.	He was also good friends with your father, was he not?
A.	They were friends.
Q.	Did you also know a man by the name *****************?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	He was also a family friend, was he not?
A.	Yes, he was also a family friend.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that prior to April 1994 your father had lived side by side with ********* and ********* without any problems?
A.	They lived very well and had no problem between them.
Q.	Why then was it, Madam Witness, in your opinion, that ******* and ******* were not able to protect your father?  Why were they not able to protect him in 1994?
A.	I'm unable to explain to you how people changed during that period. What I know is that ******** did his best and gave me refuge. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, we didn't hear.  There was a rectification from there.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, could you repeat your answer, please.  We're having some problems in getting your answer across.
A.	******* hid me.  And I cannot tell you what ******** was thinking; I can only say that he changed during that period.
Q.	What do you mean by stating that Ndabukiye changed during that period?  Can you help us with that, please?
A.	 ************ did not give refuge to anybody, and even my brother who took refuge in his house, he chased him out subsequently, and my brother had to go and live with a women that I referred to earlier.
Q.	That being the case, do you know whether *****had any hand in your father's death?
A.	I wouldn't know.
Q.	You describe him as a changed man who chased your younger brother out of your house at some stage.  Would it have been possible, would it have been possible for him, Madam Witness, for him to have a hand in your father's death, in your opinion?
A.	You know, during the war, any person who gave refuge to a Tutsi person was afraid of either being killed or being looted.  Probably that was why my brother was chased away, because he probably thought that if my brother was discovered he would lose his property.
Q.	The location where your  ********** eventually ended up, why was he not chased out of that location, do you know?
A.	I don't know, but I believe these were people who had pity of him and were very kind people.
Q.	You must consider yourself extremely lucky to be alive after the events of 1994, Madam Witness.
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	You must feel particularly grateful to the men and women who went out of their way to save your life; is that not the case?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I'm grateful to these people.
Q.	When you eventually got married to your husband, did somebody give you away, as is traditionally the case in Africa?  Did you have representatives from your family who gave you away, stood in place for your parents?
A.	It was my maternal uncle who survived the genocide.
Q.	Did you ever know who killed your mother in 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you also find out who killed your younger brother in 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Have you been able to testify in the trials of any of these people in Rwanda?
A.	No.
Q.	Do you intend to do so at a future stage, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What are you going to base that testimony on, if and when you do so?  Are you going to tell that court that you were an eyewitness to those killings, or are you going to tell that court that you were told that they were involved in their death?  What do you intend to do?
A.	I'll tell the court that I got information regarding the circumstances of their death.  I will not say that I was an eyewitness.
Q.	Do you know how many Tutsis were killed in Gasharu cellule in 1994, Madam Witness?
A.	There are very many, and I wouldn't know of the exact figure.
Q.	And are you able to tell us how you came to be a witness for the Defence in this case?  Did anybody ask you to come to Arusha and, if so, who and when?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know who asked you to come here?  Do you want to write it down or do you want to tell me?
A.	The person who asked me?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	The person who contacted us is called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	Yes.  And I -- would I be correct in saying that that person that you've just mentioned is the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?  Just yes or no, don't expand any further.
A.	Are you referring to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
Q.	Yes, I am.  Just confirm whether I would be right in saying --
A.	It's (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	Right.  It's the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) the Accused person in this case, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for being so kind. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, if I could enter this piece of paper as Prosecution Exhibit -- it would be two exhibits.  Actually, we could do it in one.  We have one name on one side which belongs to her husband, and we have the ****************************************************************, and that person's relationship to the Accused on one side. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe we could make two copies, and on the one have OTP Exhibit 31.  Will that settle the dispute?  That is the relationship?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's the *******************************************************.  And also on that page is that person's relationship to the Accused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And then on the other sheet would be the name of the witness's husband.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and that would be No. 32, and both under seal.
	(Exhibit Nos. P. 31 and P. 32 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the last interchange should also be under seal, between you and the witness.  

So, court register video system, if you will delete that last reference when it comes to the link between the person who asked the witness to testify and the relationship to the Accused.  

Any re-examination? 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Just one question, Mr. President.      
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Madam Witness, your conviction of the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi during the genocide, Prosecutor is trying to link that to the fact that the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) of Ndindabahizi  ********************.  Will this conviction not, rather, flow from the totality of the information that you were able to gather on the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi, on information that you got, research that you conducted, which enabled you to assert that we're all victims of this genocide?  We're in a better position to know the perpetrators, and I can assure that you Mr. Ndindabahizi is not one of them.  Is this conviction this, and not a way of saying thank you, as it is being inferred?
A.	It is not because ***************, who is related to him.  I'm saying this because when he came he was very shocked by the killing of the people, and he was very angry.  And they showed him one person who had killed a lot of people and he asked that person to be arrested, but that person fled.  But subsequently he had Karara arrested, had him detain.  But for me, this is evidence that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi did not have any responsibility in the genocide.
Q.	You came to testify -- did you come to testify to tell the truth or to show your gratitude?
A.	I came here to tell the truth about the event that I experienced and events that I heard about. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Again, the reference to the person who lived in the house must be placed under seal and struck from the video system. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 

JUDGE KHAN:
We seek a short clarification from you, Madam Witness.  ******* had sheltered you; is that right?  Is this the same ******************************?
THE WITNESS:
It is the same person who was detained.  But later on he got to know that they were false accusations against ******** and he had been released.
JUDGE KHAN:
You said that your husband was a Hutu; is that right?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE KHAN:
Is he in any way related to the Accused?
THE WITNESS:
No, no blood relation.
JUDGE KHAN:
Are you related to the Accused?  If so, could you please write it down for us, your relationship with him.
THE WITNESS:
They were related, but it's a distant relation.
JUDGE KHAN:
Who *******************?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  It is said that  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
JUDGE KHAN:
You mean to say that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I suppose we have to place that under seal as well.  So that will be done and struck from the record. 

Madam Witness, who told you who killed your father?
THE WITNESS:
It was *********.

MR. PRESIDENT:
How did he know?
THE WITNESS:
It was ******** who had him buried.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was  ******************** present during the killing of your father?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know if he was present or not.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your source for saying that Évariste Bapfakurera was one of your father's killers?
THE WITNESS:
It's because he pleaded guilty in the Rwandan courts, and he accepted that he committed this crime.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that when he found out that he was one of the killers, when you heard about his conviction?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was when he confessed that I got to know.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before then, you did not know?
THE WITNESS:
I did not know.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he confess?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know, but I was told that he confessed his guilt.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the normal Rwandan courts or some other mechanism?
THE WITNESS:
I heard he admitted that he killed my father.  That is what I know.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether he confessed before the courts, or have you only heard that he has admitted it? 
THE WITNESS:
It was before judges.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When were you told about this?
THE WITNESS:
His testimony is even available.  This was a while ago, and I can therefore not remember the year nor the month.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you talking about two years ago, four years ago, six years ago? 
THE WITNESS:
You mean, since I got this information, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, that's the question, exactly.
THE WITNESS:
I think it must have been eight or nine months ago since I got this information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you heard Judge Khan ask you about Mr.  ************* and she asked you whether ******* was the same person, on the one hand the person who sheltered you, and on the other hand the man whom Mr. *******************.  Did you say that he was the same person? 
THE WITNESS:
It was the same person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would this person on the one hand be a Tutsi-saver and on the other hand be ordered ***************?
THE WITNESS:
These were persons who spoke to Ndindabahizi and ****************************************************  ************  But it was when he got to know later on that these were ***********************************, who just **********
MR. PRESIDENT:
But why did Ndindabahizi **************?
THE WITNESS:
Ndindabahizi was*******.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The killings of whom? 
THE WITNESS:
Of Tutsis.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he ***? 
THE WITNESS:
The same day he arrived.  When he arrived on that same day, he*********************************** him away for ***************************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this all happened in June '94?

THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Madam Witness.  Your testimony --
THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you too, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony has come to an end.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much, and do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This will bring us to the end of the day also.  

And tomorrow, Defence, we start with DL? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, in fact, Mr. President, I'm in a position to give some information to the Court on the proceedings.  We currently have 13 witnesses here in Arusha.  We have called four.  Things are moving very fast and that's very good.  Out of the 13 witnesses, we have seen and prepared eight.  The Defence team has not yet met the remaining five.  Other witnesses should be arriving at the end of the week, and the expert can come here only from the 17th of November.  If tomorrow we are able to hear four witnesses, we would have heard all the witnesses that we've prepare, and we would need a day or two to meet the remaining witnesses.  Therefore, I think that if we are able to hear four witnesses tomorrow, to adjourn for a day or two, or a day and a half, to enable us to meet other witnesses so that before the end of the week we could hear other witnesses.  Today, I can say that we'll be able to hear ten witnesses in the course of the week.  It is possible that we would need a day of Thursday, Wednesday or Thursday, to be able to prepare the witnesses that we intend to hear on Friday.  Will this be agreeable to the Court?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if you do not have more witnesses, there is no choice.  But as I indicated previously, this is exactly the situation that the Court would wish to prefer -- to avoid.  Now, but what we note now is that we have four witnesses for tomorrow, and that is very well and good, and then let's see how it proceeds from then.  But I'm a bit worried about next week.  How many witnesses do you have for next week? 

MR. BESNIER:
The week after, it would depend on how many witnesses we are able to call this week.  We are going to call Witnesses 9, 14, 15, 16, and 17, plus possibly some witnesses who are already here that we have not yet heard.  But here I would not like to make any pronouncements on that.  In any event, 
Mr. President, we have sufficient witnesses for next week.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So that's where we are now.  Thank you very much for that clarification.  And, tomorrow, could you just indicate the order for the four witnesses, tomorrow.  Will you do that, please, the ones you have already had occasion to interview, please. 
MR. BESNIER:
Tomorrow we would hear Witnesses DL, DU, DV and DB.  In other words, we are respecting the order as set out in the list.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That's very helpful.  Thank you very much, indeed.  

So the Court is adjourned until tomorrow at 8:30.  
      (Court adjourned at 1706H)
