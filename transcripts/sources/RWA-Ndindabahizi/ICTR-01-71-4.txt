MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and you will be referred to by your pseudonym, CTK, in these proceedings.  When asked questions, you must be careful not to reveal your identity, and if any of the answers you are about to give could disclose your identity, then you must alert the Chamber so that we may proceed in a way to avoid it.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.
MR. MUSSA:
Raise your right hand and say after me:
(Declaration made by Witness CTK in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT.
Now, Madam Witness, we know that there may be a need for you to take a break, depending on circumstances, but we will start with your testimony now, and you will first be asked questions by the Prosecution.  Do you have a document in front of you, madam?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Is that your signature at the bottom of that document?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Does that imply that the information in that document, which is in English language, but that information was given by you and that it is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Thank you very much.  That will then be --
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you, Mr. President.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
P5, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, P5, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P5 admitted)
MR. PRSIDENT:
Please proceed, Prosecution.
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Before I ask the witness to give her testimony, she has expressed security concerns.  She wishes to address you before she gives her testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes, is there anything you want to tell the Court, Madam Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Please do.
THE WITNESS:
We were in a certain place, and Mr. *********************** asked me whether I was going to come to testify in the Ndindabahizi case.  I said I didn't know.  He asked me my name - my surname, and he said he had seen my family name, and he told me that he had seen a list of people who were going to testify in the Ndindabahizi trial and my name was on that list.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Could you repeat the name of the person who told you that, please?
THE WITNESS:
**************************.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Would you be so kind as to spell that name, please?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, or maybe could you give a pen so that I can write it down?
MR. PRESIDENT:
His name is ************************.  Is that your handwriting, madam?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Then we have the spelling on record.  Who is this person you have just referred to, madam?
THE WITNESS:
It's a person who came to speak to me to tell me that he had seen my name on the list of witnesses who were going to testify in the Ndindabahizi trial.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Thank you.  Now we may revert to this at the end of your testimony, but now we would prefer to hear the testimony first.  Rest assured, madam, that we will come back to this issue.  Is that clear?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Could you only indicate when is it you had this conversation with this person Manirunva?  When was it?
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember the date, but it was in August.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Prosecutor.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
WITNESS CTK
first having been duly sworn
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Madam Witness, in April 1994, were you living with your parents of Gitesi commune?
A.	Yes, I was living with my parents.
Q.	Following the death of the President of the Republic on the 6th of April, could you briefly tell us what the security situation was in your secteur?
A.	There were political parties and rallies were held regularly, and the killings started on the 12th.  The conseiller held a meeting to stop Hutu from killing Tutsis, and they refused; they threw stones at him; and we fled on the 13th.  My mother was killed, and I fled.  I left the secteur.  I went into Kayenzi secteur, and I remained in the house of one resident of that secteur.  Three weeks later I left the secteur to go and hide in the bush.  I spent two weeks there, and I saw vehicles, a car and a Daihatsu on the road.  When these two vehicles came to the roadblock, they stopped --
Q.	Witness, let us have your testimony in pieces, right?  Now, you say that after the 12th, after your mother was killed, you fled and hid in a house of a named person.  Would you tell us the name of the person in whose house you went to hide, please?
A.	I do not think I can mention the name of that person because that person is known to many people.
Q.	All right.  Could you just tell us whether he was a Hutu or a Tutsi?
A.	He was Hutu.
Q.	From that person's residence, where did you go?
A.	I continued to wander around and I came to a place known as Fayer, spelt:  F-A-Y-E-R
Q.	Can you tell us where Fayer is?
A.	In Kayenzi secteur.
Q.	And could you tell us approximately the time you reached Fayer in Kayenzi secteur?
A.	It is in the same secteur; the distance is not that great.
Q.	All right.  Could you tell us when you reached this place Fayer?
A.	It was in May.
Q.	And could you help us, please?  What part of May?  Was it the beginning of May, the middle of May or towards the end of May?
A.	It was in the beginning of May.  I was quite close to that place,  But I was still in that same location at the end of May -- in the month of May.
Q.	Now, could you tell us what you observed while you were at Fayer?
A.	I saw a vehicle and a Daihatsu which were coming; the vehicle was black and the Daihatsu was green.
Q.	Could you tell us what time it was that you observed these two vehicles?
A.	I was about 1 p.m., but I didn't have a watch, I am only giving you an estimate.
Q.	Yes, thank you, Madam Witness.  Could you not tell us what you observed when these two vehicles came to where you were?
A.	Three people came out these vehicles.  There was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and on the Daihatsu there were machetes, and there are were also people in the Daihatsu.
Q.	From which direction did the vehicles come from?
A.	The vehicles were coming from Kigali.
Q.	You have described several people who came out of those vehicles.  Could you tell us which people came from which vehicle?
A.	There were three people into the car and they were armed, and in the Daihatsu there were also three people, Interahamwe, who were armed with firearms.
Q.	You testified, Madam Witness, that one of the people who came from those vehicles was
Mr. Ndindabahizi.  From which vehicle did he come?  Did he disembark from?
A.	He was in the car.
Q.	Did you observe him driving that vehicle or he was one of the passengers in that vehicle?
A.	He had a driver.
Q.	Could you tell us of those three people in that vehicle whether any of them were armed?
A.	Yes, they were armed.
Q.	All of them or some of them?
A.	All the occupants of the vehicle were armed except Ndindabahizi.
Q.	Now, when the vehicles reached the place where they stopped, how far away were you from them?
A.	I didn't measure the distance, but I think the distance was about 5 metres, because I was in a place which was above the road and they were on the road; the vehicles had stopped on the road.
Q.	Was there anything significant at that particular place where the cars had stopped?  Was there any activities that were going on?
A.	There was a roadblock; people were stopped, and they were asked to show their identity cards.
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, after the two vehicles had stopped, did you observe anything?  Did you hear anything?
A.	Emmanuel Ndindabahizi spoke to the people who were at the roadblock, asking them whether they had finished killing the Tutsis, and they answered: "We spared the women who -- Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men and their children."  And he ordered them to get into vehicle -- vehicles, to go and kill them.
Q.	I didn't understand the last part of your question (sic).  You say he ordered them to do what?
A.	He ordered them to get into the Daihatsu and take the machetes that were on the Daihatsu and to kill the Tutsi women who were married to Hutus and children whose fathers were Hutu and mothers were Tutsi.  So they got into the vehicle; they took the machetes.
Q.	Could you observe how many machetes -- how many weapons or what type of weapons were off-loaded from that vehicle -- from the Daihatsu?
A.	There were only machetes.
Q.	Could you tell us how many machetes you saw?
A.	There were many machetes.  I don't know how many there were.
Q.	After that speech and the off-loading of the weapons, what else did you observe?
A.	They continued on their way, and I remained in that place for some time, then I went towards the Nyabahanga River.  After that I went to look for some food.  I met people who were going to harvest sorghum.  One person threatened to cut me with a spear, and I gave him money.  I went back to Nyabahanga and I heard noises of a plane.  And when I got to Nyabahanga, I asked what was happening with these planes -- the aircraft, and I was told that it was the French who were coming, and that was when the war ended.
Q.	Now, the people who were manning the roadblock at Fayer, do you know any of them?
A.	No.
Q.	Could you shed some more light, Madam Witness.  How far is it from Fayer to Nyabahanga Bridge?
A.	It's a distance of about 1kilometre.
Q.	Is it correct to say that FAYE and Nyabahanga are between Mabanza and Gitesi town; is that a correct statement?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, you have told us that in May l994, you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at Fayer Bridge distributing arms.  Had you known Mr. Ndindabahizi before May l994?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us where you knew him and how?
A.	He would come to his home and to a centre which was quite close to his parents' home.
Q.	Madam Witness, I think you can mention that centre without any problems.
A.	It was Gitaka centre in Gitesi commune -- Gitesi secteur.
Q.	So, when was it that you saw him come to this place?
A.	In 1990, 1992, 1993.
Q.	Let's go to 1990.  How often did you see him in 1990 at Gitaka centre?
A.	Every year I would see him only once.
Q.	In 1990, under what circumstance did you see him at Gitaka centre?
A.	There was nothing special.  He had come to visit his parents and he went to that centre.
Q.	Did you know where his parents lived?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us how far it was from Gitaka centre to their house?
A.	About 1 kilometre.
Q.	Do you know the names of his parents?
A.	Yes.  His father is known as Hanyumbwa, and his mother is Nyirabarukwa.
Q.	To your knowledge, are his parents still alive?
A.	No, they died before the war.
Q.	Now, in 1990 when you saw him at Gitaka centre, how did he come there?
A.	When I saw him, he was on foot.  He was standing at the centre in the company of other people.
Q.	Could you say whether he was doing anything that you noticed or you saw him do, or say anything that you heard him say?
A.	He was speaking with those people, but I do not know what they were talking about.
Q.	And what were you doing at that time at that particular centre?
A.	I came to the market.
Q.	When again did you say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi in his secteur?
A.	In 1991, 1992.
Q.	Okay, let's go to 1991.  Where did you see him at the Gitaka centre?
A.	We met on the way on the road.  He was being accompanied.
Q.	Can you help us?  What was he doing?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	For how long did you observe him?
A.	Are you referring to the first time or the second time?  About 20 minutes only.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The first time or the second time?
THE WITNESS:
This is the first time, because he was standing.  On the second occasion it was for about ten minutes, because he was walking and I was also walking.
MR. PRESIDENT.
And the location of this second occasion was at this location?
THE WITNESS:
We met on the road.  I was coming from the centre, and they were coming from there.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And on what other occasion did you see -- in which other year did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi after that second occasion?
A.	In 1992.
Q.	Where were you?  Can you tell us where you saw him this time?
A.	I saw him at Gitaka.  I was passing through and I was coming from prayers.
Q.	Can you tell us for how long you observed him this time in 1992?
A.	About 30 minutes.
Q.	Madam Witness, on all the occasions you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at Gitaka centre, were all these on one particular day or it was on different days of the week?
MR. PRESIDENT.
What does that question mean?
MR. KAPAYA:
What time I mean, Your Honour, is whether she saw him on Mondays or Tuesdays or Sundays.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Did you see him on the same week days these three years or on different week days?
THE WITNESS:
On different days.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Madam Witness, could you tell us what Mr. Ndindabahizi was doing in 1990, 1991 to 1992, if you know?
A.	No, I don't know.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Did you know his profession?
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't know.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Did you know where he lived?
THE WITNESS:
They used to say that he lived in Kigali, but I have never been in Kigali.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, have you been to Fayer after May '94.
A.	Are you referring to the period after May?
Q.	Yes, that is correct.  After May l994, have you had occasion to visit the Fayer trading centre?
A.	After the war?
Q.	Yes, please.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us when you went there and why?
A.	I went there on many occasions because it was on my way, but on other occasions I went there in the company of other people.
Q.	Was there a time when you went to Fayer with officers of this Tribunal, the ICTR?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us when, please?
A.	In 2001, but I don't recall the month.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal the purpose of your visit that year to that place?
A.	It was to show them where the roadblock was erected and where the vehicles were parked.
Q.	Do you recall the person you went with to show him those places?
A.	No.
Q.	When you reached the place, did you disembark from the car or how did you show him?
A.	The vehicle slowed down and I showed them the position of the vehicle.
Q.	Now, when you went there in the year 2001, can you tell us what topographical differences you observed between then and 1994, conditions of the road, whether -- the vegetation and that kind of thing?
A.	Yes, there were changes.  The trees that were there had been cut off, buildings had been erected and there was a tarred road that didn't exist before then.
MR. KAPAYA:
This is all I have from this witness, Your Honour.  Thank you, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the person you think is Mr. Ndindabahizi dressed in when you saw him in May, Madam Witness?
THE WITNESS:
He was wearing black clothes, a pair of trousers and a shirt.
MR. PRESIDENT.
How could you describe this person?
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to Ndindabahizi?
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
He was a very big person, with a big head and long ears with a flat nose.
JUDGE KHAN:
Is he present in the Court today?  Do you see him in the Court today?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he is in the courtroom.
JUDGE KHAN:
Could you tell us where he is sitting?
THE WITNESS:
Since I hadn't seen him -- I have not seen him for a very long time, and let me recall that I was very young at the time, but I think it is the person wearing a white shirt and a tie.
MR. KAPAYA:
Let the record reflect, Your Honour, that the witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT.
I am afraid we cannot let the record reflect that, Mr. Kapaya.  Are you pursuing this?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then you have to do the homework.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us where the person you say is Mr. Ndindabahizi is seated?  Could you stand up and show us; with leave of the Chamber.

Just to facilitate your identification, could you please stand up and look around and tell us where he is seated?
A.	I see him.  He is there seated behind the white people.  He is wearing a white shirt and a tie.  But I must add that I haven't seen him for a long time.  He is also wearing a black jacket.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, let the record now reflect that the witness has identified Mr. Ndindabahizi -- she has identified the Accused person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the colour of his trousers, Madam Witness?  What is the colour of his tie, for instance?
THE WITNESS:
He is wearing a black tie.

1715H
MR. PRESIDENT:
	 It is noted, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Cross-examination.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. Marçais will conduct the cross-examination.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Currently, in Arusha, you are living in a protected house, in a safe house?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Alone or with other persons?
A.	There are other persons in that house.
Q.	People with whom you could have formal or informal discussions?
A.	Yes, I do have conversations with them. 
Q.	And in particularly (sic), are you able to discuss the reasons for your trip to Arusha, matters relating to this case, the Ndindabahizi case with them?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you share your experiences regarding the various -- your various testimonies?
A.	Which persons are you talking about, Counsel?
Q.	You did say a while ago that you were not alone in that house, and I wanted to be specific.  You said there were people you could discuss with.  Are they your compatriots?
A.	These are officers of this Tribunal.
Q.	It appears you also said that these include witnesses in this case?
A.	No, I am talking about officers of the court.
Q.	Let me just finish.  But you live in the same house as they?
MR. KAPAYA: 
	Your Honour, this is something that may disclose the location of the witnesses in this Tribunal.  They are supposed to be staying in places which are referred to as safe locations.  So I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	You are quite right in raising the issue that we want to protect the witnesses, and also that, of course, we do not want to mention where the safe houses are, you are quite right in that.  But it seems to be quite difficult to imagine that the question, whether there are other witnesses living in a safe house, that that can disclose anything which is sensitive.  Would you agree with me?
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, at least --
MR. MARÇAIS:
I can only repeat the question of the President.  The location is immaterial, but are there other witnesses living in the same house where the witness is living or in the neighbourhood where Madam Witness is currently living in Arusha, that is my question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And if that's your objection, Mr. Kapaya, it is overruled.  

Answer the question.
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, there are other witnesses in the same house.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Madam, are you able to tell me how it is that your first testimony on this case is taking place seven years after -- it's seven years later?  You told the investigators that it is so important, why did you have to wait for so long before coming to testify?
A.	Questions were put to me on events that I knew about, and I gave my testimony.
Q.	Yes, I understand.  But did you not take the risk seven years after the facts?  Because if I look at your date of birth, you were about 16 or 17 years at the time of the events, and you revealed them when you were 24 years old.  I'm not doubting that your memory is no (sic) good, but why did you have to wait for so long?  Madam, don't be afraid of showing your face.  
MR. MARÇAIS:
Can the curtains be drawn?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Madam Witness?
MR. MARÇAIS:
Fully, so that we can see the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Madam Witness, the question is the following:  You -- are you listening?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, Mr. President, I am listening.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now, the question is the following:  This -- you were in touch with the investigators of the Tribunal in 2001.  How is it that your information was given to them in 2001, more -- about seven years after the events?

MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, maybe that question should be clarified because it is our office that goes looking for witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya --
MR. KAPAYA:
I am sorry, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that was improper.
MR. KAPAYA: 
I am sorry, Your Honour.  
  MR. PRESIDENT: 
      That was - please sit down. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
(No translation).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence counsel, we are now waiting for the questions -- for the witness.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Madam, let me repeat my question, and I'll wish this time around that it is the witness who answers.  Why is it that, given the fact that you have such an excellent memory, that you had to wait for seven years?  And let me -- and you waited for the Prosecutors to come and look for you.  One would have expected, one would have expected that this information would have been brought to the notice of the police.  How come that you waited for seven years to make a statement on such serious events as you are making today?
A.	I did not do so because nobody interviewed me on them.
Q.	Madam, are you a member of a victims association?
A.	I am not a member of any victims association.
Q.	And, Madam Witness, one last question:  Have you ever entered the premises or had you ever entered the premises of this Tribunal before this afternoon?
A.	No.
Q.	You have never entered a courtroom?
A.	I have been to a courtroom on another occasion, which is not today. 
Q.	But a courtroom of this Tribunal or another judicial system?
A.	It's a courtroom of the same Arusha Tribunal.
Q.	Then you have -- you had earlier entered the premises of this Tribunal?
A.	I had already seen this courtroom, but it is today that I have entered to give my testimony.
Q.	The Courts will evaluate that answer.  Let's move on.  
There are two problems in this case, and we would like to know the conditions under which you know or did not know the first time you met in 1990, 1991, 1992, Mr. Ndindabahizi to your knowledge.  If I compare your testimony of today and the one you made to the investigators, are you able to clarify where Mr. Ndindabahizi lived when you were born and grew up?
A.	I did not know where Mr. Ndindabahizi lived, but I knew his parents' house.
Q.	Very well.  In your statement to the investigators, you said that Ndindabahizi lived in Kigali from January until '94, and do you know approximately what date where Ndindabahizi lived without you knowing him, and can you be more specific today?
A.	I knew that Ndindabahizi lived in Kigali, but these are things that other people told me.  People told me he lived in Kigali, but I did not know exactly where in Kigali.
Q.	I am sorry, that is not my question.  My question was not to know his address in Kigali, which you do not know.  My question is to know since when, to your knowledge, was he living in Kigali?
A.	When I got to know Mr. Ndindabahizi, he lived in Kigali.  I was told that he lived in Kigali, but I did not see the locality in which he lived in Kigali.
Q.	Very well.  Let's then go to a number of statements.  You said that, "I know Ndindabahizi because we both hail from Gitesi.  I got to know that he lived in Kigali up to the beginning of the genocide."  As far as the circumstances that the Prosecutor referred to, you, before 1994, saw Ndindabahizi only three times?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Once in 1990, once in 1991 and once in 1992?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You said that on one occasion you saw him because he was visiting his parents?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In the family house?
A.	Yes.
MR. MARÇAIS:
I believe the Court will be very indulgent with me because this is my baptism of fire.  I might make some errors regarding the form.  I am very sorry about that.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	When you met him, was he somebody you met together with other persons or you met him one on one?  Was he introduced to you or was -- did somebody tell you that this is Mr. Ndindabahizi or the son of Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	Ndindabahizi was pointed out to me.  I was told that he is the son of so and so, so that he's the son of Hanyigwa, and he lives in Kigali. 
Q.	So such that you never spoke to him, you did not have any personal conversation with him, just that once or twice somebody pointed him out to you as Mr. Ndindabahizi, the son of so and so?
A.	Yes, that is how it happened.
Q.	But you yourself, you never approached him to ask him whether, "You are indeed Mr. Ndindabahizi, I am glad to meet you"?  Did you do any such thing?
A.	No, I could not.  I couldn't put such a question to him because I wasn't in the same age group as himself.  I don't know how he would have reacted to such a question.
Q.	So do you know what his profession was?  Do you know what he was doing in Kigali?
A.	No.
Q.	You didn't know -- not his parents, but did you know his wife, his children?  Do you know whether he had -- he was married, do you know whether he had children and, if so, how many?
A.	No, I did not know his family.
Q.	And you say by that that you know someone?
A.	I know him individually.
Q.	Another small point on which I would like to ask you some questions, Madam Witness:  In your written statement and also in your testimony today, you said that until the 12th of April, there was only one disquieting speech on the 7th of April 19 -- no, the 12th of April 1994, I beg your pardon.  That's some days after the killing of the president, but that Mugemagango, at the end of his speech, was stoned, but until then there had not been any looting nor any killings.  Can you confirm that?
A.	Yes, that was my testimony.
Q.	But you didn't attend that meeting yourself, did you?
A.	No.
Q.	So this Mr. Mugemagango was appealing for calm.  So who told you about what happened at that meeting and this call for peace or calm?
A.	It's people who attended the meeting who reported that to me.
Q.	You say also that when you left - that at the end of the meeting, looting and killings began.  How did you get to know about that?
A.	No, I was a witness of those activities.  I would see people destroying houses and burning them.
Q.	You situate the beginning of the killings after the 12th of April, is that correct, and --
A.	Yes, for -- as far as our secteur was concerned. 
Q.	Very well.  And I refer to the killings.  You say people started killing Tutsis.
A.	No.  It was rather on that date that the killings of the Tutsis in our secteur began.
Q.	Okay, very well.  So at the beginning -- the beginning of these killings was on the 12th of April, and what is referred to as the killings is that Tutsis were being killed?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Yes, all the Tutsis who were found were killed.
Q.	Without any discrimination of age, children, men, women, all Tutsis were killed; is that what you are saying? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Madam Witness, you testified that at that time, knowing the danger that you were running, you were risking, you left together with your mother.  I am sorry, I am referring to your statement.  You went to hide with your mother in two houses, and you didn't say whether they were distinct one from the other.  And then furthermore, a little while later you got to know that your mother was killed in that house.  Why did you not hide together with your mother?
A.	It was in order to avoid our -- us being killed at the same time.
Q.	In your written statement, when you say that the houses were not far from one another, in your opinion, how far away were they from each other, those two houses?
A.	About 40 metres.
Q.	During that attack and the killing of your mother, you didn't hear anything?  You didn't hear anything, and you were only informed about it later?  You didn't hear any cries, you didn't hear any noises accompanying that attack on your mother; did you?
A.	I didn't hear any noise.  Earlier -- I came to that house in the evening after my mother was killed, and her body was shown to me.
Q.	Very well.  Then you fled into Kibuye secteur, you went and sought refuge at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) house.  You didn't give his family name, but you were able to do so for his wife.  I believe it is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal). 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I'll request that that certain name be deleted from the record --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KAPAYA:
-- because the witness has said this is a name that is familiar in the area and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, we agree that this name will be struck from the transcripts and deleted from the video system.
MR. MARÇAIS:
I do apologise.  I can therefore not ask you any more specifics.  Can I mention the first name, (By order of the court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Is it a family name?  I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Defence counsel, you will remember that the witness asked specifically not to mention that name, and we have respected that, so now we strike it from the record for the second time.  

Now, we do not want that name mentioned, but you will easily be able to reformulate the question and achieve what you want.
MR. MARÇAIS:
(Not translated).
MR. KAPAYA:
Alternatively, Your Honour, he can use the writing method.  He can write on a piece of paper, show it to the witness, and then ask the question.
MR. MARÇAIS:
	No, no, I will not ask any more questions on that.  
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	But on the first name, one of these two people, it would seem it's the woman -- I can use the writing method, but the second person mentioned, the second person mentioned, it seems that that was your baptismal witness; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	Can you explain to me for my own personal information what is a baptismal witness, because I know that in the Catholic religion, you know that there are godparents and in marriages there are witnesses, but for baptismal, I do not know what you are referring to.  What is it exactly that you mean by that?
A.	No, this is my godmother.
Q.	I gave you the opportunity to make that correction.  I am sure you are happy about that.  

You state a little later that you hid for some weeks in their house, and then other Interahamwe, led by Sinishunga, came to the house looking for Tutsis.  So who is this Sinishunga?  The name is not known to us.  Who is this person?
A.	This was a citizen of that area who was leading the attacks.
Q.	If I were to put your testimony together with your written statement before the investigators, I place the scene, which makes Ndindabahizi appear in conditions which we will need to have explanations for, I place that in the middle of the month of May.  Would I be correct in doing so?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Mid-May? 
A.	In other words, the end of the month of May.
Q.	That's not quite correct, because if I look at what you say, this is what you stated.  You stated -- I am trying to find the place -- that you hid for two -- for three weeks in the house of the persons whose names I should not mention, and then you say you spent three weeks, "And during that period I was being told that the Tutsi population had been exterminated," and you then spent two weeks hiding in bushes.  And if we were to take that -- those periods of time, this takes us to the middle of May.  Wasn't it the middle of May?
A.	It's towards the end of May.
Q.	Very well.  After leaving the house of your godmother, you were chased by Sinishunga and his acolytes.  You fled and you went to hide in bushes.  That was a rather tragic situation, and everybody is aware of that.  How were you able to survive, because this was practically one month?  How were you able to survive for a whole month in the bushes?
A.	When I left the place known as Fayer, I went to settle along Nyabahanga river.  I left that place to look for food.  When I came back, I met a group of people who were going to cultivate sorghum.  One of these people came to me and attacked me with a knife on the head, but that person only wounded me.  He did not kill me.  I gave him a note of 5,000 shillings which I had with me.  

I went towards Nyabahanga River, and that's where I saw aircraft flying overhead.  And I asked people why the planes were there, because I thought they were looking for Tutsis.  I went back to the person who had provided me shelter.  They opened the door.  I told them, "I see there are planes circling in the sky.  Why are they there?"  And those people told me that they were French planes which had come to put an end to the war, and they asked me remain in the house because, they said, the war was coming to an end.
Q.	Well, is that the incident that you place at the end of May?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Madam Witness, do you hear us?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, I am listening.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, first of all, when you are asked questions, please listen carefully.  The question posed by counsel some time ago was simply, "How did you survive hiding in the bushes?"  He didn't want you to repeat all your evidence.  But leaving that aside, now the question is this episode about giving a person a note and seeing the planes.  When was that?  Was it before or after the alleged episode with Mr. Ndindabahizi?
THE WITNESS: 
	It was after seeing Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And when was it?  When did you make those observations about the planes and the person hurting you?  
THE WITNESS: 
	I mentioned this in my written statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we know, but we are asking you now orally.  Do you remember now?
THE WITNESS: 
	I don't remember, but it was towards the end of the war.  It was in June.
MR. MARÇAIS:
By your leave, Mr. President, I want to come back to this incident, and I want to go again back to the date for the last time because it's got a lot of inconsistencies. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	So Madam Witness, I want to go back to the instance during which you claim you saw 
Mr. Ndindabahizi and the circumstances you spoke of a moment ago.  So I want to come back to this one last time to remind you that in one instance you said that it was in the middle of May, and today you are saying that it was at the end of May.  Now, can you remember exactly when it was that you saw this incident?
MR. KAPAYA:
I object to that recitation.  The witness has said it was towards the end of May, and at no time had she said that it was in the middle of May.  Counsel is misleading the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Well, in fact, my note is that at the beginning she gave a different indication of time, but I don't want to recall that now.  

So Madam Witness, the point now is, there is some unclarity or lack of clarity as to exactly when this episode with Mr. Ndindabahizi took place.  Now, you have told us it was in May.  When in May, beginning, middle or end?  Can you help us with that, please.
THE WITNESS: 
	It was at the end of May.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	Therefore, that means that you spent a month in the bushes in Fayer, and I am repeating the question which you didn't answer:  How did you survive?  What did you drink, what did you eat during this whole month?  Because if we were to look at your answer, this is a question which arises.
A.	I went to dig in the fields. I went to dig up sweet potatoes, and I was eating wild fruits, and I was drinking the water from the Nyabahanga River.
Q.	And during this whole time you were hiding in the same bush close to the roadblock at Fayer?
A.	I was on the shores of Nyabahanga River.
Q.	Very well, we'll come back to that incident.  Where were you sleeping during that whole month?
A.	But I was sleeping in the bushes.
Q.	So this is an area which is densely populated, as we were told by the investigator.  Were you not afraid of being found out?
A.	What area are you talking about?
Q.	We are dealing with the area near the roadblock near Fayer, and you said you lived there for a month.
A.	I beg your pardon?  When I was drinking the water from the Nyabahanga River, I was living on the banks of that river and not close to the place which was referred to as Fayer.
Q.	Is it an area which is highly populated or densely populated?
A.	Which place are you referring to, which area?
Q.	Well, the secteur, the cellule about which we are speaking, Madam Witness.
A.	Are you referring to the area near the place called Fayer or are talking about the banks of the river, Nyabahanga River?
Q.	Wherever you were when you were hiding.
A.	But I am asking you whether you are referring to the area known as Fayer or are you referring to Nyabahanga?
Q.	Well, we will come to Nyabahanga a little bit later.  Maybe it's a good idea to have known what was happening in the various areas, but we have to follow it all chronologically.  I think we are speaking about the incident which you have referred to on the banks of Nyabahanga River.  I am speaking about the time where, for about a month, you were hiding in bushes close to the roadblock at Fayer.
A.	No, but I didn't spend a whole month in that place.
Q.	How much time, then, did you spend there?
A.	Two weeks.
Q.	So we will have problems of chronology, chronology, which don't only contradict one another, but they are also inconsistent.  You say you spent three weeks at your godmother's house.  Unfortunately, I have to look at this chronology myself.  After the -- on the 13th of April, you went to your godmother and you spent three weeks there.  That takes us to the 4th of May.  And you say, "I spent three weeks in my godmother's house."  That takes you to the end of April.  And then three weeks you went to the place which was close to the Fayer roadblock. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
And I am saying, Mr. President, that there is inconsistency, and I want to determine where it arises from.
  MR. KAPAYA:
      Your Honour -
  MR. MARÇAIS:
      The witness has just said that she had spent two weeks there and not one month.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	There is a need to simplify the proceedings now.  Defence counsel, you are using too many words and you are mixing the questions with argumentation, and that is not simplifying your communication with this witness.  So it's important, for ease of communication, just to concentrate on the brief questions and receive, hopefully, the brief answers.  And then you will later address the Bench on alleged inconsistencies.  So if you would assist us in this way, then, as I say, it will become more efficient.
MR. MARÇAIS:
I shall repeat my question.  I had thought I heard the witness said that she only remained for two weeks there.  I am reading and I can hear, "I spent three weeks at my godmother's house and then two weeks in the bushes near the Fayer roadblock."  This seems to take us to the middle of May, but the witness has just mentioned the end of May, and I want to have for clarification because this seems to me to be inconsistency.
MR. KAPAYA: 
	May I make a comment, Your Honour?  The witness is talking of a period of "about".  She is not saying exactly three weeks, she is not saying exactly two weeks.  She is saying about two weeks, about three weeks.  I think counsel should take this into account when posing his question to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But in fact we have now, we have now been circling around this issue, beginning of May, middle of May and end of May, for quite some time.  I think we know the witness's answer.  The answer is the end of May.  She has been asked many times now.  The question, then, is whether that is inconsistent with a calculation based on the calendar, and that is something you will come back to later.  You have made your point.  You have made your point that there is an inconsistency, in your view.
MR. MARÇAIS:
It's the last answer given by the witness in which she said, when I asked her how she survived for a whole month, she said, "No, not a month, a fortnight."  And I said at that time that if we were to do the arithmetic and look at the statement, this brings us to the middle of May.  That was a mere observation I was making.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That's braking in open doors.  That we have understood.  So what is the next question?
MR. MARÇAIS:
Very well, Mr. President.
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	When we read about your presence near the roadblock near Fayer, you state that you were about 5 metres away from the roadblock.  A question arises here, Madam Witness:  You are in great danger, great danger of death.  Would it have been reasonable for you to be 5 metres away, even only just to hear everything, without considering the risk -- without considering the danger that you were risking?
(Pages 43 to 53 by Petrus Chijarira)














	1800H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear the question, madam?  The question is, if you were afraid, why only be five metres away? 
THE WITNESS:
These people were on the road, and I was above the road.  There was a kind of mound, and I was overlooking the road.  These people could not see me, and they didn't know I was there. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	You said two vehicles arrive at the roadblock manned by the Hutus and that there you recognised, from behind the bushes, Ndindabahizi that you had seen on about two occasions earlier.  You -- he was not introduced to you.  And you said, "I saw Ndindabahizi speaking to the Tutsi." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But counsel corrects that to say that, "He spoke to the people who were manning the roadblock."
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	And the persons manning the roadblock could not see you, but they could hear you moving since you were close by. 
A.	They could not see me.  There were some eucalyptus trees, and I was uphill from them and they could not see me. 
Q.	The person that you claim is called Ndindabahizi allegedly said, "Have you finished with the Tutsis?"  Is that correct?
A.	He posed the following question:  "Have you finished killing the Tutsi?" 
Q.	Apart from this scene, have you ever witnessed any other massacre scenes? 
A.	No.
Q.	You never went to Bisesero?
A.	No. 
Q.	You give two different answers but quite similar.  That was -- with regard to the answer that was given to Ndindabahizi, "They did not kill everybody.  They did not kill women and children"; is that correct?  Let me use your expression again.  "They did not kill women and children of Hutu mothers."  Is that correct? 
A.	I said, and I repeat, he posed the following question:  "Have you finished killing the Tutsis?"  And they said, "Yes, we only -- we did not kill women who -- Tutsis who had married Hutus." 
Q.	So they did not kill Tutsi women if they had a Hutu husband; that is correct?  But you said a while ago that on the 12th of April, to your knowledge, they had killed all the Tutsis.
A.	No, I did not say that they killed all the Tutsis.  I said they were in the process of killing the Tutsi. 
Q.	Well, it appears -- I've been asked not to mix the questions and the arguments, but if you -- the issue was on a general question on men, women, and children.  But on the 13th April, you did not indicate that they did not kill some category of people.
When you said that they did not kill persons this day, who is it referring to? 
A.	I don't follow your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Let me quote, madam.  Ndindabahizi put the question, "Have you finished with the Tutsi?  And they answered him."  I don't know who the "they" are.  Who are these "they"?  Who are these "they" referring to? 
A.	The persons who answered his question were the Hutus who were at the roadblock. 
Q.	So "they" referred to the Hutus who were at the roadblock.  And the other "they," who does it refer to?
A.	The Kayenzi secteur, Tutsi women who had Hutu husbands who were not killed, and as well as children who had Hutu mothers but Tutsi husbands -- Tutsi fathers, I'm sorry.
Q.	Let's continue with your testimony.  Ndindabahizi came in a vehicle, in a small pick-up with about five persons -- Mr. Ndindabahizi was not driving his car himself -- in a green pick-up; is that correct?  Witness, did you say 400 persons? 
A.	No.  Ndindabahizi came with four or five persons.  His car was driven by a driver, and it was a small pick-up with four or five persons.  
Q.	So that makes it four -- that makes it five or six persons; is that correct? 
A.	I did say that there were three persons in the -- in Ndindabahizi's car, two persons plus Ndindabahizi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, can counsel wait for the interpretation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The break -- please remember the pause between the answer and the question so we can have time for translation, for interpretation, please. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	In a pick-up, a while ago you said that there were other persons, two, three persons in Ndindabahizi's private vehicle who came to the roadblock; is that correct? 
A.	No, that's not what I said.
Q.	I thought I understood you to say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that there was a roadblock manned by Hutus, and that the two vehicles we are referring to come to the roadblock under the conditions that you recounted. 

Did the roadblock already exist with the Hutus manning it when the vehicles, that you referred to as Ndindabahizi's vehicle and the pick-up -- 
A.	The roadblock was there.
Q.	And manned by about how many persons? 
A.	There were many.  About 15, but I didn't count them. 
Q.	Were they -- or, who were these people?  Did you know them?  Were they holding their famous machete?  How were they? 
A.	Well, I did not know them.  I didn't live in that locality.  They were wielding machetes and clubs, and that is clubs that we call ntampongano.
Q.	So you saw the person that you call Ndindabahizi arrive together with another vehicle on a roadblock kept by 15 persons, about 15 persons wielding machetes? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	You said that in a green pick-up -- when you saw the green pick-up approaching --
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the witness needs to tend to her baby. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Madam Witness, I think it is good if you could leave the courtroom for a moment and look after your baby, but I don't think we should close the session for today, we just take a little break.  So shall we say about ten minutes? 

What is your view on the situation, Mr. Kapaya?  What is the need?
MR. KAPAYA:
Ten minutes would do, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, yes.  Let's do that, then. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
I shall defer to the wisdom of the Court.  I have no question (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we adjourn for ten minutes.
	(Court recessed from 1812H to 1830H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.  And if we could finish this witness by seven, I think that would be preferable. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Yes, I'll do that.  I'll ask three quick questions. 
BY MR. MARÇAIS:
Q.	It seems that there's a small confusion, Madam Witness.  A moment ago I was speaking to you about where you were hiding in a mound or close to the roadblock near Fayer, and you say you were drinking water from the river.  I think you may have confused this with the time when you had fled to the place close to Nyabahanga river. 
A.	Yes, I did make that mistake.  At the time when I was in that place, I didn't have anything to drink or eat.  Sometimes I could have had bananas given to me by people who, like me, were fleeing.
Q.	I'm now coming to the last episode -- no, let me go back to the episode following the Ndindabahizi. 

At the roadblock you were saying Ndindabahizi was speaking to the Hutus, you are referring, undoubtedly, to the Hutus who were manning the roadblock, unless I am mistaken?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And it was to those Hutus that he was saying, "Take up the machetes and kill them all"? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, on the episode dealing with the Nyabahanga river, you said in your written statement that you met a Hutu carrying a spear who struck you and wounded you, and today you talked about a Hutu who threatened you, so which is the truth?  Which is which? 
A.	I said that he struck me with his spear on the head and that I gave him 5,000 Rwandan francs.
Q.	Were they Rwandan francs?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You had kept this 5,000 francs throughout this very difficult time? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall the colour of that note? 
A.	It was a note of 5,000 Rwandan francs such as was used before the war. 
Q.	(No translation).
A.	I don't remember.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. MARÇAIS:
Mr. President, I'm done. 
MR. KAPAYA:
One question, Your Honour. 
RE-EXAMINATION
MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Madam Witness --
MR. KAPAYA:
I don't see the witness. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	You were asked by counsel whether, apart from the Accused person and his parents, do you know any other relatives, blood relatives of the Accused person?
A.	I would see them as they went by, but I didn't know their names. 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's fine, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the persons manning the roadblock, I understood that you told us that before 
Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived, they were armed with machetes; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, why would, then, Mr. Ndindabahizi give them machetes and give them the order, based on this provision of machetes, to go and kill Tutsi if they already had weapons? 
THE WITNESS:
But he had brought them the machetes.  And some of these people did not have machetes, they only had clubs which are known as ntampongano. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So not all persons at the roadblocks had machetes, is that your testimony, before Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.  That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

I have a question I think, rather, to the Prosecution, but the witness should be waiting in case we may need her.

Now, this Fayer roadblock, in our bundle of documents which you produced as Prosecution Exhibit 2 there is a document which seems to be relevant to this episode, and this sketch seemed to have a link with that particular witness.  Isn't that so, Mr. Kapaya? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, that's right, Your Honour.  Actually, that particular roadblock is referred to on page L0019875 of Exhibit P2, and sketch 3, sketch 3 on page L0019873. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Seven-eight?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, 78 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.
MR. KAPAYA:
-- and 75.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, so sketch 3, and that coincides with the question to the investigators who mentioned the pseudonym of this witness in connection with sketch 3.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the investigator (sic) went to show him where it was.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so this -- where on the page L0019875 do we find this particular roadblock?  Can you assist us with that? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's on R2, Your Honour.  Sorry, R2, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
R3? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No, R2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
R2.
MR. KAPAYA:
R2 is the Fayer roadblock.  R3 is the Nyabahanga river, Nyabahanga roadblock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this follow from the map itself? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  It follows there on the right-hand side, "R2 roadblock, ref. sketch 3."  That's the link, is it?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, yes.  Okay, then, we have located that.  And if you now compare this map L0019875 with the big map, with the bigger map, for instance, the map on the preceding page, would we find this on the same map in a more large scale? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, if we look closely, Your Honour, we can see it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, all right.  If it's difficult to find right away, I still think it would be useful to make sure that we know exactly where the roadblock is.  So if the parties could simply agree upon and, at a convenient moment, come back to the Bench and show us exactly on the big map where we are when we look at the small-scale map, that would be helpful.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we'll revert to Your Honour in due course.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much, indeed.

Madam Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  We thank you very much for coming to the Tribunal and giving your evidence.  We wish you a safe journey home and ask you kindly not to discuss your testimony with anyone.

When it comes to the particular episode you mentioned, that you had been approached, that will be looked into in the appropriate forum. 

So we wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the last available witness, Prosecution, and I understand even that if we're short of witnesses, that is because one of the witnesses did not travel to Arusha from Kigali, in spite of the fact that you had asked that witness to come.  Is that so, Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the reason why there is not the witness this time is because this was an unforeseen circumstance. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  That's what they say.  That's what they tell me.  I have no way of verifying that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It may well be as a direct result of the comments we've heard from witnesses this week, and that's a matter that I would address in due course.  I have no way of verifying the circumstances that have led to this witness.  As far as I'm aware, when we had a status conference, Your Honour was told that all was well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you did tell us, didn't you --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Not me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in your e-mail of 1st of September that, "As you are already aware, this witness did not travel to Arusha last Friday"?  And that was before the testimony started, wasn't it? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I became aware of it on Friday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So in other words, I don't think there is a link between testimony given this week and the non-appearance of this witness because --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, the events that surround the testimony given this week happened before they came here, that's my point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're talking not about what happened in court.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're talking about pre-trial issues.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Well, we'll look into that.  And this implies that when do we meet again, at 2:00 next Monday?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On Monday, yes. 

Your Honour, there's a procedural matter that I need to address the Court on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before doing so, are we in a position now to indicate the order of the, say, five witnesses that have arrived in Arusha, or will you do that in 24 hours' time?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It would be as indicated, from number five down; in other words, five, six, seven, eight, nine, in that order. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We have finished number one, two, three, and 18.  So you are saying that it will be number five, six, seven onwards? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that sequence?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now you have something you would like to raise.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  It's a matter that troubles me very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour would -- is aware -- Your Honours are aware of the provisions of Rule 85, Rule 85(B) in particular. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We might excuse the witness?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, she's been excused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can we have the registry escort the witness out, please?
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you will now be escorted out of the courtroom because we are now addressing another matter which is not related to your testimony. 

Please, you have to draw the curtains, of course. 
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You referred to Rule 85, Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
85(B) in particular.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm interested in the provisions of that rule.  And whilst I am mindful of the fact that Judges may at any stage -- Your Honours may at any stage put questions to witnesses whilst they're testifying in this courtroom, it has to be said on the record that such questions cannot be seen to compromise either the case of the Prosecution or, indeed, that of the Defence.  Certainly that is not the idea behind Rule 85(B).

We're all officers of the court, and indeed, be us on the Bench or at the bar, my training suggests that we're all officers of the court.  And as officers of the court, we have a duty to our clients, be you the Prosecution or the Defence, and in exercising that duty, we do it, at least my training tells me that we do it, with the utmost courtesy to the Bench and, perhaps, often expect that that courtesy be extended to us, be us the Prosecution or the Defence.
Now, a situation arose this evening, Your Honour, which I find extremely regrettable, where my learned friend and colleague, a very senior member of the Tanzanian bar, was stopped and restrained and almost bullied from asking or objecting to a question which he felt was extremely pertinent and legitimate which -- the result of which may have ended up compromising the evidence of a Prosecution evidence.

Now, the position is this:  He makes an observation following a question from Your Honour, and he does it in good faith.  He does it as a result of his duty, as an officer of this court, to protect that witness.  He did so, being extremely courteous to the Bench.  I would leave this courtroom this evening with the regrettable feeling that that courtesy may not have been extended to him as a result of the way Your Honour intervened and restrained him from asking that question, and I regret that.  And I must say, as lead counsel representing the Prosecution, I regret that.

I would also add that if I had a younger and more junior counsel assisting me today, the end result of which would have been such a lawyer may have been frightened out of his or her wits, unable to continue with the job that I have assigned him to do this evening, and that in itself would have compromised my case.

I leave this courtroom this evening with a feeling that, unfortunately, somewhere along the line that courtesy, which I expect as Prosecution counsel, has not been extended to the Prosecution.

I'm grateful for your attention.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for drawing our attention to this issue, Mr. Phillips.  I am now happy to make my contribution so that you will not leave the courtroom with that feeling; neither should Mr. Kapaya do so. 

What happened here was quite normally only the issue that there was, during a question by the Defence, an objection by the Prosecution.  That is perfectly legitimate, and, as you just said, that is what any officer of the court is expected to do.  What happened, however, was that that particular objection was formed in a way which could indicate the answer to that witness.  Now, this happens on many occasions, and we all know that that is something that should be avoided.

There was certainly no -- any intention to hurt anyone or to not express courtesy.  And Mr. Kapaya and I, we have worked together in this courtroom for a long time and in many cases, and you know I have the utmost respect for Mr. Kapaya, and that respect is unchanged.  And you will then note that after that particular episode where I had to stop him, because the objection was suggestive, that the cooperation in a very courteous manner continued, in my view, from both sides.

So I do not think we should blow up this episode, and it's my absolute belief that we will continue, as we have done previously, to cooperate to the fullest extent.  Thank you very much.

Now, the Court is now adjourned to Monday at two o'clock.
