Q.	Where did they live?
A.	They lived in Gasharu.
Q.	For how long, since when did they live in Gasharu?
A.	Well, when I was born, they were there.  I believe it was my grandfather that settled there, initially.
Q.	How many brothers and sisters did you have?
A.	I had four sisters and two brothers.
Q.	They were -- were they also living in Gasharu?
A.	Well, there was a brother that lived in Gasharu even today.  There is also one sister that still lives in Gasharu; another sister that lives in the neighbouring cellule to Gasharu, very near called Gahigiro so that we have one brother and two sisters that live in Gasharu or in its environments.
Q.	What is the first name of that - - of your sister that still lives in Gasharu today?
A.	Mariana is the first name, sir.
Q.	When was she born?
A.	She was born after me, she came just after me.  She will be in 1952 approximately.  She comes directly after me.
Q.	Mariana, your sister, did she have any children?
A.	Yes, sir.  She had children.
Q.	How many?
A.	She had two children, only two, sir.
Q.	What were their names, what are their names?
A.	The first one was called, Ngabo, Boniface and the second is Mutirende, Jack.
Q.	Who was the father of Jack Mutirende, Witness?
A.	Kajeguhakwa was the name.
Q.	Of what ethnic group?
A.	He was Tutsi, sir.
Q.	And Jack Mutirende, what was his ethnic group?
A.	His father's ethnic group that is Tutsi, sir.
Q.	Do you have any other living sister that lives in Gasharu or in any surrounding areas of Gasharu at this time?
A.	I did say, that is, that there was a sister, the elder sister that lives in Gahigiro, that is a neighbouring cellule to Gasharu cellule, so that - - she lives very near the Gasharu cellule.
Q.	And what is her name?
A.	Her name is Nyiranteziryayo, Adella.
Q.	Could you spell Adella's name please? 
A.	N-Y-I-R-A-N-T-E-Z-I-R-Y-A-W, sorry, A-Y-O, Y-A-Y-O, Nyiranteziryayo, Y-A-Y-0.  It's a very long name.  Adella is the first name.
Q.	Did Adella have any children?
A.	Yes, indeed, she did have children.
Q.	Did some of the children get married in turn?
A.	Yes, indeed, they got married, some of her children.
Q.	Did they marry Tutsis?
A.	There is a girl that married a Tutsi.
Q.	Are those children still alive today?
A.	I did not hear you properly.  Whose children are you referring to?
Q.	Please give us the names of the children, first.  There are the children of your sister Adella.
A.	Well, the children are many.  She had more than ten children.  One was Mukamakasha, one was Mukarinika.
Q.	Just a minute. What I am interested in is the names of the children that married Tutsis.
A.	Yes, sir, I am sorry. Now the girl that married a Tutsi was called Wera. W-E-R-A.  It's a "U", 
U-W-E-R-A, Uwera.  She married a Tutsi.
Q.	Did Uwera have any children herself?
A.	Yes, she did have children.
Q.	What is the ethnic group of the children you have just referred to?
A.	It's the same, the children - - the children's ethnic group is the ethnic group of the father.  So if the father was a Tutsi, the children were also Tutsis.  They were therefore Tutsis.
Q.	Now, those Tutsi children, are they still alive today?
A.	No, sir.  They are not alive today.
Q.	Were they murdered?
A.	Yes, sir, that is correct.
Q.	Do you know when and under which circumstances they are murdered?
A.	Yes, I know that they were murdered between April and June 1994. That was therefore during the tragedy events that engulfed their country.  It was at that period that I learnt of the fact that they had been murdered.
Q.	And, do you know by whom, who murdered them?
A.	Well, sister, Nyiranteziryayo, Adella, talked to me about it when we met in June 1994, and she was the one that was the first who told me that Uwera's children, two of them, had been killed by one fellow whose father she knew, but you would appreciate that when we were here recently in this courtroom, one of the witnesses told us that it was he himself that murdered them.  So that the witness that stood here did corroborate that he killed them.  I heard him say so.  So my sister did mention that to me too.
JUDGE KHAN:
All the children were murdered?

THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	I was told that two children were murdered.  No, no, Your Honour, I said that there were ten children from my sister, but the two were Uwera's children, that is Uwera's -- my sister's sister.   So the children of my sister's younger sister.  Now, when I was asked how many children they were, I said ten and I was then told that one wanted to know whether among the ten some of them married any Tutsis, and that is the time I talked about Uwera.  Uwera had two children who were murdered.  Uwera had two children.  So it was her grandchildren. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, along the same lines as Judge Khan, what is your relationship with the Tutsi children that we are talking about?
A.	Now, these are the grandchildren of my sister, Nyiranteziryayo, that is the grandchildren, they are my grandchildren.  This is the type of relationship we have as far as our family is concerned. 
Q.	But if we are talking about the grandchildren of your sister, we should be talking about your
grand nephews?
A.	Grandnephews, well, I don't know in our own language we simply say grandchildren and this is -- this is, well, I translated in French.  In our language, it's grandchildren.  If they are the grandchildren of my sister, in my language, they are my grandchildren.  They are the grandchildren of my brothers they are the grandchildren of my other sisters.  This is how we say it.  I don't know how you say it in French.
Q.	Very well, point taken.  

Now our last question is one, Mr. Ndindabahizi:  Could write on a piece of paper the name of the witness that according to you, murdered those children, please?
A.	It was not according to me, because he stated so here.  I heard it here, and it is not according to me.  He said that he killed Nyiranteziryayo's children and he is the husband of my sister, Nyiranteziryayo.  
Q.	I see the one you are referring to, Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
MR. BESNIER:
Could we tender this as an exhibit, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	D. 54, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 54 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, let's finish this biographical section.  Your father, did he have brothers and sisters?
A.	Yes, my father had a brother and two sisters.
Q.	What is the name of your father's eldest sister - - of your father's eldest sister?
A.	She was called Nyirakaje.
Q.	How do you spell that?
A.	N-Y-I-R-A-K-A-J-E, Nyirakaje, N-Y-I-R-A-K-A-J-E, Nyirakaje.
Q.	Was she married?
A.	Yes, she was -- she was married.
Q.	To whom?
A.	She was married to one Gashema.  Her husband was called Gashema.
Q.	How do you spell Gashema?
A.	I spell it, G-A-S-H-E-M-A, Gashema.
Q.	What was Gashema's ethnic group?
A.	He was Tutsi, sir.
Q.	Nyirakaje and Gashema, did they have any children?
A.	Yes, they had children, sir.
Q.	Cyprien Karegeya, is that one of the children?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	What is the relationship, how would she appear to Karegeya?
A.	The mother was my aunt so that Karegeya was my cousin.
Q.	Now, tell me, Mr. Ndindabahizi, how did you get along with your cousin especially with Karegeya?  How did you get along?
A.	Well, we had no problems between myself and Karegeya and members of his family, that there were no problems at all.  We had no problems.  There were no problems at all between myself and Karegeya.  The members of our families, there were no problems that I knew of, sir.
Q.	What primary school did you go to, sir?
A.	I attended the Kirambo primary school but I also attended Nyagasomwa at primary six.  And at primary six, I ended the primary cycle there to move on to secondary school. I was at Nyagato then that is one year after that.
Q.	Now these schools at Kirambo and Nyagato, were they in the Kibuye Préfecture or in another préfecture in Rwanda?
A.	The préfecture was Kibuye, Gitesi commune was - - that primary school was very near my area.
Q.	Now, what secondary schools did you attend, or which secondary school?
A.	Well, after the primary school, I -- that was in 1964, I attended the Shyogwe secondary school and then I attended the Official College of Kigali, that was another secondary I attended in Kigali. 
Q.	Now, let's recapitulate.  First of all, Shyogwe, the secondary school.  Shyogwe, would you spell it?
A.	It's spelt, S-H-O, I am sorry. YO, S-H-Y-O-G-W-E, S-H-Y-O-G-W-E, Shyogwe.
Q.	Which préfecture was -- which préfecture was Shyogwe?
A.	Shyogee was in the Gitarama Préfecture.
Q.	Do you remember the years during which you attended Shyogwe secondary school?
A.	It was from '64 to '67, that is the basical cycle, three years course '64 to '67 and then  '64 to '70, I went to the college officiel de Kigali, that is the Official College of Kigali.
Q.	At what date were you at the Official College in Kigali?
A.	Between '77 and '70 - - rather '67 and '70, '67 and 70, that is correct. 
Q.	Very well.  If I get you correctly, from 1964 you were no longer in school in Kibuye; that is correct?
A.	That is correct.  It was Gitarama and then Kigali.
Q.	Now with which money did you attend school in Gitarama and then Gitarama?  Were your parents rich?  Did you have any financial assistance?  How did you do that?
A.	Well, at the secondary school in Shyogwe, it was our parents that went around it, saving cattle, goats, we had some.  We had some cows and my parents sold them, that was so that we could go to school for three years, in Shyogwe with that funding from the family.  But when I got to Kigali, the family had become impoverished, and the two cows had been sold, the goats as well.  So they had to turn to the church.  I went to the Church that is Presbyterian Church of Rwanda because I am a protestant.  I knew that they had some funds for funding studies for poor or impoverished children, so that I was listed, and it was the church that paid for my fees for the three years that I spent at the college official de Kigali, that is the official school in Kigali.
Q.	Now following the Kigali College, did you go on to further your studies?
A.	After the Kigali College, I went on to the university.
Q.	Which was your speciality, which special field that you studied?
A.	I was in social and economic sciences, sir.
Q.	And at the end of your university studies which diploma did you obtain?
A.	I went in university in two stages, first as baccalauréat which I ended in 1974 with a bachelor degree in economics and social sciences and then I went straight into bachelor's course or a licence course that I finished with a licence in management.  That was in 1976.
Q.	Very well.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, we have a certain number of documents to tender to the Court that is the diplomas obtained by Mr. Ndindabahizi.  This is supposed to be very important because we are trying to show that Mr. Ndindabahizi did not study in the Kibuye préfecture, but rather in the school established very away.  We have the Arts Diploma, Diploma in Humanities, and then the beccalauréat and then bachelor's degree or the licence obtained by Mr. Ndindabahizi in 1976.  The Prosecution has already received these documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  You want these documents tendered now; don't you not?  And --
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, with your leave, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
And you want to start maybe with the one from 1970; don't you?
MR. BESNIER:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Okay.  Do you have it ready, Registry, Kigali, the 26th of June 1970, is it?  That's D. 55.  And there is one for 1994, isn't it?  That would be D. 56.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you secured one in 1976; isn't it?  So we have one from '74 and one from '76 and they would 56 and 57 exhibits for the Defence, yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. 55, D. 56 and D. 57 admitted)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, let's move on.  I would like to know if during your studies, your secondary and university studies, if you regularly returned to your family in Gasharu?
A.	I don't know what you mean by regularly because the school year is divided into three terms and at the end of each term, I would go home to spend the vocation with my family.  So during my secondary studies and even at the university studies at the end of the term, I would go home to Gasharu.  I would spend two weeks if I had two weeks' leave, because those were small vacation and we had the big vacations in July through to September.  I would spend those months at home in Gasharu.  That is how it always was.
Q.	That is very clear, thank you.  When did your parents pass away, Mr. Witness?
A.	May father died in 1980.  My mother passed away in 1984.
Q.	After you received your university degree, did you begin your professional life?
A.	I did immediately thereafter.
Q.	How did you do so?  What did you do?
A.	I didn't do anything.  In fact, I did an internship, post degree internship at Trafipro in the cooperative.  That was in 1975.  When I finished my degree, that cooperative asked me to come and work there.  That was in 1976.  The chief of personnel came to see me at the university.  He said, "You have a good internship in our cooperative.  Why don't you come and help us?"  And that is how I began in 1976.  In fact, the day after I received by degree, I didn't go home; I went straight to Trafipro to work.
Q.	What were your activities, what were the activities rather at Trafipro, at that cooperative?
A.	Trafipro is a consumer cooperative.  It had stores throughout the country, thirty or so throughout the country, and it had its base in Kigali, in Kabgayi.  That is where the general-director's office and the general services offices were, but the stores were scattered about the entire country and they sold consumer goods, clothing, food, cloth, even farming implements for the farmers.
Q.	Where were assigned within the cooperative?
A.	In the general services department, the director's office.  First, I worked in the finance department.  We called it the department before it was called the division. I worked there for three months.  After three months, I was appointed as head of that section and I think this was in 1976.  I don't remember the exact date, but I think it was around that time.
Q.	In fact, I wanted to ask you in which city you were working, that was the gist of my question?
A.	First in Gitarama in Kibuye and in Kigali. The three months before I was appointed temporary head of section was spent in Kabgayi in Gitarama.  Then when I was appointed chief or head of section, head of the finance section, I was transferred to Kigali.  That's where the management was and all the purchasing and other functions were held there in Kigali.
Q.	Did you work in another branch office for Trafipro?
A.	No.  I didn't work in any branch office.  I worked in the general director's office. I was head of the finance division. I wasn't in the stores.  The stores were the managers' vendors.  I was not a vendor; I was head of the finance department in Kigali.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But you mentioned that you had been or had an internship; was it so?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Yes.  Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where was that please? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	That was in 1975 at the accounting department of Trafipro in Kabgayi.  After that - - after my degree, I went directly to that division.  And I became head of that division at the end 1976. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Did you ever do any auditing in any other branch offices of Trafipro in Rwanda?
A.	I was not an auditor.  I was head of the finance section, but I was not an auditor.  There was another division; there was the sales division and made the audits in the branch offices.  So the organisation chart is very clear.  There is a parallel directive to my division and that was the sales or divisional services.  That division did audit in the stores.  They had auditors and they moved about from branch to branch to conduct their audit.  My finance division did not have those responsibilities.  We were not charged with auditing the stores.  Therefore, I didn't have that authority to go into the stores nor did my employees.  We were not auditors.  Anything that came from the stores went to the auditors of the auditing papers and there was a sales division that took care of that.  My employees and I did not have the right to audit the stores.  I don't know if that is clear to you, Counsel.

JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you mean to say you never remained a salesman?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Did you ever visit any Trafipro local department in the Kibuye area?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	No.  I did not go into the branches.  The head of sales and the auditors in the sales department had that mission.  They were in charge of auditing the stores and branches.  I did not have the responsibility for auditing stores and the branch offices.  I did not therefore go into them.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That leaves us the auditing issue:  Did you ever visit that area and in particular the Trafipro department in that geographical area? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	There was only one Trafipro store in Kibuye.  In fact, in general, there was one per préfecture, they weren't many.  So my responsibility was not to go into the stores to the branches.  So I did not visit them.  There were auditors in the sales division who did that work.  My work was at the office in the finance department.  We waited for reports given to us by those who were responsible for gathering the data, from those who were responsible for conducting the audit, that is to say, the sales division.
JUDGE BOSSA:
What were your duties as head of finance department?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	I had to supervise the accounting.  I have the chief accountant working for me as well as his deputy.  At one point, I even had an advisor, a Swiss advisor, and I had the chief of office who bought supplies the office, he was in charge of procurement for the office.  I also had a secretary but our duties - - our main duty was to supervise the accounting operation and their accountants. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	How much time did you spend at Trafipro? 
A.	I arrived in 1976 and I left 1981.  I believe if I remember correctly, that is the amount of time I spent there.
MR. BESNIER:
Well, Mr. President, we have a document here from the Trafipro cooperative confirming that 
Mr. Ndindabahizi worked as the chief of the finance division and chief of the general services for Trafipro from November 1976 to December 1981, and we would like to tender the original version of this document as a Defence exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And this is the document which the Defence has obtained recently in Kigali? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	D. 58.
	(Exhibit No. D. 58 admitted)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Why did you leave Trafipro, Mr. Ndindabahizi?
A.	There is no reason really.  In fact, when I was recruited by Trafipro, it was a temporary post, if you will.  The civil service had decided if I was to remain there indefinitely, so Trafipro recruited me waiting for the civil service to confirm my appointment by a decree because the civil servant, the civil service rather, hires all civil servants in the first category, category A.  So in 1981, Trafipro wanted to keep me on board.  I had no problem with that, but the civil service, decreed a transfer and transferred me elsewhere.  So, in fact, the civil service, it was their decision to make.
Q.	Where were you transferred?
A.	I was transferred to electro gas, electro gas based in Kigali.
Q.	What were your duties at Kigali electro gas?
A.	It was basically the same responsibilities as at Trafipro.  Some things were different.  I was head of the administrative and financial departments at electro gas. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, when were you transferred to electro gas? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	At the end of 1981, right after I left Trafipro. 
JUDGE KHAN: 
Thank you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	For how long did you work at electro gas?
A.	I worked there from 1981 until 1985.
Q.	Did you ever work for a private company called Bralirwa?
A.	Counsel, no, I didn't.  I did not work for Bralrwa.  I knew about Bralirwa, but I never worked there.  I never worked there, it would have been impossible.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, you will remember that a Prosecution witness stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi worked at Bralirwa.  We asked that company to give us a document and they gave us a certificate according to which -- which shows that Mr. Ndindabahizi never worked for that company Bralirwa, and I would like to hand it to the Registry.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Just to be on the safe side, Mr. Witness, is Bralirwa a private or semi-public or a public company? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Bralirwa is a private company.  It is a -- it brews beer and makes lemonade.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the owners of that company, is that - - I understand that it may well be associated under another name according to the -- 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI: 
	Yes, I did not work in that company.  I don't have much information regarding its shareholders and its capital and the make-up of that.  I am sorry, Mr. President, for not having that information.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So this is the attestation from Bralirwa then taken on the 14th of September 2003, D. 59. 
(Exhibit No. D. 59 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, we stopped at 1985, what did you do after you left electro gas?
A.	The civil service transferred me again to the ministry of planning.  I was transferred there in 1985.
Q.	Very well.  What were your duties at the ministry of planning, briefly?
A.	I didn't do much. I was head of section of the internal financing section within that ministry.
Q.	For how long did you work at the ministry of planning?
A.	I remained there up until 1991 or something like that, five years or so.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. BESNIER:
Once again, Mr. President, the Defence has found a document of appointment for Mr. Ndindabahizi as an employee of the ministry of planning.  It is a decree which was in the official gazette of the Rwandan Republic.  This is a degree - - a decree rather dated 1st of December and on the second page you see that Mr. Ndindabahizi was transferred from electro gas to the ministry of planning as the divisional head.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	D. 60.
	(Exhibit No. D. 60 admitted)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	In which city was the ministry of planning located?
A.	Well, it's in Kigali, Counsel, in Kigali.  
Q.	In which year did you leave the ministry of planning?
A.	In 1991, that same year, 1991.
Q.	Why did you leave that ministry? 
A. 	I requested leave and I left.  I submitted my request and I was granted.   
Q.	How long did you work at AUDICO?
A.	I requested leave and I left for personal reasons.  I submitted my request and it was granted.
Q.	After the ministry of planning, did you work, did you, after 1991?
A.	Yes, I worked in a tink-tank in Kigali.
Q.	A consulting group.  What was the consulting group called?  What did you do there?
A.	I don't understand your, - - the last part of your question, Counsel.  Can you repeat it for me?  
Q.	That consultancy office, what did you do there, what was it called?
A.	It was called AUDICO or AUDICO, A-U-D-I-C-O. A-U-D-I-C-O.  My responsibilities there included audit.  We would audit the books for projects or companies, and we would make reports for ever, for those who asked us to do that consulting for them.  That is what I did there.  We are a team of about five persons and sometimes we worked together on projects and would produce reports at the end. 
Q. 	How long did you know at AUDICO
A.	I don't really know, but I know that I left that company in 1992, that office in 1992.  I know it was in 1992.

Q.	Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, we're already in 1992, we're moving quickly, and we're going to try to speed up even more now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we speed up even more -- now, the first parts of your career were in the public administration, Mr. Ndindabahizi, and you were promoted and asked to move from one place to another by the civil service.  But if I understand you correctly, the Audico period was different.  Was that so?  There you resigned at your own volition from the Ministry of Planning and is that correct?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Audico, is that a public or a private company?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Private.  Very much private.  Very much private.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was a private consultancy, wasn't it, in auditing?  Is that the gist of it?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Absolutely, that is correct, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Why did you leave Audico?
A.	I left Audico because I was assigned to the Ministry of Finance.  I believe it was in September 1992.  I was assigned to the Ministry of Finance.
Q.	Under what circumstances were you transferred to the Ministry of Finance?  Was it of your own free will or were you told to go?  Are there any explanations for that?
A.	There are no such explanations.  I was transferred.  I used to go there with others to represent the PSD party; that is my party.  We used to go there, because we were suppose to be running that ministry.  And as I was a member of the PSD, it was within that framework that I found myself at the Ministry of Finance run by the PSD.
Q.	If I got you correctly, you find yourself at the Ministry of Finance because you were a member of the PSD.  You are transferred to the Ministry of Finance.  Was it a political measure?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Now, who was the Minister of Finance at the time you entered the ministry?
A.	It was Mr. Rugenera, Marc.
Q.	What was his party?  What was the party of which he was a member?
A.	I told you that that ministry was run by the PSD, so that he was a member of the PSD party, sir.

MR. BESNIER:
Indeed, Mr. President, we found another decree of the 15th of November 1992 published in the official gazette of Rwanda that states that Ndindabahizi has been appointed Director of Cabinet in the Ministry of Finance.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, what was your position in the Ministry of Finance?  What was it?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I was Director of Cabinet.  That is the director of the office of the minister.  I call it the Directeur de Cabinet in French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. 61.
(Exhibit No. D. 61 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And if Defence counsel would give us some more information concerning the exact function of the Directeur de Cabinet, then that would be helpful.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I was going to come to that, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, can you give us some details about the work you did as Directeur of Cabinet?
A.	Yes, sir.  The Director of Cabinet is responsible for coordinating the activities of the ministry.  He is the one that coordinates the activities of the advisors, because in the ministry we had advisors and the Directeur de Cabinet also dealt with the coordination of activities of those advisors.  

Now, there's also the director general of the ministry that supervises some five directorates and the Directeur de Cabinet and the director-general together supervised all these services.  The Director of Cabinet replaces the minister when the latter is absent.  The Director of Cabinet carries out any other assignments given to him by the minister.  So that that is, in a nutshell, the attribution of the Director of Cabinet.  I hope I have given you all the details, but this is the general picture.  

With the Director of Cabinet, he coordinates all the activities of the ministry and when the minister is absent he is in charge of the management of the day-to-day operations of the ministry.
JUDGE KHAN:
Generally you were the immediate boss in the ministry?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
No, I am above -- I came after the minister, directly, and the director-general was under me.
JUDGE KHAN:
You were director and the director-general was under you.  Is that what you mean to say?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The director-general was under me, and the director was under the director-general.  This is the organisational chart of the ministry; Director of the Cabinet, who replaces the minister, who acts for the minister, so that he, was naturally above the director-general in the ministry.  This is the French system, the Director of Cabinet, then the director-general, then the director-generals.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Directeur de Cabinet is mainly a political function, is it?  Could we put it that way?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes.  It is just a political appointment.  When the minister leaves, he leaves with all the members of his office, his cabinet.  You have the Director of Cabinet and two advisors and the minister.  They all represented the party.  And if the ministry was to be run by another party all those people have to leave.  The rest of the staff wouldn't leave, except those that came with the minister.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this is helpful.  Could you now please repeat what we could call the political staff on the top level in the ministry?  You just mentioned it, but please take it once more, because, you know, the system of each country differs here, and it's important that we get your system right.  

So it's the minister; then you mentioned the minister de cabinet (sic); and then you mentioned two advisors.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Then two advisors, one for political and administrative affairs and another for technical affairs.  So that we were four.  And it was the same pattern in all ministries, in all other ministries, even those ministries run by other parties.  The system was the same, as far as political appointees were concerned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Whereas the director-general, he is not politically appointed, and he continues within the civil service.  Is that correct?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct.  He does not leave.  He's a civil servant.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Could you attend the council of ministers meetings as Directeur de Cabineti?
A.	No, that is not possible.  The Director of Cabinet does not appear in the meetings of the ministers or the ministry of council.  He replaces the minister when the latter is absent, but he does not attend the council of ministers meetings.
Q.	Very well.  After what time did you stay Director of Cabinet?
A.	I was Director of Cabinet until the 6th of April 1994, 6th of April 1994.  That is correct.  That is in April 1994.
Q.	You talked about the PSD.  How and when did you join the party, PSD?
A.	How?  Well, the party was recruiting members ever since its inception in 1991, I believe.  
And how I joined the PSD, I was recruited by the PSD.  That is it, sir.
Q.	Why did you have to join the PSD in particular?
A.	Well, that is another matter.  There were several parties that had just been created and, of course, one had the option to join one or the other.  I opted to join one party, and I chose the PSD.  I joined the PSD because I was not interested in the other parties.  The party in which I was interested was PSD.  I read its constitution, its mission statement, its ideology, and I thought that that was the party that suited me.  I knew the other parties, MRND, MDR, etc.  I chose the PSD after having perused their basic documents, their objectives and, of course, an account of what I knew about the other parties that were there or that had been there since the 60's up to '67.  I did make a choice.  The MRND was not of interest to me.  The MDR neither.  But after having given thought and, indeed, talked with people, including the chairman of the party, I made an option.
JUDGE KHAN:
So you joined the PSD of your own accord, of your own initiative?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, nobody forced me.
JUDGE KHAN:
What do you mean by recruited, recruited in this party?  You said you were recruited in this party.  What does this mean?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I mean that following the creation of those parties, all the parties tried their worst to enrol members.  They went to the various préfectures, the various regions or areas to get members.  The various parties, for the MRND, the MDR, they all went around looking for members.  This was how I joined.  When I talked about recruitment or enrolment, it was because there was a campaign on the part of the parties in Rwanda.  As far as these parties were created, they tried to synthesise people.  Various parties tried to show people what they wanted to do, what the ideologies were and what orientations they wanted to adopt, and people accepted.  They were not forced to join any party, but there was this campaign to synthesise people, to win them over as members.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, who founded the PSD, Witness?
A.	The PSD was founded by several persons, sir.  You have the mention in its manifesto, some people came together, met, and they had the constituent congress to create that party.  Some of them were very well known:  Zamarambo, for example; Ngango.  Zamarambo was president, and the other was the first vice-president: Gafaranga was the second vice-president or second vice-chairman; Gatabazi, Minister Gatabazi, was inspector-general of the party.  And they became members of the national committee of the party.  But founding members of that party were not only those four; there were others that sat at the congress.  I cannot remember all the names, because I was not even there at the time the party was created.  But in the statutes of the party, I can read the names of the founding members of the party.
Q.	Sir, you talked about the national committee.  Could you explain, in a word or two, how the PSD was organised, in terms of its internal structure?
A.	Now, we had the -- what we called the politburo or the political bureau composed of those four people I just mentioned:  the chairman; the vice-chairman; the second vice-chairman; and the secretary general.  That -- those were the spokespersons of the party.  But there was also a political bureau or politburo composed of those people, and we had a structure organisation covering the préfecture to the communes and even the secteurs and the cellules.  Of course, at the top you had what we called the national congress.  This was the organisational format, if you will, of the PSD party.
Q.	And you yourself, what duties did you have within the party?  What responsibilities were you given in the party?
A.	Now, within the party I was appointed as executive secretary at the level of the préfecture of Kibuye.  At a given time, therefore, I was also in charge of the party in my own native area that is Kibuye, sir.
Q.	Were you appointed or were you elected?
A.	No, appointed I was not.  I was elected, sir.
Q.	At what date were you elected?
A.	I should apologise most sincerely; as far as days are concerned, I do not know -- I can't remember the exact date, but I know, of course, it was 1993.  I do know and recollect that there were elections in the Gishyita commune in May 1993, and I was responsible for overseeing the elections on behalf of the PSD in May 1993.  So that I was in charge of the -- representative of the party in that particular area.  I cannot remember the date at which I was elected, but I know that it was in 1993.
Q.	Now, how has it been that you had political responsibilities in Kibuye, whereas you had not been living in that préfecture for a long long time?
A.	No, no, that is no problem, sir.  That is not a problem.  The same applied everywhere, even for other people.  One cannot be a politician other than in your own native préfecture.  It was not possible for that to happen.  You can't be a politician outside your own native préfecture.
Q.	Now, what was the position of the PSD in the regional political life of Kibuye, in general?
A.	Sir, I do not understand that question clearly.  Could you kindly rephrase it, make it more clear.  I do not see the point you are driving at.
Q.	Was the PSD a large party?  Did you have a greater number of members, as compared to the other parties?  Was it one of the larger parties or was it one of the smaller parties?  How did it compare with the other parties?
A.	Sir, there were no elections in Kibuye.  There were no elections in other préfectures, either, to quantify the weight of any given party in any given region.  That was an impossibility, to determine the weight of a party.  That was not possible without elections.  But I do know that almost all the political parties, the major parties, MRND, MDR, PSD, PDC, were all represented in the Kibuye préfecture, but one cannot say for sure which party had more members.  But the PSD was there, and the PSD was there as one of the parties that had taken roots in the Kibuye préfecture, sir.
Q.	Very well, let us come back to some questions concerning PSD's ideology.  What was the ideology of the PSD in terms of ethnic or interethnic relations, interethnic relations PSD?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move to the ideology, just to be certain about the structures, now the political bureau or politburo was at the central level, was it, at the national level?  There was one political bureau at the national level composed of four members?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that body was in Kigali?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
In Kigali, Mr. President, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the functions were the chair, the vice-chair, the secretary-general, and the fourth you said was?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, chairman, first vice-chairman, second vice-chairman, and secretary-general.  Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
First and second vice-chairman.  All right.  Now, the other central organ, is that the national congress?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Now, we have the political bureau and its committee that is the political bureau's committee; that was at national level.  But we had reached a level -- we had the regional executive secretariat that worked at the level of the region.  Each region had one.  But at national level, we had these four people that were in charge.  They were the spokespersons of the party at national level.  They were the only four.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But listening to the English translation of what you said, I jotted down the national congress, a brief reference to the national congress.  Did you refer to that body?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  I talked about the national congress.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that a PSD body?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It is the supreme body of a party.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly, so that is the supreme body of the party at the central level.  It covers the whole country, doesn't it?  That's the situation.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this imply, then, that there were two central bodies, on the one hand, the politico, and on the other hand the national congress?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The politico bureau and the national congress.  Well, the national congress is above the political bureau.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The national congress is composed of?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, the national congress was composed of the representatives of all the regions, all the regions representatives plus the members of the political bureau.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you, being the executive secretary at the Kibuye level, were you then a member in that capacity of the national congress?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That's how I was a member of the national congress, in that capacity, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you had no other functions, or had you, at the central level?  You only had functions at the local level.  Is that the testimony?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was only at the local level, at the level of Kibuye.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you opted for the PSD in '91 or later.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, I said that I joined in 1992.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may have said that, but that was not what I heard and that was a clarification I wanted.  So the party was established in '91, and you joined in '92, is that so?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  So as far as the ideology of the parties is concerned, I know you already mentioned it, but could you be more detailed as to the position where interethnic relations were concerned?
A.	Yes.  The PSD enrolled members from all ethnic groups in Rwanda, Hutus and Tutsi.  You could find Hutu and Tutsi within the PSD, and we know that even in the objective of the party, it was stipulated that ethnic groups were not to be mentioned in identity documents.  So that the PSD did not have any problems of discriminating between various ethnic groups.  There was no distinction of ethnic groups within the PSD.  This was the reason why they proposed that ethnicity should not be mentioned in identity documents.  I hope I have covered the question properly.  Be that as it may, I can say there was no Hutu-Tusti problem in our party.
Q.	Very well.  Now, as far as collaborative activities with the RPF, and from the point of view of the possible role of the RPF in the broad-based government on the basis of the Arusha Accords, what was the position of the PSD?
A.	The position of the PSD on the basis of the broad-based government, as per the Arusha Accords, was to share power with one and all parties.  As far as the Arusha Accords were concerned, the PSD accepted that all parties sit around the same table and take part in the same government, including the RPF, for the running of the country during the transitional period, whilst we wait for the elections to be organised for power to be invested in the elected, those that can run the country, by the electorate.
Q.	Did you take part in PSD meetings in Kibuye?
A.	Yes.  In '93 I attended certain rallies, and in certain rallies -- I do remember one place in Gishyita in Manunga, in Gishyita commune, and in Rwamatamo, they also held a rally.  And I was in Ndadabo (phonetic) and we were responsible for preparing those rallies and organising them.  I was also at Girambo in Bwakiro commune.  There, too, we held a rally.  And I believe those were the only meetings that I took part in in 1993, as far as I can recollect.  But since there were other rallies, I can only remember those three at this particular time.
Q.	Did you hold a rally in Gasharu, at the Gishaka centre?
A.	In Gasharu, that is my area.  It was in my house, a meeting.  There is my house, but I did organise a meeting there.  But once I came to the area, the Gishaka centre, people knew that I was from the PSD, and at that time I had some hats, some caps, in the vehicle, and I gave them out to those who wanted them.  Those were PSD caps or hats, because I also wanted to show that I had followers in that particular area.  But I was not there to organise a rally.  I could not organise a rally all by myself.  I just went there to see what the situation was.  It's not possible to organise a rally by one person.  And political parties did the same thing everywhere they went and engage in such activity.
Q.	But why did you refuse to give caps or hats to the Tutsi?
A.	Well, what I said -- I said that the PSD party made no discriminations at all.  We even proposed the deletion of ethnic ethnicity on ID cards.  How can I refuse to give caps or hats to the Tutsi?  This is not possible.  I never did so, sir.

JUDGE KHAN:
Do you have any member of ethnic groups -- of the Tutsi group in your party, PSD party?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
There were.  There were many Tutsis within the PSD party.  Even in the politburo, there were Tutsis.  There were many of them.  I knew them.  Even in the préfectures on the regional level, there were Tutsi representatives.
JUDGE KHAN:
Could you please name them?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, I can give you a few names.  There was Umbanguta, Jean-Marie Vianney, who was an advisor in the technical services department at the Ministry of Finance.  

There was Thomas Kabeja, Kabeja, who was Director of Cabinet of the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock.  

Frederick Zimeranbaho.  

There was Rugema, Donatien.  You saw him here.  

François Ndumwe, who is now a parliamentarian.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we go one by one, including the spelling, so that we can avoid going back again afterwards?  

So you mentioned first Jean-Marie Vianney Umbanguta, who was an advisor.  Where was he an advisor, you said?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Umbanguta was an advisor in the technical services division at the Ministry of Finance. 

There was Thomas Kabeja.  Thomas Kabeja, who was Directeur de Cabinet at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. 

I also spoke of Donatien Rugema.  I think he is known here in this Chamber.  He's a Tutsi from Kibuye, my same area. 

I also spoke of Ndumwe, François.  Ndumwe, François.  And I believe that currently he is a member of parliament in the Rwandan parliament. 
And I also spoke of François Ndungutse.  François Ndungutse.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have the spelling of that one, please, Ndungutse?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Ndumwe not Ndungutse.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  Ndumwe, N-D-U-M-W-E.  Ndumwe, François. I believe that he's currently a member of parliament. 

Innocence Sabasajya.  Sabasajya, Jean, excuse me.  Sabasajya, Jean also worked at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sabasajya, that is?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
S-A-B-A-S-A-J-Y-A, Sabasajya.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how many members of the politburo were Tutsi?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
What?
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many members of the politburo were Tutsi, of the four?  You briefly referred to the politburo, I think.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, Umbanguta was a member of the politburo.  Kabeja, was as well.  Ndumwe also was.  Sabasajya was also.  They were all in the politburo.  That's how I knew them.  They were in the politburo.  The others were in the préfectures, but these I knew personally.  We worked in Kigali in the same place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these four were in the politburo for how long?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Ever since the politburo was created.  The party was created in 1991, in July.  When I arrived at the party in '92 they were already there.
JUDGE KHAN:
Were there any Tutsis in the national congress?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, because, as a member of the politburo, you're also a member of the national congress.  So those four that I've just mentioned sat at the national congress.  Even the Tutsis who were members at the regional level sat at the national congress, as well.  

Rugema, whom you saw before you, was a member of the national congress, in fact.  He sat at the national congress, Rugema, Donatien.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You now mentioned four names belonging to the politburo, and they were Tutsi, these four.  That's what we just heard.  Isn't that so?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
But they weren't the only ones in the politburo.  There were others.  These are the only ones I remember.  There were others.  If I had my documents with me, I could enlarge the list and give you more names, but they weren't the only ones.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, how many members, in total, were there in the politburo?  Leaving aside the Hutu and the Tutsi question, but how many members were there in that bureau?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Not less than 24, between 24 and 30, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And if you were to give an estimate as to how many of those that were Tutsi?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I would say ten maximum.  Surely not more than ten.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I'm seeking a clarification on the structure of the party.  I am really confused about the politburo.  And it's fair to say that, according to the constitution of the party, there was a politburo which was constituted by the chair, two vice chairpersons and the secretary.  Then there was the governing structure at the préfecture level with a regional executive.  Then the national congress.  

What I don't understand is how it shall be -- or how some of them fed into the politburo.  That's on the one hand.
(Pages 13 to 23 by R. Lear)











	1545H
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The politburo is composed of people that were elected by the national congress.  In 1993, in December, in fact, we elected the committee, the four who led the party at the end of '93.  So the congress chooses those who will lead the political bureau.  The national committee is in charge, therefore, of the party on the country level. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You remember, I asked you for how long were these four persons in the politburo members, and you said from '91.  But until when? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, unfortunately I did not completely understand your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Khan asked you to mention Tutsi in the party, and you kindly gave us quite a few names.  And then I asked you to mention members of the politburo, and you mentioned four names: Rugema, Kabeja, Ndumwe and Sabasajya.  Now, these four persons that were members of the politburo, for how long were they members of the politburo?  Not only a question from when they started in '91, but for how long?  Until when? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
In 1994, in April, when the tragic events took place and began, those people were still at that time in the politburo.  They were still members of the politburo at that time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So all these four persons were members until the 6th of April, of the politburo? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, up until the 6th of April they were still there, in the politburo. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, on an electoral level, were there elections that the PSD had to participate in, or participated in, since it was created in 1991?  We're not talking about appointments, now, we're talking about elections.  Were there ever elections in which the PSD participated, and, if so, were they supposed to participate in elections after 1991?
A.	There were no elections in '92 or '93 in Rwanda.  Everybody was awaiting elections that were supposed to take place.  And this was supposed to take place after the transitional period, and this was stipulated in the Arusha Accords.  That is what I know. 
Q.	Starting in April 1994, wasn't there a question of renewing the mandate of deputies in the National Assembly?
A.	Yes, there was that issue.
Q.	Was the PSD supposed to present candidates for the National Assembly elections in 1994?
A.	Counsel, are we on the same wavelength?  I said there were no elections in 1994.  Do we understand each other?  I think there might be a misunderstanding here.
Q.	You told me that the deputies of the National Assembly had to renew their mandate in 1994.  How could their mandate be renewed?  By which means? 
A.	I don't know.  I think that you are speaking about renewing the mandates of the deputies who were at the CND, the National Council for Development, or parliament, which existed since 1991.  Is that what you are speaking about? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Their mandates had ended in July 1994.  Is that what you mean, Counsel?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	If that is what you mean, then I would say the following.  The political parties that made up the government had decided in July 1994 to renew that parliament because the members' mandates had run out, and in fact, indeed, each party had to designate its own representatives.
Q.	Very well.  We'll get back to this issue a bit later.  But earlier, you talked about three meetings that you remembered in Kibuye préfecture.  Did you say that?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Starting in 19 -- in the 1990s, I would like to know how often you went to Kibuye préfecture.  We've already talked about three different meetings of '92-'93, but did you ever, outside of those meetings, go to Kibuye, either to see your family or for personal reasons?
A.	Well, I have a sister in Gasharu, in Kibuye, therefore.  I told you that my parents passed away in the 1980s, and that sister lives in my parent's house -- has lived there since my parents died.  In fact, she moved in to stay with them, and when they passed away -- I believe that on some rare occasions I went to Kibuye, especially to Gasharu, to see my sister.  But you asked me how often, starting in 1990.  In fact, I don't remember how many times.  I do know that I didn't go very often, perhaps once a year, perhaps twice, but it was a rare occasion.  In fact, I had responsibilities to attend to -- wasn't frequent.  I had no activities in Kibuye, and so if I went there, it was infrequently, every now and then, perhaps, to see my sister.
Q.	Very well, let's explore this issue more deeply.  When were you married?
A.	I got married in 1987. 
Q.	Was your wife also from Gasharu?
A.	No, not at all.  She's not from Gasharu. 
Q.	Where is she from?
A.	She's from Gitarama, Kabgayi (phonetic).
Q.	What is the ethnic group of your wife's parents?
A.	As we said, just like my sister's children, her father is Tutsi, her mother is Hutu, so she's Tutsi.  She would be considered a Tutsi.
Q.	If your wife is Tutsi, wouldn't she have an identity card with "Tutsi" mentioned on it?
A.	Yes, she has a card that says "Hutu", because her father had an identity card with "Hutu" on it.  My wife continued to carry that same mention on her card, but in fact her father is Tutsi.  In fact, he was killed in 1994.  He's Tutsi -- he was Tutsi.
Q.	Mr. Ndindabahizi, I don't really understand.  Your father-in-law, your wife's father, was he Tutsi or Hutu?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Did he have an identity card with the mention of his identity of Hutu or Tutsi?
A.	I didn't read his card, but when I saw the identity papers of my wife, it said "Hutu".  She explained to me how that came about.  And it came from the identification of her father, but she was a Tutsi.  I think this happened frequently in the 1960s in Gitarama.  People would change, perhaps because of the prevailing events or other circumstances.  Even brothers who remained in Rwanda -- his brothers who remained in Rwanda, they were Tutsis.
Q.	How many children did your wife and you have?
A.	We had five.  I have five children.
Q.	After you were married, where did you live, in which city?
A.	Since I got married, up until 1994, we lived in Kigali.
Q.	Did you have any property in Gasharu?
A.	Well, I told you that the house where my sister lives is the house that I built for my parents, so it's my house, in a way.  The fields around that house are my fields, so, if you will, that property, even though my sister lives there, it belongs to me.  But since my sister came back to the house, I thought I had to help her with her child.  She was separated from her husband and came with her child, and I said, "Well, listen, stay here in my house on my land". 
Q.	Very well.  We've often heard about Gasharu here during this trial.  Can you briefly describe Gasharu for us?  Is it a city like Arusha?  Is it smaller?  Is it bigger than Arusha?  How is Gasharu like?
A.	Well, in the 1960s, when I was still a boy, there were very few people living in Gasharu.  Currently, there are people who came from other hills to settle there.  But in the 1960s, there was my father, my aunt, my cousins.  JX, JE, those witnesses, they lived there.  They came before this Tribunal.  CGH, his brother, he had a wife, and CGH's mother lived in Gasharu with us.  He had two wives in fact, and the other one, her mother -- CGF's mother -- lived just next to Gasharu.  Those were the people who were there.  

At that time, my father was the only Hutu on that hilltop.  All the other people were Tutsis.  Thereafter, people like Karara came to settle there in Gasharu.  My cousins got married; they had children.  And so the hilltop -- the hill got bigger; the families got bigger.  Hutus from other hills came to settle there amongst the Tutsis.  But I don't think there were many Hutus who came.  If you will, in 1994, Gasharu had more Tutsis than it did Hutus, even if you do count those Hutus who came to settle from other hills.  So that that is the makeup of Gasharu hill, if you will.  

There's nothing out of the ordinary.  There's a small market near Gatara.  I had a couple of shops there.  People go to drink beer at that market or they go to sell their livestock.  There was a small road there.  It comes from the main road to Kibuye.  It's six or ten kilometres to get there from Kibuye.  There's nothing extraordinary about the place.  But what makes it known is that it was known as a Tutsi hill since 1963, when there were problems.  The neighbouring hills are inhabited by Hutus, and those Hutus, during the '59 revolution, tried to attack that hill.  But the hilltop protected itself very well and it didn't have very many problems.
Q.	Were there marriages between Hutus and Tutsis on that hill?
JUDGE BOSSA:
I'd like a clarification before you proceed, Counsel.  

I'm interested in the witnesses who lived -- the witnesses who came here that you mentioned.  What were their pseudonyms, who lived with your parents on that hill in the '60s?  I remember CGH, but I don't remember the others.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I mentioned several witnesses through their pseudonyms, the pseudonyms they had here, because I know that they were protected witnesses.  This is why I used their pseudonyms.  I talked about CJ --
JUDGE BOSSA:
(Microphone not activated).
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I shall give them to you now, Your Honour.  CGX; I talked about the son CGE; I talked about CGH; and I talked about CGF, who is the brother-in-law of CGH.  But CGF came to Gasharu a long time afterwards.  I don't know him.  I don't know him.  But he came to settle down in Gasharu quite recently, and I was told that he was the brother-in-law of CGH.  The wife is the sister of CGH.  The wife of CGF is the sister of CGH.  And they are all in Gasharu.  But CGF only came recently, while CGX, for example, was there ever since the '60s.  His son was born there in the '70s, so that they lived there.  It is their area.  They were one of the first natives of that hill.  

So that I am just trying to show you that on that hill there were very few people, and the people who were there were mainly Tutsi, and then gradually Hutu came to ask for land from the Tutsi.  I hope I've satisfactorily covered your question, Your Honour. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you coming back, maybe at a later stage, to the Prosecution witnesses, Defence Counsel? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi, tell me, up to 1994 were there intermarriages between Hutu and Tutsi in Gasharu?
A.	Yes, sir, there was intermarriage between Hutu and Tutsi.  I said that my sister, to begin with her, had a Tutsi husband.  And I know one Gatwa, whose name should be mentioned in one of the cases here, he had a Tutsi wife.  There is a witness who said so.  There was also Ngirabanzi (phonetic) -- one Ngirabanzi, who was married to Tutsi women.  Gatwa had about seven children with that Tutsi woman, and Ngirabanzi also had children -- had many children with a Tutsi wife.  And my aunt, Nyirakaza (phonetic), was married to a Tutsi since the '20s, because when I was born, my aunt had children already been married, in 1910 or 1915, to a Tutsi.  So that marriage between Tutsi and Hutu in that area in Gasharu, and even in certain other neighbouring areas, was not a problem in 1994.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Now, let us move on to another subject matter.  Where were you on the 6th of April 1994?
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, I was at home, sir.
Q.	How did you hear about -- learn about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learned about it through a telephone call, sir.
Q.	Through a telephone call?  Somebody called you on a telephone?
A.	Yes, somebody called me over the telephone.  At 8:30 in the evening somebody called me.  But I was with that somebody that same evening.  That was that person who called me.
Q.	And what did that person say to you?
A.	He called me over the telephone.  We had just left each other, because we were together in a bar, and he was a cellule leader, and I used to go to his place (interpretation unintelligible) because I lived nearby.  And that evening we had just left each other about 8:00, 8:30.  And when I got home, I heard the telephone ring.  It was his telephone call, and he asked me whether I had arrived at home.  That's what he said, "Are you at home?"  I said, "Yes".  And I said, "Why are you calling me?"  Because that was not usual.  He said, "Look, I have just heard an explosion and I wanted to know whether you managed to get home".  Because at that time there were grenade explosions in the city of Kigali.  That was very frequent.  We would hear that people were shot down at the entrance of their houses, and he thought that that explosion happened very near his house.  And he said he just heard an explosion.  He wanted to make sure.  I told him that I had also heard the explosion, but that the explosion did not take place around my house, sir.
Q.	Now, what was your reaction when you learned about the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Well, sir, when he told me that he had just heard an explosion, I believe that immediately he didn't tell me that the president had died, no; he just wanted to know whether I'd arrived home.  Several minutes afterwards, he called again and said, "Look, that explosion was the president.  His plane has been shot down at Kanombe; so the explosion you just heard was the explosion of the plane of the president that had just been shot down at the time it was landing".  It was at that time that I learned about the death of the president -- at around 8:30 in the evening.  

Now, my reaction, you say?  It was no joke, because with the tension all around at that time in the country, especially in Kigali, to hear that the president has just died, it was no joke.  It was serious.  I got scared.  I didn't sleep throughout the night until the morning, myself, my children, my wife, because we were wondering what was going to happen next, because we knew that that event had just occurred at a time when the city was in itself explosive.  In Kigali, we were expecting -- we were expecting such things, ominous, bad things.  We could not sleep.
Q.	And came the morning, what did you do?
A.	Well, in the morning, there was a communiqué urging people to remain at home, but at around 8:00 or 9:00 -- I can't remember; this was about ten years ago.  And it was the watchman that told us that there were soldiers that were going around houses, killing people.  So I went out of the house and I left.  I left; I went hiding at a neighbour's house not too far away.  I went to a neighbour's house.  My wife also went out of the house to hide in another neighbour's -- the nearest neighbour, because houses were adjacent.  That is where my wife went with two children.  And three other children spent the night elsewhere.  I went away, 500, 600 metres away, at a neighbour's house to hide.  That was my first reaction because I thought that, with the news I had just heard, those people might very well come to my house.  And I knew what would happen.  With the problems I had experienced, I knew that I was in danger.
JUDGE KHAN:
Where did you hide in your neighbour's house?  Mr. Ndindabahizi, you said that you hid in your neighbour's house.  What was the ethnic group of your neighbour -- ethnic identity?  He was a Hutu or he was a Tutsi?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I know that he was a Hutu.  He was Hutu.
JUDGE KHAN:
Why did you hide in his house?  You were a Hutu, too.
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, I was Hutu, Your Honour, but I went to hide because I knew that I was holding a position in society of a burdensome responsibility, and I said to myself that people could come to my house, they could kill me, because people told me that they were going around the first houses in the area.  They were going into houses and they were killing everybody.  And I was frightened because of my position, because of the position I had within the party and within the ministry.  That was why I had to go.  

I knew that perhaps with that small neighbour of mine, because he was not very well known -- it was a house that -- perhaps the interpreters can help me -- was surrounded by some type of bush.  I said to myself that probably those killers would not come to that particular house.  But it was just for that time.  It was not once and for all that I was going to hide in there.  It was just for the time being.
JUDGE KHAN:
	Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was the position of the neighbour, the Hutu neighbour?  What was his place in society? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I am saying that he was not of any significant stature, socially.  I didn't know where he worked, but he was not famous.  He was not well known.  I know -- I knew that he was from one of the Kibuye cellules.  So I knew him, but he was not an important man.  His house was not big.  It was a small house, and I knew that the killers would say to themselves, "Well, in that house there must be somebody important".  So I had to make that choice.  I had to choose that house, whose fence was some sort of bush, some sort of plants. 
MR. PRESIDENT.
	So what was his name and position in society, then? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes. 
MR. BESNIER:
What was your question, Mr. President?  Probably there was a translation we missed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question I am asking is this neighbour, what was his position in society?  You have told us that he had not a conspicuous placement, a small house.  But who was he?  What was his name?  What was his position?  Why go to him?  That's what I am circling at. 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, Mr. President, he's called Gahizi, Amon (phonetic).  That's his name, Gahizi, Amon.  Now, I went to his place because he lived in a modest house with a fence of shrubs and I thought that the killers would never think that a little house was inhabited by anybody of importance.  And I thought that since it would be viewed like that, I went there.  

But my wife went to another house, another house next to mine, because we had the same wall between our houses.  That house belonged to a warrant officer of the Rwandan army.  He was from the Bigogwe (phonetic) military camp, and his house was occupied by his wife, children and house help, and my wife went there.  And she was thinking that perhaps that house belonged to a soldier, and since it belonged to a soldier, nobody would think about getting into that house. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Now, what was the profession or occupation of Gahizi, Amon?
A.	Amon Gahizi used to work somewhere.  I don't know exactly where, but I know that he was a civil servant.  His wife used to work with the People's Bank, but Gahizi himself, I can't remember the ministry or company in which he worked.  I can't remember that.
Q.	Very well.  Could you, Mr. Ndindabahizi, tell us the nature of the threat which hung over you?  You were Hutu, one; two, you worked in a ministry as an important personality, you could be protected.  Now, what were you scared of?  Why would they attack you? 
A.	Well, I think that it was self-evident the reason why I was scared.  I said that I was director of the cabinet of the ministry of finance, and people told me that people were being killed all around my house.  You think I should stay in my house?  No, I didn't do so.  I said to myself, "I could be killed, especially as I belong to a political party that was always said to have been pro-RPF".  It was said that PSD was pro-RPF.  Do you want me to stay at the house to be killed?  No, sir.  I was scared about what could have happened, because I heard gunshots in the area.  I heard gunshots.  I wasn't told, "Look, people have been killed and I should run away".  No, I heard the gunshots, and I ran away.  And on my flight, I saw soldiers.  I saw soldiers go into houses, breaking down doors, killing people.  I was scared.  I was right to be frightened and to run away. 
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, did you see people being killed near your house? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Well, Your Honour, I have told you that those people went into houses and killed, and when they killed they came out.  Now, to tell you I saw a body, a dead body, or somebody wounded, all I saw may not be true, but I saw them going in, coming out, and people they killed were left in the houses.  Doors were broken, windows were broken, but people were left in the houses.  That was the situation.
JUDGE KHAN:
Now, how did you succeed to go to your neighbour's house? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, it was at around 8:00, 9:00, and the killers had not yet arrived on the road that led me to my neighbour.  So that there were several roads in the area, and they went straight from street to street.  And I went along the valley -- along the valley.  I used that particular road that went along the valley.  It was not very far away.  It was only about 500, 600 metres away.  Not very far at all. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Were there any RPF soldiers in Kigali at the time?
A.	Yes, there were RPF forces in Kigali.  There was a 600-man battalion that was barracked at the CND, National Development Council.  They were there, those people of the RPF.
Q.	And the CND, was it far from your house?
A.	No, it was in the same vicinity, almost in the same cellule.  There was only a road between us, but it was very near.  So that in our own vicinity, we had the RPF soldiers, but there was also the military camp of the Presidential Guard.  There were two military camps on that particular hill in which I lived. 
Q.	How long did you stay at your neighbour's?
A.	You mean, at Amon Gahizi's?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Yes, sir, I stayed there till about 1400H.  That is 2:00 p.m.  Yes, till about 2:00 p.m.
Q.	Two p.m., 7th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  We're talking about the 7th of April.  I left my home in the morning and it was still the 7th of April.
Q.	Now, why did you leave that hiding place?
A.	Well, in the morning, there were soldiers that came out, that were killing, but in the afternoon, there were other soldiers that came out, and those were the RPF soldiers.  They came out of their CND barracks, and they were on the Rugando cellule, Rugando hill in which I live, and Rumera secteur.  The RPF attacked those two hills.  They also attacked the Presidential Guard camp.
Q.	And what was the threat over you, under those circumstances?
A.	Well, you see, there were soldiers in the morning.  In the afternoon, the RPF came to that hill, so that there was a confrontation brewing.  The RPF, just as the other soldiers went into houses and killed, they killed just like other soldiers.  So that seeing that the area, the vicinity, was becoming more and more dangerous, and I had to run away.  I had to decide.  

I decided therefore to leave.  I decided to call my wife on the telephone and tell her that I was leaving, and I told her where I was going.  I informed her, because people that were living around the RPF barracks and the CND area were running.  They were coming towards us.  We were near the valley, and I told my wife, "Look here at Amon Gahizi's".  And there was a telephone at that soldier's house.  I told her, "Look, I am leaving.  You also should try to run away because the RPF is outside too -- is out there too".  So I left.  I immediately left in of the midst, haze, of bullets from all over the place.  We didn't know where bullets came from.  

I was asked whether I should stay within the house.  I said no.  I was scared; I had to leave, because Gahizi's wife was telling me they were killing important personalities.  "If they come here, they will kill you".  Sometimes they would tell me to hide in the latrine outside the house.  I had to go.  I left.  I left, and I went to another hill.

	1630H
JUDGE KHAN:
And you were not scared of the enemies outside the house?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
I was scared, but what do you want me to do?  I had to leave that hill.  I had to leave that hill even in spite of the shooting.  I couldn't stay at Ugando (phonetic).  I couldn't stay at Gahizi's (phonetic).  It was dangerous for me.  The RPF had come down.  The presidential guard who was also in the vicinity -- confrontation had started.  The hill was in (interpretation unintelligible)... fired.  Even if I was to be met with a bullet, that would have been it.  I had to leave and I had to get there.  I wanted to get there.  It was the way it was during the war.  It was during the war, that was what it was -- that is what -- Sometimes one is lucky not to have been shot, but as long as one is alive, one strives to be alive, to remain alive in war.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who were killing important personalities?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The first soldiers that came out from their barracks were the soldiers of the presidential guard.  They were the ones that were killing in the vicinity.  That was it.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Where did you go after having left your neighbours?
A.	I went to Rafiki's -- Hyacinth Rafiki's house and (unintelligible) ... Rafiki, that's where I went.
Q.	Who was this Rafiki?
A.	Rafiki was a director of cabinet of the ministry of public works and energy.
Q.	Where did he live?
A.	He lived near around Kicukiro, opposite the Rugando (phonetic) Hill.
Q.	What was the distance of -- from Gahizi's (phonetic) to that particular location?
A.	It's difficult to say.  Perhaps one kilometre, one-and-a-half kilometres, something like that.  I was on foot, and it took me a long time to get there.  I cannot measure the time I used to tell you the distance, but I could say one kilometre, one-and-a-half kilometres, something like that.  It was not too far away.  One kilometre, perhaps.
Q.	Why did you take refuge precisely at Rafiki's?
A.	Well, I left Rugando (phonetic), and Ugaza (phonetic) I went to his house.  And after that, the only safe hill was the one opposite, and where -- the only person I knew there was Rafiki.  I alerted him, I called him.  I called him and said, "Look, I have problems" and I was scared that -- I knew that the RPF soldiers were out in the street and I was coming to his house.  I knew that there were people.  There were soldiers in his area.  Gun shots were very sustained in the area.  There was danger everywhere.  I didn't want to go too far.  I went to Rafiki's.  He knew me.  He was a member of my party.  He was also a colleague from the minister of public works because he was a director of cabinet just like myself, and that was the case.  During those bloody and frightening events, as the ones that took place in 1994 in Rwanda, one didn't have a lot of choice.  One reacted spontaneously.  In the face of death one doesn't think too much.
Q.	Was Rafiki also a member of the PSD?
A.	I told you he was a director of cabinet at the minister of public works and energy.  He's a member of the cabinet.  Yes, he's a member of the party because that ministry was led by the PSD, so, yes, indeed.
Q.	Did he accept to welcome you without any hesitation?
A.	I had already called him.  I called him, he had agreed.  Yes, he'd agreed.
Q.	You're a member of the PSD, director of cabinet, and you said you were in danger?  He was also a member of the PSD.  He was also director of cabinet in the ministry.  He should also have been in danger, right?  Why would you go to his house?
A.	When I arrived at his house, there were no problems in his neighbourhood, in the area he lived in.  There were no problems.  The RPF was in Rugando (phonetic) and in Rumera, near the Amahoro Stadium.  They were attacking that area, but it was still -- his area was still in tact, but that doesn't mean that there were no problems at all, because when I arrived at his house there were problems inside the house.  He had boarded up the house.  Everybody had barricaded themselves inside their houses.  He felt threatened.  He was inside his house, but he wasn't as -- in a spot as dangerous as mine.  I didn't -- I didn't say I was going to stay there definitively.  It wasn't the last place I was going to stay.  We had before us soldiers; we heard gunfire, even up above the CND.  Here was an RPF gun shooting people at the presidential guard camp.  So we were trying to -- we didn't have a -- we were trying to get away.  We didn't have a final solution to what we were going to do. 
Q.	You left Gahizi's at 2 p.m. on the 7th of April.  At what time did you arrive at Rafiki's house?
A.	That's difficult to say, Counsel.  I was on foot and every time there was gunshots I would go down to the ground so that I wouldn't get a bullet on my way.  I don't know, I must have arrived at about 4 p.m., approximately 4 o'clock.
Q.	Did you spend the day of 7th April at Rafiki's house, the rest of that day, the day?
A.	Well, in the afternoon I arrived at his house, so on the 7th at night, I was there that night.  I spent that night at his house.
Q.	Did you spend the night of 7 to 8 April, therefore, at his house?
A.	Yes, at the night of 7 to 8 April, I was at Rafiki's house and in the morning on the 8th, I was at Rafiki's.
Q.	What was the prevailing situation in Kigali on the 8th of April in the morning, to the best of your knowledge?
A.	There was still gun fire sporadically in the city; in Kicukiro and in Rumera and Kimihurura (phonetic), Rogondola (phonetic); there were the military camps, and those places were completely unsafe.  People were barricaded in their houses.  Other people were on the road trying to find a way to get out.  People had their suitcases with them.  It was total insecurity in that part of the city where I was in the morning, and even later on in that day.
Q.	Very well.  We are on the 8th of April now.  You have evaluated the situation, you spoke about your friend -- you spoke to your friend, rather, about the situation.  Did you prepare a plan?  What were your intentions?  Did you try to escape?  Did you plan to stay there for a few days?  What was your mood, your feeling at the time?
A.	Counsel, I would be lying to you if I told you that I had any intentions.  For me, it was over.  I didn't know what to do.  I was in the hands of Rafiki.  If he was going to leave, I would have to leave.  If I would stay in that house, I would be killed.  I didn't have any other plan.  What was I supposed to do?  At that time, on the 8th of April in the morning, were you in touch with your family?  Counsel, you think I was with my family?
Q.	No, were you in touch with them by phone, or did you have any news from your family is what I mean?
A.	When I arrived at Rafiki's house, my wife called me.  She told me that she had arrived in Kicukiro at a convent.  She told me that she had arrived at Kicukiro, but that was on the 7th in the evening.  So in answer to your question, I was not in touch with her, save that one time on the phone when she told me where she was with two of the kids, because the other kids from the 6th to the 7th at night, they went somewhere else to spend the night.  They went somewhere else to spend the night.  They were not with us.  My wife left with our oldest boy who was 16.  He was born in 1968, and my last born son who was one-and-a-half years old and she had him on her back.  Those were the two children that she was with.
Q.	Very well.  Let's get back to the day of the 8th of April.  While you were at Rafiki's house, did he receive any visit?  Did anybody come to see him?
A.	Yes.  In the afternoon at around 2 p.m., I believe, somebody came to see him.
Q.	Who?
A.	It was Colonel Théoneste Bagosora.
Q.	Did you see Bagosora yourself that day on the 8th of April?
A.	Well, I was inside the house.  Rafiki went outside the house to see him, outside his compound.  I saw him through the window, but I was inside.  I did not go outside, but I did see him.
Q.	Did you hear what they talked about?
A.	No, Counsel, they were outside.  They weren't even inside the compound; they were just outside the compound.  Bagosora remained outside.
Q.	Did Rafiki tell you what Colonel Bagosora wanted, what he'd come for?
A.	Yes, he told me.
Q.	What did he tell you?
A.	Well, he told me that Bagosora had come to invite him to participate in a meeting.  That meeting was amongst the political parties and it was to be held in Kigali.
Q.	Did Rafiki accept the invitation to go to that meeting?
A.	Of course.  He went, he went to the meeting.  Counsel, what do you mean "did he accept"?  Was he of the feeling that he needed to accept? 
Q.	Was Rafiki satisfied by the invitation given to him by Bagosora, or did he feel that it was a dangerous thing to do, to go to that meeting?
A.	Well, I can't tell you how Rafiki felt when he came.  He talked to me, and he said that the colonel just told me that a meeting is being held in Kigali, and it is amongst the political parties, and the PSD is not represented in that meeting.  So, he was going to represent the PSD.  There were no PSD representatives in the meeting.  That's what Rafiki told me.
Q.	According to Rafiki, what was the objective of the said meeting?
A.	When I was still at Rafiki's, I didn't ask that question and, in fact, he didn't tell me anything about the objective of the meeting.  He just said, "It's a meeting of the political parties", that's all.
Q.	Did Colonel Bagosora suggest taking Rafiki with him to the meeting?
A.	No, they didn't go in Bagosora's vehicle.  In fact, Rafiki used his own means of transportation to get there.
Q.	Did Rafiki inform Colonel Bagosora that you were at his house?
A.	That's what Rafiki told me.
Q.	Since Bagosora said that there was a meeting being held amongst the political parties at the MINADEF, the ministry of defence in Kigali, Rafiki said that he spoke of a certain Ndindabahizi who is head of the PSD in Kibuye, who was present in his house.
A.	This is the Ndindabahizi who is chairman of the PSD in Kibuye and according to what he told me, Bagosora apparently asked if Ndindabahizi could come to the meeting.  That is what I was told.
Q.	Did Rafiki go to that meeting?
A.	Yes, I was with him in fact.  He brought me, we were together.
Q.	Why did you decide to accompany Rafiki to that meeting?
A.	Rafiki had told him that I was there at his house.  Rafiki told Bagosora I was there.  Bagosora asked him if I could accompany him, Rafiki.  That is why I accompanied Rafiki through the ministry of defence, but Rafiki had spoke about this to Bagosora.  That's what he told me.  He told me that I could.  He told Bagosora, yes, I could accompany him.
Q.	But why did you freely choose to accompany him?  Couldn't you just stay in hiding at Rafiki's house?
A.	Counsel, the situation at the time wouldn't have allowed such a thing.  When Rafiki left he closed his whole house down.  He left with his wife and all the people, and his wife, in fact, had some problems, she was pregnant in fact.  He had to bring her to the hospital where she gave birth that night or the next day.  Everybody left the house, t was closed up.  Counsel, how could I stay there, or how could I refuse?  What could I do otherwise?  Was there any other way I could have done things, under those circumstances?  He accepted to welcome me into his house, I spent the night there.  His wife was pregnant and, in fact, in that neighbourhood I told you there was total insecurity.  There was gun shots here and there.  Later on -- in fact, we never went back there.  The situation became very serious.  I could only leave with him.  That's the only thing that I could have done.  I didn't know anyone else in that neighbourhood.  It was dangerous to move about on foot and even by car if I had had one.  I decided to go with him.
Q.	Very well.  Where did that meeting hold?
A.	At the ministry of defence, Counsel, in Kigali.
Q.	How did you get there from Rafiki's house to the minister of defence?  By what means of transportation?  With which protection?
A.	Well, we used Rafiki's car and Bagosora was still there.  He had soldiers with him.  They were in a jeep.  That was the protection or the security, if you will, for the group.
Q.	Must I understand, therefore, that from Rafiki's house all the way to the ministry of defence, you were accompanied by Colonel Bagosora in a jeep with soldiers?
A.	Counsel, before arriving there was something -- before arriving in the middle of our trip, there was something.  Rafiki told me that he can't go to that meeting; he couldn't go to that meeting.  He couldn't go without François Ndungutse, so we went to go to pick up someone else.  Rafiki said that he could not represent the PSD party at the ministry of defence without being accompanied by another person who was also a member of the politburo as he was, a person who was a native of the south region of the country.  Rafiki is from the northern region.  In his car he said, "Listen Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have some problems.  I don't know if I can represent the PSD, I'm afraid.  The PSD is -- it's strong hold is in the south and not in the north.  I don't want to be accused later on of taking over the PSD party which is a southern-based party".  He said, "I have to absolutely go and get Mr. Ndungutse so that he can come with me".  So, we went -- we went to Kicukiro in a roundabout way.  We went to get Ndungutse who was from Butare.  He was a member of the politburo.  We went to get him for that reason.  If I could just explain.  We were at Ndungutse's house, therefore.  Rafiki convinced him, but Ndungutse was having problems himself.  There were people who wanted to attack him from the outside.  Rafiki convinced him, and now he decided to go to the meeting.  The meeting that was holding at the ministry of defence, and from there we went to the ministry of defence, there were three of us.  I was with them.  Two members of the politburo; Rafiki and François Ndungutse (phonetic), and then myself.  We arrived at the ministry of defence together, and this was in the afternoon, the afternoon of the 8th of April 1994.  On that afternoon at around 3 p.m. we were there.  And I can't give you the exact time, but it was around 3 p.m. when we arrived there.
Q.	Were you with Mr. Rafiki's wife as well?
A.	As I told you, Counsel, she was pregnant.  She gave birth that night or the next day.  She was dropped off at the central hospital in Kigali.  It wasn't far away, just a hundred metres or so away from the ministry of defence, from the ministry of defence where the meeting was being held.
Q.	Very well.  It's the 8th of April 1994, it's 3 p.m. and you arrive at the ministry of defence, and who is there to welcome you?
A.	Counsel, could you really call it a welcome?  We weren't welcomed.  We arrived and we found people in the room; some were standing, others were seated.  There was no welcome; there was no protocol, if you will, when we arrived there.
Q.	Was Colonel Bagosora at the meeting when you arrived?
A.	When we arrived, there was no longer need for security and Bagosora wasn't there.  I don't know where he went.  We were not together at the meeting at the time we arrived there.  We weren't with him, to the best of my knowledge, Counsel.
Q.	What happened at the ministry of defence on that day?  Did somebody tell you something?  Did somebody propose something to you?  Describe the situation for us.  What happened during the meeting?
A.	Well, there wasn't a meeting as such when we arrived.  Some people were standing, others were seated.  Can you really call it a meeting, I don't think so?  The meeting was over.  When we arrived, the meeting was over.  The first thing we were told is, "Oh look, the PSD has arrived".  We've already informed the government who are the persons who will occupy the ministries that you hold.  The discussion was over.  I don't know who chaired the meeting.  We weren't told who chaired it.  People were standing, others were seated.  That's how it was.
Q.	Do you confirm that upon your arrival at the ministry of defence, the people who were already there proposed to you and to the other persons of the PSD who were with you to join the government; is that how things happened?
A.	Counsel, who are the other persons who accompanied me?
Q.	I'm talking about Rafiki and Ndungutse.
A.	I think I was accompanying them.  They weren't accompanying me, but, yes, I was with them.  I was with those two persons, and they are both members of the politburo of the PSD.  I was only chairman of the party in Kibuye; I was not a member of the politburo.  When we arrived, those two members of the politburo would play the game.  When they were asked who would represent our party -- first, they were surprised.  I was next to them.  I was following everything.  See, we have -- you have ministries.  Who is going to represent us?  Who is going to hold those portfolios?  That was the question that they asked.  The answer was the following: "Well, those people are dead or they've disappeared.  Those people who would represent our party are either dead or just disappeared.  What are we going to do" they said "with your ministries?"  Have I (interpretation unintelligible) satisfactorily covered the question, or should I go on to tell you what happened next?  I think, madam, Your Honour --
JUDGE KHAN:
What do you mean by "they"?  Who is "they"?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Perhaps I should have said one, O-N-E.  I'm sorry, I should have used one.  The French, un.  That is the one that said they were either dead or they've disappeared, and if you have a proper recollection it was Mugenzi that is the president or the chairman of the PR who was there.  And I told you that the meeting didn't have any chairman, visibly.  People were seated, people were standing, and Mr. Mugenzi told us, look - when we were asked where our former ministers were, I heard Mr. Mugenzi say, "They are either dead, or they have disappeared".  This is the answer we were given, and everybody there insisted because we had all the members of the various committees of the various parties that form the proceeding governments were there.  They were all represented except the PSD so they said, "We have finished our work.  We have already supplied the names of our ministers, now it's the turn of the ministries who were assigned to the PSD.  Now it's up to you, now, to tell us the ministers that were to replace your former ministers that are either dead or disappeared".  That was it, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What time is it now?  When did the meeting start, you said?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Mr. President, I did not say the time that the meeting started, because I don't know.  When we - when Bagosora arrived, I would say that was around 2, 3 p.m. and -- sorry, we arrived at 3 p.m.  We didn't know for how long those people were there.  All I can say is that they told us that they had finished their work, and it was the turn of the PSD to supply names.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how many persons were present in the meeting room?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Perhaps I can give you the names that I remember?  Now, for MRND, there was Gunamatse Matera (phonetic), Karamera Eduardo (phonetic).  I also saw Zidovera Joseph (phonetic).  For the MDR, I saw Murego Domat.  I also saw Karamera, Frodouald Karamera.  And for the PR, I saw Mugenzi Justin.  I also saw (interpretation unintelligible) and for the PDC, I do remember having seen Rumerigisa Caspar.  So, there was also another person for PDC, but I do not remember his name.  But there were two of them from the PDC, so that if one reckons -- it was the PSD that was missing.  So that when we arrived, I was with Ndungutse François and Rafiki, but we -- that day the meeting had ended, we did not take part in the meeting.  What we did is what I just said, that was when I was asked a question -- and, of course, what we had to tell each other -- the people we met there that it was the end of the meeting.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Ndindabahizi, what was decided in the meeting?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The purpose of the meeting -- when we got there, what we were asked to do was to appoint or to supply names of persons so that we were to occupy --
JUDGE KHAN:
You didn't follow my question.  When you reached there, what was decided in the meeting?  Do you know what was decided?  Do you know what was decided in the meeting? 

THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was the setting up of a government, an interim government.  That was what was decided upon at that meeting, because we were told -- you see the president of the republic is dead.  There is no longer any government, we are at war.  We should therefore look for how this country's to be run.  In other words, in a nut shell, it was a question of setting up an interim government.  If there was anything else done there, I wouldn't know.  But that was the purpose as it was told us.
JUDGE KHAN:
An interim government was set up in that meeting? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
That is correct, Your Honour.  That is correct, it was set up.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was this second person representing the PR?  I got Justin Mugenzi, but then there was a second name and that was a bit fast.  I think you have to spell that one.  
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was Ntambyariro.  N-T-A-M-A-R-I-R-O.  I'm sorry, N-T-A-M-A-B-Y-A-R-I-R-O, Ntamabyariro, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The three persons representing the PSD were Hutu; is that so? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
Yes, sir, they were Hutu.  Rafiki is Hutu; François is Hutu, and Ndindabahizi a Hutu.  They were all Hutu, sir.
JUDGE BOSSA:
There was this decision -- you found this decision made that there was going to be found an interim government, and that the PSD was to take three posts.  When was the decision made as to who was going to represent the PSD in that government?  Was it there and then, or some time later? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The members of the politburo, that's (interpretation unintelligible) decided there and then.  They were asked to appoint the representatives of the PSD and there, on the spot, they decided to allow the former directors of cabinet of those ministries to place the ministers that had either died or ran away.  That was the decision made there and then when we were there.  They immediately supplied names that were immediately added on the list.  Now, the problem was that we had three ministries; the minister of agriculture and lifestyle; the minister of finance; and the minister of public works and energy so that we had to have three directors of cabinet that should have succeeded the former ministers.  The problem was that there was a director of cabinet that had been killed, so that we only had two directors of cabinet and three ministries.  We had to find somebody else.  Now, in the decision made by the two members of the politburo --
JUDGE BOSSA:
I want to interject.  And when these two members of PSD there and then, were you consulted or was it just handed down?  And, what was your response? 
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
They did not consult me.  They decided quite simply that the directors of cabinet should continue so that they did not talk to anybody.  They said the directors of cabinet, since we could not get the problem (interpretation unintelligible) where the members are at a time of war, we should show our responsibilities.  They did not consult me.  They said the directors of cabinet will continue to assume those posts.  
JUDGE KHAN:
Who made the decision?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
The two members of the politburo, Mr. Rafiki and Ndungetse.  They signed the politburo agreement between the political parties that had just set up the government.  There was a decision adopted that was called -- sorry, that was a political agreement, an additional political (interpretation unintelligible).  There was an existing protocol and in that political agreement, they added representatives of the PSD.  They were Ndungutse and Rafiki who signed along with the other parties to set up that government.  They immediately signed, but they formulated reservations, both of them, and the political agreement, they formulated reservations.  They said, "We will accept to sign with conditions, otherwise we commit to party, but when the politburo of the party or the committee is set up, it will be the people in that committee that will decide whether these people should stay or be replaced so that the decision we made was provision.  They require that that be mentioned in the political agreement they signed as the basis of the setting up of that interim government.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Who was the director of cabinet who had already been killed at that point in time?
THE ACCUSED NDINDABAHIZI:
It was the director of cabinet of the ministry of agriculture and livestock called Kabesha Thomas (phonetic).
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Were you given information before the ministerial posts were proposed to the PSD concerning the guidelines of the interim government?
A.	No.  When we arrived, the government was almost set up.  The only thing that remained was the membership of the PSD which was to appoint those that were to represent the PSD, but -- I did not get the subtlety there, Counsel.
Q.	Let me rephrase this.  At one time or the other, at the minister of defence, were you informed about what the policy of that government was going to be?
A.	Well, when we arrived, the meeting was almost over except for the signing of the protocol of agreement.  That was signed between the parties that set up that government.  That was the only document signed by our representatives, and that showed what the government was going to do.  As for reasons why the government should have been set up, I did give you the reasons, but we did not sit down with those people to talk about all of that, about what was to be done by the government.  Our representatives signed, simply, what the others had decided upon -- decided to join.
Q.	Did you know who the prime minister was going to be?
A.	No, not at that time at all.  We did not know at all.  Personally, I did not know who was going to be prime minister.  I knew that it was MDR that was to name a prime minister, but we weren't given a name of the prime minister.  What we were interested in, when we arrived was that we give them many people to take part in the government that is all. 
Q.	Now, you were going to take part in a government.  You didn't go the policy of the government.  You didn't know the prime minister of that government; is that what you're saying?
A.	Unfortunately, yes, sir.  The condition, in which we were working, couldn't have permitted to do otherwise.  We were there.  We are representatives who are requested to make a decision on their feet.  The rest of the work was already done.  What do you want us to do?  We were not putting any conditions that were normal conditions and which one would have asked one to sit down and think about fair assumptions as to what should be done to make knowledgeable decisions.  We were faced with a (interpretation unintelligible).
Q.	Now, I have one last question on this issue and then we'll go on.  Now, why are you Ndindabahizi, under the circumstances of uncertainty, did not refuse to take part in that government?
A.	That is the same question as the one you put to me when you asked me why I didn't stay at Rafiki's house, or why I didn't decide to go elsewhere when Rafiki went away.  Well, I was at the ministry of defence.  I - at the ministry of defence from Rafiki's house, where I was a refugee -- he asked me to go along with him, and he gets there and he makes a commitment, he makes a decision.  He points to me and says that I was minister of finance.  Are you asking me why I did not reject that offer?  Do you really think that is possible for one under those conditions to refuse, really?  I don't know. 
Q.	Very well. 
MR. BESNIER:
Should we go on, Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have to stop now.  Now, it has been decided that the Muslim holiday will take place on Wednesday.  

That implies that we will continue these proceedings tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  We will then continue with your testimony tomorrow Mr. Ndindabahizi.  

And the Court is adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1725H)
