MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.

Can we hear each other now?
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

Counsel for the Defence was cross-examining you last night and he will now continue.

Maître Besnier, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS CGY
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, to summarise some of the statements that we went through yesterday, will it be correct to say that you left Karongi on 20th April 1994, and that you hid yourself in a bush between the 20th and the 26th of April with your wife and your children?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And on 23rd April you observed a distribution of weapons by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was there an attack immediately after the departure of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that 23rd of April 1994?
A.	On that day there was no attack.
Q.	The following day, which was 24th of April, was there an attack against the people who were taking refuge on Gitwa?
A.	Yes, an attack which was not large scale was launched on that day.
Q.	Did that attack occasion victims on the part of the refugees?
A.	Yes, people were killed, but there were not many.
Q.	How were they killed?
A.	They were killed with clubs and machetes because at that stage the attackers were not carrying guns.
Q.	The following day, 25th April 1994, was there another attack?
A.	Yes, there was another attack, not large scale, such that that attack was not successful from the standpoint of the attackers.
Q.	In your written statement you stated that this attack made victims among the Tutsis, but also among the attackers; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court how the attackers were killed by the people?
A.	The people came in a group and when they got close to the refugees on the hill -- when they were getting close, the refugees went to meet them.  There was a combat and since the attackers were few they went back, such that there were attackers who were killed during the fighting and, obviously, there were victims on the part of the people as well, the people attacked.
Q.	What weapons were used by the Tutsis against the attackers?
A.	The Tutsis also used traditional weapons which were available to them.  You know, when we were fleeing, those who had machetes carried them along.  In Kinyarwanda (sic), it is normal that when you have a weapon and you feel that you are in danger you protect yourself with that weapon.
Q.	Can we say that a large number of farmers who were all Tutsis also had machetes?
A.	Yes, in Rwanda normally, be they Hutu, Tutsi or the Twa, the people had implements, normally machetes which they used to work on their farms.
Q.	Thank you.  The 26th April 1994, there was an attack -- you witnessed an attack which was on a larger scale; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Are you able to describe in a few words the intensity of this attack?
A.	Yes, this was a large-scale attack.  The attackers came from all sides and they came in great numbers.  They were wearing banana leaves and they were carrying clubs and machetes.  The attack was large scale and the attackers came from all sides of the hill, and they were very determined.
Q.	Was there a large number of victims among the Tutsi?
A.	Yes.  It is not easy.  I don't know what terms to use to describe the number of people killed.  A lot of families were disseminated (sic), families numbering about 30 were completely disseminated.  There were few survivors after that attack.
Q.	Did the attackers have guns or other firearms?
A.	Most of the attackers had traditional weapons.  A small number of the attackers were carrying grenades and firearms and, among the attackers, there were civilians who had been trained in -- who had had weapon training and training in the use of grenades.
Q.	If I should refer to one of your previous answers, you stated that on 23rd April there were fewer victims because the attackers did not have guns as yet.  Am I to understand that guns were made available to the attackers between the 23rd and 26th of April?
A.	I told you that there was no attack on the 23rd, that however on the 24th and 25th there were attacks; but I told you that there was no attack on the 23rd.  Regarding firearms which were distributed on that day, I stated that weapons were distributed previously and secretly, but not on the day of the attack.
Q.	Would you know by whom and when these firearms were distributed?
A.	I cannot give you the details.  That was done secretly, but what makes me say that is that, among the attackers, some of them were in military uniform.  That is one.  Two, we do know that they were civilians in military uniform and, secondly, when the security situation worsened we heard explosions, such that -- which meant that there was a prior distribution of firearms and that there were instructions to that effect --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, can counsel wait for the interpretation before coming in?
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	-- but that on the 26th April 1994 firearms were used?
A.	Yes, firearms were used.  There was another attack that I referred to, that of the 18th, and that attack was led by one Musema, a former director of the Gisovu factory.  The attackers tried attacking us, but they did not succeed.  I thought to myself that they were trying to gauge the force -- the strength of the refugees and then, subsequently, there was a large-scale attack which I spoke about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please remember the pause, s'il vous plaît.  Please remember the pause between the question and the answer.  The interpreters are having a little problem here.
MR. BESNIER:
I'll do that, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You have just mentioned Mr. Musema, Mr. Witness.  You were a Prosecution witness in the Musema case; is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed, I was in that trial.
Q.	And, indeed, you testified against Musema, 30th of April 1999; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on with the Musema bit, can you repeat, Mr. Witness, the date on which Mr. Musema led the attack, the date?
THE WITNESS:
The first attack was on the 18th of April; that was when he led an attack.  I recall that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was that the only attack led by Mr. Musema, on the 18th of April?
THE WITNESS:
No.  He came back during the large-scale attack on the 26th of April, which I referred to earlier.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I have a question, and only one, to put to the witness in respect of his testimony in the Musema case.  I believe the registry can make available to the Judges the witness's testimony during the Musema case.  You already have the statement.  I'm going to use the English statement, and the Bench and the Office of the Prosecutor are English speaking.  I also requested that copies be made available to the -- copies of the transcripts be made available to the interpreters.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, do you read English?
A.	No.
Q.	Therefore, I'm going to read your testimony, with the agreement of the Office of the Prosecutor and the Bench; page 43 of the transcript of 30th of April 1999 in the Musema case, page 43, line 10.
MR. BESNIER:
The witness was being examined by one Mr. Phillips.

Mr. President, I'm going to have to read the questions in English.  Please bear with me with my English accent.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	"You were saying that you had left on the 20th -- you had left your previous hiding place on the 20th of April.  Why did you leave that place?"

Answer: "It is because a friend I was living with wanted me, given the fact that those he'd asked to come and help him did not know me and they could kill me."

Question by the Prosecutor: "Maybe I can clarify that for you.  Would I be correct in saying that the friend that you were staying with at Karongi had asked for some reinforcements and before the reinforcement arrived you thought it sensible that you left because the others would not sanction you being there; is that correct?"

You answered: "He told me to leave because he could not stay there alone because those with whom he was working had gone to another place."

Question: "Therefore, you were alone there?"

Answer: "I was there with my family and no one else."

Let us pause at this stage.  Witness, did you understand what I have just read to you?
A.	Yes, I understood.
Q.	I would like to continue for a while. 

The next question was: "Did you feel abandoned; is that what you mean to say?" 

Answer: "Abandoned by whom?"

Question by the President: "By your friend."

Answer: "It was a way of helping me because the reinforcement he had asked for, if those people had arrived, he would not have confidence in them.  So it was a way of helping me."

Question by the President: "I see.  Thank you."

Question by Mr. Phillips: "And would I be correct in saying that you left that place and sought refuge in the bush with your family; is that correct?"

Answer: "Yes."

Another question: "Whilst you were in bush did you witness another attack?"

Answer by the witness: "There were no other attacks."

Now, then, Witness, you have just said that there was an attack and there were victims among people on the 24th of April, and you also said that another attack made victims not only among the people but also among the attackers on the 25th April; whereas, in the Musema case you testified that there was no attack before the 26th of April.  Are you able to explain whether or not the attacks of the 24th and 25th April actually existed?
A.	I can explain that if I am given the opportunity.  I believe I explained extensively these attacks.  To start with, you made reference to the time when the people working with my friend left.  In fact, they were involved in looting, but I don't want to go into that.  If they left, it was because they -- that was in their interests.  When my friend realised that he was alone and that rumours had been circulated to the effect that the refugees were preparing to take over the Karongi antenna, questions were put to him in that respect, and he answered that he was not with anyone, and at that stage they wanted to give him military reinforcement but, given the circumstances, I do not think that soldiers were going to save me.  And I can't say anything about that.

So, as I said, there were smaller scale attacks which took place.  So, when you say there is a contradiction in my testimony, I made reference to an attack which took place on the 18th and other small-scale attacks.  And I don't know if you made reference to the attack of the 18th.
Q.	The attacks which took place on the 24th and 25th April -- you clearly answered in the Musema case that there was no attack before the 26th April, and I wanted your explanation on this point.  That is all.
A.	What I can say is that the person who recorded my testimony, if he said I said nothing on this, it's because my testimony was not properly recorded.  I recall yesterday when I said that the French came in May -- you said I said that the French came in May, but that was not what I said.  I said that they came probably after the 26th of the month of May.  But I did not have the opportunity to check these documents.  So I am just giving an example of what could have happened in that case.

There is a line which you pointed out to me where you said that I said that the French saved me in May.  That also reminds me of that passage because, as we all know, the French were not yet in the country in May.  That mistake is contained in that document, so I will give the same explanation regarding the -- the same explanation as I gave in respect of the mistake we met yesterday.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, Defence believes that there is, nonetheless, a contradiction in the testimony that was given in the Musema case and the testimony as given yesterday.
MR. BESNIER:
And I will have to enter the transcripts as exhibits in each pages 43 to 45, the witness -- transcript of the witness's testimony of 30th April 1999.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's then admitted as D7, I think.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, wouldn't it --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is whether it is sufficient with these three pages or whether we need to see it in context.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what I wanted to speak on, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. KAPAYA:
Because there is a question.  The witness was also closely examined on this very issue, on the question of attacks by Mr. K, in the course of the proceedings, so I thought it was better that the entire proceedings -- the entire evidence of this witness in the Musema case could be entered as an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have no problems with that because we did that with a previous Defence exhibit, a transcript.  So you have kindly copied the entire bundle.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Yes, very well.  I must say, Mr. President -- in that case, I would like the entire transcripts to be entered as an exhibit.

MR. PRESIDENT:
That's accepted.
(Exhibit No. D7 admitted)
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now, let's come back to Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Would you say that Mr. Ndindabahizi played an important role in the genocide perpetrated in Kibuye?
A.	I can say that he played an important role because when a leader carries out a distribution of weapons and issues orders, he does not have to use these weapons personally; but if you understand very well the concept of responsibility, then you will understand that he played an important role in the genocide.
Q.	Would you remember that you mentioned the name of Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi to -- in reference to his role in the genocide either before this Court, or before the investigators of this Tribunal, or before the Rwandan authorities before your statement of 10th May 2001?
A.	To date, in all the cases, be they the people who worked together with him or those who got the weapons -- there are a lot of them; some of them in prison, some have not been tried yet -- to date, I have not had any problem of anyone in my country; for example, if you contacted the court of first instance, you'd understand -- you would find out that I have not been involved in any case.  Before this court somebody was brought -- was accused -- was brought before this court and I was called upon to testify, but I have not testified in any other case in the Rwandan judicial system in relation to the events that -- or the genocidal events that occurred.
Q.	Let me clarify my question: why did you have to wait for seven years to talk about serious events accusing the former minister, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, whom you referred to as a senior officer of Kibuye?
A.	In return, I would like to put a question to you, you, as a lawyer.  Before you appeared before this Court you never came here to assist him in his defence, since he was not present to talk about  -- to talk about charges against him would be a vain exercise.
Q.	In Rwanda, is it not the duty of a good citizen to denounce the activities of an offender?
A.	How can you contact that judicial system when you have not been requested to do so?  For example, if I were not called upon to testify in this Court, I would not have done so.
Q.	Were you never interviewed by the prosecutor general, Mr. Gahima?
A.	No, he did not interview me in that respect.  You can contact him and if you find out that I testified in respect of that person, then I'll agree that I am a liar.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A pause please, Mr. President.  I guess it's a repeat of the previous question.

THE WITNESS:
Regarding Gérard Gahima, he came and put questions relating to some individual, but that had nothing to do with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  You can contact Mr. Gérard Gahima and if I said anything -- and if he said I said anything in respect of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, that would be a lie.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, the question now, Mr. Witness, is the following: have you ever been interviewed by Mr. Gahima?  Leaving aside the subject matter, have you ever been interviewed by him; yes or no?
THE WITNESS:
Gahima never interviewed me on any issue whatsoever.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. President (sic), I thought you said a while ago that Mr. Gahima interviewed you with regard to a certain individual.
A.	I accept that Mr. Gahima came to Kibuye.  But he never put any questions to me.  He came to the office of the prosecutor.  The office of the prosecutor summoned all of us.  We were many and we had to talk about one individual who had nothing -- who is not linked to this case before this Court.  It's a matter relating to people in Kibuye.  I was interviewed by an assistant prosecutor of the court of first instance in Kibuye.  I was, therefore, not interviewed by Gérard Gahima.  At that time Gérard Gahima was visiting the office of the prosecutor and he had reason to visit the office of the prosecutor, but I was not summoned by Gahima and those who were with me were also not summoned by Gahima.  It was the office of the prosecutor which summoned us.
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I have had my answer, Mr. President.

Another question and, in fact, I have six more questions, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, does it not appear strange to you that a minister, like Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, specifically came to Gitesi with soldiers to distribute weapons to people who already had some?  Would he not rather distribute firearms?
A.	That is not a problem, in my opinion.  Let me explain the situation to you.  He said he came to distribute some machetes, but I spoke about a box of military uniforms which had to be distributed.  Possibly -- it's even possible that guns were there and that they were waiting to be distributed, but they were members of the population with guns; so how did they get the guns?  So to say that he came to distribute just machetes is not surprising.  What we should focus on is that he did something and that led to certain consequences.
Q.	Witness, at the beginning of your testimony to your -- to the Prosecutor you said something in respect of knowing Mr. Ndindabahizi before the war, and you said something to the effect that he studied in Kirambo in '68 or '69; or was it, rather, you who studied in '68, '69?  Can you clarify this issue?
A.	Let me repeat my answer, just in case you did not understand.  I did say that I knew him when he used to come on holidays as a secondary school student.  In '68, '69, I was a student at Kirambo school which is neighbouring to his residence.  But ask him if at the time the Kirambo school was not close to his residence.  If he tells you the contrary, then you can say I am lying.
Q.	Another clarification which I need: you have made reference to PSD rallies, the social democratic party.  Can you say where and when these meetings took place -- these rallies took place?
A.	Normally, all the rallies took place in the building which is called the MRND palace.  It's a building that belonged to the préfecture, but now it's a building that is currently referred to as an all-purpose hall.  The rallies normally took place on Sundays because the people were normally available on Sundays.
Q.	Have you ever attended any of these rallies?
A.	No, I did not want to be a member of any political party for personal reasons so I never attended any political rally.
Q.	You also said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was an influential political figure at the national level.  What did you mean by that?
A.	By that, I meant that at the national level he was an important politician but, in fact, I was talking in relation to our préfecture.  He was an important leader within the PSD, such that at the national level he was like a representative of our region.  Currently, we talk about regions, but in those days we used to talk about préfectures.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.

Now I move on to my very last line of questioning.  I'm going to read a portion of your written statement to the investigators to you in relation to how you met Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  In the English version, it's a document K0181025 -- 0181525; that is, pages -- page 3 of the witness statement, paragraphs 2 and 3, and in the French version K0262326.  Are you following, Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You say: "I know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi well.  I'm sure I can still recognise him today.  We are natives of the same secteur, Gitesi.  I remember that since 1992 Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, came and held public meetings in his cellule at the ... centre." -- I don't want to mention the name of the centre so as not to reveal your identity.  "I did not attend these meetings, but afterwards people told me what they had been told.  I was always at my work at (By order of the Court these words have been extracted and kept under seal) in Kibuye town and I was not a member of a political party".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Besnier, it was very good that you didn't read the centre, but was not so good that you referred to the office.  So we have to strike the reference to the office in both the video system and in the transcripts.  That element will be put under seal then.  So, the transcripts will read, "I was always at my work place in Kibuye town", and then it goes on.  Please proceed.

MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry about that, Mr. President.  It just escaped me.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	"... and I was not a member of a political party.  Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, was an influential member of PSD.  The purpose of these meetings was to promote PSD and many people joined PSD, leaving other parties, including MRND."

Last paragraph --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President; we are lost.

Okay.  "I remember having seen Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, before the war around the end of 1993 on the road towards the guesthouse in Kibuye after a meeting in the conference room of the Kibuye préfecture office.  After the meeting he took a round in Kibuye town to greet and wave to his supporters from a car, and at the time I saw him for the first time."
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	If I believe you, Mr. Witness, you are saying that you saw Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi once come to greet his supporters; is that correct?
A.	Continue, Counsel.  I understand you and I'm going to give you explanation after your question.
Q.	On the last bit of the sentence which I read to you, "it was the first time I saw him", I understand from that that that was the first time that you were seeing him when he came to greet and wave at his supporters, and that was around the end of 1993.
A.	Yes, I understand what you are saying, Counsel.
Q.	Then answer the question.
A.	I'm going to answer.  When he came to hold the meeting, he went round in a vehicle.  He went round the town greeting people, shaking people's hands.  I told you that he used to get out of his vehicle to shake hands with the people.  But regarding the lower class, he would normally wave to them from his vehicle, but to greet people of higher classes he would get out of his car to shake their hands.  I think I explained that to you already.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this will be my last question.  I would like to give the witness a piece of paper with two names, and I would like to know if the witness has any family ties with these two people.

Registry, can you show these names to the Court, to the Office of the Prosecutor and then to the witness? 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Do you know the names of the persons whose names you are seeing on the two pieces of paper you have before you, Mr. Witness?
A.	I know one of these people only, and even the person whose name I recognise is not related to me at all; we are not even neighbours, but I do know the person.  I'm going to mark the paper on which the name of the person I know is -- I recognise, with a letter "V", and the other name, I'll mark with a question mark.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. BESNIER:
I have come to the end of my cross-examination, Mr. President, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Any re-examination? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, yes; just two questions, Your Honours.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified to me that the attack occurred on the 26th of April and before.  Now, what makes you recall that particular date?
A.	I remember this date.  It's a date which I'll never, ever forget in my whole life.  I will remember it until I die.  I saw unnameable things which I had never, ever seen in my life; people who were attacking small children, babies, pregnant women, everyone, anybody, old men.  These are unnameable things which I will never, ever forget.
Q.	Now, can you now -- in relation to that particular attack, can you tell us how many days, approximately, was it before you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	I'm going to give you a simple example.  I'm using the date of the 26th -- in other words, the last day, the day which I have said I will never, ever forget -- because there were thousands of people who died and these people were innocent people.  So, let me begin with the 26th on which there was a large-scale attack.  On the 25th -- in other words, before the 26th -- there was a surprise attack and on the 24th there was a smaller-scale attack.  On the 23rd that was the day of the distribution of the material.  I will stop there but, if you will, I can repeat the answer I have just given, if that's not a waste of time for you.
Q.	That will suffice for the purposes of my question.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I have before you the three photographs which you requested to be provided with.  Now, can I -- I wonder whether I can ask the witness to clarify on some these.
(Pages 1 to 11 by Verna Butler)


	1500H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	May I ask the technicians, please, to beam the photograph exhibit which is before the projector?  Can you kindly beam the --
MR. BESNIER:
Objection, Mr. President, my cross-examination did not deal with these photographs.  I didn't ask any questions of the witness on these photographs, and I am done with my cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are quite right, Mr. Besnier.  In fact, it was me who raised that at the end of the last session.  So, I think the correct procedure would then be that I ask these questions to the witness as questions from the Bench.  So, we will handle this, Mr. Kapaya, unless you want an exception from the               cross-examination.
MR. KAPAYA:
As it pleases, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  Do you have any other questions, please?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, my actual --  my last questions are focused on these three photographs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  

Now, Mr. Witness, we have now been provided with -- thank you very much, Prosecution.  We have now been provided with three photographs which are in our bundle, but these are more easy to read.  

If the registry could show this witness page 10 -- no, page 11; please use page 11, registry.  

Now, do you recognise this place, Mr. Witness?  Have you seen this photograph before?
THE WITNESS:
These photographs have not been shown to me before today.  But the answer that I can give in terms of what these pictures relate -- and I'm not doubtful at all about what I am going to say.  I'm going to give you as much explanation as I can on these photographs.  

I can see a place, which I believe I recognise quite well.  It is a place at which there is a kind of road, and towards the top I see a stable where cattle were kept.  I can see trees; I think this is the forest and the house where I was.  You can see pillars above the road, and a kind of mount.  I went to this location with investigators, and the only thing I mentioned is that that is where I was hiding, but the house had been destroyed.  We had been waiting for assistance to get the house rebuilt.  And since we didn't get that, we were using these poles or these pillars as firewood.  

That is where I was.  And I think from there I can see the road.  I can see my signature below.  And I see the figure K0181533 on this sheet of paper.  I, therefore, believe that I'm not wrong, and that this is the photograph about which you are asking me questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a pen in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, but I do not have any paper.  I would like to be given a piece of paper, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, would you be able to mark on this photo where the house was; where, according to you, you were hiding -- you said that the house had disappeared -- could you indicate?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can indicate where the house once stood.  I have marked that location with the letter "V" for Victor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you, very much.  If that could then be -- 
THE WITNESS:
I also wish to thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  If that could just be passed around, and I think we will mark it as Chamber Exhibit 1.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, can it also be put on the projector for all to see?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is possible.  Can you do that please?

If there are no more questions from the Prosecution, just for the record, I note that the parties have not requested that the written statements of this witness, or any other witness for that matter, be placed automatically before the Chamber as an exhibit.  So, for instance, these three documents relating to this witness have not been exhibited.  

But in view of the fact that reference was made to a particular month when the French came in one of the statements, namely, the statement of 2001, that was the point mentioned by you, Mr. Kapaya, and it was also briefly mentioned during cross-examination, I think just to put it on record that I noted that in the witness statements dated the 13th of January 1999, where there is also a reference in the last sentence concerning the witness rescued by French soldiers, and there I note that the witness says, "I continued to hide from the attackers until I was rescued on the 11th of July by French soldiers, who took us to a certain camp".  It is not very important matter, but I just thought that the record should reflect this. 

Mr. Witness, the Gitwa hill you were hiding during this period, in what commune was it?
THE WITNESS:
Well, with regard to the commune, I was still in our commune of Gitesi in the hills which are near the place where I lived, in the secteur which neighbours the place where I live.  Gitwa was a place where one couldn't really hide.  It was almost a desert like place, and one could find dead bodies there and heads of victims.  

There had been many killings there, and as people were being killed their bodies decomposed, and the attackers continued to loot and to rejoice about their work.  But some attackers were also -- were still on the lookout and would go into the bushes to look for any possible survivors, and sometimes, they did find survivors.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much.  This will then bring your testimony to an end, Mr. Witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, I would like to pursue the other two photographs for purposes of identity by the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MR. KAPAYA:
	May I now refer the witness to photograph No. 10, on page 10?
THE WITNESS:
I can see the photograph. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, no we think that we have to stick to this procedure here, and since this was not raised, we tend to think that the last question has been asked, unless you have a very convincing explanation why you should follow up this, because we did not asked any questions concerning the other two paragraphs.  I just wanted to raise one particular issue concerning the observation place of the witness; that is why I thought that was relevant.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  And as far a Rule 85(B) is concerned, having raised that question, my learned friend is well entitled to follow up on it, if he considers it prejudicial to his case.  That is the whole point that I raised the other day about Rule 85(B), and whilst Your Honours can ask questions, it cannot compromise my case.  And if he, in his professional opinion, deems it to be so, he has a right to explore that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but this cannot -- how can you possibly say that this compromised or was prejudicial to his case, because it --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, what happened is simply that I wanted to see something which was in the Prosecution's bundle, namely, this document.  And I just wanted to know whether the witness was able to say where he was positioned when he made his observation.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Having invited the witness to comment on a document of any sort, Your Honour, it then forms part of the Prosecutions case. And, indeed, I can argue either way that it compromises my case.  As long as you have invited comment from a Prosecution witness, it then impacts directly on our case.  That is my respectful submission.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is your respectful submission even if this were only -- even if the question only related to one paragraph, as of one page and not the two other pages.  What is your comment on that?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, there is a distinction between seeking for clarification on a matter that has been raised by either party.  And there certainly is clearly a different matter for the Trial Chamber and, indeed, the Bench to raise an issue entirely on its own; they are two separate matters.  

And the impression I get from the proceedings yesterday and today, was that this matter was not directly confronted by any of the parties.  Instead, it was raised by the Bench; having been raised by the Bench, we then have a right to address the issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Try to relax a little bit now.  This is not a very dramatic thing, we are listening.  So, I take note of your submission and we will hear the other side.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So, what is your view, then?
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I believe that I had formulated an objection a moment ago, and the Tribunal did not admit my objection.  And I think the Tribunal accepted that these photographs could not be presented by the Prosecution as evidence, and I think we should stop there, and stick to the ruling which had earlier been made by the Chamber.  

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a little moment to deliberate

All three Judges are of the opinion that we will enter, then, this document on which I raised a question as Chamber Exhibit 1.  And that was the question which will be raised in addition to this witness. 

So, Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  And we thank you for having come forward to the Tribunal here in Arusha, and wish you a safe journey home.  Please, do not discuss your testimony with anyone. 
(Chamber Exhibit No. 1 admitted)
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you want to speak.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I wish to say something, I will be very brief.  I thank you very much, Mr. President.  But I have some concerns which I want to express to you, Mr. President.  And they are the following:  My concerns in the conclusion of the presentation of my testimony, you have asked me to not share this with anyone.  When a secret is divulged, it no longer remains a secret.  I wish to tell you one thing.  You do your job very well, but you know there can be obstacles which may be of hindrance to us as witnesses, but which may not be evident to you as Judges.  We, who are outside of this Chambers, we have problems.  I'll give you a few concrete examples.  

Defence counsel stated that I had said that there was no attack, and I answered that my statement was not well taken down, because I gave as an example the place in my written statement where I had -- where there was mention made of French being in Rwanda in May, whereas the French was not there then, that is something that was well-known.  Yet in my statement, it was stated that they were there in May, but I will not come back to that.  
What I wish really to say is this:  Delegates from the Tribunal called us to the town, and they met us at -- on the veranda of the office of the mayor of the commune.  Everyone was present at the mayor's office, and they could see what we were doing.  I think this should be corrected, because it is a procedure which may bring about insecurity on our part.  This is done on a determined date.  I can mention the date to you.  I will not mention the names of the individuals involved, but these are persons who have committed a mistake; a mistake which has arisen in the proceedings.  

I wish to also raise another point.  Someone came, and he said that he was part of the Ndindabahizi Defence team.  I have proof of what I am saying.  He was looking for Defence witnesses.  You know that in a trial there are Prosecution witnesses and Defence witnesses, and it depends on what one knows about the Accused.  So this person came, and I don't know whether in the Rules of the Tribunal this is allowed; in other words, it is the Prosecutor who contacts us; does he have the right to go and contact Defence witnesses in the Ndindabahizi case?  What I'm telling you about did happen, and I have the evidence; I was not the only person contacted, there were other friends who were also contacted. 

I have another issue to raise within the framework of our security and safety.  You say that everything should be done in confidentiality, and you ask us to speak the truth and not to be indirect in what we say.  But when we are not indirect in what we say, there is no longer confidentiality; there is no secret.  So if Defence counsel for Ndindabahizi tells me that I didn't mention this or that, if I answer him, he doesn't keep these answers to himself.  This is information which I am providing which goes out and cannot be held back again.  This is what I wanted to say, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I thank you. 

The name of the organisation for which I was working, and the time during which I was working there, and people will understand who the witness is.  I think since he mentioned this, he is putting me in a difficult situation, and yet he is a lawyer himself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for raising these issues.  When it comes to the first matter, namely, whether it was easy to observe some of you at your place of origin, that is something that the Prosecutor is looking into whether there was a mistake or not.  We heard that previously in the courtroom.  And I understand that the laws in connection with the witness protection unit make sure that things like that do not happen.  

As to the second question, whether the Ndindabahizi Defence team or certain representatives for that team have contacted you, I note what you are saying.  Please address your concerns to the witness protection unit.  Could you just indicate when this episode took place, Mr. Witness, according to your recollection?
THE WITNESS:
I think I know the date.  I had mentioned it on a piece of paper, but when I was to travel, I was a bit in a hurry and I wasn't able to find the piece of paper again.  I wasn't alone; I think this affects at least three witnesses.  There was a witness who was called, he was far away, and he was transported on a vehicle.  But I was close by, and another witness was also very close and was working close to that place. So these are three people.  

And I think that these three people are going to be mentioning this matter to you.  So we shall give you the date.  I do not know the person who came to contact us.  But the person who contacted me to meet this other person at a given place, I wouldn't say it is an office, I'm not going to mention the place, but let's say that it was a place where there was a bar.  

I know the person who asked me to go to that location.  So I'm requesting that you follow this matter up closely, because if there were ever to be any problem, these people should be held responsible, or they should be made accountable.  And that the person who was looking for us should be known -- should be known.  We need to know who was looking for us.  

I know this person physically, but I do not know his name.  But the one who came to me, the one who was the intermediary, the go-between, who made us meet the other person, I know that person very well and I know that person 100 per cent.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, Mr. Witness, rest assure that this is being followed up.  Whenever such allegations are made, we are following them up.  And I can assure you that in this particular case, I have already been in touch with the witness protection unit to investigate the matter, because similar allegations have been made by other witnesses.  

So rest assure, and if you would kindly provide specific information about this to witness protection unit.  When it now comes to your third point, then it is true that there was a slip of the tongue here in this session, today, but that was obviously inadvertent, counsel excused himself, and the information was placed under seal and delete from the record of the Court video system.  So you can be confident that this information will not be disseminated.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  And we wish you a safe journey home.  

And if the registry could kindly accompany the witness out of the courtroom, after having drawn the curtains, please? 

THE WITNESS:
I thank you. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next witness is CGF, Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
CGF, Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, registry, if you could kindly escort the witness into the courtroom. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness.  You are in open session now, so when you are asked questions, please be careful so as not to reveal your identity.  You have to tell the truth.  And the registry will now take the sworn declaration.
MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up and raise your right hand and say after me. 
(Declaration made by Witness CGF in Kinyarwanda).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, do you have a piece of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have it right here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that your signature at the bottom of that page?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is indeed my signature.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information contained in that document is correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That will then be P8 under seal.  All right, Prosecution please. 
(Exhibit No. P8 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, again, to Your Honours.
WITNESS CGF
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Actually, Your Honour, I hadn't considered the nature of this witness's testimony.  In that regard, I would invite Your Honours to look at pages 96 -- I take that back.  Look at -- yes, if you look at pages 96 through 101, it becomes terribly apparently that this nature and, indeed, the nature of his testimony has a great bearing on his area of residence presently.  I'm more worried about his present location than I am about his location in 1994.  

The witness still resides in that location.  And that location forms the essence -- the essence -- the very essence of his testimony.  And whilst I make the application for this particular witness, it is going to be the same for the one that comes after him as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you just -- we have page 96 in front of us, now.  Could you just indicate the paragraph where it is particularly transparent?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if I refer you to page 96 itself, to paragraph seven where it says addresses as the starting point.  Aside from the place of birth, Your Honours, look at the current residence and glance across to the residence in April of 1994.  It then becomes apparent that the witness hasn't moved and that cellule also has some bearing with the Accused person.  

So you see, he talks about events in that location, it is the location where he still resides.  He has to mention people who also still reside in that location.  And it then becomes very obvious who he is.  And then I also invite Your Honours to look at paragraph five, which details his ethnic group, increases the likelihood of repercussions following his testimony, Your Honour.  

A follow-up question which I know is perhaps on Your Honour's lips is, how much of this testimony am I seeking to exclude.  The honest answer is all, because I fear -- I fear to delve into matters that may eventually, unconsciously, either by virtue of his replies or my state of excited ness reveal his identity.  
So I regret that I'm going to have to ask for the entirety of his testimony to be excluded.  And I do that under the provision of Rule 79(A), little two, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comments, Defence?
MR. BESNIER:
No objections, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have glanced through the testimony, now, and in light of what you have just said --
THE WITNESS:
(No translation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking the interpreter to speak up because he has problems with his hearing.  The witness is asking for the volume on his headsets to be increased because he has problems with hearing, he is a bit hard of hearing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, but what we were about to say here was that having looked at the statement, and in view of the submissions by the OTP, it is clear that the safest is to decide to hear this witness in a closed session, because the combination of the elements may, very well, reveal his identity.  

So I'm sorry to ask the audience, kindly, to leave the public gallery during this witness' testimony.  This is exceptional; usually we hear it in open session, but we have to be sure that nothing happens to our witnesses.  

Thank you very much, indeed.
