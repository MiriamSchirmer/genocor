MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, please.
MR. DIALLO:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Erik Møse, presiding, Rachid Khan and Balungi Bossa, is sitting today, Monday, the 1st of September 2003, in open session for the commencement of the trial referred to as Case No. ICTR 2001-71-T, the Prosecutor v. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.

I thank you, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

The Prosecution has already presented -- placed itself on record for the pre-trial purposes.  Maybe since we are now in a public session we should repeat the exercise.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Good afternoon, to your Honours.  Mr. Peter Tafah, Mr. Wallace Kapaya and myself, Charles Adeogun-Phillips, represent the Office of the Prosecutor for this trial.  We are ably assisted by Ms. Céline Fomété and Ms. Daniela Link.

I am most grateful, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Defence, please?
MR. BESNIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am Pascal Besnier, from the Paris bar, and I am with Guillaume Marçais from the Paris bar.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Mr. Besnier was speaking rather fast, and I missed the name of the assistant.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could just repeat the name of your assistant, Mr. Besnier?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, he is Mr. Léopold Munderere, spelt M-U-N-D-E-R-E-R-E, and he is from the Kigali bar association.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.
Prosecution, you have the floor for opening statements.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.

Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands before you today, charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, for the murder and extermination of Tutsi civilians, in and around his home commune of Gitesi in the prefecture of Kibuye in Rwanda.

Needless to say, Your Honours, these crimes are some of the most heinous of crimes known to mankind.  The Defence will have Your Honours believe that the widespread, systematic and sustained attacks on Tutsi civilians throughout Rwanda in l994 resulting in the said genocide, was a spontaneous outburst of communal hatred triggered by the downing of the president's plane as it approached Kigali airport on 6th of April 1994.

The Prosecutor will however, represent to Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi which occurred in Rwanda during the said period was conscious, meticulously planned, and orchestrated at the highest level -- at the highest official level.  The Prosecutor will further represent to Your Honour, that the killing of Tutsi was a result of the strategy, the essence and objective of which was a systematic elimination and extermination of all Tutsi in Rwanda, in effect, leaving none to tell the story.

Your Honours, simple logic would suggest that given the magnitude of the killings, it was virtually impossible for such mass killings to have been committed within 100 days without the direct involvement of the state.  In that regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the opposition of the extremist Hutu in power at the time to the power-sharing agreement reached in the Arusha Accords, led to the formulation of an extremist "Hutu-power" ideology within Rwanda.

Two Prosecution witnesses, Your Honours, GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges, will testify that although the interim government established following the president's death was composed of five of the six political parties in Rwanda, in reality the said government essentially comprised of politicians who were selected from the extremist factions of the respective political parties, many of whom were opposed to the power-sharing agreement.

Your Honours, indeed, the majority of the politicians who formed the said government were
non- extremists.  However, there were some politicians amongst them who had no known history of extremism, but rather, were mere opportunists brought into the said government without any real political power, but rather, as a façade to establish a broad-based government.

Your Honours, the Defence will have you believe that those politicians who had a known history of extremism were indeed more likely to have a motive to commit these heinous crimes than the politicians who belonged to the known moderate parties such as the PSD.  They would argue that such politicians, the moderates, simply have no case to answer.  In that regard, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honour, that factors such as past or present political affiliations had little or 
nothing -- absolutely no bearing on the sad events which form the basis of this trial.

Witness GKH will describe to Your Honour how, from 7th April 1994, three categories of politicians existed in Rwanda: those who were seen as obstacles to the genocidal government and were eliminated; the second category, those who fled the country in the knowledge of what was about to happen and did not want to be seen to be part of it; and the third category, those who remained and chose to participate in the said genocidal government.

At 10:30 p.m.  on the evening of 8th April 1994, Dr. Thédore Sindikubwabo, who was then the president of the National Assembly, in a radio broadcast to the nation, declared himself president of Rwanda, citing article 42 of the constitution of 10th June 1991.  He announced a list of members of the "provisional government".

Now, regardless of their political affiliation, 20 ministers on the morning of 9th April l994, pursuant to paragraph 56 of the constitution of 10th June 1991, pledged to do as follows, Your Honour, and I quote from paragraph 56 of that constitution.  They pledged to:  "Loyally carry out their duties and be faithful to the Republic of Rwanda, the Head of State, and most importantly, to promote the interest of Rwandan people".

Your Honours, for those men and women who chose to serve in that said provisional government, and those who took the oath of office on the 9th of April, there was now a common denominator that held them together.  It was not political affiliation, but rather, the need to fight the common enemy and those perceived as its accomplices.

Your Honours, the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, an accountant by profession, chose to serve in that transitional government as Minister of Finance.  He remained in that position, Your Honours, until November 1994.  Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, I would represent to Your Honours, was dedicated to cause and country, and that, we say, was a clear motive for participating in such a horrendous crime and criminal enterprise.

Your Honours, it is not therefore surprising that having taken the said oath as indicated by paragraph 56 of the constitution, to be loyal to both cause and country, we find that the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in one form or the other in the killing of Tutsi in and around his native commune and prefecture of origin, Kibuye.

Your Honours, the Accused was a member of the Social Democratic Party, the PSD.  Indeed, he was the chairperson of the said party in his native Kibuye prefecture.  In that regard, Your Honours -- sorry, in that regard, the Accused will have Your Honours believe that the PSD was indeed famous for its moderate stand prior to April 1994.

The Prosecutor will, however, represent to Your Honours that whilst this may have been the case prior to 6th April 1994, the entire moderate leadership of the said party, including those PSD members who by virtue of the power-sharing agreement had participated in the Habyarimana government, had all been eliminated by 12th April l994.  They included Félicien Gatabazi, the PSD leader and cabinet minister in the Habyarimana government, who was assassinated in April 1994.  Mr. Frederic Nzamurambaho, who was the president of the PSD and also a minister in the Habyarimana government, was also assassinated on the 7th of April 1994.

Now, Your Honours, those who had not fled the country, those who hadn't been killed in the first days of the genocide had, in fact, left the country, leaving only members of the PSD, like the Accused, who sympathised and identified with the extremist Hutu ideology to take part in the provisional government.

Now, one of those who fled the country was a man called Marc Rugenera.  He was a senior member of the PSD party and a finance minister in the Habyarimana government.  Rugenera had been earmarked for elimination as well, but had only escaped death due to the fact that he did not reside in the ministerial district like other ministers.  You would be interested to know, Your Honours, that the Accused that stands before you today replaced him in the genocidal government as Minister of Finance.

To survive in government, the Prosecutor would represent to Your Honour that those who chose to remain in the said provisional government quite simply had to remain loyal and committed to the chosen path and had to be seen to be so.  Indeed, those who remained there were at great pains to distance themselves from any association with the perceived enemy.

On 19th April 1994, Your Honours, the interim President Sindikubwabo identified his government as "a government of saviours," a government that would come directly to the people "to tell you what it expects of you".

During the third week of April 1994, ministers and other high-ranking officials did go into the countryside, insisting on the need to support the genocide, promising rewards to supporters and threatening sanctions against dissenters.  Your Honours, the Accused was no exception.

Prosecution Witness GKH was an elected parliamentarian.  His only offence, Your Honour, was that he was married to a Tutsi woman.  That witness will testify in the course of today how the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, accused him of being inactive and demanded the witness to waive his right to assume his elected seat in parliament in favour of another party member who was supposedly more active.

In a speech during a visit to Butare on the 29th April l994, the then interim president, Théodore Sindikubwabo, emphasized that government ministers from Butare had returned home in order to supervise the killing of Tutsi.  On the 18th of May 1994, Mr. Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye préfecture and publicly congratulated the Hutu population for having done its work.

Similarly, the then interim Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, visited Kibuye on 3rd May 1994.  Various ministers of the interim government who originated from Kibuye prefecture were present at this meeting.  This included the Accused, Your Honour.  Witness GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges will testify that despite the large-scale massacre that occurred in Kibuye prefecture between 14th and 30th April l994, absolutely none of the senior government ministers present at the said meeting, including the Accused, condemned or even referred to the massacres.

In that regard we would submit to Your Honours that by focusing hatred on Tutsi, the organisers of killings hoped to forge solidarity amongst Hutus.  But beyond that, Your Honours, they aimed at creating collective responsibility for genocide.  People were encouraged to kill together so that no one would bear individual or total responsibility for the executions.

The Prosecutor will represent to the Trial Chamber, that the involvement of the present population in the massacres that followed was facilitated by their misplaced belief, Your Honours, and confidence in their leadership, and also by an understanding that the encouragement of the authorities guaranteed them immunity to kill Tutsi and loot their property.  From 12th April to the beginning of May 1994, the killers carried out the most devastating massacres of genocide throughout Rwanda.

According to the 1991 census, 12.4 per cent of the Kibuye prefecture population was killed in the genocide.  That means, Your Honour, approximately 80 per cent of the Tutsi population.  The majority of those killed in Kibuye were killed in the first two weeks of the genocide, that is, between the 6th and 21st April, 1994, and then again in mid-May 1994.  It is the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that the Accused, as a member of the interim government, frequently visited Kibuye in order to instigate and order the killing of Tutsi civilians in his préfecture of origin.

By virtue of his prominence in the local community, the Accused as president of the PSD party in Kibuye, as a serving minister, was clearly a person of considerable influence.  As such, civilians, gendarmes, members of the Interahamwe militia, were more likely than not to follow his orders.

Now, several Prosecution witnesses that you will hear in the course of this trial, Your Honours, will testify that roadblocks which had been established to promote security and check rising crime in Rwanda were very quickly transformed and used to identify Tutsi for killing.

Now, by restricting movement at these roadblocks, it made it less likely for people to escape.  In some cases, local businessmen and local officials, people like the Accused, sponsored these roadblocks and supported those who manned those roadblocks with food, drinks and weaponry. 

Your Honours, the Prosecutor will represent to you that as a member of the provisional government, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's mere presence at the roadblock, or indeed several roadblocks in and around Gitesi commune, or indeed his presence, or alleged presence during attacks in Gitwa Hill Karongi Hill, and in the area of Bisesero, would most certainly have an encouraging effect on the attackers.  But more importantly, Your Honours, it would have conveyed to those attackers the impression that the killings of Tutsi in Kibuye was endorsed by the interim government.

The Prosecutor would further represent to Your Honours that the actions of the Accused throughout the months of April, May, June 1994, as outlined in the indictment, namely, the distribution of weapons, his participation in the systematic killing by leading convoys, transporting attackers to massacre sites, being seen at several roadblocks at various locations, is demonstration of his specific intent to destroy in whole or in part of Tutsi as a group.  Indeed, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's statements and directives provide direct evidence of his genocidal intent.

In terms of context within which the activities were conducted, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honours that there are striking similarities between the killing of Tutsi civilians at various roadblocks in Gitesi commune, Kibuye, the attacks on Gitwa Hill, also in Gitesi commune, the attacks in the area of Bisesero, and those launched against Tutsis in other areas and other parts of Kibuye préfecture and, indeed, in the country of Rwanda as a whole during the same period.

Now, in that regard, Your Honour, it is the Prosecution's case that the mass killings and other crimes alleged in this present indictment or code, was part of a wider genocidal plan and policy to exterminate Tutsis throughout Rwanda between April and June 1994.  To that end, I urge Your Honours not to assess the factual allegations that you would hear in this case in isolation, but, rather, to consider those allegations in the overall context of events -- the events that occurred in Rwanda between April and June 1994, and more specifically in Kibuye préfecture within the same period.  Because it is only such an approach, Your Honours, that will provide you with a better understanding of the context within which the Accused committed the crimes alleged in the present indictment.

Finally, Your Honour, as outlined in Appendix A of the pre-trial brief, the Prosecutor will rely on the evidence of 17 protected factual witnesses, an expert witness, and an investigator, during the course of this trial.

Your Honours, based on the premise that the Prosecutor will be able to present four witnesses every week, I expect that the Prosecution will complete the presentation of her case within four weeks from today.  Unless I can be of further assistance to Your Honours, the Prosecutor is ready to call her first witness.  He is Mr. Upendra Baghel, an investigator from her office, and he will be led by my colleague, Mr. Wallace Kapaya.

Your Honours, I thank you for your attention.
MR. PRESIDENT:

(Pages 1 to 12 by Regina Limula)













1445H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Baghel, what do you intend to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Hold on a little moment, Mr. Kapaya.

Please proceed.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	Mr. Baghel, just very briefly, what's the relevance of these maps to the work you did in this case?
A.	The first map, which is the Rwanda map, it shows that Rwanda is surrounded by Tanzania, Burundi, Congo and Rwanda (sic), and it consists of eleven préfectures which have been shown in the map.  

The second map, which is of Kibuye because Kibuye is one of the préfectures of Rwanda, there is a map of Kibuye préfecture which shows that this préfecture is surrounded by Gisenyi, Gitarama, Gikongoro, Cyangugu préfectures.  And this Kibuye préfecture consists of nine communes, and Gitesi is one of the communes.  

Third map, which is basically a road map, which shows that Kigali to Gitarama is around 42 kilometres, and Gitarama to Gisenyi is around 138 kilometres, Gisenyi to Kibuye is 104 kilometres, and Kibuye to Gitarama is 76 kilometres.  I travelled on these roads and I measured the time which I took, which have been indicated in the map.
Q.	All right.  Now part 2 of the - of your work consists of, of sketches consisting of hills.  Can you briefly describe the source of the information which is contained in this one, in this map?
A.	For the part 2, it shows the map of Gitwa hill and adjourning hills.  Here, the primary source has been an earlier-prepared Bisesero map, the source of most of the hills, and which is in the evidence unit, and I was one of the members who prepared the map.  This primary source after that I took to the field, and again, I contacted the concerned authorities and verified.  So now, this map consists of the Gitwa hill and Gitesi commune and adjourning hills.
Q.	And what is the relevance of these sketches in this case?
A.	During the course of the investigation of this file, I noticed that many witnesses are from Gitwa hill, which is in Gitesi commune, and some other hills nearby.  So this map shows where Gitwa hill is located, which is hill number 25 on the Gitwa hill map, which is reference L0019869.  And this hill is located on the road which goes from Kibuye to Karongi hill, which is hill number 20 is Karongi hill, and it goes Gisovu.  And the adjourning hills are -- they are in Bisesero, which I numbered from one to 19.  And there is one more road which comes from Kibuye to these hills directly, because these hills have been referred by the witnesses during the investigation, so these hills are depicted where they are located on the map.
Q.	Now, Mr. Baghel, it relates to the names of the hills.  We see in hill numbers 5, 6 -- in hill 5, they are all referred to as Gitwa hills.  How would one make the distinction between the three hills?
A.	Yeah, hill number five and six, they are also called Gitwa hill, but they are in Gishyita commune; and hill number 24 - sorry, 25 is the Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.  These three hills are quite far away from 25, to hill number 5 and 6, and the direct distance between these hills can be measured because this map is as for the scale.  It has been taken extract from map which was prepared in 199 -- in 1998 by the National Geography of Belgium in collaboration with Rwanda.  So, these two hills are totally different.
Q.	Now, can you relate these hills to the photographs that you have prepared in this bundle?
A.	In this bundle, I took the photographs of Gitwa hill, which is in Gishyita commune, and this is hill number 25.  And these photographs are in part 4, photo number 3 to 6.  Photo number 3, which is on the page L0019886, is the photo of Gitwa hill taken from the roadside, and part of the road is seen.  

And photo number 4 is taken from the top of Gitwa hill, and as seen from the photograph, top of Gitwa hill having a small grass, small plants and loose stones.

Photo 5 is taken from Gitwa hill towards left direction, that is, pointing towards hill number 26.  So the front which we see the hill is hill number 26, called Gasagaza (phonetic) hill, and as this stretch of road is seen, this stretch of road goes to Kiziba.  Now in Kiziba there is a refugee camp maintained by the UNHCR.  

Photo number 6 is also taken from the top of the hill on the right side, so on the right side this road is seen.  This road is coming from Kibuye town and going through Gitwa hill to Karongi hill, then to Gisovu.  And on the right side there is Kibuye town and the lay council, and the valley is seen.  

So these four photographs are concerned to hill 25, which is Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.
Q.	Right.  Now, let's move to the sketches which are in part 3 --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, when you took these photographs, did you take them in order to give the Court an impression of the topography, the landscape, the hills, or was it your purpose to identify particular locations in these hills which may be of relevance in this particular case?
THE WITNESS:
These, photographs I took, keeping in view about the topography, terrain, and landscape to how Gitwa hill looked like, because when I visited this Gitwa hill, I was not with the - like, with any witness, so I don't know exact location which maybe relevant.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, talking of photographs, how do you relate the other photographs which are in the bundle?
A.	The other photographs on the bundle, like photo 1, photo 2, they are about the Gitaka centres, and this Gitaka centre had been referred by few witnesses during the investigations.  That's why I took the photograph of the centre. 
Q.	M-hmm.
A.	Then photo number 7 to -- 7 to 16, these photographs are of the adjourning hills around Gitwa hill, and basically they are of Bisesero area.  I reviewed some previous trial transcript and selected a few photographs which show the terrain, topography, and landscape and the kind of hills in the area.  After that, I took them from evidence, evidence unit.  They copied and gave me.  Those photograph, I matched them with the copy in evidence unit, and after that I put them in this bundle.
Q.	Is there anything to indicate as to when those photographs were taken?
A.	These photographs, like photo number 7 to photo number 11, were taken up to 1995; and photo number 12 and 13 were taken in September 1995; and photo number 14 to 16 were taken in February 1998, and these are the Prosecution exhibits in the case of Kayishema.
Q.	Right.  Now, finally, you have sketches.  What methodology did you use in preparing these sketches?
A.	The sketches which are in part 3, these are sketches I prepared during the investigation of this file, and I filed them in evidence unit.  While preparing these sketches, I accompanied with the witness, who showed me the place where a roadblock was there in 1994.  And after getting some more information from witness about the location, the jurisdictional location like in which secteur, which commune, I prepared this sketch.  Now, again, I took them from the evidence unit and re-verified, and after that I put them in this binder. 
Q.	You have in part 5 a list of secteurs.  Can you tell us the relevance of this document in your bundle?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Before you move on to that.  

Now, Mr. Witness, did you say that you indicated places where there were roadblocks based on conversations with witnesses?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are these witnesses in the present case or in other cases?
THE WITNESS: 
	These witnesses are in the present case, and during the investigation I did so.  But during the re-verification, I verified the place again.  And with regard to sketch 6, I got additional information, which I put in additional  information, like on sketch 6 which is on L0019879, the place which is marked as B.  B was the bar of Augustine Karara who was the cellule responsable of Gasharu cellule in 1994.  This information I put in the form of additional information on the next page.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We do not know, do we, Mr. Kapaya, which witnesses this investigator's -- this investigator got his information from?
MR. KAPAYA:
The witness has the pseudonyms of the witnesses from whom he got the information from.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  But that's not in this document, is it?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, it's not there.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	No.  Are we talking about many witnesses or only one witness, Mr. -
THE WITNESS
No, for these sketches -
  MR. PRESIDENT:
      Please push the button, will you?
THE WITNESS: 
	For the sketches, we are talking about many witnesses because each sketch is referring to one witness.  Sketch 2 is one witness; sketch 3 is one witness; sketch 4, third witness; then sketch 6 is the sources, secteur counseiller of the secteur; then one more sketch.  So there are four witnesses I'm referring who gave me this information about specific locations.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Do you think it would be helpful for the Court to know which witnesses, in pseudonym form, these were, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, yeah, it would.
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	Could you, Mr. Baghel, mention the pseudonyms of the witnesses who supplied you with the information in regard to the sketches?
A.	With reference to sketch 2, which is L0019877, the witness who showed me this place, his pseudonym is CGC, Charlie-Golf-Charlie.  In sketch 3, for this, the pseudonym of the witness is CGK, Charlie-Golf-Kilo.  For sketch 4, the pseudonym is CGM, that is, Charlie-Golf-Mike.  For the sketch 6 is the secteur conseiller, who I suppose is still secteur conseiller of the secteur.  And for the sketch which is L0019881, the pseudonym of the witness is CGY, Charlie-Golf-Yankee.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I have you repeat the last one, will you?  Where - are you now on 80?  I think the problem here is that you have K numbers and L numbers.  Now, you were referring to the last two, L81, were you?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yeah.  I am referring L number because K numbers are the old numbers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS: 
	And the L numbers are the new numbers, which are red in colour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS: 
	L0019881, the pseudonym of the witness is CGY, Charlie Golf Yankee.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right.  Now, I was asking you the relevance of the list of six that you put in the file of your report.
A.	The part 5, which consists of local authority in Gishyita commune, and this is the list of the secteurs, secteur conseillers and cellules in Gishyita commune in 1994.  This information I collected from the commune office, which is the district office now, on the advice of the trial team to collect it.  And moreover, during the investigation also, I found the many witnesses were referring the names of Gitesi commune, different cellule and secteur.  So the names which have been put here, they may be relevant in the case, and moreover now because Rwanda has been reorganised and the places are called as districts and authorities are called mayor.  So this all '94, it may be useful.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now, this document does, as you've just indicated, not only relate to the secteurs, but it also gives information about persons holding office during that period?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  In 1994, the person who were holding the office of secteur, secteur conseillers and the bourgmestres.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  And that's based on witnesses you met?
THE WITNESS: 
	This is based - this list was given to me by the mayor of Kibuye municipality, which he has signed on the page 3 of this documents on 31st July 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So also the document -- also the information relating to the holders of office comes from the commune office?  
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And it provided, provided when?  In July 31, 2003?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	And finally, Mr. Baghel, you have a copy of the constitution of June '91 as an appendix to your report; is that correct?
A.	Yes, this is the final document that is appendix in my binder.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's all I have from this witness, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you.  

Defence.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you.  Mr. President, I only have a few questions for this witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Investigator, you visited Kibuye préfecture.  Did you pay specific attention to the cellule in which the Accused was born?
A.	Yes.  During the course of my investigations, I visited the place which is in Gitaka centre, and I was told that the Accused's parental house is located at the place.
Q.	Could you give us the name of the Accused's native cellule?
A.	The name of the native cellule where the house of his parents, his parents is located is Gasharu cellule in Gitesi secteur.
Q.	Very well, thank you.  Mr. Witness, I would like us to look at L0019861, please.  Do you have the document?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  This is the report that you made after your travel through Kibuye préfecture; is that correct?
A.	This is the report which I made after travelling on the roads, not necessarily in Kibuye prefecture, because I started from Kigali to Gitarama, then Gitarama to Gisenyi, and Gisenyi to Kibuye then to Murambi; that is, Gitarama back.
Q.	With regard to the road from Gitarama to Kibuye, can you describe to us the status of that road and what was it made of?
A.	This is -- I travelled - like, I have been travelling on many times on this road.  For this - for the purpose of this document I travelled -- I went on this road during the days which I mentioned, from 11 August to 18 August 2003, and on that day the road is made of asphalt and it is fully tarmac road from Kibuye to Gitarama.
Q.	Do you have any information on the condition of that road in 1994?
A.	I don't have any information about the condition of the road in 1994.
Q.	Did you not ask the authorities what the status of the condition of the road was in 1994, because that is what is of interest to us now?
A.	I did not ask the authority specifically that what is the condition of -- what was the condition of the road in 1994.
Q.	Can we now look at L0019870, please, the little D of 2, small (ii).  At the end of that paragraph, the last sentence reads that, "It can be granted that the Bisesero area covers parts of Gitesi, Gishyita and Gisovu," and we are referring here to communes, Gishyita commune, Giseti commune and Gisovu commune.  Have you found where I am?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  Do you confirm that Bisesero area covers these three communes?
A.	Because I have been to this area on many occasions, so there is no fixed boundaries for the Bisesero area.  The area which -- around these hills is known as Bisesero.  So that's why areas of these three communes, not whole communes, some parts of the commune where these hills are there, is called the Bisesero area.
Q.	What was your methodology in arriving at that conclusion?  Was it by listening to the witnesses or did you consult maps?
A.	This is by listening to various informants, basically witnesses and some local, general informers.  Like when we start from Kibuye town, if you say, "Which is Bisesero area?"  Then they will point out to the hill, "This side is Bisesero."  So this is not on the basis on maps, this is the basis - on the basis of local information gathered in the area.
Q.	Are you very sure, according to your research, that the Bisesero area is part of Gitesi commune, even if it's only a small part thereof?
A.	Yes, because Gitesi commune is quite large.  Like hill 25, 26, if you go through the hill map, it is in the Gitesi commune.  And if you go to the north of hill 25, 26, they will refer these hills towards Bisesero.  So this - there is no clear-cut distinction.  Bisesero, which I mentioned here, Bisesero is the name of a cellule, is name of a secteur, name of a hill also.  So Bisesero area is having very big boundaries.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I don't know whether the Tribunal has in -- the pre-trial brief filed on the 1st of August, 2003, by the Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, we have it.  What do you want us to look at?

MR. BESNIER:
I wanted to request the Chamber to go to page 1154 -- 59, 1159 of this document, please.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	In the French or English version?
MR. BESNIER:
Both.  There is no Defence (sic).  I am working with the English version because I believe the French version is not ready as yet.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	You said the pre-trial brief, did you?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, I did.
JUDGE KHAN:
Which page did you mention?
MR. BESNIER:
1159.  This is annex B, the "Prosecutor's Request to Admit" is the title on that page, numbered in the right-hand -- top right-hand corner as 1159. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have found it.  Yes, that's fine.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like us to deal with number three, which is at the very bottom of that page.  This question is as follows:  "In Bisesero stand the communes of Gishyita and Gisovu in Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda."  That's right, Mr. President.  The Defence did admit that proposal by the Prosecutor, as you can, yourself, see; but today the investigator from the Prosecution is telling us that the Bisesero area spreads through Gishyita, Gisovu and Giseti communes.  We believe that we have already resolved this matter in the framework of the Prosecutor's motion, and we should not come today to be told that the Bisesero area also covers Giseti commune.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Well, this raises two questions, doesn't it:  One, what you have actually admitted, and the other issue, what is the factual situation?  And your admittance stays; that's what you have admitted.  And you are now saying that it can't be correct, the additional information given by the witness today; is that the position?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  This is information I wish to show the Chamber.  We will bear this in mind later on when we will present our witnesses, and maybe we will be enabled to amend, if need be, what is being said, given what has been said by the witness on the stand, the investigator.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you for sharing that with us.  It's noted, thank you.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have other questions for the prosecutor's investigator.  These are questions which may help us to gain time during the cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses or during the examination of Defence witnesses.  
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	This is the localisation of certain cellules.  If you cannot answer, you will inform the change (sic), but I think it will help us in gaining some time at a later stage.  

My first question, Mr. Witness, were you able to identify a cellule referred to as Nyagahinga?  I will spell it, N-Y-A-G-A-H-I-N-G-E, Nyagahinga -- the last letter is A, as in Alpha --in Bubazi secteur, 
B-U-B-A-Z-I, in Giseti commune?
A.	In which document are you referring, excuse me? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is not, I think, related to any particular document.  The question is only, have you located that place, I think.
THE WITNESS:
No.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	It's specifically because I did not see this cellule in any of the maps presented, that's why I am putting this question to you, Mr. Investigator.
A.	I don't know because I have not asked about the specific cellules.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, if we can be of assistance to the Chamber, this is provided on page 902, on item 8, the fifth name is shown there as a cellule.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	You are in which document now, Mr. Kapaya?
MR. KAPAYA:
I am sorry, I am in the Exhibit P2, Prosecution Exhibit P2 at five, page L0019902, and item, 
sub-item 5.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  So that's number five under paragraph 8?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Another question to the Prosecutor (sic) is, did he visit this location?  Did you visit this cellule?
A.	No, I did not visit.
Q.	Did you visit the Kibirizi market, K-I-B-I-R-I-Z-I, Kibirizi market?  This is Mabanza commune.
A.	Yeah, once I visited.
Q.	Can you tell us roughly what is the distance between Gasharu cellule and Kibirizi market?
A.	In fact, I did not measure the distance but only I can estimate it with rough figures.  Yes, this may be around 8 to 10 kilo - 8 kilometres, around.
Q.	Thank you.  Is there a tarmacked road to go there, or is it a dirt road?
A.	Kibirizi market to the divergence to the Gasharu cellule is tarmac now, but from a main road divergence to the Gasharu cellule is non-tarmac road.  So, there is a mix:  3 kilometres may be 
non-tarmac, five may be tarmac road. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And you want to know the condition in '94, I assume, if the witness knows?
THE WITNESS: 
	I did not ask specifically the condition in 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	You don't know.  That's covered by the general question, yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I was indeed going to put that question to the witness.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Another question for you, Mr. Witness:  You referred to the Gitaka centre and you took photographs of that centre, did you not?  Is the Gasharu cellule from where the Accused hails, is it far from the Gitaka centre?
A.	In fact, Gitaka centre is in Gasharu cellule.  So Gasharu cellule is the administrative entity, which is territory.  So how it can be far?  It's part of - like, in Gasharu cellule, Gitaka centre is there.
Q.	Now, how does one get to Gasharu from Gitaka centre?
A.	If you reach Gitaka centre -- or before that, border of Gasharu cellule will start.  Gitaka centre is, Gitaka centre is a place which is -- which lies in Gasharu cellule.
Q.	Can one get to that place from Gishaka - Gitaka centre by vehicle?
A.	Gitaka centre is a place where some market is there, a few shops are there.  It is an open area.  And Gasharu cellule is the entity of cellule.  Cellule is like a few square kilometres, so the centre lies in that, so I don't know how Gitaka centre to Gasharu cellule.  If you say some other cellule which is not in this somewhere, then okay, then maybe like Kibuye town or Manya (phonetic) or something.
Q.	So if you will, how can one go to Gitaka centre to the Accused's house or his parents' home?
A.	I went to the parents' house because I went to Gitaka centre first.  I asked who is the secteur conseiller, and the secteur conseiller was there and I approached him.  I requested him; he took me to the house of his parents, and he told this house also in Gasharu cellule.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now the question is, how do you get from this Gitaka centre to this that house, whether you can explain that to us.  That's the question.
THE WITNESS: 
	From Gitaka centre to his house - like, I parked the car in Gitaka centre and I went by walking, on foot, and it's around half kilometre of estimate from the Gitaka centre to his house.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Is it a road which goes up or does it go down?
A.	A road which goes up from Gitaka centre.
Q.	In other words, the Accused's family home, which you claim is the Accused's home, is at the top of the hill; is that correct?
A.	It's -- the family house or family home which was shown to me is at high elevation than the Gitaka centre, but I cannot say it's the top of the hill because Rwanda is full of the hills.  It's in higher elevation than Gitaka centre.  And if you take up some place, like locate some few metre here and there, you can see Gitaka centre from the place, from the house.  
Q.	From Gitaka centre up to what you call the Accused's home, is it possible to go that distance, cover that distance using a vehicle?
A.	I did not use the vehicle, and it depends on the weather at the time.  If it is raining, then it is difficult to use at that time, but I think some powerful car can go up to that place.  It depends on the skill of the driver.  But the road is not so much more travelled, that place, so it is safer to park the car at Gitaka centre and walk.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So was there a road leading up there or would a car have to go off-road?
THE WITNESS: 
	Yeah, from there, like, it's around half kilometre.  So up to half distance there's a - like, the car can go to places - like, the road is wide enough that a vehicle can go, but after half distance I was taken to the dirt track, that is, footpath.  But there may be alternative routes which were not shown me, but I cannot claim those things.  The road which I took I am telling you.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	One minute.  I think you used a path because you went on foot to the Accused's home, but you were allegedly told that there was a road which could have been more easy to use for you to reach the same destination; is that what you're saying?
A.	Yeah, up to half distance I think vehicle -- the vehicle could have been driven.  After half distance, I was taken on a small footpath on the hill and shown the house, that this is the house.  And the track which was coming where vehicle could have been driven that took right, they were then to right side.  So I did not travel on the right divergence, and I was taken to another track, which was footpath.
Q.	But how do you know that if you turned to the right you could reach the Accused's family home using a car, since you did not do that yourself?
A.	I don't know, because it is not like the tarmac road is there and there is lane system or something.  That's why I am not telling whether that right turn, it could have gone.  I don't know exactly.
(Pages 13 to 24 by Petrus Chijarira)





































	1530H 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well.  So to conclude with this matter, all that you saw is that there was a road, a path, which could be used going up on foot and that's what you yourself did, in fact; is that not so?
A.	Yes, I went by foot -- on foot.  So, I don't -- I can't claim and I don't know about -- that a vehicle could go there.
Q.	Thank you.  When you were in Gasharu, did you hear mention made of a place known as Kirombo, 
K-I-R-O-M-B-O, Kirombo (sic)?  Did you hear any mention made of that or did you see any such place?
A.	Yeah, because the road which goes from the main road to Gitaka centre, I asked where this road leads then I was told this road leads to Kirambo school.  So I suppose there may be a school in Kirambo and that may be the place Kirambo, but I did not visit that Kirambo place.
Q.	Since you didn't go there, do you know whether the inhabitants of Gasharu cellule have to go to Gitaka centre in order to go to Kirambo school?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The name is Kirambo.  I do beg your pardon.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the people who -- in Gasharu cellule, if they follow the main -- the road which is the main road in that area, then they might have to go through the Gitaka centre.  But, again, Gitaka is a place in the cellule, so it depends on the person where he is staying in the cellule.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You mentioned one Mr. Karara, can you confirm that you mentioned that person's name?
A.	Yes, I mentioned the name of Augustine Karara, who was cellule responsable of Gasara cellule in 1994, and I got information that his house and bar was in Gitaka centre and which is marked as "B" in my sketch 6.
Q.	What was the name of the Gitesi commune bourgmestre in 1994, if you know?
A.	Yes, the name of the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune was also Augustine Karara, but these two are different persons.
MR. PRESIDENT:
They have the first name and the last name in common?
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, they have first and last name both in common, Augustine Karara.
MR. BESNIER:
This is an ambiguity which I wanted to clarify as of this moment, because this name is going to come about several times during the course of the trial. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Could you clarify again what the designation of these two Karara was?

THE WITNESS:
In my sketch 6, which is on L001-9879, I have shown the place marked "B" and it was the bar and the house of Augustine Karara, and his designation was cellule responsable of Gasharu cellule in Gitesi secteur, in Gitesi cellule.  And the other Augustine Karara which -- the name which is referred to me just now, he was the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And he is the one mentioned on L001-9901? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, he is the one who was bourgmestre, but cellule responsable is not mentioned because the names have not been given of those authorities.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Thank you.  I would now like to refer to document L001-9880, L001-9880, and let us now refer to Item No. 3.  Could you please tell us who informed you that there was a roadblock during the events of 1994 in Gitaka?
A.	During the course of investigation, I found few witnesses referring about the roadblock in Gitaka centre.  But when I visited this Gitaka centre I asked the secteur conseiller whether there was a roadblock during the 1994 events and that time he informed me the roadblock was near the place marked "B" and "H1".  So this was the secteur conseiller who gave me information about the specific location, but during my investigation I came to know two other witnesses also.  When I visited I was not with the witnesses, but -- when I went to Gitaka centre I was not with the witnesses.
Q.	But you were accompanied by the consellier, Mr. Karara, weren't you?
A.	Yes, I was with him.
Q.	And he was the one who told you that, indeed, in 1994 there was a roadblock in that location; is that correct?
A.	Sorry -- I was not -- you are just now mentioning I was accompanied with the (sic) secteur conseiller Karara, no, the current secteur conseiller and the Karara which is mentioned, he was the cellule responsable, not the secteur conseiller.  So I was accompanied by the secteur conseiller.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No Karara?
THE WITNESS:
	No Karara. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	I am sorry, I had not understand (sic) that data which is why I asked you to clarify it.  Could you tell us what the name of the conseiller de secteur is, if you recall his name?
A.	I have the name of the secteur conseiller who told me his name is Uwimana, Ephraim.
Q.	Thank you.  I would now like to refer to document L001-9881, that's L001-9881.  Did you go to the top of Karongi hill?
A.	During the course of investigation of this file I did not go, but in some cases -- in some other case I have been to the top.
Q.	Did you see any specific building at the top of this hill?
A.	There are antennas -- communication antennas are there and big towers are there on the top of the hill.
Q.	Thank you.  If we take a look at your sketch, when -- if you are standing on Karongi hill, across from the person, there would be a non-asphalted narrow path leading to Rubengera and Mabanza; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is the information I got from the witness.
Q.	Is it possible to see Mabanza from Karongi hill?
A.	It's on the high elevation, Karongi hill, and Mabanza is low elevation.  It should be possible to see Mabanza or to look at the direction in which Mabanza is there (sic).  It depends on the location of the person and the place where the person is standing.
Q.	Are there any road signs on this road?
A.	There is no road sign on the roads.
Q.	Thank you.  I would like now to look at document L001-9878, that's L001-9878.  Have you found the page?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You mentioned a roadblock at Fayer, which is often -- sometimes referred to as Foyer as well.  I am referring to sketch No. 3, Foyer also referred to as Fayer.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  On sketch No. 4 you have also identified the Nyabahanga river, which is spelt: 
N-Y-A-B-A-H-A-N-G-A, Nyabahanga.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I would like to know whether you know the distance separating Foyer, also known as Fayer, and the Nyabahanga river?
A.	On this road, I measured the distances by driving a vehicle, like, from Fayer or Foyer to Kibuye is 
10.7 kilometres.  Nyabahanga river -- from Nyabahanga river to Kibuye is 3.5 kilometres.  So the distance between these two places should be around 7.2 kilometres by road, which is existing now.
Q.	Is this an area that is populated?  Is it densely populated?  Did you see any houses in-between Fayer and the Nyabahanga river?
A.	Yes, there are houses on the roadsides which are, I cannot say densely populated, not like town or something, but a few houses are there.
Q.	On sketch No. 4 you have mentioned the bridge that goes over the Nyabahanga river.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know in what secteur of Gitesi commune this bridge is located?
A.	To me, information was given as it is mentioned in this sketch in  Gitarama secteur of Gitesi commune.
Q.	In Gitesi commune and in what secteur?
A.	Gitarama secteur.
Q.	Very well, thank you.  My last question -- or, last few questions will deal with Gitwa hill.  You have identified that there were two hills or actually several hills that had the same name.  Is that correct; they were all called Gitwa?
A.	Yes, I have identified them, three hills which are called Gitwa in this map.
Q.	To your knowledge, how many hills are called Gitwa in Kibuye préfecture?
A.	I do not know how many hills because these names have been given locally by the local people.  The area which I visited on these roads -- around the roads, I asked and they gave these names of Gitwa hill, so I cannot say how many hills are in Kibuye préfecture.
Q.	Are there also hills or places that might be called Gitwe, with an "E" at the end: G-I-T-W-E?
A.	Yes, like -- which I have shown one more hill, which is hill No. 2.  It's called Gitwe hill.  And I don't know about others which are not in this map.
Q.	If we refer to document L001-9886, we can see a photograph of Gitwa hill; is that correct?
A.	Yes, this is a photograph of Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, hill No. 25.
Q.	And it is the Gitwa hill which is located in Gitesi commune; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  Is this hill very high?
A.	This hill is quite high and it can be seen in the photograph also.  There is a valley on the one side, like if you see photograph No. 46.
Q.	Yes, but when I look at that photograph 3, it does not seem that it's a very high hill, actually, it seems like a slight rise in this lay of the land.  Could you please explain this to us?
A.	Because when you travel on the road, the road is passing through the hills, going from one hill to other hill.  So on the side of these roads you see photograph No. 3, on the left side there is a valley, so height has to be relative phenomenon.  So this hill is quite high compared to other -- other very near hills, but Karongi is the highest hill in this area.  So this hill is quite high.  It seems as -- quite flat because photograph No. 4 is taken from the top, but we have to see the locations of -- like photograph Nos. 5 and 6, you'll see that, yes, valleys are there and hill is quite high compared to other hills.
Q.	Very well.  Did you visit the other Gitwa hill, the one that's located in Bisesero?
A.	Yes, I visited those hills also.
Q.	But you did not take any photographs of them, did you?
A.	No, because for this -- like for the purpose of this case I did not take the photograph of those hills because through the photograph Nos. 7 to 16, the hills have been projected, how the hills look like in this area.  And all the hills are like -- they look almost similar but there are a lot of hills and there is a road in-between and hills are covered with vegetation, trees, like a little bit of forest in the valleys.  So which is -- these have been presented in photo 7 to photo 16.
Q.	I would now like to focus on Gitwa hill in Bisesero.  In photograph 7 to 12, could you identify the Gitwa hill located in Bisesero?
A.	No, I cannot identify it.
Q.	I believe that you were the one who interviewed some of the Prosecution witnesses; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you ask them to distinguish, when they were speaking of Gitwa hill, whether they were referring to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune or of Gitwa hill in Bisesero?
A.	Yeah, I asked some of them and they referred to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, which is in the statements.  And, in fact, I visited like sketch number -- sketch number --  sketch on L001-9881.  This sketch has been prepared when I went with the witness and that time he referred to the Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune which is hill 25 here.  And I passed through that road, crossed the hill, then I went to the place which is shown as a roadblock in this.
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  This -- and this would allow us to be able to proceed smoothly with the rest of the trial.  I have no further questions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, just one simple question, Your Honour.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, could you tell whether the Accused's -- the family home of the Accused person was accessible by road -- by car from Gitaka centre in 1994?
A.	About 1994, I don't know.  I visited only in 2001.
Q.	Thank you, very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I understood you to the effect that these photographs were taken without any consultation with particular witnesses.  It was to give us an idea of the topography and the landscape.
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, photographs 1 to 6, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this also relates to photographs 1 and 2 concerning the Gitaka centre.
THE WITNESS:
	Yes.

MR. PRESIDENT:
No contact with particular witnesses in contact -- in connection with that one?
THE WITNESS:
	No, when I took the photographs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, now you limit your answer to photographs 1 to 6.  But when we look at photograph 7 onwards, again, what was your method there, was there any link to any witness in this case?
THE WITNESS:
	Photograph -- because during the course of investigation, some witnesses referred from Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune, they fled to the adjourning hills.  That's why to project what kind of terrain of the hills in that area, topography, what kind of vegetation is there where those witnesses fled.  That's why I took those photographs.  I searched from the database and found those photographs which were '95, so it was hardly one year after the main events.  That's why I took those photographs put here (sic).
MR. PRESIDENT:
So these are all photographs from 1995 and not linked to any particular story or event recounted by the witnesses in the present case?
THE WITNESS:
	No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Thank you very much.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for coming --
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- forward with your testimony. 
THE WITNESS: 
	Thank you. 
	(Witness excused) 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next witness I would like to draw to your attention that during the status conference that was held last week we had agreed with the Prosecutor as to the order in which the witnesses would appear.  However, we were informed just a few hours ago that this order was going to be modified and that the witness that was scheduled to testify today was not the one that had been specified during the status conference.  We do not wish to cause an incident with respect to this, but we just wish to draw your attention to the fact that this state of affairs raises some difficulties for the Defence.  At the present time, at this very moment, we do not know what this witness will say in his testimony, but in view of his statement, it is possible that as a result of the testimony of this witness we might ask for some additional time before we begin our
cross-examination.  We might, for example, request that we begin our cross-examination tomorrow morning if this is required.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You are quite right.  It follows from the notification we were provided with today that the order of witnesses has been changed.  This being said, I note that there is no request for additional time as of now, and we will see how this develops.  

Could we then bring in the next witness, Prosecution? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I expect that the WVSS section is dealing with that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Registry, this is a protected witness.  If you will now kindly draw the curtains.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the Prosecution proposes to call Witness GKH -- gulf, kilo, hotel.  That witness is listed as No. 3 on your list.  

Your Honour, I acknowledge my learned friend's comment in relation to the order that we had indicated.  There are certain circumstances that govern these trials that are absolutely beyond my control as Your Honour may be aware of.  This particular witness that I had requested to travel was unable to travel, and other issues came up over the weekend that necessitated us taking this particular witness instead of the prior indicated witness.  But I assure both Your Honours and my learned friend for the Defence that we do this in good faith.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, witness 1 on the original list, C-Charlie, G-Gulf, H-Harold, did not come?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no, Your Honour, witness 1 is actually here.  CGH is here.  But we -- based on reconfirmation exercise over the weekend, we felt a lot more comfortable with GKH to come now and CGH to come right after him.  So we kind of reversed the order but -- 

So, if I can be of some assistance whilst we wait for the witness to come in.  I have informed my learned friend for the Defence that we would take Gulf-Hotel - sorry, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel now.  We hope to finish with him today.  We will then take Charlie-Gulf-Hotel second, hopefully, tomorrow at this time; we will then take Charlie-Gulf-Kilo, third.  And that would be it for this week, at least as far as I know.  As I stand before you I have no other witnesses in Arusha.

MR. PRESIDENT:
There is no GMZ? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
GMZ did not arrive, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  All right, these are the three witnesses available at present.  

Can you please bring the witness, Registry? 
MR. BESNIER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I'm not sure I fully understood the order in which the witnesses were going to appear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat it, please, Prosecution?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We would hear witness No. 3 on our list now.  He is GKH, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel.  We will then hear witness No. 1 on our list this time tomorrow, God willing.  That witness's pseudonym is Charlie-Gulf-Hotel.  We will then hear witness No. 4 on our list, and her pseudonym is Charlie-Gulf-Kilo.  And that about wraps up -- that would exhaust the witnesses we have on the ground as we speak.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
	Good afternoon, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to testify in French during your testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
I speak French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness GKH in these proceedings, and you are a protected witness.  So when you are asked questions by, first, Prosecution -- can you hear me, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I was about to say that you are a protected witness and you have to be careful when you answer the questions posed first by the Prosecution and then by the Defence in order not to reveal your identity.  So, if any question, when answered, would lead to disclosure, then please make a pause and we will make the necessary arrangements to proceed without risking anything.
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now administer the solemn declaration.  Registry, please. 
MR. MUSSA:
Mr. Witness, please stand up and raise your right hand, then say after me. 
	(Declaration made by Witness GKH in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, listen carefully to the questions, Mr. Witness, and try to answer them as briefly and concisely as possible.  
The Prosecution will now start, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, may I start by asking the Registry to kindly hand to the witness a personal information form, as is customary in this Trial Chamber, to dispense with the need to have to go through his personal identification details with him.  It's signed.  He just signed it in the witness room and I just want him to confirm it for the record that he does agree with its contents.  I'll then enter it into evidence.  

Mr. Registry, can you assist me, please?  Very kind.  

Whilst that is being done, Your Honour, due to the nature of this witness's testimony, I am afraid that I am going to have to make one of those applications that doesn't endear me terribly with the press and the public.  And in that regard, I am making an application under Rule 79(A)(ii).  And the application unfortunately is that the press and the public be excluded from part -- and I emphasise, part -- of these proceedings for reasons of the safety, security and the non-disclosure of the identity of this witness, pursuant to Rule 75(B)(ii).  

In terms of the scope of the order, and I hasten to add that the first three segments of this witness's testimony has to be in closed session and I would only request to re-open the session towards the end of his testimony when we talk about more general events in the locations that he is going to be testifying about.  

Your Honour would see, having closely scrutinised his particulars and, indeed, his -- the nature of his testimony as indicated in page 4 of the English version of his statement -
MR. PRESIDENT:
The first statement? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I believe he only has one, Your Honour.  I think so.  I will just check.  Yes, I think he only has one statement.  Yes, he only has one statement dated the 10th of May 2001.

Your Honours, I draw Your Honours' attention to page 4 at least of the English version.  And if you look at the paragraph that starts "In early think June 1994", Your Honours would see from the discussion there that it is very unlikely that there were many people in this witness's position at that particular time.  It is certainly an issue that troubles my witness very much, and it is an issue that he has raised and I cannot but agree with his representations that if I adduce that sort of evidence in public then he certainly would be identified.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this is something you are going to start off with?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's the thrust of my testimony -- of his testimony, Your Honour, and I intend to go straight into it, you know.  Yes, if you turn to page -- the first page, page 3, what is page 3 of the English statement as well, I do intend to go to -- into matters that concern his political affiliations.  Again, they are closely linked with his location and his residence and that of the Accused.  So, again, there are not many people who are in that position and -- 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, there is no advantage or disadvantage for this being in closed session.  It's unfortunate for the press and for general information in general but, in any case, if it's great -- it's better for justice if we proceed in open session, but it's up to the Prosecutor and for the Trial Chamber to make a decision based on information provided by the Prosecution.  Therefore, Mr. President, I shall abide by your decision.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will see how this develops.  

Thank you very much for that remark, Defence.  Having looked at this document, we will follow the proceedings, but in view of the observation by the Prosecution that they will -- rather, early focus on the particular occupation of this witness, the most practical way, and also in conformity with the spirit of the relevant Rules, would seem to indicate that we have to close this session.  

Now, what is the actual time span, Mr. Phillips?  Approximately how much do you intend to be in closed until you open or are there anything you could take in open first before you move into these other areas?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The matters I want to deal with in open session, Your Honour, are very general matters as to the state of events in Kibuye.  If I start with that Your Honours will end up being totally confused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, no, we will not be confused.  So maybe we could do it that way, unless anyone else is getting -- is it difficult for you -- for your strategy to do it that way?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it's difficult and it's perhaps also totally inconsequential to my case whether or not I deal with those general matters.  And, as I say, they are matters -- they are matters I might, in the course of his testimony, just decide to leave out entirely.  So, to start with it would be really prejudicial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you may not even have to go into it.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then -- and so the entire testimony of this witness in-chief will be for closed?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  It wouldn't to be terribly long, Your Honour. He is testifying in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Approximately?  About an hour would be --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- French and --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- I think about an hour would be --
MR. PRESIDENT:
About an hour.  So the public is informed of that, but then that would have repercussion on the cross-examination.  So there may well be closed session for the rest of the day.  At any rate, the Registry will announce whether we can go into open session later on.  That is the situation.  If the public will then kindly leave the gallery and we will proceed.  

Mr. Witness, you have listened to this discussion and I am sure you have seen that in order to protect your safety we will now close these proceedings.  That implies that everything that's going to happen here now will only be heard by the parties and the staff.  There is no one in the public gallery, and the transcripts of the proceedings will be kept under seal afterwards.  So now you can speak freely. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 37 to 52] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

1745H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we will now start with the open session, Mr. Witness, and from now on you have to be careful, but we understand that the questions to be put to you by the Prosecution are of a general nature.  But beware that you don't reveal your identity in any way. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during your stay in Kibuye between April and June 1994, did there come a time when you attended a meeting at the Kibuye préfectural office, and, if so, when?
A.	Yes, it was on the 3rd of May 1994. 
Q.	And do you know who convened this meeting?
A.	I don't know, but the prime minister was there, and other ministers were there as well.  There were members of various political parties who were there, there were bourgmestres there as well.
Q.	And do you know the identities of any of the government ministers that attended this meeting, sir?
A.	Well, apparently they were all there, but mainly those from Kibuye, because the prime minister had come to visit Kibuye prefecture, and so those who were natives of Kibuye had to be there. 
Q.	And are you able to recall which particular ministers hailed from Kibuye who attended that meeting?
A.	There was Agnes Ntamabariro, who was the minister of justice, I believe, N-T-A-M-A-B-A-R-I-R-O, first name Agnes, A-G-N-E-S; there was Eliezer Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka, first name Eliezer; and there was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  And I think those were the ministers who were from Kibuye. 
Q.	Do you know why the three ministers who hailed from Kibuye had to have been present at the meeting?
A.	Well, they had to be there, because the prime minister, who was the one who had appointed them, had come to their prefecture, therefore there was no reason for them not to be there and to be where he was, especially as the visit dealt with Kibuye prefecture.  So they had to attend the meeting.
Q.	Do you know what the purpose of the meeting was, sir?
A.	Well, the main purpose -- at least this is what the prime minister said -- it dealt with pacification with respect to the killings, the massacres.  And so the main word was pacification.  And he spoke about the RPF, that RPF units had attacked the country, that we needed to fight, that we would defeat them, but he was saying that we had to stop the killings. 
Q.	At the time of this meeting, the 3rd of May 1994, were you personally aware, Mr. Witness, of any, any, massacres in Kibuye prefecture?
A.	Yes, there had been massacres everywhere, killings everywhere.
Q.	Can you mention some locations that you had become aware of where massacres had indeed occurred as at 3rd May 1994, Mr. Witness, in Kibuye?
A.	At that date, no.

I'm not sure I understood your question. 
Q.	I guessed as much.  Can you tell the Court of any locations in Kibuye prefecture that you had become aware of as at 3rd May where massacres had occurred, just off the top of your head?
A.	Well, not on that specific date, but between April and May there had been massacres in Kibuye at the Home St. Jean, at the parish, at Gatwaro stadium, at Nyange and Mugonero, and they had already started in Bisesero.  But fighting still continued, so everywhere there were massacres and killings.
Q.	Whilst you were at the meeting on 3rd of May involving the prime minister and these other ministers who hailed from Kibuye, did you hear anyone condemn those massacres that you have just described as having been aware of?  Anyone?
A.	Yes, a person named Leonard Hitimana.  He was a doctor.  He was a member of the MDR party, but from the moderate MDR wing.  He condemned the massacres.  He said that small children remained in the stadium and at the Home St. Jean and had been taken to hospital, and that it was necessary to watch over them, to bring them food, to take care of them, because they were still there.  And the person named Eliezer Niyitegeka said that was none of his business and was not his problem, even though he was a physician, these matters were none of his business.  And this is why, after the meeting, Dr. Hitimana had to flee, because he was being persecuted.  He had to flee the country.  He went to Congo and did not come back until some time much later.  And so there were persons who had bad intentions and did not want people to be saved.
Q.	The man you describe as Niyitegeka, who reacted to Hitimana's comments, was who?  What position did he hold in government?
A.	He was the minister of information, I believe.  The minister of information.  He was a member of the MDR power wing. 
Q.	Did the prime minister himself react to the comments made by this Dr. Hitimana?
A.	I don't remember.  I don't remember his reaction. 
Q.	Now, you also mentioned, Mr. Witness, that some bourgmestres attended the meeting on 3rd May.  Do you recall if any of the bourgmestres made any speeches at that meeting?
A.	There was a person -- I can't recall this person's name -- a person from Gisheta commune.  I can't remember the name just now, but it will come back to me.  Yes, it was Sikuwabo, and he said that there were RPF soldiers in Bisesero and he was asking for assistance, asking that soldiers be sent to fight them.  And the prime minister said, "You must be watchful and see whether they were RPF soldiers, Inkotanyi, or if they were Batutsi who had fled to that location.  If they were Batutsi, you should leave them, but if they were RPF soldiers, tell us, and we will provide assistance so that you can fight them". 
Q.	To your knowledge, Mr. Witness, were there any RPF soldiers in Kibuye as at the 3rd of May 1994?
A.	Well, who else was there?  Let me think.  I know that the Turquoise troops came, but I don't remember exactly when.  I know they came to Kibuye.  I don't know if it was then or later.  I don't really recall.  Turquoise was also in Kibuye, because I think it was towards the end of May when Turquoise went to Bisesero to try and save the survivors who had remained there after the massacres. 
Q.	My question, rather, referred to RPF soldiers.  Do you know, in your personal knowledge, whether there were any RPF soldiers active in Kibuye in May 1994?
A.	Well, unless they had infiltrated, but they had not yet arrived.  They were still in the Gitarama area.  They were still fighting in Gitarama.  They had not yet crossed the Nyabarongo.
Q.	So in your opinion, what -- who did you understand this bourgmestre Sikuwabo to be referring to when he referred to RPF or Inkotanyi?  Who was he referring to?
A.	I wouldn't be able to know.  I mean, they weren't wearing a uniform, they could not easily have been identified, so I don't know who he could have been referring to.  I don't know. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness. 

Mr. Witness, if I asked you to identify Emmanuel Ndindabahizi this evening, would you be able to do so?
A.	Yes.  He also would recognise me.  I can see him over there. 
(Pages 53 to 55 by Trish Greig)






















	1800H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, may I seek your leave to have this witness perform a dock identification, or an identification, at least if he can, of the Accused. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, look around this courtroom, and tell me if you can see the man you knew as Emmanuel Ndindabahizi here.  If you do --
A.	Yes, I can see him. 
Q.	Can you --
A.	I recognise him. 
Q.	Can you describe where he is seated in the courtroom, if you recognise him? 
A.	He is seated behind counsel.  He's wearing a tie.  He's balding; he has a few white hairs. 
Q.	And do you recognise the colour of what he's wearing, if you are good with colours? 
A.	He's wearing a black jacket. 
Q.	Enough for me.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, may the records reflect, in my opinion, it's been a positive identification of the Accused seated to the left of the witness box behind counsel, learned counsel for the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's noted. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness, can you tell me, has anyone other than officers from the Office of the Prosecutor contacted you in relation to this trial, anyone at all apart from members of the Office of the Prosecutor?  Has anyone contacted you in relation to this trial and, if so, who and when? 
A.	Thank you.  It was during the month of August, I believe it was on the 10th or the 11th, I received a telephone call from someone who was claiming to know me and they wanted to meet me in a bar.  I was busy, and I told this person that I could go there later.  This person called me back, and so I went to see this person.  I didn't know this person, but there is someone who knew me and knew the person. 

And when I reached the bar I had a drink, and I was expecting for someone to come and see me and say, "I have been looking for you."  After approximately ten minutes this person said, "Well, where is so and so?"  The person who knew me said, "Well, he's there."  So this person came and greeted me.  It was around 5 p.m. or 7 p.m., but we could see with the lamp. 

So we moved to one side of the road, and he told me that he was contacting me at the request of Ndindabahizi's counsel and that he wanted me to make a statement for Ndindabahizi's defence, and he told me that he had been sent by counsel.  He gave me his name.  His first name was Jean Pierre; I don't remember his surname.  I know someone who had lived with this person.  And he told me, "To confirm this, I can say that during the month of August you will be travelling to Arusha to testify." 

He showed me a document on which was written the names of all the persons who were going to come and testify here in Ndindabahizi's trial and their pseudonym.  I believe that is the word that you used, was that.  He said, "This is your name and this is your pseudonym."  And he read the names.  I recognised some of the names; these were some of the people I knew.  And I told him, "I cannot speak double-talk.  If you know that I am going to Arusha, then I go to Arusha.  I will not change my testimony and I cannot give you a statement."  And I know that subsequently he went to see other people who will perhaps come, and they contacted me and said, "Were you contacted by someone?"  And they said, "Yes, I was contacted."  And they said, "We met with this person as well." 

I thought this person was an employee of the ICTR, and when I mentioned this to someone they said, "No, it wasn't us because you know us."  And when I reached Kigali before I came here, I spoke to ICTR employees in Kigali because if we are to be protected, then everything should be done in the strictest confidence.  I mean, I've left my house, and now everyone knew I was coming to Arusha.  And this is why I said this, in case there were any problems, so people would know how things actually took place.  This is what I have to say. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let the records reflect, Your Honour, that the 10th of August is three days after I made unredacted disclosure of my entire witness list to the Defence team in Paris, France. 

I have no further questions for this witness.

Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Before I lead the cross-examination with this witness, there was one point that I would like to clarify, and I would like to ask the Prosecutor to which part of the indictment he is referring to.  When hearing this witness, what are the relevant parts of the indictment that pertain to this witness, because I have closely read the indictment and I do not see that Mr. Ndindabahizi is accused of having participated in a meeting on the 3rd of May, 1994, in Kibuye, and I do not see that he is accused of having had a meeting with the witness in June 1994.  So from a legal perspective, I believe it is important to clarify which specific parts of the indictment are relevant to this testimony and to the testimony made by this witness. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's a very simple matter, Your Honour.  They are factual allegations in any indictment and there's also something called specific intent to commit genocide.  Genocide and intent, that's what it goes to, Your Honour.  It doesn't have to be clearly stated in the indictment. 
MR. BESNIER:
Well, I believe that we will have to go a bit further, but maybe we will do this in our closing argument. 

Mr. President, there's two points I would like to make.  First of all, this witness was supposed to testify at a later time, and I have understood that we would only have three witnesses this week.  Therefore, if we request that we -- that today's session be shortened, I believe that we will not lose -- that we will not get behind.  And would it be possible for the Trial Chamber to order that cross-examination begin tomorrow afternoon, especially as it is now currently six -- ten minutes past six. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is, of course, like both parties, willing -- no, eager to move things forward and use court time in an efficient way, but this being said, we note, as mentioned by the Defence, that there has been a change in the witness sequencing.  We also note the explanation of the Prosecution previously why that happened during the weekend. 

In view of the fact that there is a limited number of witnesses, at least for the time being, in the couple of days to come, we would see no problems in granting the Defence request and start tomorrow at two o'clock.  Yes.

Could we plan now a little bit forward, Prosecution?  You have mentioned the witnesses.  We have the investigators, we have the present one -- and I don't think there is any harm in the witness listening to this.

Mr. Witness, we are now just discussing a few procedural issues.  If you could kindly bear with us a couple of minutes.  And as you understood, we will come back to you tomorrow at two o'clock, but before we close for the day, only a few practical arrangements.

Now, the next -- please, Mr. Phillips, first let me ask the Defence the estimated time for the cross-examination of this witness, it being understood that it is certainly only an estimate. 

MR. BESNIER:
One hour to an hour and a half.  I believe that it would take approximately an hour and a half to cross-examine this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the next witness, Mr. Phillips?  Did you indicate --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Number one on our list, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Approximately two hours, one hour, three hours? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I actually don't have an indication of how well or how badly I did in relation to time today because of that break in between, but I think I spent, what, two hours? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You started --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no idea how long it was.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, we will shortly be able to -- you started 16:10 and finished 18:10 and then we lost 20 minutes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So I did better than I anticipated, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not bad at all.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Oh, good, okay.  So if we say two hours maximum for that witness and hopefully shorter than that, Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  So the next witness, approximately two hours?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
At the very -- at maximum.
MR. PRESIDENT:
At the maximum, yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's two hours.  Now, that implies that we will start with this one and we will start with cross-examination of that witness tomorrow.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then it was -- that's Tuesday.  Then the third one.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The third one is number four on your list, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And that is a very short witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Estimated time?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One hour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
One hour.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
One hour maximum.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Say max one hour from the other side, and that's that.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's that.  I have no indication who has been brought today, if anyone.  I would find out when I leave here, so ...
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so please get in touch with the witness protection.  And the problem is that GMZ didn't arrive, was that so?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, we're having problems with him, Your Honour, and he's -- he has indicated that he would not be available until November.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Which is -- which poses a problem practically.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it's important, then, if you -- when you get in touch with Mr. Chappell to make sure that everyone is doing his and her very best, because the number is too limited.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  You will come back to us on that one, then.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, this brings us to the end of today's session.  You will continue tomorrow.  You must not discuss your testimony with anyone until tomorrow. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The court is adjourned until tomorrow.
(Court adjourned at 1815H)
