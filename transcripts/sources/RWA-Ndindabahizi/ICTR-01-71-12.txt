P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session.  So, which witnesses are we to hear today, Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  We propose to call first, Witness CGP -- Charlie, Golf, Papa -- who is now known by the name on the witness statement which is on your desk. That document, Your Honour, is in French.  We only received it today -- at least over the weekend.  I only got it today, and it is a statement that confirms the circumstances that form the background to the mistaken identity of this witness and the person listed on No. 14.  Essentially, it is the witness confirming that the interview did occur as indicated on the 4th of April, and that the signature on the witness statement contained on pages 152 and 158 relate to him, Your Honour.  I don't know what my learned friend's position is -- latest position is in relation to this witness, but in anticipation of any issues that you might have, we have the investigators that took the original statement here in Arusha.  We brought them in over the weekend so that you can hear directly from them the circumstances that led to this mix-up, and to also afford my learned friend of the Defence opportunity to put questions to them prior to hearing the witness himself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, these investigators that are not on the witness list, are they Mr. Amahumisiliza and Ms. Julia Watson?
MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that is correct.  Both of them are present, but only one of them needs to give evidence, and that may be Julie Watson.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you are offering Julie Watson?
MR. ADEOGUN PHILLIPS:
I am offering both of them, Your Honours, but either of them can give evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, all right.  So there are two issues, one starting with CGP and the other one whether we want to hear the investigators.

Defence, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Defence cannot absolutely work under such conditions, and Defence would like to oppose the calling of Witness CGP.

We base this on two arguments.  First of all, the combined provisions of Rule 20 -- Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure obligate the Prosecutor to disclose the name of the witness at the very least 21 days before the beginning of the case.  In respect of CGP, this has not been done, and his identity was disclosed only on the 26th September 2003.  However, the name and address of the witness are an extremely important element.  Indeed, Defence could have interrogated -- examined, cross-examined the witnesses of Prosecution who have already appeared on the possible presence of CGP at the sites in Gitwa.

Until now Defence has tried to assess the credibility of witnesses by cross-examining them on the presence of other witnesses and sometimes by even giving their names on a piece of paper, so that Defence could have verified if the witness has not already testified in judicial proceedings in Rwanda, or more generally, on any relevant investigations on the file.

Defence is therefore of the opinion that this would prejudice its case pursuant to Rule 66, and also that this runs counter to Rule 85(B) and 90(G) of the Rules of Procedure if this witness was allowed to testify.

Secondly, the Defence is of the view that the Court should examine this issue in relation to Rule 95 of the Rules.  Indeed, the context in which this witness is being called appears a bit strange to us.

In October 2001 Defence received 26 statements -- redacted statements and under No. 13 there were two statements for Witness CGP dated 4th April 2001 and 2nd June 2001.

Registry, can you please hand on this document to the Court and the Prosecution.  The first of these statements appear in the bundle of documents disclosed by the Prosecutor, and this is the second statement.  The similarities between these statements are extremely worrying.  First of all, in both cases the witness refers to events that occurred at Gitwa in Gitesi commune.  Secondly, in both cases, it is claimed the Accused was distributing machetes.  Thirdly, in both cases, the witness points out that the presence of a certain bourgmestre who has already been mentioned, and the préfecture Kayishema.  Fourthly, the witness leaves Gitwa to go to Bisesero.

In conclusion, it is impossible to say that there are two separate witnesses or one and the same witness.  Finally, which one did the investigators investigate?  And it is surprising that the error of identity persisted until last week when the witness was transferred to Arusha.  All this discredits the testimony such that if they are admitted they will go -- they will run counter to the integrity of the Court.

Defence therefore concludes that Witness CGP should not be allowed to testify.  Thank you,
Mr. President.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I hear what my learned friend for the Defence has said.  But a lot of issues that he raised, unfortunately I am unable to answer to because I did not take the statements, but in terms of the legal issues that are raised, to my mind there are two issues here, and the main issue is, what prejudice, if any, have the Defence suffered by this unfortunate mix-up.

Now, one matter is the question of notice.  Have they received adequate notice of the allegations being made by this witness?  That has to be answered in the affirmative.  Clearly in the pre-trial brief, the disclosure does contain the evidence of the witness, and that has not changed in any manner or form.

What is in issue here is the identity of the witness, and, of course, they do have legitimate rights.  And the Accused has a legitimate right under Rule 20, to know who his accusers are.  The issue is, have they suffered any prejudice at this stage, not knowing before Friday for sure, what the name of this witness was?  They certainly have a right under Rule 66, which we certainly concede, and we did make disclosure to them well in advance under the requirements of that Rule.  There was no deliberate attempt to hide the identity of the witness.  It was an honest mistake, and the investigators are here to explain it.  Now, if they have suffered any prejudice, then the Chamber is at liberty at any stage to recall the witness if indeed any sort of allegations arise following his testimony here to put those allegations to him.

I did point out when this issue arose that I personally am very embarrassed at the developments, but this is the situation and I would offer the investigators who took the statement to address the Trial Chamber so that you can make your own assessment of whether or not this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate one on the part of the Prosecutor.  Those are my submissions.

And then in relation to the statements that have been handed out, there are two separate -- it's not correct for me to say there are two separate people with the same identity, it is just one person, and it is this witness with the statement dated 2nd June 2001 that is responsible for the mix-up in the first place, and you will hear it more directly from the investigators.  It was the witness with the statement dated June 2001 that the investigators went to interview in the first place.  However, they interviewed somebody else because he was not available, but they had anticipated meeting him and had entered the name prior to the commencement of the interview on their computer, and they will testify as to how that happened.

So, to answer my learned friend's question, it is not the same person; there is only one person by that name.  He is the person whose statement is dated the 2nd of June 2001.  We were not interested in calling that person.  However, it was in attempt to locate the person dated -- the person with the statement dated 2nd of June that the mix-up arose in the first place.  And that is the explanation.  There are not two people, just one person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, do you have -- we have now received this document which was given to us from the Defence, CGP2, and here we have, of course, the redacted version.  We have page 3 and 4, but we do not have page 1 and 2 containing the particulars of the witness, when it comes to that witness that gave a statement on the 2nd of June 2001.  Now, that is normal, because this is the redacted version, but, do you have the unredacted version, so that the Court, in order to see the full picture, could see page 1 and 2 of this document of the 2nd of June 2001, please?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
CGP2 is exactly the same as this one in French.  It is the English -- what they have simply done is that they have given you the statement in French, and the one that has the cover, CPG2, is the English version of the French.  It is an English redacted version of the one you have in French, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  Now, do you have the English version of this document CGP2?  Can we have that one, please, then we have both the English and the French version.  We have the French version, but that one is dated the 23rd of September 2003.  But there is probably in the file also, the document with the identification of the witness dated the 2nd of June.
MR ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I am just handing that to you, it is in English.  It is coming to you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Defence, have you seen this unredacted version?
MR. BESNIER:
All I have is the version that I handed in a while ago.  I don't know if this is another version.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the Defence work in French, and there would be no reason to give them the English version because we didn't call the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable, what you are saying, but now since this is an issue, do you have the French version of the 2nd of June witness statement, identification of witness, do you have that in your file as well?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the French version which is the one that has been handed to you by the Defence.  We have all the statements in our files.  If you look at the statement 2nd of June that the Defence handed to you, it is the French version of the one I have just handed to you now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but in that French version which we were not handed, we were just handed by the French --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that version there is not page 1 and 2 containing the particulars.  Maybe you have it, but the Bench was only given -- we haven't seen that.

Mr. Besnier, you now just gave us, didn't you, Témoin CGP -- and that starts with page 3.  That is what you have just handed to the Bench?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, in English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and now my question to you is:  Do you in English or French have page 1 and 2 of that document, in other words, the unredacted version of this document of the 2nd of June 2001?  Do you have that?
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President, I received this document in October 2001, and I received only a redacted version, and only the English version of that document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, what I could imagine could be useful, would be that we all had page 1 and 2 of this other document of the 2nd of June 2001, before we proceed.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is -- this is -- that is the one I just handed to you, Your Honour, and I am handing another one to you in French.  I thought we all had it because I thought it came from my learned friend for the Defence, anyway.  I thought he handed two documents to us.  This one and a French statement.  I certainly got two documents from him just now; no?  My mistake.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we can see from this 2nd of June statement is that on that statement we have the name which is listed as No.14 in our binder.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
While as you explain it, that is a wrong name.  The right name should be the name on the -- 

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On the 23rd of September statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, in fact, both the statement of the 4th of April 2001 and the statement of 2nd June 2001 contain then the wrong name?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No. The statement of the 2nd of June 2001 belong -- contains the right name, that is the name and statement of the person who rightfully has that name.  The problem is with the 4th of April 2001 statement, and the explanation is this:  It was with a view to procuring the 2nd of June 2001 statement that the investigators went out into the field through an intermediary.  Unfortunately, they were meant to meet him in April; he didn't turn up.  Somebody else turned up instead.  They took a statement thinking it was the 2nd of June man they were talking to.  It turned out not to be, Your Honour, and we only realised that this year, four years after the fact.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Prosecutor, the name mentioned at file No. 14, CGP and CGP2, they are one and the same person?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the confusion.  It is my learned friend for the Defence that has called that person CGP2.  He is not CGP anything, because he is not a witness in this case.  Do you understand, Your Honour?  We never gave him this pseudonym.  As far as we are concerned, the pseudonym CGP applies to the name on the statement dated 23rd September 2003.  However, it is misleading because my learned friend has called this other man as CGP2.  There is no such person as CGP2.  I guess he has just done that just to illustrate to Your Honour.  I mean, it is not from us, it is from them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then now when we look at this document dated the 23rd of September 2003, there is a person identified.  What about that name then?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is CGP -- CGP, that is the name of CGP.  That is CGP, that is his identity -- those are his particulars.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And that is what I meant.  So the real person, CGP, the one who is being offered now as a Prosecution witness, that is the person under Arab (1) in 23rd September 2003.  Is that correct?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then when we compare that to the names in the 4th of April statement and the 2nd of June statement, we see that the names in those two statements are the same, in other words, it is a different name, and it is the same name in both these statements.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So none of these previous statements contain the right name of the witness.  Still correct?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No.  Second of June statement contains the right name of the witness, because 2nd of June and 4th of May do not belong to the same person.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, that is what I don't understand, because when I now look -- you remember I asked to see your page 2 of the 2nd of June statement?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRSIDENT:
Now, I have that in front of me, and it seems to me that that name is the same as the name as I find on page 152 of your binder.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it will be, Your Honour, but that is exactly the mistake.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the name is the same in these two documents.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly.  Now, the problem then is that in relation to one of these documents that name is wrong, but the statement is correct.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  The statement is the 4th of April 2001.  The name on that statement is wrong, but everything else in that statement is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So when the Defence argues that they have only known the right name of this person since the 26th of September approximately, then they are right, are they not?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
They are right, Your Honour, yes, because that is when we received confirmation of who he was based on this statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the name under Arab (1) on the 4th April 2001 statement should have been the name now listed under Arab (1) under the 23rd September statement?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the first observation, and that observation is correct.  Then, the second observation, Your Honour, and that based on your question, is that the details that are listed in paragraph 7 of the 4th of April 2001 statement should, in fact, have been the details listed in paragraph 7 of the 23rd September 2003 statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So also the place of birth, et cetera, also that is wrong?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  There were three essential problems with that 4th of April statement, and I can take Your Honours through what the problems were.

Paragraph one, the name is wrong.  It should have been the name in paragraph 1 of September 2003.  That is the first problem.  However, having said that, if you look at the French version in your bundle of the 4th of April statement, you will see that it has the same nickname as the same nickname listed under 23rd September 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Help me with where I can find the nickname, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The nickname is under paragraph 1, under I think where the first name is -- if you look at the French bundle in your -- if you look at the nickname in the French, it doesn't exist in the English translation, but in the French, the nickname is the same with that on paragraph 1 of the 23rd September statement.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Prosecutor, you are referring to the nickname of CGP?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
JUDGE KHAN:
On page 152 of the English version?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, the French version, Your Honour.
JUDGE KHAN:
No, on the English version.  Nickname -- okay.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at page 155, Your Honour, if you look at pager 155, if you look under the nickname --
JUDGE KHAN:
 Yes.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at the 23rd September statement, they are referring to one and the same person, but that was the first indication that we knew that we were talking about the same person, but there was a 
mix-up somewhere.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  This nickname on page 155, French version, is correct?
MR. ADEGOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is correct.
JUDGE KHAN:
The nickname is correct?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The nickname was correct, but the real name was not.
JUDGE KHAN:
But the first name and the last name are not?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Are not.  And the French version is the operative version because that is the real statement.  The English was just the translation from the French.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
So that was where the confusion started.  The name --
JUDGE KHAN:
Even the nickname on the first --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
-- is wrong, it is spelt wrongly.  It is spelt slightly wrongly.  There is an M there, but --
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.  The last name and the first name in the French version are also not correct?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The last name and the first name are not correct on the French version.
JUDGE KHAN:
Only on the French version?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it is not correct.
JUDGE KHAN:
Okay.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is the first observation.  Now, the second observation is paragraph 7 on the 4th of April statement, be it French or English, is incorrect -- it's incorrect.  Those details belong to the real person and not the person on the 23rd September 2003.  And again you can cross-check that, because if you look at the 2nd June statement, 2nd June 2001 statement, you will see that the place of birth coincides with that person.  So what had happened there was that they had -- the investigators had some prior information before they met -- the investigators had some prior information to identify witnesses.  That information consisted of name, place of birth.  In anticipation of meeting the person that is indicated on the 4th of April 2001 statement, they, before the interview, filled in some of those columns.  It is a pro-forma form on their computer.  So in anticipation of the meeting, they filled in the name, the place of birth and all the things you see in paragraph 7.  However, that person did not turn up, and someone else turned up instead.  Also, someone they wanted to see, but not the person they were expecting at that time.  Forgetting that they had entered column 1 and column 7, they just continued with the interview and entered column 2, 3, 4, 5, et cetera, and that is really where the confusion arose.  They forgot to delete the name they had entered there before.  That is why we have this problem.

So paragraph 1, paragraph 7, are not correct on that statement, and also paragraph 13 is not correct.  This man is not a member of that organisation in paragraph 13, but the real man is.
JUDGE BOSSA:
I have a question, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE BOSSA:
The details in paragraph 7 appearing on the 23rd of September 2003 statement --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Are you saying that they should be replaced with the details which appear on the 4th of April?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No. The details -- rather it is the other way round, Your Honour.  It is the details that appear on the 4th of April paragraph 7 that should be replaced with that of paragraph 7 of the later statement of 23rd September 2003.
JUDGE BOSSA:
 And this statement of 2nd June, I don't seem to have a copy.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, we have very limited copies of that one, because we didn't think it would be relevant.
JUDGE BOSSA:
By whom was it made, was it by the --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The real man, the person with the same name on the 4th of April.  That is the person -- the person --
JUDGE BOSSA:
Is it CGP?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, no.  We gave the pseudonym to him, thinking he was the person we wanted to talk to.  So that is why he is called CGP, but CGP actually belongs to 23rd September.  The person we thought was CGP, yes, Your Honour, so to answer your question, the person we thought was CGP, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Turning now to the substance of these documents.
MR. ADEGOUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, does the substance come from the same person or from two different persons?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The substance comes from two different persons -- actually, I have to take that back.  The substance comes from the same person known as two different names.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So only one person has actually been interviewed on the 2nd of June and on the 4th of April?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In that regard, two different people.  I thought Your Honour was referring to something totally different.

Now, in relation to the 2nd of June and the 4th of April 2001, the substance comes from two separate persons, two separate bodies who are individuals.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And who is the one who is now being referred to in the 23rd of September statement?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The one  with the statement of the 4th of April 2001.  The one we sent back the week before last was 2nd June 2001.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the substance on page 3 of this document in the English version, the 4th of April 2001 statement is the basis for what this witness CGP may be telling us?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this 2nd of June statement then, here you have the wrong name?

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, we have the right name, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, we have just agreed -- well, well, it depends on what we compare to.  But what matters now is the witness that is actually called, and in relation to that witness, we do not have his name, we have the other name, 2nd of June 2001.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, the 2nd of June statement, Your Honour, does not really have any part in all this.  It is just -- it is a distraction.  The 2nd June -- there is no problem with the 2nd of June statement.  It belongs to the man indicated on that statement and it is intended to be his statement.  It has no bearing whatsoever here.  The only problem is between the April and the 23rd September.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see, the Bench also has to see this in the perspective of how this must have looked for the Defence, and the Defence was confronted with a situation where the names in the two documents were the same, namely, under Arab (1), and now I understand that the substance now on page 3 of this document of the 2nd of June 2001, is that right, that it belongs to that other person but not this witness that is now being offered?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Your Honour, yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is why you are saying that page 3 is not really relevant or has no bearing, but it was disclosed as the other statement of this real CGP?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it wasn't, Your Honour.  That is exactly why I say it is confusing.  It was not disclosed that way.  As far as we were concerned, up until last week, I would have sworn on oath that I had two witnesses with exactly the same name.  That would have been my position.  I had two witnesses in this case. Now, I only wanted to rely on one f them in trial, and that has been very clear to my learned friend for the Defence.  Now, that is why I say the 2nd of June man is irrelevant, because I never indicated to him that I was calling the 2nd of June man.  Even if they had the same name, assuming two witnesses have exactly the same name, but different particulars, I at some stage had made a choice between one and the other, and it was not the 2nd June.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just were handed a list of witness statements for the confirmation of the amended indictment against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there under paragraph 13, we find CGP.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, I see that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there, there are two statements.  One, dated 4th April 2001, and one 2nd of June 2001.  That would seem to give the impression that there were two statements disclosed as being CGP statements.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
A very dreadful error which is terribly regretted.  I haven't -- it is the first time I have seen that.  But then, let us talk about this list.  This is a list that was handed to my learned friend in the early days when the indictment was confirmed.  This document must have been prepared by the people who handled the case before I did.  But then in any event I see Your Honour's point that the way it is written -- and it is the first time I have seen this document, actually -- it looks as if the person CGP has two statements.  It is indicated like there are two statements obtained from the same person.  Well, it is understandable because, I mean, everybody at some stage thought that them having the same name, they were the same people, but having taken over the file we realised that they were two separate people, but we didn't actually realise there was even a further complication, that there was an error.

So my learned friend is actually correct, in that at the time the disclosure was made to him, our office had indicated that CGP had two statements.  That is wrong.  That is not so.  That is regrettable.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But tell us, what you are saying is that when you look at the binder which you have been using in this trial, you only offered one document, and that was the 4th of April statement, and that is where the name is wrong, but where the substance is right?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In other words, between the time we had prepared this statement, this list, and disclosed it to my learned friend, and the time we had prepared the pre-trial brief in anticipation of this trial, we had realised that those two statements belonged to two separate people, and had therefore chosen to rely only on one of them which was the 4th of April 2001.   We made that very clear, that we were relying only on one of them.  I had no idea that he had been misled prior to then, that the same person had two  statements, and now I understand why he keeps saying that CGP had two statements.  Now I understand, I didn't understand that before.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Prosecutor, which of the two statements is correct; 4th of April 2001 is correct, is that what you are saying?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, 2nd of June is correct, in that it belongs to the maker.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, now we must not be confused.  The substance of the 4th April 2001 is correct in the sense that it belongs to the witness in the corridor.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the name is incorrect.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
JUDGE BOSSA:
 I have a question on the statement made on the 23rd of September.  It is in French, so I don't understand what it is all about.  It was made by -- am I correct in saying that it was made by the witness in the corridor?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it was made by the witness in the corridor after we realised the confusion in the identity, and it was for him to confirm that the interview that took place on the 4th of April 2001 did, in fact, take place; that the content of the commentary on page 3 of that statement were his comments and that he intended them to be his comments, but that the name on the April 2001 statement was not his name.  That is all that 23rd statement says.  He is acknowledging our mistake.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the rule about variation of witness lists, Mr. Phillips?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Rule 73bis(E), Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, I would like to hear your opinion on the following questions.  Is article -- is Rule 73bis(E) applicable here, since, in fact, the name of the witness originally in the bundle and the name in the 4th of April statement is the name of a different witness?  In other words, in your view is -- what you have to do now is to vary under 73bis(E) or is it your view that since the person has all the time been the same and it is only this unfortunate error in terms of the name, that you don't have to go the way of 73bis(E)?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I would argue on behalf of the office that the provisions of Rule 73bis(E) relates more to the substance of the testimony that is being adduced as opposed to the identity of the witness.  The intention clearly there is to cater for events where you do want to add or vary the nature of the testimony.  Well, testimonies are made by witnesses, they are made by bodies.  Certainly, the intentions of the people who drafted 73bis could not be to cater for the bodies minus the testimony.  What we have here is different.  We have the testimony being for the most part consistent -- entirely consistent.  There is, therefore, no prejudice, because notice of that testimony has been given way above schedule.  The problem now is with the body -- the human body which I respectfully would submit, is not what Rule 73bis is trying to address.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when it comes to your argument about prejudice, the fact that the Defence has been unable to investigate and prepare until the 26th of September, it is true that the Defence can always start investigations after the cross-examination.  But still, how do you say that this is no prejudice?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, there is -- I can't say there is no prejudice.  I mean, clearly there is an element of prejudice, because I accept that an accused person has the right to know those who accuse him.  So I certainly cannot argue that there is no prejudice.  But, can the prejudice be cured?  I believe it can, Your Honour, and I believe that we can cure that if any material evidence comes to light by recalling the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that is your submission.  It is prejudice, but it can be cured?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President I think the prejudice is irreparable -- incurable, because it is important for the Defence to have investigations before hearing the witnesses.

Now, we have done this throughout the trial, and we have compared testimony of witnesses.  We have looked at the recognition of the Accused by the witness.  If we don't know the name or the address of the witness, how are we going to question the witness under conditions which he got to know and recognise the Accused?

We didn't have any verification which was possible to us.  There are errors which are completely irreparable, particularly in the fact that in one situation the witness belongs to a political organisation and not the other.  And therefore the cross-examination turns out today, the 29th of September 2003, practically impossible to carry out, given the error, even if it was an error committed in good faith by the Prosecutor.

Therefore the Defence believes that this is an irreparable damage which has been caused, and the only solution would be not to admit any testimony from Witness CGP.
(Pages 1 to 15 by Regina Limula)

	1450H
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will have noted that generally we rule directly, orally, from the bench after a brief discussion here.  This time we would wish to discuss the matter a little bit further, so we will probably come back in between five or ten minutes and deliver an oral ruling.

So the Court is adjourned for about ten minutes.
(Court recessed from 1454H to 1530H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we took a moment to deliberate because this is an unusual situation.  The Judges have reached the following conclusion.

It follows from Rule 69, protection of victims and witnesses, that, subject to Rule 75, the identity of the victim or witnesses shall be disclosed within such time as determined by the Trial Chamber to allow adequate time for preparation of the Prosecution and the Defence.  Moreover, we have a relevant provision in Rule 73bis, which provides in connection with a pre-trial conference that there will be a pre-trial brief; there will be a list of witnesses the Prosecutor intends to call, with the name or pseudonym of each witness; and that the Trial Chamber or the Judge may order the Prosecutor to provide the Trial Chamber with copies of written statements of each witness whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify. 

Now, in conformity with the system, the bundle of witness statements was then provided both to the Defence and the Trial Chamber shortly before the trial started.  As soon as the unredacted version of the witness statements were disclosed, the Defence must have been under the impression that Witness CGP had the name listed under No. 14 in the bundle, and that would be confirmed by looking at the statement itself. 

Moreover, in a previous list provided by a previous team within the Prosecution, it was stated that this witness, CGP, had not only the statement of 4th April 2001, which is the one reproduced in the bundle, but it also follows that there is a statement dated June 2001, and also in that statement the same name as No. 14 in the bundle was listed.  So there were two documents, then, indicating the wrong name of the witness. 

In addition to this, as mentioned by Mr. Phillips, the location of the witness was wrong in the 4th April statement; in other words, his particulars as to his commune, cellule, secteur and so forth, which are important elements to identify the witness, were misleading. 

It is true that in that statement there was a reference to a nickname, but a mere reference to a nickname cannot replace the full name of a witness. 

Consequently, the Chamber has to conclude that the Defence has been unable to prepare for the preparation of this witness, and it was only in connection with the latter part of this trial when the mistake was discovered, and in particular on the 26th of September, when I understand that the real name was disclosed to the Defence.  It was only on that occasion that the Defence was able to understand that this witness actually bore a quite different name. 

Now, this certainly constitutes prejudice to the Defence.  The question is how grave it is; can it be cured?  And it is true, as stated by the Prosecution, that the witness may be recalled and that further investigations may be carried out until the commencement of the Defence case.  But we are now at the end of the Prosecution's case.  We have heard virtually all the witnesses.  It is obviously of interest to the Defence to know the identity of all the witnesses in order to compare their statements and also the testimony in order to check their credibility.

So, therefore, we are of the opinion that we cannot now say that this prejudice can be cured.  Consequently there is a breach of Rule 69(C), and it would not be in conformity, in our view, to allow this witness, bearing in mind the provision of Article 20 paragraph 4(b) of the Statute.

Let me stress that it does not in any way imply any criticism against the Prosecution.  The Prosecution did not know what was happening.  This is a human error, a genuine mistake, but when it comes to balancing the interests against each other, the Chamber had to reach this conclusion. 

So, Witness CGP, with the right name, will then not be allowed to testify, and we do not see that there is any need to hear the two investigators. 

That is the ruling of the Chamber. 

Are there any other witnesses in the trial, Mr. Phillips? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is one more, Your Honour, CGC.  In terms of logistics, we had asked that he be brought in when we have the afternoon break, because we thought we would be busy with this witness.  So I'm not sure if he is here yet, but he is certainly on his way here.  But they can check and find out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the registry could check whether he is already in the neighbourhood, please. 

MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, before the break I have a point to raise.

Last week we raised an objection regarding the admissibility of the interview made of Mr. Ndindabahizi by the investigators in 1996.  We intend to renounce that objection.  In other words, we now admit that those documents be admitted onto the records.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  That was helpful.  In other words, we are referring to this white binder. 

Yes, Prosecution, that will be P -- registry?  It could be P25, maybe? 
MR DIALLO:
Twenty-five and 26; 25 for the May 3rd and 26 for the interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So you accept both documents, Defence; is that so?  Both the interviews and the minutes? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Your Honour, all the documents.  

Just a moment. 

No, I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I was referring only to the interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Regarding the transcripts of 3rd May, we will deal with that later.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, exactly.  So we are talking about the interviews in the blue folder.  They are accepted as P25 for the time being.
(Exhibit No. P25 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you said that you would come back to us and make submission after having listened to transcripts regarding the other document. 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  Regarding the transcripts, we intend to disclose to the Court the cassettes.  We have already contacted registry, and we should be able to resolve that problem within the hours ahead together with the registry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will come back to that other document at the end. 

Now, do we have good news or bad news?  

The witness is on his way.  Any suggestion, Mr. Phillips, as to when we should resume? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I would say 4:30, Your Honour.  I had indicated that we normally took a break between 4:20 and 4:30.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, let's do that.  At 4:30 will be the last Prosecution witness.  Thank you very much.
(Court recessed at 1540H)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you will be referred to as Witness CGC in these proceedings.  You are a protected witness and have to tell the truth, as all witnesses; and the registry will now take the solemn declaration to that effect.  
(Declaration made by Witness CGC in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you have a document in front of you, haven't you, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your signature at the bottom of that paper? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that imply that the information in that document containing your particulars is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P26, I think.  P25 was the interview, so this will then be P26 on receival.  Please, proceed.

WITNESS CGC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	How do you know him?
A.	I've known him for a long time.  That was around 1991, '92.
Q.	Can you describe to the Court the circumstances that led to you knowing Mr. Ndindabahizi during that period?
A.	I used to see him when he came to visit his sister as usual.  The sister was suffering from a chronic disease and Ndindabahizi used to bring her medicine.
Q.	Do you know what his sister's name is or was?
A.	Yes, I know her name.
Q.	Can you tell the Court, please?
A.	She's called Marcianne.
Q.	You referred to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you just repeat that name, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
I said Marcianne, but I don't know the other -- her other name.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's on page 130, fourth paragraph in the English version of his statement.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall if Marcianne was married?
A.	Yes, she was married.
Q.	Do you know who she was married to?  And I just want you to answer yes or no.
A.	I knew her husband, but I don't think it would be proper for me to give his name here.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Yes.  Your Honours, can I have a name shown to the witness just for him to -- I've circulated it to all the parties. 

Very quickly, please, Mr. Registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, is this the name starting with a P or with a G?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's with a G, Your Honour.  Thanks for that. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see that name, Mr. Witness?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Is that the name of her husband?
A.	Yes.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'd ask for that to be entered as Prosecution Exhibit No. 27.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So admitted. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Twenty-seven. 
(Exhibit No. P27 admitted) 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall how many times you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi visit his sister?  Do you know how many times; numbers?
A.	I do not recall the number of times, the number of times, because on each occasion he came to see his parents he would visit the sister.  In short, he visited her on several occasions.
Q.	In term -- in terms of number, can you estimate for us, would you say it was more than two times, four, five, that sort of thing?  Can you help us with an indication of how frequently you may or may not have seen him?
A.	On more than two occasions at the very least.  However, I am unable to say whether it was three or four times because he used to visit his parents on so many occasions, and each time he visited the parents, he also visited the sister.
Q.	And do you recall, approximately, the period that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi visit him, the period, the year or years?
A.	Ninety-one, '92, thereabouts, but I cannot specifically recall the year, but it was during that period, between 1991 and 1992.
Q.	You talk about his parents' home.  Do you know how far his -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's parents' home was from his sister's home?  What was the distance between those two locations, if you know?
A.	It's a long distance because there is a secteur separating the two places.
Q.	And when you say "long distance", do you mean -- I mean, what do you mean by "long" in terms of metres or kilometres?  Can you help me?  Don't mention the secteurs, but please, just indicate for us the distance you refer to as long.
A.	In fact, I cannot give the distance in terms of kilometres because I haven't been to school.
Q.	Did you and Mr. Ndindabahizi come from the same secteur and cellule?  Just answer me yes or no.
A.	No.
Q.	In that case, can you tell me or can you tell the Court what secteur Mr. Ndindabahizi's parents lived in, if you recall?
A.	Yes.  I do not know the parents, but I know the secteur in which they lived.
Q.	Can you tell us which secteur that was, please?
A.	The secteur was called Gitesi. 
Q.	What about Mr. Ndindabahizi's sister, do you recall the secteur she lived in at the time?
A.	Yes, I recall the name of the secteur, but I personally do not believe it is a good thing for me to mention the name.
Q.	Is it close to where you lived at the time, Mr. Witness?
A.	I would rather say it is the same secteur, but I don't think it is proper to give that name.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I just draw Your Honours' attention, in that case, to paragraph 7 of the witness statement on page 128, if that is - was the testimony.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the person that you identified on the piece of paper I showed you a while ago, was that person related to you in any way?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Without mentioning his name, Mr. Witness, what was the relationship between yourself and that person on Prosecution Exhibit 27?
A.	He was my maternal uncle.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi throughout 1994?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Do you recall when you saw him; by that I mean the date?
A.	That was a long time ago, and please bear with me if I do not get the dates right, but I believe it should have been the 20th of May 1994.  If by any chance I make a mistake with regards to the dates, please bear with me because that was a long time ago.
Q.	Is there any reason, Mr. Witness, why you remember the date as being the 20th of May 1994?
A.	No, I just think that it must have been around the 20th, that is, the 20th of May.
Q.	Okay.  Where did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi on the 20th of May 1994, and by that I mean the location?
A.	I saw him at a place called Gaseke.  There was a roadblock where people had been killed.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Gaseke for the record is spelt G-A-S-E-K-E. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what were you doing at this roadblock at Gaseke, or were you, in fact -- what were you doing at the roadblock at Gaseke?
A.	In fact, I was led to that roadblock because it was being said I was a Tutsi, but miraculously I was not killed by the people who took me there.
Q.	First of all, can you -- is this roadblock anywhere near your -- was it anywhere near your residence then or now?  Just answer yes or no.
A.	I'll say that from where I lived to the roadblock, one could cover the distance in -- within about ten minutes, so it's not a great distance, it's not a long distance.  However, the two places are not that close.
Q.	Okay.  In that case, can you tell us which cellule or secteur Gaseke can be found and in which commune?
A.	The roadblock was mounted in the Gitesi commune between the Kayenzi secteur -- 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness mentioned a name which we did not hear. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you repeat -- you said between Kayenzi secteur and somewhere else, can you repeat what -- your answer, please, Mr. Witness?
A.	It's between Kayenzi and Ruragwe.  Ruragwe is R-U-R-A-G-W-E, Ruragwe.
Q.	And Mr. Witness, in terms of the location of this roadblock, can you tell us, if you recall, the road that this roadblock was mounted on, do you know what road that was?
A.	No, it's not a matter of remembering the road, I know the road very well; it's the road that leads to Kigali.  There is a turn that take -- that goes to Birambo. 
Q.	So the road leads to Kigali from where, Mr. Witness?
A.	From Kibuye.  Also, when you come from Kigali you pass by that location on your way to Kibuye.
Q.	Okay.  Was the road tarmacked?  Was it a tarmacked road or what sort of road was it?  Can you help us with that?
A.	No, it was not tarmacked at the time.  Mention was being made of the tarmacking of the road, but it hadn't yet been done.
Q.	Okay.  Now, you say that you had been brought to this roadblock.  Can we talk about that?  Who exactly -- what were the circumstances surrounding your presence at that roadblock? 
(Pages 20 to 24 by Judith Baverstock)



















	1700H
A.	I was taken to that roadblock to be killed because it was said that I was a Tutsi. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Who had taken you to the roadblock to be killed? 
A.	Yes.  The people who did that, they're there, but I do not think that it would be a good thing for me to mention their names in public, unless you guarantee that these names will not be divulged to the public. 
Q.	Were you related to any of the people that took you to the roadblock?  Can you just answer yes or no? 
A.	No, I was not related to any of those people. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, what ethnic group were the people who took you to the roadblock?  What ethnic group did they belong to? 
A.	They were Hutu.
Q.	And from where had they taken you to the roadblock?
A.	They had taken me away from my own secteur. 
Q.	Any particular place in your secteur?  On the streets, near your house somewhere?  Can you help us with that? 
A.	No, it wasn't from my house; rather, it was from the bushes, because at that time no one was still living in his or her own home.
Q.	So you were in hiding, Mr. Witness, were you not? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	When was it that you were taken from the bushes to the roadblock?  And by that I mean date, if you recall. 
A.	It was indeed that very date we've already mentioned.
Q.	The 20th of May, 1994, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What ethnic group was your mother, Mr. Witness? 
A.	My mother was Hutu.
Q.	And your father? 
A.	He was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Did you have any brothers and sisters, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No.  What I can say is that at the time I did, but for the time being, they are no longer there.
Q.	You say you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi whilst you were at the roadblock.  How long had you been at that roadblock before you saw the man you describe as Ndindabahizi?  How long? 
A.	I don't think I can remember the duration for which I had already been at the roadblock.
Q.	Was it hours?  Was it days?  Can you help me with that sort of estimation, please? 
A.	No, it wasn't days.  In wasn't in terms of days.  It was a few moments, but I'm unable to specify to you how long the time was. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived at the roadblock, did you find anyone there, and if so, who were those you found at the roadblock? 
A.	I found many people there.  I think in my written statement I mentioned the names of those people, but I do not think it would benefit my security in any way whatsoever if I were to mention those person's names in public, because those people are still there.  They're still alive. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In that case, Your Honours, I draw your attention to page 130 of the English statement, it's the last paragraph, two names mentioned there; and also on page 133 of the French.  And of course, the present location of those people, those persons, has a bearing on the witness's security as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to table this statement as an exhibit?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I will.  I will, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I will.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So then you are referring to --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I think I might as well do it now, actually.  If I can just enter that statement as Prosecution Exhibit 28, Your Honour, so I don't forget.  And the relevant part of the English statement is the last -- the two, the two names on the last paragraph on page 130, and the two names as well on 133 in the French.  So that would be 28 or 27A and B.  I think we're on 28.  Twenty-eight?  Okay, 28A for English and B for French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, so admitted in English and French, under seal.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Under seal, yes.
(Exhibit No. P28A and P28B admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we've taken note of those names.  Can you tell me what ethnic group these people belonged to? 
A.	They were Hutus who were manning that roadblock, and they did nothing else but kill.
Q.	Do you know how old these people were?  Do you have an idea of how old they were at the time? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you their ages.
Q.	Were they young men or old men?  Can you help me with that sort of description?  Were they your age, for example? 
A.	One of them was young, others were older, but I wouldn't say they were old men because old men wouldn't be manning roadblocks. 
Q.	Had you known any of these men before you saw them on the 20th of May, 1994?  Before you saw them at the roadblock on the 20th of May, 1994, did you know any of them before? 
A.	I knew all of them. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know why these men were manning that roadblock? 
A.	They were not doing anything else, except to ensure that the Tutsis who were considered the enemy were unable to escape.  That was what they were doing. 
Q.	Do you know how they sought to achieve that goal of not enabling the Tutsis to escape?  Do you know how that was done? 
A.	Well, you see, I didn't spend all my time with them.  I didn't spend my nights with them; I didn't spend my days with them.  All I know is that they would stop people at that roadblock and would kill them at the very roadblock. 
Q.	Now, whereabouts at this roadblock were you located on the 20th of May, 1994?  Do you recall how far away from the roadblock or how close to the roadblock you were?  And can you describe the distance in terms of metres, as far as you remember? 
A.	In my opinion, I was about 2 metres away from the roadblock.  In fact, I was at the roadblock where I was. 
Q.	And from -- and in what position were you 2 metres from the roadblock?  Were you -- and by that I mean, were you kneeling, sitting, standing?  Can you help us with that, with your physical position at the time whilst you were at the roadblock? 
A.	I was sitting. 
Q.	You testified that you had been captured in the bushes and taken to the roadblock.  Were you restrained in any way whilst you were at the roadblock?  Were there any physical restraints on your person whilst you were there, or were you free to roam around? 
A.	No, I wasn't touched at the time when I was at the roadblock.  It's the attackers who took me to the roadblock who wounded me, but those who were at the roadblock did not wound me. 
Q.	Now, why was it necessary for the attackers to take you from the bush to the roadblock? 
A.	The reason was that I had said to the attackers that I had 30,000 francs which I would give to them at the roadblock.  The reason why I was taken to the roadblock was because I had said that at the roadblock there was someone who was owing me 30,000 francs and that I was supposed to ask that person for the money so I could give it to the attackers, but I knew that the attackers were going to kill me whether I gave them that money or not. 
Q.	Was there any connection between those who took you from the bush and those who manned the roadblock, and if so, what was that connection? 
A.	No, there was no relationship between these people, except from the fact that they were all Hutus. 
Q.	And how far was the bush where you had been found to the roadblock in terms of distance? 
A.	I would say that between the roadblock and the bushes where I was found would be a distance of about a 40-minute walk.  You could cover that distance in 40 minutes when walking. 
Q.	What time of the day was it when you arrived at this roadblock on 20th May 1994?  What time of day was it? 
A.	It was during the day.  I would say that it was around 11.  You will understand that that is a mere estimate because I wasn't wearing a watch at the time. 
Q.	Were you aware of the existence of that roadblock before the 20th of May, 1994, and if so, how did you become aware? 
A.	Of course I knew that, given the fact that I had first of all hidden at another place, and in that place I had heard people say that there was a roadblock at Gaseke and that no one was able to cross that roadblock.  At the time when I reached the roadblock, I realised that there was indeed a roadblock at Gaseke. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you, do you recall describing the location of the roadblock to investigators from the Tribunal? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Do you also recall describing where you were located at that roadblock to those investigators? 
A.	But I know where I was.  Generally speaking, this was where I was born.  I was a native of that area, so it's an area which I knew very well.
Q.	Did you accompany the investigators to that area, or did you just describe it to them from the location of your interview? 
A.	I described it to them.  I didn't take them to the site. 
MR. ADEOGUN    -PHILLIPS:
May I draw Your Honours' attention to Prosecution Exhibit P2, sketch 2 in particular, which is serialed -- serial numbered L0019877.  That sketch is indicative of the witness's description of where he was located at the time.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you, you testified earlier that whilst at this roadblock you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  Can you describe to the Court the circumstances surrounding your -- surrounding you seeing Mr. Ndindabahizi at the roadblock?  What was he doing there? 
A.	No, he was not doing anything in particular at the roadblock.  I saw him pass by.  He was passing by.
Q.	Okay.  How had Mr. Ndindabahizi arrived at that location on that day? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you that.  I saw him passing at the roadblock.  I recognised him because of the fact that he stopped there for a moment. 
Q.	Are you able to tell us whether he had arrived on foot? 
A.	Well, you will understand that he obviously didn't come to that place on foot.  He was on a vehicle. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, are you able to describe the vehicle that you saw him arrive in?  And let's start with the colour of that vehicle.  What was the colour? 
A.	I'm quite sure, from my memory, that it was a white vehicle.
Q.	Are you able to recall what sort of vehicle he had arrived in when you saw him? 
A.	I am unable to tell the different makes of vehicles, but it was a vehicle with a long chassis.  It was the kind of vehicle on which one normally mounts antennae.
Q.	Was it a pick-up vehicle, for example? 
A.	I really don't know how to differentiate makes of cars.  All I noticed is that it was a long chassis vehicle.  But it was sort of like a Pajero kind of vehicle, but it was not the same vehicle as those which transport merchandise, for instance. 
Q.	Do you know how many people were in this vehicle when you saw it? 
A.	It was a very long time ago, but I'm quite certain that there were three persons aboard that vehicle.
Q.	How many people got out of the vehicle, if anyone? 
A.	It was the chauffeur and Ndindabahizi who came down from the vehicle.  The other occupant did not come down from the vehicle.
Q.	When the two occupants, Mr. Ndindabahizi and the chauffeur, got down, did they do anything in particular?  Do you know why they got down from the vehicle? 
A.	I remember that with regard to the driver, he opened the back end of the vehicle and from there he brought out machetes.  That's all I remember. 
Q.	And do you know what he did with the machetes he brought out the back of the vehicle? 
A.	What he did with them?  But these machetes were meant for killing.  There was no other use for them in that place.
Q.	Did you see them kill anyone with those machetes?  How do you know they were meant for killing, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I'm quite sure that that was the use for those machetes because, first of all, Ndindabahizi said something.  He asked them why they were not killing the Tutsis, why they were allowing them to go.  That is why I was saying that there was no other use for those machetes except that of being used for killing. 
Q.	You testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke about Tutsis.  Who was he speaking with at the time?  Was he talking to you? 
A.	No, he wasn't talking to me.  He was talking to the people who were manning the roadblock. 
Q.	And what exactly did you hear them say -- I'm sorry, did you hear him say, Mr. Ndindabahizi? 
A.	As for what he said, he asked the question why the Tutsis were being allowed to go without being killed.  Those were his words, and they were the only words he said at that place. 
Q.	And did he say those words before the chauffeur took out the machetes from the back of the vehicle or afterwards? 
A.	I don't remember that very well, but I think that he first of all said those words and then the driver off-loaded the machetes from the vehicle. 
Q.	In what language was Mr. Ndindabahizi speaking on this occasion? 
A.	He was speaking in Kinyarwanda because he was speaking to Rwandans.
Q.	And the machetes that were taken from the back of the vehicle, were they just left by the roadside, or do you know what happened to them? 
A.	After his departure, people took those machetes and they were taken to houses which were below the road.  In fact, that's where the people manning the roadblock lived. 
Q.	How far away were these houses from the roadblock? 
A.	It was actually a small structure, a small kind of house.  It wasn't a house as such.  You need to make a distinction between normal houses and this little structure in which the attackers lived. 
(Pages 25 to 30 by Diane Hermann)



























	1730H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	You have testified, Mr. Witness, that you were some two metres away from the roadblock itself.  Now, did Mr. Ndindabahizi see you?  Having arrived at the roadblock, was he able to see you?
A.	Actually, we looked at one another, he and I, but I couldn't tell you a hundred percent that he saw me, because, had he seen me, he would have given instructions for me to be killed.  So I cannot confirm that he recognised me.
Q.	Did he make any reference to your presence at the roadblock, to your knowledge?
A.	No, he didn't say anything about me.  As I have just told you, I cannot confirm categorically, in other words without making a mistake, that he saw me and recognised me.
Q.	How was Mr. Ndindabahizi dressed when you saw him at the roadblock on 20th May 1994?
A.	Since that was a long time ago and that it was during the war, I have already mentioned this in my written statement.  He was wearing a black suit.
Q.	Apart from saying those words to the men at the roadblock, did you see Mr. Ndindabahizi doing anything else whilst he was at the roadblock?
A.	No, nothing else, apart from the fact that he took money from his jacket and gave that money to the people who were manning the roadblock.  I do not know why he gave that money to those manning the roadblock.  I believe the Accused would be better placed to answer that question.
Q.	How long did Mr. Ndindabahizi remain at the roadblock on that occasion, Mr. Witness?
A.	Well, I wouldn't be able to answer your question.  I think he remained there for a few minutes, maybe five minutes, I would say, but in any case not very long.  I had the impression that he was in a hurry, given what he was able to do in that place.
Q.	And, did there come a time when you left that roadblock and, if so, how did you leave that roadblock and when?
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you the exact time at which I left the roadblock, because I wasn't wearing a watch.
Q.	Did you leave the roadblock several days after you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi or when did you leave, in terms of days and months and weeks?  Can you help me with that?
A.	After he left I remained there for just a few moments.  It wasn't a matter of several hours, nor days.
Q.	And how were you able to leave the roadblock?
A.	As for my departure from the roadblock, it is someone who helped me leave that roadblock.  But I don't think I should mention that person's name, because that would endanger my safety.
Q.	Did you have any relationship with this person and, if so, what was that relationship?
A.	Yes, there is a relationship between myself and that individual.
Q.	Can you tell me what that relationship was or is?
A.	I would say that I was his son, but actually the investigators made a mistake by saying that this person was my maternal uncle.  But I can say that I am like his son, like one of his children.
Q.	So, is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that this person was your father or are you saying that you took this person like your father?
A.	No.  He was not my biological father, but, actually, I looked upon him as a father.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I would just have the registry show him this name just to confirm that we are talking about the same person.  It's the piece of paper with the "P" name on it.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is indeed the person.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'll have that introduced as Prosecution Exhibit P29 under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  
	(Exhibit No. P29 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	How was the person you identified on Prosecution Exhibit 29 able to rescue you at the roadblock?  How did that happen?
A.	I think he must have given an amount of money to persons manning the roadblock, but even if he had not given that amount of money to those persons manning the roadblock he would have been able to save me from the roadblock, because I can say those who were manning the roadblock were like brothers to that person.
Q.	Had this person been at the roadblock whilst Mr. Ndindabahizi was there?
A.	No, that man came to the roadblock later, after Ndindabahizi.
Q.	How long after Mr. Ndindabahizi's departure did the man arrive at the roadblock?
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you.
Q.	Do you recall if it was a matter of seconds, minutes, hours?  Can you help us out with that sort of thing?
A.	Let's say that it was a matter of minutes rather than .
Q.	And when he arrived at the roadblock, how was he able to secure your release?  How long did it take before he was able to secure your release from that roadblock?
A.	That did not take a very long time; I would say maybe five minutes.  Actually, he was drunk.  He had been drinking and he didn't stay at that place for a long time.  I think that's the reason why he didn't stay there for a long time, because he was drunk.
Q.	And is it your testimony that some amount of money was paid to secure your release?  Was that the only reason why you were released? 
A.	Yes, it's for that reason, but I think that even if he had not given that amount of money to the people manning the roadblock they were linked by a bond of friendship.  I think there must have been some kind of exchange between some of those people manning the roadblock, maybe an exchange of cattle or something like that.  So he didn't need to offer that amount of money in order to obtain my release.
Q.	What ethnic group was this person who secured your release from the roadblock?
A.	He was Hutu.
Q.	Now, earlier on in your testimony, Mr. Witness, you testified that those manning the roadblocks were there to kill Tutsi.  Do you recall saying that? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you actually see or know anyone who was killed at that roadblock?
A.	Many people were killed at that roadblock; moreover, there was a smell emanating from dead bodies.  And I know one person who was killed at that very roadblock.
Q.	Do you know that person's name, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us?
A.	That person was known as Nturusu.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can the interpreters help us with the spelling of that name, if they know?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nturusu is spelt N-T-U-R-U-S-U.  S as in Sierra.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Nturusu, was this person killed before or after Mr. Ndindabahizi's visit?  Can you recall?
A.	If my memory serves me right, that person was killed after Ndindabahizi's departure.
Q.	But would I be correct in saying that that person was not killed in your presence?  You didn't see this, did you?
A.	That person, yes, you're quite right.  When this person was killed I was not present.
Q.	Do you know if anything else happened at the roadblock whilst you were there, before your uncle rescued you, apart from Mr. Ndindabahizi's drive through there?
A.	People were being killed at that roadblock.  Nothing else.
Q.	Were these people killed at the roadblock in your presence or before or after you had left?  Can you help me with that? 
A.	Before I arrived, people were being killed there, and even after I left the roadblock.  I'm saying this because those who were manning the roadblock there only were to kill people.
Q.	Can you describe what -- can you describe what the man you say was Mr. Ndindabahizi -- can you describe what he looked like on that day?  What did he look like in terms of his physical appearance?
A.	You mean Ndindabahizi?  Ndindabahizi is a man of average height.  His skin is not dark nor light.  His complexion is neither dark or light, it's average, between the two.
Q.	Do you recall making a statement to investigators, Mr. Witness, on the 10th of November 2000?
A.	I don't recall the date, because after that I experienced a problem and I fell ill.  So I cannot remember those dates.
Q.	Okay.  In that statement you referred to a Rwandan half-caste being killed after Mr. Ndindabahizi's departure.  Do you recall saying that in the statement? 
A.	I did not quite understand the term that you used.  Yes, I made that statement.
Q.	Now, was this person killed in your presence or was this something you were told, Mr. Witness?
A.	I have explained to you that that person was killed after my departure, but I do not know how the investigators took down my statement.  I think I explained to you that this person was killed after my departure.
Q.	So any reference in that statement to the fact that you were present at the roadblock when that incident happened is wrong, is it not, Mr. Witness?
A.	Do you mean the incident in which that person was killed?
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  You were not present, were you?
A.	I have explained to you that that person was killed after my departure and that I do not know how the investigators took down my statement in that manner, because I had already left when that person was killed.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are currently detained, are you not -- and I don't want you to mention the location of your current detention -- but can you confirm whether or not you are currently detained in Rwanda?
A.	Detained in Rwanda, yes, yes, I am detained in Rwanda.
Q.	Now, how long have you been in detention and, again, please don't mention where you are detained, just answer me as to the length of time, how long a period?
A.	I cannot tell you the date when on which I was detained because I don't think that would be good for my safety.  However, I am a detainee.
Q.	Okay, can you tell me how long, like one year, two years, three years, can you give me that sort of assistance?  How long you have been detained?
A.	No.  I have told you I do not wish to tell you the year during which I was detained, because I do believe that may cause me a problem regarding my safety.
Q.	I understand that, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell me why you were detained?
A.	I am in detention because of crimes I committed, and there is a law which provides for sentences for persons found guilty of a crime.
Q.	Can you tell me what crime you have committed?
A.	The crime that I committed, well, it's genocide.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just testified to this Court that you are of the Tutsi ethnic group.

JUDGE BOSSA:
Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to ask him a question.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Judge.
JUDGE BOSSA:
Are you a convict?
THE WITNESS:
No.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that you're on remand where you are detained?  You have not been convicted of any crimes yet.
A.	Yes.  What you're saying is true.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you've testified and, again, it's on your personal identification details, Prosecution Exhibit 26, that you are of the Tutsi ethnic group.  Why is it, then, that you are currently detained on genocide charges?  Can you help us with that? 
A.	Yes.  I can shed light on that for you.  There are many people who are in detention, and you yourself can carry out investigations.  There are many Tutsis who are in detention, many.  The only thing is that anyone who commits a crime must be punished.
Q.	And are you able to particularise the crime that you are suspected of having committed, Mr. Witness?
A.	No.  I do not believe I can do so, because that would be detrimental to me.
Q.	Did you, Mr. Witness, carry a false identity card in 1994?
A.	What do you mean by a false identity card?
Q.	Were you known as a Tutsi in 1994 after the event at the roadblock?  Did you continue to be known and recognised as a Tutsi?  Can you help me with that?
A.	Yes.  I was known as such.  I was a Tutsi and I was known as one.
Q.	And you are alleged to have committed acts of genocide; is that your testimony?
A.	Yes.  It is the crime of genocide that I committed those crimes after the date I mentioned to you.
Q.	So you are alleged to have committed this crime of genocide after the 20th of May, 1994.  Is that what you say, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.
Q.	All right, now -- 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I think I might have to go into closed session to do this, but I'll come back to that.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have spoken at length about the man you described to be Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi.  With the leave of the Court, if I asked you to look around this room, do you think you would be able to recognise him?
A.	Yes, I can identify him.  However, before the war I was 15 years old, and during the war I was 17 years old, and I think that was nine years ago, and if a person who, at that time, did not have grey hair, that person may have grey hair now or maybe someone who was not balding at the time may now have a bald head.  So there are risks of making a mistake.
Q.	We understand that, Mr. Witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, may I ask leave for the witness to -- thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you would like to stand up where you are currently located and look are around this room and see if you are able to identify Mr. Ndindabahizi and, if you do, please indicate what -- where he is and what he is wearing, please.
A.	I can see him.  He's over there.
Q.	He's over where, Mr. Witness?  Can you point in the direction which you see him?
A.	He is to that side, toward the back.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The witness is pointing to his left from where he is located.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you describe for me, Mr. Witness, what this person is wearing, this person you think you can identify?  How is he dressed?
A.	He's wearing a black suit.
Q.	What else can you see?
A.	A white shirt.
Q.	Is there anything else about the way he's dressed?
A.	No, I can see nothing else.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, if the record can reflect that it's a reasonable enough identification.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Noted.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness --
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, my usual comment.  There is no one here with whom the Accused can be confused.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi on the 20th of May, in what direction was he travelling?  Can you help me with that?  Where was he headed and where was he coming from on this road?
A.	From the Kigali direction.
	(Pages 31 to 36 by R. Lear)

	1800H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:  
Q.	So he was coming from Kigali direction or he was heading to Kigali?  Can you help me with that?
A.	He was coming from Kibuye going the direction of Kigali.  I would not say that he was going to Kigali, but he took the direction of Kigali.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, does your release from that roadblock on 20th of May 1994, does your release from that roadblock have any bearing on the charges of genocide which are currently levied on you?  Can you help us with that?
A.	Yes, there is a link between my release, but I do not think that to, to -- I don't think the fact of having committed this crime -- I don't think the fact of saying there is a link between my release and the fact of having committed a crime is good for me.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.  Your Honour, I have to make an application to go into closed session, just to deal with this very little area of this testimony, at the very tail end of his testimony, just to get the point across.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We will grant that application.  

Mr. Witness, we will now ask the public kindly to leave the public gallery so that no one will be listening to this case, and then we will enter into a closed session where you can speak freely.  And the transcripts will be placed under seal and court video system will not be transmitted to the outside world.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 38 to 41] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 37 by Petrus Chijarira)














MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we will now open the doors again, so from now on you have to be careful.  

We are now in open session.  Please proceed.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, since Defence did not know until now the charges brought against the witness in Rwanda, we believe it would be proper to obtain the criminal records of the witness.  However, I don't know how we are going to proceed, how we are going to go about it.  I don't if it's the Prosecutor or the Defence or the registry should be taking that initiative, but I shall leave it at that for now.  We can bring it back.  They are just thoughts that are coming into my mind.  I have no clear idea how to deal with it, but I just want to mention it this evening so that we can possibly come back to it.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness, let's go back to April 1994.  How long after the death of President Habyarimana did you hide yourself in a bush?
A.	I cannot give you the date, but I know that when I was hiding I saw Tutsis fleeing.  On the way, they were being killed.  So it was within that context that I went to hide, but I cannot recall the date.
Q.	Were you personally threatened or chased?
A.	Well, if I fled, it only means that those who were around me were wondering why I did not follow my kinsmen, because they were making reference to these Tutsis who had been -- who had fled to the stadium.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Your Honour, we didn't understand counsel.
THE WITNESS: 
	There was no doubt, there was no doubt these people clearly know my -- knew my ethnic background, and as far as I am concerned, I know my ethnic background.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We didn't hear your question, Mr. Besnier.  Can you just repeat your own question?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	The question is:  Was there no doubt surrounding your ethnic background?
A.	No, these people had no doubt whatsoever, and they were speaking knowing what they were saying.  But as far as I was concerned, I did not (sic) know my ethnic group.
Q.	And these people who had no doubt about your ethnic origin, were they convinced subsequent to the act that you committed and which you referred to a while ago?
A.	Those who had no doubts about my ethnic group were not the same people who brought me somebody to be killed.  That was another group of people who brought me somebody to be killed, and after that act, they were satisfied that I was a Hutu.
Q.	When you hid yourself in a bush, as you said, did you go to other communes, apart from your native commune, to hide?
A.	No, I remained in my secteur.  There were a lot of people that I knew.
Q.	And in the first sentence of your written statement dated November 2000, it is the second sentence, "In April 1994 and throughout the war, except for a few times when I hid to escape death, I remained in my commune of origin."  Am I to understand from that that you left your commune of origin to hide or did you mean something else?  May I repeat the question, Witness?
A.	At this place there were relatives, and that is why I did not leave that locality.  So there were relatives within that locality, and it is still my current place of residence.
Q.	But the question is that in your written statement, I understand that you left your commune to hide, whereas you are saying today that you never left your commune.  I therefore realise that there are two different things.  Which one is correct?  Just hang on a minute, let me finish with my question.  Have you understood my question?
A.	No, I think that is from your own notes.  All I know is that I remained in my own secteur and my commune of origin.  I did not go beyond that commune.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now, in your statement, Mr. Witness, there is a sentence which gives the impression that you did on some occasions leave the commune.  Is that wrong or correct? 
THE WITNESS: 
	No, no.  I do not understand where you get that from because that's not the truth.  I hid within my commune of origin.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Now, Defence counsel gets that from the statement you gave to investigators.  Do you understand where the investigators got that from?
THE WITNESS: 
	No, they misread that sentence.  In fact, I don't know where they obtained that formulation from.  I remained within my secteur and also within my commune of origin.
	(Pages 42 to 43 by Petrus Chijarira)








	1830H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal, did you come spontaneously to see them or is it they or someone else who came to fetch you?
A.	I personally was at the guesthouse and I made that statement.  I am the person who gave the statement; no one else made me do so.
Q.	How did you know that the investigators were looking for information regarding Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?
A.	Yes, I was able to know that because where I was staying there was someone who spoke in French.  I heard him say that.  I heard him say that information was being sought concerning one so-and-so and I told him that I knew that person.
Q.	Very well.  So who was this other person who was speaking in French and who asked you to speak to the investigators of the Tribunal?
A.	No, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to say the name of that individual.  (By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal).  I heard them say -- they were speaking about Ndindabahizi, and I was saying why were they looking for information on Ndindabahizi.  And that is how come I provided the information concerning that individual.
Q.	If I understand you properly you were at the Kibuye guest house and you came upon a conversation during which one was mentioning Ndindabahizi and that's when you suggested that you'll provide that information.  Do I understand you correctly?
A.	I first of all wondered why they were looking for information concerning Ndindabahizi.  When I was given an answer, it was at that time that I was able to give the information I possessed concerning that individual.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think maybe we will delete the word (By order of the Court this word has been extracted and filed under seal) from the records and the court video system.  So that will be placed under seal. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, you did say that you have known Emmanuel Ndindabahizi for a long time and you made reference to the years 1991, 1992.  Are you able to tell the Court your age at that time?
A.	I was still young, 14, 15 years, quite young.
Q.	Do you have any relationship with ********************?
A.	Yes, there is a relationship, but I do not think it is proper to speak about it because it's a very close relationship.
Q.	But you did make reference to that relationship in your written statement?
A.	That is correct.  Yes, I did say that there was relationship, but I don't think it is proper for me to speak about it now.
Q.	How is it that you do not even know the name of the **************************************, you only know her by the first name?
A.	Yes, I don't know her name, but I know the name that she is commonly called by.
Q.	Were you living in her house?
A.	No.  No, I was not living in her house but there wasn't a long distance between their house and where I lived.
Q.	When the************************************  were you present in the house when the latter brought him *************************?
A.	No, I was not there, but each time we see a vehicle passing since we were children, we would run and see what was happening.  It was in those circumstances that I came to know.
Q.	How do you know that **************************?
A.	People were saying that the purpose of the visit was *************************************************** ***********************.
Q.	People were saying it, but you personally did not know; is that correct?
A.	What I do know is that **************, but also people were saying that************************************* bring *********************************************************************************************************** ************************
Q.	Have you -- have you had any conversation -- or had you had any conversation with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the past?
A.	Do you think there could be any conversation between a young man, a child, and somebody the standing -- of that standing?  Well, we used to see him from a distance; we'd see his vehicle.  We are more interested in his vehicle and we looked at him in the vehicle from a distance.
Q.	Very well.  Witness, how did you hear about the death of President Habyarimana, do you recall?
A.	I did not hear it during the night of his death.  It was when I was going to the market that I heard it from women that I met on my way.
Q.	Do you recall the day that you went to the market and heard about the death of the president?
A.	Normally, the market day, it's Wednesday, so it must have been a Wednesday.
Q.	Approximately what time?
A.	I do not recall the exact time, but it was in the morning.
Q.	You said the market day is Wednesday?
A.	Yes.  It was twice a week, including Wednesday.  I think the market was twice a week.
Q.	And do you recall the other market day?  Was it a Friday, a Sunday or any other day?
A.	It was Saturday.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Let's now focus on the Gaseke roadblock, and you said that you were led -- you were taken to the Gaseke roadblock on the 20th -- on or around the 20th May.  What margin of error are you giving to this statement, would it be one day, plus or minus one day, plus or minus three days; can you be more specific?
A.	I'm saying without any doubt that it was on that date.
Q.	Well, then, now you remember that it was the 20th of May 1994?
A.	Yes, it was the 20th of May 1994.
Q.	Is there any specific event which jogs your memory to remind you that it was that day?  Was it your birthday?  Anything particular that reminds you that it was the 20th of May 1994?
A.	I think that date is etched in my mind.  There is no -- there is no specific event that reminds me of the date, but it's a date that I just remember.  It's engraved in my memory.
Q.	Before the 20th of May, and following the death of President Habyarimana, were you -- did you go to the neighbourhood of the Gaseke roadblock?
A.	How would I have found myself in that neighbourhood and what for? 
Q.	But you knew they were killing Tutsis at that roadblock, didn't you?
A.	Yes, I knew that.  Yes, people were saying that you cannot venture to that roadblock and I realised that subsequently.
Q.	Who arrested you and took you to that roadblock?
A.	There are people who did it but since they are still alive, I cannot -- I cannot name them under the current circumstances.
Q.	Why are you protecting them if they are criminals?
A.	Even if they are criminals, I believe I have told you that they are currently detained, and to ask me to mention their names under these circumstances would create a problem.
Q.	Did you testify against them in the Rwandan courts?
A.	You want to know if I testified against these people?  Yes.
Q.	When you got to that roadblock how many Hutus were already there?
A.	I told you they were many and I mentioned those I could remember.  I believe you have their names in front of you.
Q.	Yes.  You did say in your examination-in-chief that you knew them all, but you mentioned only these names, whereas you say that they -- those who manned the Gaseke roadblock were 20, in your written statement.  Do you remember other names of these people?
A.	No, there are no others.  I only estimated the number of people who were at the roadblock.  Now the names that I recall -- I mentioned the names that I knew.
Q.	So, then, how many people were at that roadblock?  If you do not recall, you do not recall.
A.	I told you they were many and that I was only to recall the names that I have given you.  I gave you three names, but you will understand that a roadblock is not manned by just three people.
Q.	But in the Prosecutor's examination-in-chief you recalled that there were 20.  Could there have been many more or less?
A.	It is not true that I gave that number in my testimony here.  I think I mentioned 20 people in my written statement, but I'm not saying that that is the absolute truth.  I mentioned the name of some of these people, and regarding the number of people that I mentioned, it was just an estimate.
Q.	All the Hutus who were around the roadblock, were they armed, were they carrying weapons?
A.	You are asking if they were carrying weapons?  Well, I saw only one person among them who was carrying a spear.  The other weapons were the machetes that were given to them at that roadblock.  That is what I managed to see.
Q.	So, you are saying that before Emmanuel Ndindabahizi visited that roadblock nobody, apart from the person carrying the spear, was carrying a weapon?
A.	Possibly they could have been carrying weapons but I did not see them.
Q.	And yet you were at two metres from that roadblock as you said and you did not observe their weapons?
A.	Counsel, what do you want me to tell you?  I have told you that even if the attackers were not carrying weapons they can kill through their mere presence given the furore in them.  But I am saying that the only person I saw carrying a weapon was the one carrying the spear.
Q.	Now, Witness, Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, when he came to the roadblock, as you claimed, did he really say that, "There are a lot of Tutsis going through here, why don't you kill them?"  Did he say that?
A.	He added the following: "Why do these people -- Tutsis go without being harassed?"  I think he himself is aware of this unless he is trying to be smart.
Q.	Could Tutsis really go through that roadblock, Witness?
A.	I am unable to tell you if he met some but I can tell that you Tutsis were killed at that roadblock.  Maybe he got it wrong or he got to know that Tutsis were able to go through without being harassed, but what I'm telling you is what he said and which I'm recounting.
Q.	Witness, don't you find it strange that the Tutsis (sic) who were at the roadblock did not immediately point you out to Ndindabahizi as being their most recent discovery of a Tutsi and did not try killing you immediately in the presence of Ndindabahizi?
A.	You find that strange?  But I told that you that from among those manning the roadblock there was one influential person and that a message was sent to that person and they knew that that person was coming to release me -- or to free me from that roadblock.  That is why those manning the roadblock did not harass me.
Q.	Who then would have sent this message?  I thought your uncle came by only subsequent to Ndindabahizi's departure?
A.	The person who sent the message -- well, the information went round because he was not far from where I was.
Q.	Now, if I should go over what you said in examination-in-chief, they arrested you, took you to the roadblock and you stayed at the roadblock for just a few minutes, then you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi arrive and he stayed for just a brief moment.  Within that short period you are saying that somebody circulated the information to the effect that you would be saved and at that very time the minister comes to the site.  Is that what you want the Court to believe?
A.	There were even screams or shouts that I had been arrested, and that person heard that I was at the roadblock and he sent a message to say that, "Don't kill my son".  He was somebody who was very -- who was well listened to by the people mounting the roadblock, and that is how come I was saved.
Q.	Am I to understand that all those people at the roadblock, including the killers that you referred to, hid from the minister, who came there himself, that there was a Tutsi close to that roadblock?
A.	I have told you that the leader of those mounting the roadblock played a role.  He, in effect, is the employer of the people manning the roadblock.  So I don't know if we're understanding each other, Counsel.
Q.	Very well.  Thank you, Witness, for this answer.  After the departure of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, how long did you remain at the roadblock?
A.	I have already told that you I was not wearing a watch, that I stayed at the roadblock for about five minutes.  I would not be table to give you the precise duration since I did not -- I was not wearing a watch.
Q.	The half-caste who was killed subsequently at the roadblock, and the person called Nturuso, is it the same -- is the one and the same person?
A.	It is that person called Nturuso, he was the half-caste.
Q.	But you admit today that you did not witness that killing, whereas you said the contrary in your statement to the investigators of the ICTR?
A.	Counsel, I expressed reservation and I did say that the investigators might have got it wrong or maybe the interpreter got it wrong, or for some other reason.
Q.	I understand, Witness.  I just want to know, based on what you were told, if the killing of the half-caste had anything to do with the visit of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi to the roadblock?
A.	I have already said that regarding Ndindabahizi and the killing of that person, the killing of this person occurred subsequent to Ndindabahizi's departure.  I don't know if you understand me, Counsel.
Q.	Very well.  But this killing occurred after, but was it after, in the course of the same day, in the course of the week?  Do you have any further information on this?
A.	Well, Counsel, I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.  There wasn't a long lapse of time.  I don't know if you need someone else to explain what I'm telling you, but I believe it's clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you say now, Mr. Witness, can you repeat your answer? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that it was not after a long time -- it was not a long time thereafter.  I cannot even say hours, let alone days.  It was soon after the departure of Ndindabahizi.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Is it correct to say that this killing took place on the 20th of May 1994?
A.	Yes, on the same day, that same date, around 11:00 or a bit after 11:00.  It was not in the night, it was in the morning but not early in the morning.
Q.	Rwandan half-caste, exactly what do you mean?  Is it a child of a Hutu and a Tutsi or a white man and a Rwandan woman?  Explain exactly what you mean by half-caste.
A.	It was not a Hutu or a Tutsi nor a Twa.  Briefly I don't know how to describe him to you in French.  I think that in French you say naturalised.  Maybe you are in a better position to understand that than myself.
Q.	Did he have any white blood?  Did he have any parent who was of the white race?  Do you know anything about that?
A.	No, I wouldn't say that he had white blood but, in fact, it was said that his mother was Rwandan, but that his father was allegedly white.  Now, as for his physique, he had the traits of a Tutsi.
Q.	Did you know him yourself?
A.	No.  It was only at that location that I learnt of his existence and people spoke about him saying that he was called Nturuso.
Q.	Do you know any other name that he may have had or a nickname?
A.	How would you want me to know that, Counsel? 
Q.	In your written statement you mentioned the fact that this half-caste was in his vehicle and that his driver was driving.  Did you also come by this information through other persons?
A.	You are referring to the driver?  No, no, I knew the driver before.  That is not something which was reported to me.  I knew the driver.
Q.	And the driver did indeed answer to the name which you mentioned in your written statement?  I don't want to mention the name out loud, but you stated that he was driving his vehicle and you mentioned the name.  Do you remember the name that you mentioned?  Don't say it out loud.
A.	Yes, of course, I know that name.  I do remember his name but of course I won't say it out loud.

	1900H
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	I want to give you a piece of paper, Mr. Witness, so that you can confirm that indeed it is the same person we are talking about.  It is very important.  
A.	Yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to counsel.  Your microphone was not on, Counsel. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Have you recognised the name of the half-caste about whom we are speaking?
A.	Yes, yes.  That indeed was his name.
MR. BESNIER:
I have two or three other small questions.  I do not want to go back --
JUDGE BOSSA:
I am seeking a clarification.  Was the name written on the paper the name of the half-caste or of the driver?  
THE WITNESS:
Are you speaking about the name that I have here before me? 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand your question, Your Honour. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Does that name relate to the late half-caste who was killed at the roadblock, or the driver of the vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
No, it's the driver's name. 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	I want to go back a little to your situation and your alleged crime.  I simply want to know whether that crime was committed in the same cellule where you were living in 1994 or whether it was somewhere else in Rwanda.
A.	Oh, you make me laugh, Counsel.  It is indeed my native cellule, that's where I committed that crime. 
Q.	I'm sorry that these things make you laugh, Mr. Witness, and I want to know approximately when this crime was committed.  Was it in the month of May, was it in June, or do you still want to remain vague? 
A.	I cannot give you the exact time because I do not remember myself, but it was the day after the incident we referred to, the following day in the morning, the morning following the day on which I left the roadblock, but I cannot specify the time.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further questions for this witness. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No re-examination, Your Honour. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
You mentioned that you were taken to the roadblock at around 11 o'clock in the morning; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot tell you that that is the absolute truth.  It was not during the evening, but neither was it very early in the morning.  I gave a period of time which was approximate. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
In the morning; okay.  How long after that did the Accused arrived? 
THE WITNESS:
Just a little after my arrival at that place. 
JUDGE BOSSA:
Okay.  And how long after that was the half-caste killed?  Because you said he was killed in the morning as well. 
THE WITNESS:
Briefly, that happened about five minutes after I left the roadblock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did you get into hiding?  When did you start hiding in the bush; which month? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember the exact date, but it's obvious that that was in the month of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it before the event at Gataharo stadium or after the event at this stadium? 
THE WITNESS:
With regard to the time that I went to hide, it was before the incident that took place at the Gataharo stadium.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you stayed in the bush from before the event at Gataharo stadium until the 20th of May; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you ever -- was this bush far away from your home, or were you simply in the bush? 
THE WITNESS:
You must understand that one can't live in the bush without eating.  I would go somewhere where I was given food to eat, but I must specify that this was in the cellule where I was born.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.  So you were living in the bush day after day, but given food to eat by someone in your cellule; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
It's not only one person who gave me food, it was several people.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In my language what I said, it wasn't only one, it could be one or many, and now you are clarifying that it could be many.  All right.

Now, how are you then able to remember that this happened particularly on the 20th of May, this event, after having stayed about for four weeks hiding in the bush? 
THE WITNESS:
When one goes into hiding, that doesn't mean that one loses one's mental capacities.  I cannot forget that date.  It's true that I was living in the bush, but I had contact with the outside world, and I must tell you that there were obviously bad people in 1994, but there were also people who were good.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But can you explain to me how it was possible to keep trace of the dates in this period, Mr. Witness?  Can you explain that to me? 
THE WITNESS:
I'll never forget that date, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the beginning of the testimony you said that you were not certain about the date; later in your testimony you said, "I can never forget that date".  Can you explain those two remarks for me? 
THE WITNESS:
It's a fact, the memory of an individual retains certain facts and forgets others.  I think that this is a normal process when we are dealing with retention of information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, one of your first remarks in the testimony you gave today was, "I may be wrong about the date", and later you said "I'm absolutely certain about the date".  That is what I want to put to you now:  what is your answer now? 
THE WITNESS:
The explanation I can make is that when you have students in a class, there are some who will have a good memory and others who have poor memory, who do not retain what they are being taught, and if you are being taught a hundred lessons, you can, for instance, maybe only remember one lesson.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Around '91-'92 you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, you were still a child, you saw him from a distance.  Do you remember telling us that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but obviously it was a distance which was not very far.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what kind of distances are we talking about here? 
THE WITNESS:
You see, you can take as a point of reference a road used by vehicles.  You know that vehicles are parked to one side of the road.  Now, put yourself in the place of someone who would be standing by the road on the opposite side of the place where the vehicles are parked.  That's where I was.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you see him always in a vehicle or outside the vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't be able to tell you that he was outside the vehicle.  In fact, I could say that he never left the vehicle, but it's true that when he came to visit his sister, he came out of the vehicle and he would go to see his sister, and after the visit he would go back to the vehicle and leave.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you observed him, did you see him when he was in the vehicle or when he went out of it to visit his sister? 
THE WITNESS:
I am unable to be more specific about that.  I cannot -- I can tell you that I saw him when he was walking, going towards the sister's house.  In fact, as far as I know, he didn't go to the sister's house because the road was quite steep and he would park by the road, and I think he never went to that house because he could never have gotten there on foot.  The place was steep, and I don't think he could have reached the house.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So did you see him leave the vehicle on his way to his sister's house or did you not? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  No, I never saw him go up that walk in order to reach his sister's house.  Maybe he would go there at times when I didn't see him, but personally I never saw him actually making that trip.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you only observed him while he was inside the car; is that your testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was only on those occasions that I would see him, only then.  Maybe he did indeed go to his sister's house, but I cannot confirm that because I never saw him walk towards his sister's house.  I can therefore not testify to something of which I was not a witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, how can you be certain that the man you saw in '95 was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, when in '91-'92 on a limited number of occasions you had only seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi inside the car? 
THE WITNESS:
I can confirm that, and I have no doubt whatsoever about that, because, firstly, in other words, in 1992, it was said, "The brother of one such lady has come", his name would be mentioned by the people, and then on the 20th of May, 1994 some people who were at the roadblock asked who was that personality and his name was mentioned.  People were asking questions about where that man was working, and these people were saying amongst themselves that "He is now minister for finance", and it was at that point in time that I realised that it was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi they were talking about.

Now, as for the occasions during which I had seen him earlier, I had seen him two or three times, so when I saw him at the roadblock it wasn't the first time I was seeing him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Your testimony has now come to an end.  Thank you for coming the long way to Arusha to testify. 

Do you have any particulars so as to facilitate our task to find the file concerning you in Rwanda?  Is there any identity number or anything which could assist us?  Don't mention the detail, just answer yes or no.  Do you have anything which could facilitate finding those documents? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I have no indication to provide to you in that regard, but I think that you can approach the relevant authorities, in other words, the Prosecution, because that file is with the Prosecution, the Office of the Prosecutor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I wish to request that the written statements of the witness in French and in English be tendered as an exhibit, because I have some interest in that. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It is already Prosecution Exhibit 28.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think Mr. Phillips has already tendered it.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes; Prosecution Exhibit P28.
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, but I was under the impression that it was only partially admitted for certain passages from the statement.  I wanted to be certain that it was admitted as a whole document.
Also, Mr. President, I wish to tender as an exhibit the name which I showed to the witness a moment ago which would reveal the identity of the half-caste's driver, because we shall come back to that, I'm certain.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  D16, says the registry.  D16, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D16 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is good.  So have a nice journey home, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much.  

It is now 7:20.  May I propose that we have the pre-Defence conference tomorrow, maybe after 5 o'clock, then we can continue with the Military trial in the afternoon.  For how long do you think this pre-Defence conference will last, Mr. Besnier?  Are we talking about more than half an hour? 
MR. BESNIER:
It won't be very long, Mr. President.  I have some information to give to the Chamber, the names of my witnesses, subjects on which they will testify, and the duration.  I think I will be quite brief, but I'll be dealing more with the pre-trial brief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say the pre-trial brief? 
MR. BESNIER:
Yes.  I mean the pre-Defence brief.  It's not quite ready, because we haven't concluded with the Prosecution case, but it will be ready immediately before we move into the presentation of our case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any things to raise tomorrow, Mr. Phillips?  I'm just thinking about when we should start tomorrow. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, I have not seen the pre-Defence brief, we have no issues.  We have some outstanding exhibits to finalise now.  Before we close our case we have to sort these Prosecution exhibits that are in limbo out, so that we will leave our case open until that is sorted out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  Do you envisage any contentious matters in connection with these exhibits? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, we have one contentious matter as things stand, and that is very important to us.  It is the 3rd May meeting, I believe, and that is very contentious.  That is a major part of the Prosecution's case, and it is a Prosecution exhibit that is very important, so unless we have some way forward with that, it is very difficult for us to actually make a decision as to whether we are able to close our case at this stage or not, Your Honour.  It is an exhibit that cannot really be entered outside the Prosecution's case.  It can't.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but is there any other problematic issue than the 3rd of May? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it is the only one outstanding, to the best of my knowledge, as far as our case is concerned.  For the Defence case, I have no knowledge as of now what the issues are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When do you think, Defence, that you will be able to clarify the issue about the 3rd of May?  Can that be done tomorrow? 
MR. BESNIER:
With the cooperation of the registry it would certainly be able to be done during tomorrow.  I know that we have in the Niyitegeka case a transcript in French, in Kinyarwanda and in English of that document.  If I can consult that document tomorrow morning, I think towards the end of the morning or in the afternoon I would be able to express myself on these transcripts with regard to what the Prosecution is saying about the same.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what I am wondering now is whether we could start at 5:30 in the afternoon and go on to 6:00, or whether it would be more cautious to start a bit earlier in the afternoon. 
MR. BESNIER:
Maybe it would be wiser to start a little bit later so that we have enough time to go through the research that we have to do, which I have spoken about.  So I think for me 1800 would be ideal. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Eighteen-thirty, I'm sorry, 1830.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  From 6:30 to 7:00 then, tomorrow, and that's that.  That gives time, and that is the time that we will be sorting out the exhibits and look a little bit at the future. 

Thank you very much.

The Court is adjourned until tomorrow afternoon then.
(Court adjourned at 1928H)
