THE APPELLANT NDINDABAHIZI:

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You may be seated.  May I, before reading out the summary of the judgement, on behalf of the entire Bench, extend my gratitude to everybody and also in particular behind the scenes having allowed us to smoothly conduct these appeal proceedings.  I would also want to thank both parties having precisely and firmly presented their own cases in a fair and cooperative way. 

Let me now turn to the main purpose of the hearing.  Today, the Appeals Chamber of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will deliver its judgement in the case of 
Emmanuel Ndindabahizi versus the Prosecutor.  At the outset, I would like to emphasise that the following is a summary of the Appeals Chamber's judgement.  Copies of this judgement will be made available to the parties at the end of this session.  It has to be stressed that the only authoritative account of the Appeals Chamber's conclusion is to be found in the English version of the written judgement.  This oral summary does not constitute any part of the official and authoritative judgement of the Appeals Chamber.  In addition, not every point in the judgement will be mentioned in the summary, which will instead focus on the main issues.  

In this case the Appeals Chamber was seized of an appeal by the Appellant, Mr. Ndindabahizi, from the judgement of the trial of Trial Chamber I rendered on 15th July 2004.  

The Appellant was born in the year 1950 in Gashuru, Gitesi commune, Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda.  Between September 1992 and 6th April 1994 he was directeur de cabinet in the ministry of finance, second in authority, reporting to the minister only.  In 1973 he was the elected executive secretary of the Social Democratic party, the PSD, in Kibuye.  He was sworn in as minister of finance of the interim government on 9 April 1994.  The Appellant left Rwanda for Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo on 13 or 14 July 1994.  

The Trial Chamber primarily found that on 23 April 1994 the Appellant arrived at a roadblock near Gitwa Hill in a car in a convoy with two other cars, the latter two cars carrying people identified as Interahamwe.  Machetes were offloaded and distributed to the attackers assembled around the roadblock.  The Appellant said words to the effect that the machetes should be used according to plan or that they knew what to do with the machetes, meaning, thereby, that Tutsi should be killed. 

The Trial Chamber further found that the Appellant transported the assailants to Gitwa Hill on 
24 April 1994.  Two, he supervised the distribution of machetes to them and encouraged in the attack on Tutsi civilians who had sought refuge on Gitwa Hill stating that the Tutsi on the hill should be killed.  Two days later, there was a massive attack against Gitwa Hill.  Very few of the thousands of Tutsi men, women and children on Gitwa Hill survived the attack.  

For these acts, causing the deaths of thousands of Tutsi, the Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant pursuant to Article 6 (1) of the Statute for instigating, aiding and abetting genocide, Count 1.  

The Trial Chamber also convicted him for committing or, alternatively, instigating and aiding and abetting extermination, as a crime against humanity, Count 2. 
Furthermore, the Trial Chamber found that in late May 1994, the Appellant encouraged those manning a roadblock at a place called Gaseke to stop and kill Tutsi and that he distributed machetes and money to these men, who, according to the reasonable findings of the Trial Chamber, soon after the Appellant's departure apprehended and killed one person named Mr. Nors.  The Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant for these acts pursuant to Article 6 (1) of the Statute, for instigating and aiding and abetting genocide, Count 1, and for instigating and aiding and abetting murder as a crime against humanity, Count 3.  

The Trial Chamber handed out a single sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of the Appellant's life. 

The Appellant is appealing against all convictions on grounds of, among others, the following alleged errors:  The alleged vagueness of the indictment, Count 1 of the appeal; the alleged error in finding that the Appellant was in Gitwa, grounds of appeal 9 and 10; the alleged error in finding that the Appellant was at Gaseke roadblock, ground of appeal 11; and the sentence, ground of appeal 13. 

In relation to the events at Gitwa Hill, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber committed an error of law in rendering a judgement on the basis of the weight and defective paragraph 15 and 20 of the indictment, which alleged that the attack at Gitwa Hill took place on unknown days between 13 and 
26 April 1994.  

The Prosecution argues that the Trial Chamber read these paragraphs in context and correctly found that the dates in the indictment gave the Defence a good idea of when the alleged events occurred.  

The Appeals Chamber finds that the indictment pleaded the time period for the events at Gitwa Hill is the sufficient specificity.  The Appeals Chamber is mindful that in light of the events that occurred in Rwanda between April and July 1994, it is not always possible to be precise as to the specific date on which the crimes charged were committed.  Nevertheless, these considerations have to be balanced with the Appellant's right to be informed in detail about the nature and cause of the charge against him in order to allow a comprehensive defence to be raised.  

Given the nature of the Prosecution case, the date range of 13 days sufficiently closely specified the date range for the crimes alleged.  Consequently, this sub-ground of appeal in relation to the events at Gitwa Hill is rejected. 

In relation to the ninth and tenth ground of appeal, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred, in fact, in relying on the testimonies of witnesses CGN and CDY to find that he went to Gitwa Hill on 
23 and 24 April 1994.  In relation to Witness CGN, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber was able to reasonably establish the date of the events by examining the evidence as a whole.  Thus, the Trial Chamber reasonably concluded that Witness CGN was referring to events taking place on 24 April 1994. 

The Appeals Chamber further finds that the Trial Chamber was entitled to find that the testimony of another witness, Witness CGV, supported the conclusion that Witness CGN had sufficient prior knowledge of the Appellant to identify him at Gitwa Hill on 24 April 1994. 

In relation to Witness CGY, the Appellant submits that while the witness testified that he saw the Appellant at Gitwa Hill on 23 April 1994, he apparently contradicted Witness CGN, belatedly demonstrated that it was not possible to move to that place at that time.  

The Appeals Chamber notes that while travelling between two locations can be regarded as impossible by one witness; it can be reasonably assessed as possible by another witness.  Also the 
Trial Chamber found that Witness CGN moved at night and that the vantage point from which Witness CGY observed the Appellant was on the same side of the road as Gitwa Hill, therefore, limiting the risk that Witness CGY would encounter roadblocks.  The Appellant could not demonstrate any other alleged contradiction in Witness CGY's testimony that rendered the Trial Chamber's finding that he saw the Appellant at Gitwa Hill on 23 April 1994 unreasonable.  

Consequently, the ninth and tenth grounds of appeal are rejected.  

In relation to the eleventh ground of appeal on the killing of Mr. Nors at Gaseke roadblock, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber based its findings on his alleged visit to the Gaseke roadblock in late May 1994 on the uncorroborated testimony of Witness CJC, which was inconsistent with other evidence and incorrect as to dates.  In particular, the Appellant argues that the Trial Chamber erroneously accepted Witness CJC's evidence that the Appellant came to Gaseke roadblock on 20 May 1994 and that Mr. Nors was murdered at the roadblock shortly thereafter, which is contradictory to the 
Trial Chamber's acceptance of the log book of Witness DB, which places the murder of Mr. Nors on 
26 May 1994. 

The Appeal Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber's findings, that Mr. Nors was killed shortly after the Appellant's visit, was based only on weak and unverifiable hearsay evidence, hearsay it is not perceived inadmissible.  It is well-established that a Trial Chamber must be cautious in considering such evidence.  Hence the Appeals Chamber finds by majority, Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen dissenting, that the Trial Chamber failed to adhere to this principle and that no reasonable trier of fact could have reached the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that Mr. Nors was killed shortly after the Appellant's visit on or about 20 May 1994.  

Consequently, the Appellant's eleventh ground of appeal is granted.  Thus, the other grounds of appeal relating to the killing of Mr. Nors at Gaseke roadblock were rendered moot. 

The Appeals Chamber notes in this context that the Prosecution made ambiguous submissions during closing arguments at trial, on the basis of which the Appeals Chamber might have come to the conclusion that the Prosecution had abandoned its case in relation to the killing of Mr. Nors.  This conclusion is further addressed in the Appeals judgement and explicitly supported by 
Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen in his separate opinion.  

It must be stressed, however, that by far the main crime in this case was a genocide committed at Gitwa Hill.  In addition, the Trial Chamber was convinced that at Gitwa Hill the Appellant committed acts constituting extermination by distribution -- by distributing weapons, transporting attackers and speaking words of encouragement and, alternatively, that he instigated and aided and abetted extermination. 

The Appeals Chamber finds, by majority, Judge Mehmet Güney dissenting, that this Trial Chamber did not convict the Appellant in the alternative.  Rather, the Trial Chamber was seeking to provide a further characterisation of the Appellant's criminal conduct.  The Trial Chamber did not err in emphasising that a full characterisation of the Appellant's conduct had to refer cumulatively to these modes of liability, while, in general, a Trial Chamber has to identify unambiguously the modes of liability for which an accused is convicted.  The Appeals Chamber concludes, by a majority, Judge Mehmet Güney dissenting, that the Trial Chamber only used wrong terminology. 

In relation to sentencing, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erroneously concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.  He contends that the fact that he was well-known and influential in the region where the crimes were committed and the fact that he held an official position in the interim government do not constitute two separate aggravating circumstances but expresses the same idea since his position in the interim government explains why he had become a more well-known figure than the other workers of the public administration in Kibuye préfecture. 

The Appeals Chamber does not agree.  While it's arguable that the influence of the Appellant at the local level also derived to some extent from his position in the interim government.  The important element in the first aggravating circumstance is the abuse of trust.  This differs from the second aggravating circumstances in which the Trial Chamber considered the fact that instead of promoting peace and reconciliation, as would be the duty of a minister, the Appellant supported and advocated a policy of genocide. 

The Appellant also submits that this Trial Chamber erred in considering as an aggravating circumstance that he influenced and encouraged others to commit crimes because this influence and encouragement already constituted elements of the crimes for which he was convicted.  

The Appeals Chambers recalls that the Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant for instigating and aiding and abetting genocide at Gitwa Hill, as well as for committing, instigating and aiding and abetting extermination at Gitwa Hill.  These convictions were based on the factual finding that the Appellant transported assailants to the hill, distributed weapons there and encouraged the killing of Tutsi. 

The Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber could not also refer to the same factual findings as aggravating circumstances.  

Accordingly, the Trial Chamber erred in finding that the fact that the Appellant actively influenced others to commit crimes by distributing machetes and money constituted an aggravating circumstance.  However, the Trial Chamber correctly recalled that the sentence had to be the first and foremost commensurate to the gravity of the offence, and that the Appellant had been convicted for the most serious crimes.  In this context, the Appeals Chamber notes that there is only one genocide that was committed in Rwanda in 1994, resulting in the killing of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi. 

The Appeals Chamber recalls that it has recently held, of course, in another context, namely, in the Karemera et al, case, that genocide was committed in Rwanda during that time, and that it is a fact of common knowledge although the Prosecution still has to prove the conduct and mental state of an accused to establish criminal liability for genocide. 

In sentencing, all acts in furtherance of this one genocide and attributable to an accused have to be taken into account and the Appellant's individual criminal responsibility has to be measured according to his own contribution to this crime of crimes.  Thus, the Trial Chamber did not err in considering as an aggravating factor that the Appellant encouraged the killing of Tutsi women who were married to Hutu men at Nyirabahanga bridge.  

For the foregoing reasons and those set out in more detail in the Appeal judgement, the Appeals Chamber arrived at the following disposition.  I will now read out the disposition. 

Mr. Ndindabahizi, please rise.  

The Appeals Chamber, pursuant to Article 24 of the Statute and Rule 118 of the Rules, noting the written submissions of the parties and their oral arguments presented at the hearing on the 
6th July 2006, sitting in open session, vacates the Appellant's conviction for genocide under count 1 in relation to the events at Gaseke roadblock; vacates the Appellant's conviction for murder under Count 3; affirms the Appellant's conviction for genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity under Counts 1 and 2, in relation to the events at Gitwa Hill, pursuant to Article 6 (1) of the Statute; dismisses the appeal in all other respects; affirms unanimously the sentence imposed by the Trial Chamber subject to credit being given under Rule 101(D) and Rule 107 of the rules for the period in which Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was deprived of his liberty for the purposes of this case, that is, from 
12th July 2001; rules that this judgement shall be enforced immediately pursuant to Rule 119 of the rules and orders in accordance with Rule 103 (B) and 107 of the Rules that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is to remain in the custody of the Tribunal pending his transfer to the state in which his sentence will be served.  

Done in English and French, the English text being authoritative.
