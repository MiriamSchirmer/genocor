MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Good afternoon. The Court is in session.  

Defence, you have the floor for cross-examination.  

Madam Witness, you are still under the - Mr. Witness, you are still under the obligation to tell the truth, and the headset will now be checked to make sure that the communication is efficient.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS: 
	Thank you.  Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Defence, please.
THE WITNESS:
I am sorry, Mr. President, I didn't hear the beginning of what you said.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	So you will now be asked questions by Defence, Mr. Witness, in cross-examination.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	I am Ndindabahizi's counsel.  I am going to ask you a few questions, not too many, on your testimony. I would like you to ask -- answer your questions as briefly and as precisely as possible.  

Let's begin with the multiparty era in Rwanda. That was the beginning of your testimony yesterday.  You stated that from a given point in time, political parties were authorised and they were able to operate on the territory Rwanda; is that correct, and what time exactly was that?
A.	Do you remember the Boule conference in France which enabled multipartyism to start?  So I believe in Rwanda from 1991, that is when it started.  I am not sure exactly, but I think it was in 1991 that multipartyism started.
Q.	Thank you.  And can you tell which parties emerged from this Rwandan political class which this thus liberated?
A.	Thank you.  Apart from the MRND which was already in place, there was the MDR, the PSD.  There was the PL, PDC, PDI.  There was also the DPR.  In fact, there were several parties.  There were many parties.  PSD also was included.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, are we in a public, open session or are we in closed session?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We are, are we not, Registry, in an open session?  The question arises now when you want to go into the closed session.  Registry --
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.  I have some questions of a general nature to put to the witness, but I am also concerned about the safety and the need to preserve the identity of our witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Just for the planning, do you have some questions which could be posed in a public session to start with before moving into a closed session?
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I have some questions of a general nature, but I would at least want to mention the name of the party to which the witness belonged.  I wonder whether this would be of any problem if I were to ask him the party to which he belonged.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the question my learned friend proposes to ask may not, on its own, be a problem but, when considered in the context of this gentleman's testimony, will reveal the identity, and I think the appropriate thing is to go into camera.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	It depends a little bit on the -- on the question to be posed.  Can we hear the question first?  And we agree -- I mean, both parties are now actively searching not to divulge the identity of the witness, so that is something we are very eager to avoid, Mr. Witness.  We are looking -- we are very careful now. Now, let me first hear the question.  And Mr. Witness, you do not have to answer this question.  We just want to hear the question, and we will then assess whether we can continue with that question or whether we go into closed.  And at some stage, we will obviously have to go into closed.  The only issue now is the timing.  

Yes, please, the question, please.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Witness, you said yesterday that the PSD was a moderate party.  Can it also be referred to as an opposition party, in opposition to the president and the MRND party?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That can be answered.
THE WITNESS: 
	I believe it's true, that -
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said that it's true that it was in opposition to the MRND.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	You also said that the PSD was a party whose aim was to promote social progress.  Can you please explain to us what you intend to mean by the term social welfare, social promotion?
A.	I rather said that the PSD was a moderate party whose objective was social welfare, that's what I said.  I didn't say social progress, I said social well being.  

Now, in that context, with that term I mean that the PSD -- first of all, the MRND as it was, and had limited itself to some parts of the country where there were tendencies in various parts, depending on  who the party official was or who the president was.  The PSD in its party said that any Rwandan citizen, any Rwandan national, should enjoy social development and should be able to enjoy democratic rights.  So the PSD had as an objective the fact that any Rwandan enjoy his or her social welfare without any restriction from any side whatsoever, because the MRND was biased.  That's what I can say.
Q.	Did all the members of this party adhere to that generous ideology?
A.	Yes.  The members all shared the same objective, because before they joined the party there was an ideology which was already prepared, and each member needed to read beforehand the text that governs the party.  He had to adhere to those ideologies, and then he would join.  If he does not agree, he wouldn't join.
Q.	Thank you.  And as you have said, this party was opposed to any kind of discrimination?
A.	Yes.  What I said is that that happened before the 6th of April 1994, because subsequent to that date every changed.
Q.	On the 6th of April specifically, was -- did Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, as a member of the PSD party, share the ideologies you've just expressed and explained?
A.	Yes, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a member of the party, the PSD.  He was living in Kigali.  He was living in Kibuye, and he would regularly attend meetings, but most often he was rather more in Kigali than in Kibuye.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Mr. President, could we ask for more of a pause between the question and answer between counsel and the witness? 
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	In 1994, was there any other parties in opposition to the MRND, apart from the PSD? 
A.	There was the PSD, there was PL, there was the DPR.  All these parties were opposed.  And then the MDR in the beginning before -- it was also opposed before there was some forums which were created within parties against the MRND.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a point of order here.  When both counsel and the witness are talking the same language, it is very tempting to enter into a dialogue immediately, in other words, not allowing for translation; but both interlocutors must remember to pause for about four seconds so that we will get the rest of the sentence before you start.  So if you will both observe this.  

And Defence counsel, this seems to have gone very well so far, but you will know when you are entering areas where we have to close.
MR. BESNIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will be on the lookout.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Was the PSD party well-spread out throughout the territory of Rwanda, or was it better represented in certain préfectures?
A.	The PSD was represented everywhere.  Obviously since it was founded in such and such a préfecture, there would be more members there in that préfecture rather than elsewhere, but the PSD was well represented throughout the country, yes.
Q.	Can you remind us in which préfecture the PSD was founded?
A.	The first members of the PSD were living in Kigali, and there was Nzamurambaho, Frederic, who was a native of Gikongoro; Félicien Gatabazi was living in Kigali but was a native of Butare; Ngango, Félicien, was first vice-president, was living in Kigali but was a native of Kibungo.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The names have been mentioned and quickly, now.  So, the first name was?  Just take it a little bit more slowly, even if we went through it yesterday.  You said that Frederic came from?
THE WITNESS: 
	Of Gikongoro, he was a native of Gikongoro.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	And the second person you mentioned was?  
THE WITNESS: 
	I mentioned Félicien Gatabazi from Butare.  Ngango was from Kibungo also, yes, Kibungo.  And then Gafaranga (phonetic) -- may I continue?  From Gitarama.  That was -- those were some of the members of the founding -- founding members of the PSD at national level, but they came from different préfectures.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Yes, but you didn't quite answer my question.  I am sorry, Mr. Witness, I wanted to know in which préfecture the party was the best represented just before the month of April 1994.
A.	Yes, thank you.  Everywhere in the préfectures PSD existed.  There had been elections for members of parliament throughout who were supposed to represent the PSD in the national assembly, but one can say that Butare, which even today hoists the PSD flag, was more represented than other préfectures.
Q.	And in Kibuye, what was the situation?  Would you say that there was a party which was very well represented or a party which had few members in relation to the average numbers in Rwanda?
A.	The PSD was well represented.
Q.	You spoke about the elections to the national assembly.  Can you tell us whether all parties which were born of the multiparty era, all those you have mentioned a moment ago, were indeed represented at the national assembly of Rwanda before April 1994?
A.	Yes, following multipartyism, all the parties were represented, but the balance wasn't equally.  This depended on the numbers of the members.
Q.	Can you please remind us when this legislature that you referred to was in effect?  When were the elections that took place for appointing members of parliament to the national assembly in Rwanda?
A.	The elections took place in 1993, but the specific date I do not recall.
Q.	The year will be sufficient.  And when was that office to expire?
A.	The transition was to last - I'm sorry, I do not know.
Q.	If you do not know, that is okay, Mr. Witness.  It's not too much of a problem.  

Very well, we have spoken a lot about the PSD.  Let's now move on to the other parties.  Would you say that some of the other parties born of the multiparty system were extremist parties?
A.	I was in the PSD.  I was dealing mostly with my own party, and I wasn't really interested in going to see whether the other parties were extremist or not.  I do beg your pardon.
Q.	No.  But Mr. Witness, as a citizen who is participating in the political life of the country and as a politician, you should have some observations, some point of view on the political nature of the other political parties, wouldn't you say?
A.	In the beginning, the political parties, the opposition parties, the parties in opposition to the MRND, were unanimous.  To start with, there was the MDR, which split into two.  There was the power wing and the moderate wing.  After that there was the PL, and that same thing happened to that party.  

Now, PSD also was later seen to divide or split up.  As for the other parties, PSR and the other smaller parties, that wasn't so clear.  But there were also some parties which didn't exist in our prefecture, so I wouldn't know what their behaviour or conduct was.
Q.	Let's go about this step by step.  I believe I understood from your testimony yesterday that the PSD before April 1994 didn't split into power wings; is that correct?
A.	Yes, you're quite right.  Yes, but apparently -- that was the apparent situation. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, going back to the other political parties, do you know what happened to the most influential, as it was, of these opposition parties immediately after the 6th of April 1994?
A.	Which parties are speaking about?
Q.	I am speaking about political parties, opposition political parties, for instance, the PSD.
A.	That I know about.
Q.	What happened to them?
A.	It happened that there was a matter of identifying who had killed the president.  Others fled; some people remained behind.
Q.	As for the people who were killed, they didn't only belong to the moderate parties, did they?  They also belonged to the government in place.  For instance, the prime minister of Rwanda, she was also assassinated, wasn't she?
A.	Yes, she also belonged to a moderate party.  She was in the MDR.  MDR was not - was moderate. It wasn't - it didn't have a power wing.
Q.	There were other people belonging to the Habyarimana government who were killed on the morning of the 6th or 7th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, mention was made of that, but they were not all killed.
Q.	Some of the victims were Hutu, were they not?  Would you say that an atmosphere of terror existed on that day and days that followed in Rwanda?
A.	It is not only on that day, it was the case for a long duration of time.  It was not only in Kigali, it went on also in the préfectures.  It wasn't only limited to Kigali.  Terror reigned for at least two or three months.
Q.	Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know when the interim government was formed after the death of President Habyarimana, what day?
A.	I know that it was in April, but he knows it better because he was part of it.
Q.	I am asking you the question.
A.	All I know is that it was in April.  I wasn't in the government.  I had fled, so I did not know what was happening.
Q.	Very well.  So I believe that you may not know this, but can you confirm it -- you may not know the circumstances under which the interim government was formed.
A.	I wasn't there, but I know that it was Kambanda who formed the government, but I could not tell you why it was formed, what were the circumstances.  But in my view, I believe it's clear because what the government did subsequently was clearly seen.
Q.	The question, rather, is strictly on the technical formation of the government, and I want to know whether you have any information.
A.	I do not have any concerning the formation or the calling together of these ministers to form the government.  I don't know.
Q.	Do you know what parties were represented within that interim government?
A.	I know that there was the MRND, there was the PSD, there was the PL.  I think that's it.  I don't know whether there were any others, but the major parties that I know were those.  There could have been others that I was not aware of.  But the RPF was not there, the DP was not there, the PDC was not included, so there were parties which were not included in the government.
Q.	In your opinion as a political observer, as a citizen, why was it necessary to bring together several parties in order to form the interim government, whereas it was unimaginable that a government of national unity be formed surrounding only those involved in the MRND?
A.	Could you please repeat your question?
Q.	We are in April 1994; the president has just been assassinated.  The first reflex which will come to one's mind is to constitute a strong government around the only political party which was strong at the time, at least, the party which represented the interests of the Rwandan people, the MRND.  Why was that not done, and why did those who formed the government ask other parties to associate themselves with that government?
A.	Thank you.  The MRND -- which was still strong at that point in time because there were opposition parties which were counter-balancing, the major leaders had already been assassinated -- the MRND went back to its older form, and then, as I have said, there were factions in the parties.  There power wings in the MDR, in the MRND.  Those who left those parties joined the MRND again, and this happened in several of the parties and --
Q.	Do you think that the interim government was only made up of ministers of the power tendency or with power leanings?
A.	Well, the fact that there were Tutsis who were welcomed and a person who was in the government and who was able to lead, I don't know how -- that government could not be if it was excluding certain individuals whereas these people were for the formation of the government.
Q.	You do really believe that this government was able to have all of the powers it should have been able to draw from the constitution, more specifically with respect to security?
A.	When the government was formed initially it was in Kigali, then it went to Gisenyi, then it was -- the government was in flight.  But to say that they were actually able to wield all of the power that the constitution entitled it to, the time in which it governed was such a short period of time, nevertheless it was able to accomplish what it sought to do, sought out to do.  For example, on the 6th of April the president died.  A few days later the government was formed, and the killings did not cease.  The MRND had soldiers, militia from the MRND, and they should have wielded their power over the people.  If the people had already started to kill their brothers, the soldiers that were everywhere in the country -- I mean, one word from the head of government or from the prime minister could have stopped the situation, and if they did not do so, then it is the government's fault.
Q.	Witness, do you believe that the high-ranking officers in the army had any influence on the government, Rwandan government, between April and July 1994?
A.	That's what I was saying, that's what I meant.  The government had already been established, and there was a minister of defence whose job was to supervise the soldiers if they went above the government.  If I had been in the government, I would have stepped down and I would have left the soldiers to work alone.  If I was not allowed to have any power on them, I would have resigned.
Q.	Yes, but that's not the question, Witness.  I am not asking what you would have done, but I am asking about the events that have already taken place.  I am asking you, would it be possible that the soldiers -- that the officers took decisions without referring to the government or to the minister of defence, whether that would be a classic case of rebellion?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I object to this line of questioning.  You are either asking the witness to speculate on what he has no direct knowledge about, or you are asking for his opinion.  You can't have your cake and eat it.  You asked for his opinion; he gave you his opinion.  You are now asking him to speculate. He wasn't part of the government.  I object to that line of questioning.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, this is cross-examination.  When -- he spoke at length yesterday of the interim government, and I believe that he had information on that subject.  In any case, I would like to add that this was my last question on this matter.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The question is allowed.
MR. BESNIER:
Mr. President, I think -- I believe that the witness already answered that question.  He said that if that there were the case, that that would be a rebellion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, at least we got the answer now.  It didn't come through in the first version.  Are you moving on to a different area now?
MR. BESNIER:
I was going to move on to something else, Mr. President, but if you would like to put a question to the witness, then of course I shall pause and allow you to put your question to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have just been following the line of questioning, and at a certain point I think we have to close the session, and I wonder whether this will be a convenient moment in view of the issues you are about to get into now.
MR. BESNIER:
No, Mr. President.  I will be moving on to another line of questioning, but I believe that we can still remain in open session.

MR. PRESIDENT:  
All right, watch it very carefully.  

Mr. Witness, we are in an open session, as you know, so be careful with your answers.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	Very well, Witness, let us now speak of the 6th and 7th of April 1997 (sic) and what you stated yesterday.  You said that men and women involved in politics, especially those who were members of opposition parties, and specifically those who were members of the PSD, could be divided in a schematic form in three groups.  There is the category of those who were killed during the first few days and the days that followed; secondly, there are those who fled, those who went into hiding; and finally, there are those who participated in the government.  Have I summarised this properly?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  In your opinion, those who were killed on that day, they really didn't have much choice, did they?
A.	Could you rephrase - could you clarify your question?
Q.	The persons who were killed, they had no choice, did they?  It's because they were - they did not have the opportunity to flee, isn't that the reason why they died?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Please, ambiguous, totally ambiguous.  Can my learned friend rephrase that question, specify which day and which people he is referring to.  It's a very ambiguous question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That objection is sustained.  The question is too general, and it is difficult to answer it in a precise way when it is so generally formulated.  Please reformulate it.
MR. BESNIER:
Very well.
BY MR. BESNIER:
Q.	The persons who fled, those who are part of the second category, in your opinion did they do this as a political gesture to show - were they taking a political stand to show that they were against what was happening in Rwanda, or did they proceed in this manner because they were trying to save their lives?
A.	They were trying to seek refuge.  They could either go to the RPF or they could flee to another country, to Zaire, to the Congo; or they could join the Rwandan army, because those that went over to the Rwandan army did not die.  If they joined the RPF, it is because they were sure that they would not be killed there.  They would not be killed by soldiers or the Interahamwe, because it was alleged that there was a list saying who was -- specifying who was supposed to be killed.  There was a list and people knew.  You would go Ngango's house because there was a list, and then in the meantime you would be going to the houses of the other persons whose names appeared on the list.  It wasn't just by chance that these killings took place, especially as far as important politicians are concerned.  

I specified -- I gave you the example of the PSD, and I mentioned the names of Hutus.  I did not mention the names of the Tutsi because they were classified by ethnic group.   I am speaking here of these persons' beliefs or their ideology, the fact that they were against the MRND.  And if you had a Hutu person who was a member of the PSD and who is against the MRND, in another words, I mean, why would they die?  Why would they be killed?
Q.	In other words, and then to summarise -- sum up what you've just said, those who fled did so because they were in danger and they could be killed?
A.	Yes, because their names were on the list.
Q.	Thank you.  Let us now move on to the third category of persons, those who participated in the interim government.  Do you really believe that they had a choice to participate in this government?
A.	Once again, Counsel, I will tell you that I was not a member of the government.  I was not a part of that government.  I know it was established.  I do not know how these persons became a member of the government, and I cannot answer your question.
Q.	Yes.  So you were not present at the meeting of the 8th of April 1994 at the ministry of defence when the government was formed, is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Therefore, you know nothing about what happened during the meeting when the government was formed.  You don't know if people were threatened; you do not know if any pressure was brought about against them.
A.	I did not go to the government -- to this meeting because I was not invited to attend this meeting.
Q.	Perfect.  Very well, let us now move to a meeting that was held in Kibuye at the beginning of May 1994.  Do you remember speaking of this meeting yesterday?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Do you think it would be possible to speak of this meeting in general terms and that your identity will not be revealed?
A.	I think it would be okay.
Q.	I am referring to the transcript from yesterday, and this is what you said, Witness.  You said the main purpose of the meeting was pacification, and pacification was to stop the killings, stop the massacres.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that was the purpose of the meeting.  That is what the prime minister stated.
Q.	And then a little bit - sometime after this you added that during the meeting, you realised that there were persons, and I'm quoting, "who had good intentions and others who did not want people to be saved."  Is that correct?  Is that what you said?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	In what category would you place Mr. Ndindabahizi when he attended that meeting?
A.	Well, I would have been able to put him in one group or another if he had spoken, but as -- you will recall that I did not mention what he said.  I could not say where exact - I could not say in what position he was as I did not hear him speak and state his position.
Q.	Could you give us the names of the ministers or who attended this meeting, because I believe that I did not take proper notes.
A.	There was Agnes. I will spell the last name, N-T-A-M-A-B-Y-A-L-I-R-O, Ntamabyaliro.  Agnes,
 A-G-N-E-S for the first name, Agnes.  There was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, N-D-I-N-D-I-B-A-H-A-Z-I (sic), Ndindabahizi.  There was Éliezer Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A, Niyitegeka.
Q.	Is that it?
A.	Those are the names I mentioned.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Let us now speak of the conversation that you alleged that you had with Ndindabahizi in during 1994.  I am not going to say where the conversation took place.  I think that we might deal with that subsequently.  Before the conversation took place, didn't the bourgmestre of your commune already warn you?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this was something that took place in closed session yesterday, and I think that we will easily get into matters where the questions and answers will be so intertwined that it may become a little bit risky.  And in view of the decision we took about that particular meeting yesterday, I think this is the time to close the session.  It's logical.  It's just the same regime we operated under last time we discussed this issue.  

So we have tried to keep this session open as far as possible, because we always prefer to keep transparency and openness, but when it comes to protecting the identity of the witness, we have also to be careful, and now we have reached a point where I am afraid we have to make the ruling that the public is kindly asked to leave the public gallery, and we will continue then in a closed session. 

Could we indicate approximately, Defence counsel, how much time you envisage for the rest of your cross-examination so that the public would know when to come back again, approximately?
 MR. BESNIER:
It's difficult, Mr. President.  I have taken 45 minutes so far, and I believe that I will only need a further 30 minutes to complete my cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's noted, and there will be possibly a re-examination.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 12 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 11 by Petrus Chijarira)


BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you gave a statement to investigators from the ICTR in October 2000?  Do you recall doing that?
A.	Yes, I remember that.  I remember that I made a statement.
Q.	Would I also be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that on the 30th of April 1997 you testified as Witness M for mother in the trial against Clement, Dr Clement Kayishema at this Tribunal?
A.	Yes, I remember that also.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that on the 6th of April, on or about the 6th or 7th of April, you and other members of your family became aware of the death of the Rwandan president?
A.	It was the 6th, not the 4th.
Q.	That's correct.  And would I also be correct in saying that following the news of the president's death, you and other members of your family left your home to seek refuge elsewhere in Kibuye préfecture?
A.	Yes, that's correct; we went to seek refuge elsewhere.
Q.	Did there come a time, Mr. Witness, during the month of April 1994, when you and other members of your family sought refuge at the location known as the Kibuye stadium or the Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye?
A.	Yes, that's where we were.
Q.	Do you recall what date you arrived at the Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye with your family?
A.	It should have been the 13th of April 1994.
Q.	And did you and other members of your family remain at Gatwaro stadium throughout the month of April or did there come a time when you left that location?
A.	My two children and my wife went to ************ home on that day, but for the rest of the refugees, including myself, we remained at the stadium.
Q.	And did there come a time, Mr. Witness, when the stadium was attacked and, if so, can you help me with the date, please?
A.	The stadium was attacked on the 18th.
Q.	And can you tell the Court how you survived the attack at the stadium on the 18th, as you put it?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the circumstances under which I survived were the following:  It was at about 1 p.m.  the attackers came, they started throwing grenades into the stadium, they shot at the stadium.  I tried to hide in a latrine in the lower part of the stadium.  I remained there until about 6 p.m.  It was at that time that I was able to leave to go to the forest.  And when I reached in front of the stadium, I met a policeman whom I knew.  I had met him at ********** house.  I went towards him.  I thought that******* had sent him to come and fetch me, and I asked him to take me back to *****home.  He agreed to do so, and that's how I survived the killings.  Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness is speaking rather fast.  We would be grateful if you were to ask him to slow down.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you could speak a little bit more slowly, Mr. Witness, that would assist the interpreters.
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how long did the attack last at the stadium in Kibuye?
A.	The attack ended at about 5:40, and in the 20 minutes that followed, I left the stadium.
Q.	And you testified earlier the attack started about one o'clock in the afternoon, did you not?
A.	That is correct.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Now, Your Honour, I am really in your hands as to how to proceed with this witness.  There is very little that I can build up -- upon without having -- I don't want to emphasise the situation, so that I don't draw further attention to it, but there is a problem in that regard. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Having listened to the way this witness responds to the questions, it seems to me that it's a risky course of action to remain in open session.  

So, unfortunately to the public, I think we have to close because of the protection of the witness, because we wanted to stay in open, but it's developing in a way which could be harmful.  So let's now move again into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 35 to 66] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
