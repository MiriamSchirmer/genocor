P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  This is an informal status conference.  You have received a letter from the registry mentioning that the Renzaho trial will start on Monday the 8th of January before Trial Chamber I.  
A new memo of today from the President to the Court Management Section has transferred the pre-trial proceedings in this case from Trial Chamber II to Trial Chamber I.  This means that, for instance, the pending motion concerning witness protection is from now on pending before Trial Chamber I.  

The composition of the Bench on the 8th of January is not official.  We will come back to that after having clarified some administrative issues.  

The duration of the trial is not mentioned in the memo you received, but let me simply say that the intention is that we will hear the entire Prosecution case in one segment.  We will most likely start with a full-day week from the 8th to the 12th of January, and then as it becomes more crowded in the courtrooms, move over to half days.  The details will be communicated later.  

This is the scenario and the purpose of this informal status conference is to ensure that there are no unexpected problems.  Maybe I could ask the parties to place themselves on record since it's the first time we meet in this case.  

Prosecution? 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Counsel's name is Moses.  I appear together with my friend, Ms. Melluish who's an assistant trial attorney, and Mr. Mangan who is our case manager.  Thank you, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, shall we all speak slowly, and now we need the spelling of the two last names, please.  
MR. MOSES:
Moses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That the was the first name.
MR. MOSES:
All right, okay, Melluish is M-E-L-L-U-I-S-H.  And our case manager, Mr. Mangan is -- M for Mike, -A-N for November G-A-N for November 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Defence, please? 
MR. CANTIER:
Good day, sir, I'm François Cantier, lead counsel and my co-counsel is Barnabé Nekuie, who is also here and the legal assistant is here, Audrey Sabac. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I ask you too, kindly, to spell the names you referred to:  Cantier we know well, C-A-N-T-I-E-R.  But the other names please, so that we have them on record from now on. 
MR. CANTIER:
Very well.  My co-counsel, Barnabé, first name, B-A-R-N-A-B-É, Nekuie is N-E-K-U-I-E, Nekuie.  Now, with respect to the legal assistant, Ms. Audrey Sabac, it's S-A-B-A-C.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The trick is to speak slowly and, in particular, when we are reading and when we are spelling.  

I understand that Mr. Renzaho is present and we say good afternoon to you as well.  

Now, the various questions to be addressed -- and may I suggest the following method:  This is a status conference but what we are actually doing now is to ensure that the pre-trial conference will be more or less superfluous.  So if we now all have Rule 73 bis in front of us we could simply follow the structure in that provision and go point by point.  Would that be agreeable to both parties?  Rule 73 bis, please.  

If that is agreeable, let me say that I am aware that there has been correspondence between the parties by email and possibly by other means, but since this is the status conference and since it's the first time these matters are raised in court, there may be a need for repetition.  With other words, we will go point by point, even if some of these matters have been sorted out informally through correspondence between the parties.  

Why don't we begin with 73 bis (B)(i) a pre-trial brief?  Mr. Moses, please place on record, what is the status of the pre-trial brief?  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The Prosecutor's pre-trial brief was filed on the 31st of October 2005.  When we filed that -- and bearing in mind the time delay that we expected prior to trial -- we indicated at the commencement of the pre-trial brief, that it was possibly subject to some form of addendum being filed.  

Now, I can indicate in respect of the substance of the pre-trial brief, we do not intend to file any -- or vary that pre-trial brief which sets out the case.  In respect, however, to the witness summaries which is an annex to the pre-trial brief, we have indicated to our friends by the disclosure of a proposed witness list that there -- and by disclosure, prior to the 60 days in terms of Rule 66 disclosure -- that there are some witnesses that we -- who are on that list and we no longer intend to call, and that there are other witnesses who were not on the list that we do intend to call.  

What I was going to advise the Court, subject to anything Your Honour or my friend wishes to say, is that we intend to file by next Friday the 15th of December, a revised summary of witnesses with the summary of their intended evidence, the estimated time that they will take to give their evidence-in-chief, and the paragraphs in which they intend to testify to.  As I said, I think there are perhaps three -- maybe four, at most, witnesses who will be included on that and three who will be taken from the list.  

I think that is the -- the other thing that, Your Honour, perhaps, if I could just raise at this stage is in relation to the issue of exhibits.  I'm pleased to advise Your Honour that -- I think all counsel involved in the trial have had discussions regarding the issue of exhibits and how we can proceed with the trial in the most efficient manner, and also so that we focus on the real issues and we don't get bogged down with arguments over admissibility when, in effect, all we are going to be arguing is the weight, which is something for Your Honours to decide.  

To that end, we have today an exhibit list -- and, in fact, we have printed out all the exhibits for my learned friend.  Whilst, of course, we aren't obliged to, necessarily under the rules, we are doing that for him to look at and we are hopeful that we can -- through our first witness -- introduce these as an agreed -- as an agreed bundle of documents, Your Honour.

It may be -- and I've indicated to my friend and it's up to him that there are other documents which are in our possession and in our evidence database that he has seen.  He may wish to add them to that dossier, if he so desires and it's purely a matter for him.  He may decide that technically, he doesn't want to.  But if he does, I've indicated that we won't object and we are hoping that approach will, as I say, speed matters up in terms of focussing Your Honour's attentions on the real issues that are involved this trial.  

So we do have this draft exhibit list today, which we will also provide to my learned friend.  We don't have copies of the photographs for him today, but we will get those to him as soon as we are able.  I think that perhaps explains the two issues which may be relevant to the pre-trial brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The pre-trial brief exists in both official languages, does it? 
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps my learned friends can -- I believe so, Your Honour. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so it's available both in English and French and that also goes for the summaries in the annex, is that so?  So there is no language problem in any part of the pre-trial brief, can I conclude that?  If no one raises a problem -- 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, a few comments.  First of all, you've heard him -- the pre-trial brief must have been here since -- more than a year now, but it is not updated fully.  So, that's my first comment, because there are some testimonies which will not be used.  And, if there are new witnesses, clearly with new testimonies which will be added on; that's my first comment.  

The second one:  With respect to the disclosures made, we've already discussed these matters with my colleague and there are a number which are on the list, but have not yet been translated into French.  And since that's the working language -- in other words, that's the working language of Mr. Renzaho, the Accused, these are not available yet in the French.  That's my second comment.  
And my colleague has told me that those translations will be available no later than next week.  In other words, on or before the 15th of December, and that would resolve the problem -- if, of course, they keep to their promise.  

Then, one last thing, Mr. President, as you've just been told, I have just received the list now of documents that the Prosecutor intends to use.  I cannot make any pronouncement with respect to this document because I haven't had the opportunity to look through the list.  But what I've been told is that most of these documents are in French.  Some of them are not in French.  And if these are easy documents -- easy to peruse, of course, that wouldn't be any problem.  But if they're more complex, I think it would be preferable that we receive them in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, could I have a copy of the exhibit list? 

Thank you for those remarks. 

Now, I have not heard anything which would suggest that the pre-trial brief is not available in both languages, nor have I heard anything that would indicate that the witness summaries aren't available in both languages, so that seems to be settled.  

Then, there will be a need to update the annex to the pre-trial brief.  Isn't that the point, Prosecution?  You will only be updating the annex with the summaries, not the body of the pre-trial brief? 
MR. MOSES:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  And that implies that the pre-trial brief, as such, will be unchanged even though it is true as mentioned by Defence counsel that there is some time since we first received it.  

The other issue raised by Defence counsel was the fact that some witnesses are -- or will be dropped.  Now, has Defence counsel been informed of which witnesses you now intend to drop so that there is no need for the Defence to prepare and investigate further in relation to those witnesses?  
MR. MOSES:
We have provided to the Defence a list of the witnesses we intend to call and the proposed date on which they may testify, Your Honour, subject to their availability.  That, I think, was sent by email and copied to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Defence, the point now is that you know which witnesses will be called from January on, that is the situation.  You know which have been deleted and you know which will be added? 
MR. CANTIER:
(Microphones overlapping) ... That's correct, we may do some subtraction and addition, so the list that will -- has been disclosed to us.  Now, based on that list, we believe that will be the final list -- that is, the list of witnesses who will be brought here by the Office of the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then, Defence counsel mentioned disclosures and that is something we will have to come to, but do we then agree that everything in connection with the pre-trial brief will be settled?  It is actually settled as regards the body of the text, and when it comes to the summary, that will be filed on the 
15th of December, how much translation will there be a need for in the annexes -- or, the annex of the pre-trial brief?  Are we talking about more than a page? 
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps a page, Your Honour, maybe as much as a page and a half, but I would imagine around a page.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask the Defence, we all know the capacities of the translation department -- and sometimes it may be difficult to get documents through -- may I just ask you, even if your preference is obviously French and even if the Accused's language is French, certainly, are Defence counsel operative in English?  I'm mentioning this just so that I know a bit which factual reality we are operating within because this is important for practical purposes.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I smile at your question, because let me -- I might reveal the fact that there are some shortcomings.  My understanding of English is say average, but to be sure about my work, I would prefer to work with French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is to be respected and that will be our preference.  But should the unlikely situation occur, for instance, that we have problems in getting one page through from the 15th of December to the 
8th of January, then you will probably survive if you have that one page in English.  If you say no, we will have to take extra measures now.  Maybe, the Prosecution could provide an in-house translation, for instance?  
MR. MOSES:
What I can say, Your Honour, is all it will be is a summary of the witnesses statement, which will have been given in French.  So it's not going to be new material that will be in English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, it is difficult for me to pre-empt.  It will be a matter of one document after another.  We will look at it case by case.  Of course, we won't raise any unnecessary difficulty on this matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You must speak more slowly.  Can I ask you to do that? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, please proceed.  Your point was that you will take this on a case-by-case basis, and that is absolutely understandable.  
MR. CANTIER:
Absolutely, and that we won't raise any unnecessary difficulty. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that remark.  

To conclude the pre-trial brief, the only possible problem is that little addition to the annex concerning translation, and since the Defence already has the statements of those witnesses in both languages or, at least, in French, it is my understanding that should there be a delay with the summaries, we will survive.  

Can we conclude on that note? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, of course, subject to what I have stated earlier; namely, that currently we have four testimonies that have not yet been translated.  Two of them are very important.  For instance, that of the first two witnesses who will be appearing.  I think, it's AG -- X, AX and XY.  We also have a summary statement by witness ACK, which has not yet been translated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, whenever we mention pseudonyms, we must slow down.  The first witness is which one?  What was that pseudonym? 
MR. CANTIER:
ALG10.  The second one, BUO1; the third, BUT3 and the fourth one XXY4.  

Now, on the problem of the declaration of intent, I'm referring to Witness ACK.  Now, there's one last problem with ALG18 -- and my colleagues of the Office of the Prosecutor are yet to receive a translation -- even in English, they don't have one, let alone in French, and that document cannot be read.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence now referred to four witnesses and we will now go into the issue of disclosure and translation as you have wanted to do for some time now.  I take it that the pre-trial brief is now settled.  

Can I ask you, Mr. Moses, what is the most updated order of witnesses appearance?  You kindly sent a list to the Trial Chamber previously and that list started with JM, KM -- 
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour, that is the initials of those who are going to lead the witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay -- 
MR. MOSES:
But I can indicate -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But let me put it differently, it started with NEUP.  
MR. MOSES:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is different from any of those four pseudonyms -- 
MR. MOSES:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That were now mentioned by Defence counsel, and I was given the impression that some of the problematic documents would be linked to witnesses that would appear early.  And I only see witness ALG as number three here.  So what is the situation?  
MR. MOSES:
You're quite correct, Your Honour.  If I can indicate, the first witness is the investigator.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that person called Rajesh?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Rajesh is spelt R-A-J-E-S-H; he's mentioned in an email. 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, that's his -- yes, and the next witness, Your Honour, is also an unprotected witness who is a ******************************************************************************** in Kigali.  At the moment, I think he's under the pseudonym BUX, but she will simply be producing some photographs, so neither of them are factual witnesses, if I can put it that way.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, but my list mentions DUF --
MR. MOSES:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- as number two.
MR. MOSES:
That's the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the ******************?  
MR. MOSES:
That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so NEUP is the investigator and DUF is ************** and they are unproblematic?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the first substantial witness is, indeed, as mentioned by Defence counsel, ALG? 
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And is it then true that we have disclosure or translation problems there? 
MR. MOSES:
I believe there are some 18 Rule 66 statements from that person.  One of those was a handwritten document written by the witness in Kinyarwanda.  It has been provided to the registry for translation.  And I understand that both in a previous occasion when this witness came to testify at the Tribunal and also recently, the language section has come to us and said:  "We are unable to translate this document into English or French because it is illegible."
MR. PRESIDENT:
A question here, in what Defence counsel said, reference was made first to ALG10, and then afterwards, it was translated in a different sentence that there was a translation problem in relation to ALG18.  Is it the same person? 
MR. MOSES:
It is -- I apologise, Your Honour, there are two -- there are two documents.  There's one ALG10, we are waiting for a translation into French.  It is one of, I believe, three outstanding translations.  There is also another document, ALG18, which is, we have been told, illegible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MOSES:
Now, we intend to disclose that document in Kinyarwanda, however, to the Defence on the 
15th of December, and they can use it as they will.  But we are unable, through registry, to get a translation of that document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is Witness ALG, is that one of the new witnesses? 
MR. MOSES:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it's an old witness, but for a long time there has been a lack of translation in relation to some of the statements of that witness? 
MR. MOSES:
It was a relatively new -- yes, it was a relatively new statement.  It was only taken, I believe, on the 
13th of June of this year.  In fact, Your Honour, it might of assistance, I've got a copy of the -- and, I believe if Your Honour looks at page 5 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. MOSES:
-- the second item down, you will see in the left-hand column witness statement of ALG, 13/06/06.  The English was disclosed on the 18th of October and we are waiting for the French translation of that particular document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do we place witness ALG early amongst the witnesses, if that witness has many documents that are untranslated?  Can he not be pushed back and we have the unproblematic witnesses first? 

MR. MOSES:
With respect, Your Honour, when you say he has many documents, if you look at the number of documents -- or pages 2, 3, 4 and 5, you will see that perhaps 95-plus or 98 per cent of his documents have been disclosed.  He is a witness, Your Honour, by virtue of the position that he held, who will assist, in our opinion, in providing an overall picture of the -- the Accused's position and the situation during the relevant period.  

So, for those reasons, Your Honour, we believe that it's important that he is a witness who is able to give his evidence at the beginning.  Can I say, Your Honour, also, that I think I wrote to the 
Trial Chamber indicating there were some 11 documents that needed to be translated into French about a week or two ago.  The current situation -- and we are asking for daily updates -- are that of those 11 there are now only three remaining that need to be translated into the working language of the Defence.  There are some, I think, 14 documents that need to be translated into English, but those -- there's only three which need to be translated into French, which is the -- as you -- as my friend points out -- is the language of the Defence.  

Can I say, Your Honour, that we are -- whilst the language section won't give us any 100 per cent undertakings, we are confident that we will get that document and we will be able to disclose it unredacted along with all the other unredacted documents in accordance with the order -- the witness protection order which, as Your Honour may be aware, was a rolling 21-day disclosure.  We, in fact, are going to give all disclosure.  We are not going to do it on a rolling basis.  We're going to give -- give it all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very important.  It is clear experience that this role in disclosure very often just causes problems.  The policy you are adopting now -- and I think this Chamber would have changed that order had it been necessary -- would be in a short case like this, full disclosure of all documents about 21 days before the trial starts.  Is that what you are going to do? 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, there is one witness who is the second-to-last witness, who we are still unsure whether we will call.  We are continuing to review.  And for reasons which I wouldn't want to go in open court, 
Your Honour, in respect of that particular witness -- and, that witness only, we are only wishing to wait to see how the trial proceeds as to whether or not we, in fact, call the witness.  And so for that reason we were wanting to hold back in respect of that person.  

The only other issue, if -- if we are talking about disclosure issues is in respect of Dr. Des Forges, who is listed -- I don't know if you want to come to that later. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, later.  
MR. MOSES:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about this illegible document, ALG18, what do you do with that?  That's not a translation problem.  That's a question of understanding the document.  Is that simply unsolvable? 
MR. MOSES:
We intend to provide to the Defence unredacted, with all the other statements on the 15th of December.  And if they are -- really, I don't know that we can take that much -- much further than providing it to the Defence in its entirety. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So, all disclosures will be made in an unredacted form by 15th December, except for one witness.  All witness statements will be made available in French and, in fact, there are only three lacking for the time being.  
MR. MOSES:
That's what I've been informed, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's good news.  That's good news, isn't it? 
MR. CANTIER:
Of course, that's a beautiful promise, Your Honour, we're insisting, really.  My colleague just said in order to go the importance that he attaches to Witness ALG.  We have difficulty with that witness, because ALG's penned statement have not been translated.  ALG18 also is illegible; it cannot be read.  We would like to obtain those documents based on the time frame set in the order of this Court.  And we also would want to have all other unredacted statements disclosed.  I'm insisting on this, 
Your Honour, because there was some statements disclosed redacted and the names were all blacked out.  Some of the documents are so redacted that they are of no use -- absolutely of no use. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what we are hearing now is that you will receive all unredacted statements except for one witness.  What is the pseudonym of that witness?  The one you have not decided whether to call?  
MR. MOSES:
BKX. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's number?  
MR. MOSES:
Second-to-last witness.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, well, we note your commitment and if we hadn't had it, we would have made an order.  So that is very appreciated.  

And with that, I think, Defence -- Defence?  I think that in view of the fact that there is not now a commitment to disclose everything by the 15th of December and that the Chamber has noted it and said that the Prosecution would be under an order if it had not done it voluntarily, I think your insistence has been listened to.  So it's not only a promise, it is going to become a reality.  

When it comes to the document which is illegible, that is a problem and I'm sure everyone will try to see whether there are other versions of that document, but if it is not, well then, that is simply a problem and then we can't use it and it's a non-issue.  

Is there more to be said about the matters we have discussed, so far? 
MR. CANTIER:
Your Honour, he's an important witness.  He has made several statements in connection with this trial and from what we've learnt; he has also made statements in regard to some other trials.  And I would want to us to have that document disclosed even if it is illegible so as to know whether we can use it in any manner whatsoever.  I have not seen that document, so I can't say any further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now referring to Witness ALG, and with other words, to document ALG18.  Have I understood this correctly?  
MR. CANTIER:
That is the case, you have understood correctly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this document ALG18, do you have a copy of it?  This illegible document?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, and we are intending to disclose it on the 15th of December.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  All right, nothing prevents you from partial disclosure earlier, of course, should you so wish?  
MR. MOSES:
Other than material which may identify the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but if the document is illegible -- 
MR. MOSES:
Translation say it's illegible, Your Honour, my Kinyarwanda is not much better than my French. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Haven't we now covered both disclosure and translation as well as the requirements listed in Rule 73 bis (iv) (a) to (d)?  That seems to follow from the documentation available.  Would you agree with us there, Defence, we have dealt with the pre-trial brief in Roman (i).  Are there any admissions, let me ask that question?  That is, little Roman (ii).  
MR. MOSES:
Those which there are, Your Honour, are included in the pre-trial brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good and then moving to Roman (iv) (a) to (d), by the 15th, all elements in those four letters will be there.  And I understand you have already estimated the length of time required for each witness; the points in the indictment on which each witness will testify, and a summary of the facts on which each witness will testify -- except for the four, and the pseudonym of each witness and from the 15th, Defence will have the names.  Do we agree that this is the situation? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Your Honour, just that in the brief that we filed in reply to the Prosecutor's motion regarding the transfer of detainees from Rwanda, in our brief we had sought disclosure of the court records of those witnesses -- witnesses who are either in detention or on trial.  For us, it's a very important matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are so fast, Maître Cantier, that you are jumping out of Roman (iv) into the next issue.  

Let us deal with your issue now.  I understand you then that you agree that everything within 73 bis (B) have been settled.  And now we will deal with the judicial documents in Rwanda which certainly represent a problem.  Where are we there, Prosecution? 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour, there are five witnesses who are either detained or provisionally released who are on the updated list.  We have in relation to witnesses ALG, UB and GLJ copies of -- 
MR PRESIDENT.
The last one was?
MR. MOSES:
GLJ, number 9 on the list, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
ALG is detained?  
MR. MOSES:
Provisionally released. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes? 

MR. MOSES:
All right, we have a large number of documents from the judicial files in relation to those three witnesses that will all be disclosed on the 15th of December.  

In respect of Witness BUO, we have a copy of a judgement involving that witness.  We have written to the Rwandan authorities asking for us to be able to inspect their judicial file, and they have agreed to that.  We had -- it is apparently a file -- because it involves a file involving many accused, several thousand documents, we are having someone go through that file and to take the documents which 
are -- relate to Witness BUO and we will disclose those when we receive them.  We expect that to be done within -- by the 20th of December.  

I don't know how many documents there will be.  As I say, we will disclose the judgement relating to this person, which we have in Kinyarwanda and we will disclose that on the 15th of December.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have now mentioned four pseudonyms, and the fifth?  
MR. MOSES:
The fifth is Witness AWE who is on the list at number 22.  Once again, we have written asking to see that person's judicial records and the Rwandan government has agreed.  The difficulty that arises in respect of that witness, Your Honour, is that it appears that his file cannot be located.  

I'm aware that this witness is also listed in another trial, and several months ago, a similar enquiry was made and a similar result -- namely, they simply don't appear to have been able to locate his judicial file.  It's not through the Rwandan government not being willing or us not being vigilant and not wanting to get hold of it, Your Honour, it's simply that at this stage, it has not been located.  So we don't have possession of any documents in relation to his judicial file.  Other than one statement which he gave himself in relation to the file which he had a copy of in his own possession which he's given to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's start with the first three:  ALG, UB and GLJ.  There, you said, that you had a large number of judicial documents that you are going to disclose on the 15th.  You do not know whether you have the complete files in relation to these three, but you have what you know of.  How many of these documents are -- or have to be translated into French? 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, most of those documents -- none of them are Rule 66 documents.  So, really once we disclose them, I -- I was certainly not of the opinion that it was our responsibility to -- to have them translated.  I don't -- some of them -- most of them tend to be statements made by other individuals relating to the witness, if you understand what I'm getting at, Your Honour.  They're not -- and so most of those are in Kinyarwanda.  They're not -- and we certainly haven't asked for them to be translated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But when we are in trial from the 8th of January, the Defence will wish to use some of these documents for impeachment purposes, and how do we ensure that the Court and the two parties understand what's going on?  And it's not easy for the Defence to select these documents based on the Accused's knowledge of Kinyarwanda.  Of course, he's fluent in that language, but the Defence would wish to have a rough idea so as to know which portions to focus on; that is the problem.  
We cannot possibly translate all judicial documents from Rwanda.  That is impossible and that has never been done.  The task in this trial, as in other trials, will be to ensure that we have translated the relevant portions of those documents that the parties are able to encircle and how do we do that?  
MR. MOSES:
Well, Your Honour, to be blunt I don't know if any of these documents are at all relevant.  And it's really only for the Defence to decide which, if any of them, fall within really -- they're really are potentially 
Rule 68 material.  But it's really for the Defence to say these are documents which we consider are important.  I don't know.  I'm going to disclose them all to them for them to decide which of them are relevant.  I don't know which of them -- if any, none of them may be relevant, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As of yet, you have no intention to use any of them.  You are just disclosing them? 
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, we have no intention to use them at all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you still have the problem, Defence, that you want to know what this is about.  And we are now back to the question you just raised.  How do you envisage to tackle this problem? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Your Honour, we would like to know -- well, for each of the witnesses who are in a different situation, some of them have already been tried, if I've understood this clearly.  Others are accused, not yet tried.  Now, I would like to see the documents which -- on which the Rwandan courts relied in making their decisions.  I hear some are on provisional release.  Under what circumstances, under what conditions?  Subject to what decisions?  That decision on provisional release was pronounced on what basis?  I would like to see those testimonies (unintelligible) against the said witness.  So that's what we want to know.  And there again, we haven't seen those documents and it's difficult for me to go any further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you just said was absolutely legitimate and understandable.  Now, it is clear that you will receive all those documents on the 15th of December.  The problem is that you need to understand them.  You have the Accused speaking Kinyarwanda.  How many investigators do you have in your team, one or two?  Do they both speak Kinyarwanda? 

MR. CANTIER:
Your Honour, for now, I had two investigators and later on, in the very near future, I'll just have one.  Yes, he understands Kinyarwanda -- that's in answer to your question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's helpful, because then, I think, what can assist you in this difficult situation is to ask the investigator and the Accused to read those Kinyarwanda documents and then during your consultations with the Accused and the investigators you will be able in a global way to sort out what you think is interesting for your purposes.  

And once you have identified either the documents -- or let me say, rather, the portions of the documents, because in relation to a witness who has been acquitted or convicted together with another 25 accused, you will most likely only be interested in the portions relating to that witness.  With other words, you will be able to narrow down what you need to have translated in consultation with the team.  And once you have made that identification, you can come to the registry and to the Chamber and say:  "We need this translated; we want this translated." 

Let me say that there is no absolute right to have all this translated.  One way of solving this is that you will have a working translation within the team, since you master the two languages.  And then if you want to use portions of the documents in the court -- and that you will wish to do in connection with your impeachment -- you will then read into the record through the Kinyarwanda interpreter the portions you think are relevant.  And in this way, we will be able to reduce the number of documents to be translated to a minimum and in that way, we can make this work, in spite of our common challenges.  What do you say? 
MR. CANTIER:
Your Honour, I understand the method you're suggesting.  I think it's a good one.  Just that -- and I say this quite sincerely, I am not as -- talking about the time that will be required to perform such a work, you heard there's a whole pile of documents that I have to receive or will be disclosed by the 
15th of December.  I'll be fully available but I'm not sure I'll be able to carry out that work -- and I'm thinking out aloud.  The first two witnesses, for instance, if I have to raise issues with them.  Say, in fact, of the two witnesses, it's only ALG who is still on trial.  We can try, but I can't be too specific as to the time that we'd require; namely, to get to what we want.  That is obtaining a translation for those portions that are relevant and which we intend to use.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what I hope will then be the method is that after the identification of the relevant portions within the team, you will have made, by your investigator, or by the Accused, some kind of a not in-house but in-team translation, unofficial.  And then you can get an official interpretation -- not a translation, through the court proceedings by asking the witness to read out in Kinyarwanda the portions you are interested in, thereby receiving the Kinyarwanda interpretation or the interpreter's interpretation into English and French.  And then you will have on official interpretation of what you need.  So the problem is not to obtain an official translation, the problem is for you to have sufficient time to read these documents, I think, practically.  That's the main issue.  Time, as you said.  

Okay, let' see how it develops.  This was actually an additional argument in favour of looking at whether ALG really has to be number 3.  It is a question, actually, but you can assess the situation.  

Another method could be to have him in-chief and postpone the cross-examination until you have had sufficient time to read his file.  That will require that ALG, as a detained witness can stay in Arusha for some time, and in order for that to happen it will be necessary that the Tribunal as such has sufficient capacity for all the five detained witnesses, plus the other detained witnesses in other trials, in view of the fact that we have limited number of safehouses.  But with planning, this can be done. 
MR. MOSES:
And also, Your Honour, he won't be held in detention because he's provisionally released.  I don't believe they hold provisionally released prisoners in prison.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The expert? 
MR. MOSES:
If I can address, Your Honour, briefly in respect of that.  Firstly, we are going, in fact, going to alter the summary at the end of the pre-trial brief as to what she is to testify about.  Because I think in the summary there, we had said she was going to testify regarding the history.  And bearing in mind the Appeals Court ruling regarding the existence of genocide, we're not going to -- not say "waste" -- we're not going to lead any evidence in respect of that.  

There are two issues that she has been asked to provide a report in respect of.  One is in relation to the issue of civilian self defence; it's something which, Your Honour, is probably aware that she has testified about previously.  The other issue is she has been asked to provide some analysis of the Radio Rwanda broadcasts involving the Accused that were made during April to June 1994.  

Dr. Des Forges indicated to me that she would be able to provide her report by mid-December.  I'm writing again to her today.  I thought I'd wait until the end of the status conference, Your Honour, once again, just to confirm that we would need to have, I think, her report.  Whilst some of it will be based on previous reports so that in terms of translation issues, I believe we may be able to use what translations there have been previously, it may be that there is some updating of parts of that portion of her report and then there will need to be a translation of the other part of her report mainly regarding the media side of things, Your Honour.  
So, perhaps, if I can also undertake to advise my learned friends and Your Honour as soon as I hear back from Dr. Des Forges as to the progress that she has made on the report and the expected date that it will be filed.  And I would undertake to do that, Your Honour, as soon as I hear back from her. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But she is behind the letters ADF on your list --
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Namely, number 28, so she is testifying at the end?  
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the deadline -- 
MR. MOSES:
-- is 21 days, I think, before her ... however, for practical purposes, Your Honour, I think in terms of translations, I mean, I'm aware of the rule regarding it, but I'm also aware of the practical realities. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, your intention to do this as soon as possible is good in order to ensure translation into French as soon as possible, even if she's testifying very late and I assume that this report will not be too voluminous? 
MR. MOSES:
No, it won't be, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything to be said about the expert? 
MR. CANTIER:
Nothing, in particular, Your Honour.  We've dearly noted the fact that we'll be getting the French version by the 15th of December.  
MR. MOSES:
That's not correct, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't have the French CaseView here now, but what was said in English is that Mr. Moses is trying to obtain the original in French by the 15th of December, but he is still struggling to achieve that aim.  As for the French, that's a different matter, but he's aim is to get the English as soon as possible so that you can get the French as soon as possible.  And at any rate, three weeks before the witness testifies as required by the rules.  So this would be unproblematic.  

The number of witnesses for each week.  One of the reasons why we really need a high number per week is exactly matters that we went through now.  Let us assume that the Defence will stand up and say, "I cannot perform my cross-examination of ALG because I need one to two days to look at the judicial documents."  They will argue that they haven't had time enough.  Then, we need a couple fallback witnesses for the first week, and this may happen many times.  

For that reason, it is better to have too many than too few, even if we all know that there is a limit for how long you can keep witnesses here.  It's a difficult assessment, that one.
MR. MOSES:
It is, Your Honour, and I must say I don't appear to have had particularly good luck in my previous six years at the Tribunal in having witnesses dealt with speedily.  So in my -- in other situations, Your Honour, I've had problems with witnesses because they've, in fact, been kept up to two to three weeks, have had to return, and have been particularly upset, and Your Honour is quite right.  It is a balancing exercise.  I indicated in my email to your chef de cabinet, which was copied to my friend, the basis on which we had prepared the list; namely, that whilst it's not a precise science, if the witnesses were to take approximately the same length of time in cross-examination as in evidence-in-chief, then it would seem to me that the schedule that we have provided is -- is a fair one subject to what Your Honour says regarding a witness such as ALG.  

I had always thought, Your Honour, that once the detainees were here, if there were any gaps, we could, as it were, use the detainees as filler witnesses.  Now, the problem I have with that so far as the first week is concerned is my -- the information which I have received is that the Beechcraft doesn't -- is out of action, being serviced until approximately the 6th.  It may not be that we are able get a flight for detained witnesses until sometime during that first week -- full week of trial.  

Once they are here and we have had some time to settle them in and to see them, Your Honour, perhaps from the second week onwards, should there be a problem regarding scheduling and that, for example, there are witnesses (inaudible) available and there is time left free, it would be my intention to move those witnesses up the list as it were, so that there's no court time that is wasted.  

The only problem I foresee is that during that initial week where it may be that the -- I -- I simply don't know when the detained witnesses will be transferred to Arusha. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do they come from the same institution?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
They all come from the Kigali area?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is something one has to take into account when preparing for cross-examination.  That we may not always be able to stick to the sequence on the list and what we hear now is that the detained witnesses may be used as tools to fill up time.  So when you prepare your working schedule, you may wish to give the detained witnesses a bit more priority, even if they figure further down on the list so as not to be taken by surprise because suddenly they may jump upwards on the list.  

All right, anything else?  
MR. NEKUIE:  
Mr. President, the Defence would like to say most respectfully, that is, with respect to detained witness, it was agreed that a pile of documents regarding their judicial documents will be disclosed to us.  And, in addition, in a language that we will need to translate in order to use them, which means, 
Your Honour, that if we're talking about filling the gaps in the sequence of appearance of witnesses, the Defence will need a lot more time so as to be able to question those witnesses.  I think that clarification was required.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I'm sure you also listened to my clarification about 15 minutes ago where I suggested a working method as to how we can solve this together.  And the working method is that as soon as you get these documents on the 15th, it's important to individualise through these interpretation techniques what you need, and then when you need more time in order to familiarise yourself with documents, we will hear you.  We will hear you and see whether we can accommodate you.  I am sure you are going, when you receive this bundle of documents from the detainees, you will start with -- say, ALG, UB and GLJ since they are the three first on the list.  I assume that will be practical.  

Are there any other matters we need to deal with today?  Let me simply say that for the duration of this Prosecution case -- and we have to finish it in one segment, what is not heard within that segment will not be heard, and we will then move on to a new slot which will be the Defence case, and that slot will be fixed in consultation with both parties.  I assume it's too early to do it now, but if you wish to indicate a month for that slot, you can do it already now, because you may be busy and you may know approximately your schedule for 2007.  

But let me first say about the Prosecution case, there can be no need to remain in Arusha for Defence counsel longer than say the 1st of March.  By then, the Prosecution case will be over and that is a maximum assessment and it is the expectation of the Chamber that less weeks will be required.  I'm saying this in order to facilitate your professional life and family life. 
MR. CANTIER:
I'm obliged.  I don't have any answer.  I have no suggestion to make.  I don't know where we will be when we shall have heard the Prosecutor's case.  It's my very first appearance -- or experience before your Court.  And so that restricts my ability to imagine things.  
I would be able to give you a more enlightened and more informed answer when we shall have heard the Prosecutor.  What I would ask of you is that we have the time that would be required for us to carry out our work. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  In a single accused case, I would estimate based on experience from previous single accused cases, that you will wish between four to eight weeks for your investigations.  We will not move into the Defence case immediately after the Prosecution case.  We will give you a gap.  And this would imply that the Defence case could, for instance, start the 30th of April just to indicate a possible scenario.  But you can come back to us on that later on, but the expectation of the Chamber will be that you will need no more than two months.  And may be you will need less, but that depends on the evidence and this is premature.  It's too early for you to say anything now, of course.  
MR. CANTIER:
I am obliged to you.  We will start working on these matters, the issues of rebuttals and other evidence.  Of course, I have heard what you've said with respect to the time frame -- 4 to 8 weeks.  I'll give you my own view when we shall have finished hearing the Prosecution witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I'm sure you have already carried out investigations in preparation of what is going to happen from the 8th of January and two months would really be, I think, a maximum.  So please, when you plan your work take that into account because this is all part of a very, very complicated puzzle to ensure that all trials fit together.  It's a very complicated thing to plan all these trials together.  So that's why we are hoping to receive your understanding there.  

Is there anything else we have to deal with during this status conference? 
MR. MOSES:
Nothing other than to say, Your Honour, we are constantly revising -- will revise as we go through.  It may be that we drop two or three of those witnesses which will free up some more time.  And if we are going to change the order, we're not going to ambush the Defence.  I will give as much notice as I possibly can -- bearing in mind when I find out that there are any difficulties that arise.  And I do -- I do expect and we have had, I think, a frank and open relationship between the parties and hopefully that will continue and make things go as smoothly as they can.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence, any closing remarks? 
MR. CANTIER:
Obliged, Mr. President.  Not really.  I see no other issue that we need to raise today.  My colleague can count on our commitment in the course of these proceedings and to ensure that the trial is fair; that it would be expeditious -- but, above all, fair.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we agree that we will then meet on Monday at 8:45 in a courtroom to be announced?  We will meet for the pre-trial conference, because according to the rule, that is obligatory.  But based on what we have done now, it is the expectation of the Chamber that that conference will be, more or less, empty.  There will be nothing to address because everything will have been sorted out.  

Maybe it will take five minutes and then we will move directly into the opening of the trial with the opening statement of the Prosecution, which will probably not take more than half an hour.  And then, we call the first two witnesses, the investigator and ****************, which should be done on the first day?  
MR. MOSES:
I hope so, Your Honour, yes, subject to cross-examination, if any, in respect of those witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But your intention is not to have the investigator in the box for more than an hour? 
MR. MOSES:
All I intend to have the investigator do is simply stand there and say, "I took these photographs.  These are documents I have obtained from the database.  I wish to produce them."  That's it in a nutshell.  Now, that obviously may take an hour or it may take a little longer, but that's basically it, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we will see how this develops.  But the third witness may need to be in the waiting room then later that day.  

The Court is then adjourned.  

I thank both parties for the very practical and helpful way you have contributed to the proceedings today.  And wish you all the best until the 8th of January.  

Thank you very much.  

The Court is adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1438H)
