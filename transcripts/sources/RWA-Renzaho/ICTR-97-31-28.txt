P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, at the end of proceedings yesterday there was an objection raised by my learned friend.  I don't know whether that needs to be dealt with before we continue with the cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We said that you would be given the opportunity to commence on that objection and that is why you have the floor now. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, it may be moot because I do not want to continue questioning this witness on that particular exhibit.  If it's a matter of questions and answers being struck from the record, then obviously I would wish to address Your Honours briefly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Unfortunately, I did not get the transcript last evening, so I do not have the wording in front of me.  

Have you been in touch with the Defence and found out whether this issue is now moot or whether you need to address it?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I`m afraid I haven't, no, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now because I didn't get the transcripts, I don't remember, so could you now kindly recapitulate your objection briefly, Maitre Cantier?   
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as I`m concerned, I have some draft transcripts before me.  

But I would like to recall the objection that I made.  I objected to the questions that were being asked by my learned friend on the Prosecution on the content of the conversation that I had -- that I had made the witness to listen to, because I was saying that in the examination-in-chief I had only asked the witness whether he recognised or not, whether he recognised the voice of Mr. Renzaho.  And one of the voices of -- who was one of those who was speaking -- as one of the people who were speaking in that conversation.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, that was the objection that I raised when I asked that the questions regarding the content should not be pursued. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does anyone have the drafts from yesterday so that we remember exactly the pending question? 

Is there anything left of the objection?  

I have now read the exchange just before we left each other yesterday.  Can we leave it at that?  There are no further questions on this issue, according to the Prosecution.  Does this mean the objection is now moot, or do we need a ruling?   
MR. CANTIER: 
That will not be necessary, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
JEAN BAPTISTE BUTERA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, do you accept that a genocide against the Tutsi occurred in Rwanda between 
	April and July 1994? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I will answer that question in an indirect but precise manner.  As far as I am concerned, as I said yesterday, Rwandan citizens from -- of Tutsi origin were massacred by the 
	Hutus -- that is a reality that nobody can deny -- in April of 1994.  I told you that some of my family members were also massacred, but I would also like to add that Hutu Rwandan citizens were also massacred because they were Hutus, others were Tutsis.  They were massacred by the RPF soldiers.  So I would like to conclude that Rwandan citizens, part of the population was massacred by militiamen and also by the RPF soldiers, and unarmed citizens were killed for no reason.  And as far as I am concerned, anybody who was involved in these massacres should answer before the courts.  That is my answer, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, but would you accept that there was a concerted effort to destroy the Tutsi? 
A.	I would like to say no to that because, as I said already, if I was able to go through some roadblocks even with some difficulty -- that was because since 1991, in November and in December, I had participated in some political meetings and when the president of the republic -- yesterday I talked of the exclusion of my party which also had to take part in the government of Nsanzimana, in Nsanzimana`s government. 

The main reason for that was that if the PECO party and the other three parties that were excluded from that government were to take part in this government without the MDR, the PL, the PSD, the situation in the country would have been a disaster.  

Let me explain myself, when the president received me -- I would like to continue because this is very important, Madam Prosecutor -- when the president received me he told me, "Dr. Butera, I strongly regret" --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we must show some self-constraint now, and the Prosecution, just like the Defence, will have to really assess whether they have received an answer to the question or not.  And even if you always would wish to have the witness's answer in context, we think that at this stage the best thing is to proceed with the next question, which is?   
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said yesterday, didn't you, that you didn't think that Renzaho was an extremist? 
A.	I said so and I would like to confirm that. 
Q.	And you define an extremist as somebody who participated in the genocide, didn't you? 
A.	I don't think I said that.  But I said that -- I don't know if I maybe understand that.  I am not sure I understand what you said, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Do you agree that it's possible to be an extremist before April 1994? 
A.	Yes, it is possible, because I also know people I could also describe as extremists. 
Q.	Could you describe - you, personally, would you describe Bagosora as an extremist? 
A.	I did not acquaint myself with Bagosora very much, so I can't really answer that question. 
Q.	What about Karamera, would you describe him as an extremist? 
A.	I cannot say that.  All I know is when he gave me a letter to go ask Mr. Kajuga to escort the Tutsis who had to leave Kigali.  So, if in your explanation, an extremist is somebody who has something against the Tutsis, then I would say that by his actions, for me, he was not an extremist. 
Q.	What about Ferdinand Nahimana, was he an extremist in your view? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I do not see how that would concern the case in which I am a witness. 
Q.	Could you just answer the question, please.  
A.	I don't know, madam. 
Q.	Now you told us about your political party, PECO, yesterday.  And it's right, isn't it, that your motto or mission you said was to focus on the environment and health? 
A.	That is correct, madam. 
Q.	And you said that your party -

MR. PRESIDENT: 
The break, it is too fast now.  Let's slow down, both of you.  All right.  Thank you. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I apologise. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said yours was a liberal party, didn't you? 
A.	It was a centrist party. 
Q.	Which had no connection with Hutu power, for example? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And in answer to a question from the President, you said that your party was not involved in ethnicity issues and that these were irrelevant to your party, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Your party was established in November 1991, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	Just one month before the establishment of multi-party government, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Two months before, yes. 
Q.	And your brand new party was to form part of that multi-party government, wasn't it? 
A.	All the parties that were invited to the negotiation table for the establishment of that government, of that multi-party government, could take part, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	And wasn't your party funded by President Habyarimana? 
A.	That is some news that you are just giving me, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Wasn't it founded at the behest of the MRND as a deliberately neutral sounding party? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, if you see me here, at least I have university diplomas, do you think I was not capable of forming a political party? 
Q.	Well, you said yourself, Witness, yesterday that if as a result of this -- of the new era in politics that was dawning in Rwanda -- the ministry of health had gone to the RPF, you would have been compelled to resign; you said that, didn't you? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I had my private firm and I could have been well paid. 
Q.	But the point is, Mr. Witness, that if, as you say, your party was centrist, liberal, ethnicity was not an issue and you are allied to the MRND, why would the RPF have compelled you to resign? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, if you allow me to give more details, I will do so.  But if we are limited in time, then I cannot answer.  But all I can say is that if the RPF had just been -- had received ministers.  When a ministry was taken, taking into considering the preparation of elections, it was just logical that the ministry, or the minister of health of the RPF should give positions to members of his party, and that was logical.  That is why I told you that.  
Taking into account the political situation prevailing -- we discussed, and Tutsi competent people were appointed, a competent Tutsi person was appointed in the ministry of health with the understanding that that person would continue working in the ministry.  That is what I said yesterday. 
Q.	Your party, PECO, aligned itself with the MRND and the CDR, didn't it? 
A.	I would not say that we were aligned, but we had some kind of coalition, just as I could have had with the RPF. 
Q.	Didn't you form an agreement with the MDR and the CDR and a couple of other parties in which you all expressed yourselves as alarmed by the anti-democratic forces that wanted to destroy the gains of the 1959 revolution? 
A.	Yes, that is possible. 
Q.	Is it possible, or did it happen at all, don't you remember? 
A.	Madam, I would like to say yes, but I would also like to add when the president of the republic received me he told me that we had to -- that we should not enter the government because if we entered the government we would risk a civil war and he did not want a civil war.  Unfortunately, what happened, you are all aware of what happened in April of 1991 -- '94.  I beg your pardon. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if this registry could hand this document to the witness?  It should be the fourth document in the bundles I provided yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is a K-number?   
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, it is K0089892 to 3.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the question?   
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Have a look at the second page of that document, Mr. Witness, do you see your signature there? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you agree, do you, this is an accord between five parties including PECO, MRND and CDR? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you agree that among the objectives listed in article two on the first page of this document, is to safeguard the gains of the revolution, the social revolution of 1959?  To this effect -- 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps it's safest if I read this in French and it is translated by an interpreter.  "To this effect they undertake to fight all forms of feudal and monarchical systems."  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you agree that is what is written in this agreement? 
A.	What page are you referring to, Madam Prosecutor?  
Q.	The first page towards the bottom, you see article two.  And there are a number of bullet points.  It's the third bullet point I am referring to.  It begins (French spoken) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Safeguard the gains".
THE WITNESS:
Madam Prosecutor, please, could you read the entire article because you are referring only to a bit of it and interpreting it differently. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We in this courtroom are able to read this in its true context.  And you are right that there are many other elements there, Mr. Witness, including matters such as co-operation and the true democracy, et cetera, et cetera.  But what the Prosecution is interested in now is the particular reference to maintaining the gains of the 1959 resolution.  

Now this particular formulation, do you have any comment on that?  
THE WITNESS:
No, that is what is written and that is what I signed.  However, let me add that while I was six years, seven years old I saw how my father suffered.  

So, madam, if you did not experience this situation it is very difficult to understand it. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you deny the 1959 revolution was an ethnic revolution? 
A.	It was based on social-ethnic inequality. 
Q.	Do you deny that "le forces feodo-monarchiques" means Tutsi? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And for the record the sentence read out now was:  (French spoken) 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, let me say that I do not agree with the Prosecutor's assertion, because the feudal and monarchical systems were not made up only of Tutsis.  But it was a group of Tutsis who took everything into their own hands and forgot about the rest of the population, be it Tutsi or Hutu, who were left to their own suffering.  So this does not refer to Tutsis in general.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	PECO was a shareholder in RTLM, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, I know that the treasurer of our party had paid 10,000 francs to acquire two shares.  But it was a business undertaking.  And if there were to be any profits to arise from such an undertaking, it wasn't something to be overlooked.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to acquire any shares myself because I didn't have money.  At the time I was involved in building my own home.  But if I had had money at the time I would have taken up shares in that company as well, at that time, I must insist. 
Q.	And you're still denying, Mr. Witness, that PECO was, although a small party, an extremist party? 
A.	That is an unfounded assertion.  I told you already that I had Tutsis as members of my party.  They were friends.  They were upright people and I still have Tutsi friends living in Kigali and other countries on exile. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why would a political party engage in a commercial activity?  
THE WITNESS:
Yesterday, Mr. President, I talked about a party which was made up mainly of people who did not have any political background.  I have never been a minister.  I have never been a secretary general.  I have never been a préfet.  So we didn`t have the necessary resources to engage in politics and demonstrations and rallies, or what have you, contrary to the resources available to other political parties like the PSD or the MNDR who already had ministers in office and who had the necessary resources.  So if it was possible to make some profit for the party, I did not find any problem with such an initiative. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the witness be shown this document, which is the third, I think, of those handed out yesterday?   
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is a photocopy of an extract from a book by a gentleman called Gérard Prunier, that is, G-É-R-A-R-D, P-R-U-N-I-E-R.  Have you heard of that gentleman? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	If you have a look at the final page of those three that I have given to you, you will see an extract from a glossary of abbreviations in the book.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you see that PECO is listed on the left-hand side? 
A.	Yes, I can see PECO on that list. 
Q.	And Mr. Prunier has defined PECO, parti ecologiste, as follows: "Under its mild name, one of the worst of the pygmies closely allied with the MRND and later with the genocidal interim government."  Do you see that? 
A.	What is the question, Madam Prosecutor?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is whether you see it?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see it.  Can I answer?   
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Well, I was going to simply ask you whether or not you agree with what Mr. Prunier has said about PECO. 
A.	As I have already told you, many historians have written on the event that happened in Rwanda.  Prunier has his own understanding of the tragedy that befell my country, Rwanda.  However, I would also like to see another document by Mr. Pierre Pean who talks about a number of issues, and in that view we might get another opinion.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness referred to a document produced by this author, which we didn't get.  We didn't get the exact title. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The first name was Pierre.  Can we have the last name again please?
THE WITNESS:
Pean.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Peant, P-E-A-N-T. 
THE WITNESS:
There is no "T" at the end of that name. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I delete the T, thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did you leave Rwanda at the end of 1994? 
A.	Correct, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Did you go to Congo? 
A.	I was forced to go through the Congo. 
Q.	Did you end up in Cameroon at any stage? 
A.	Only when I was on mission or attending an international conference on HIV AIDS.  I was never in Cameroon in `94, `95 or `96. 
Q.	And in `97? 
A.	Since I was a director of the AIDS control program in Rwanda, I was able to travel to Cameroon on official mission.  But, thereafter, I have never been to Cameroon. 
Q.	Did you see Renzaho when you were in the Congo? 
A.	Yes, I saw him over a period of two to four weeks.  That is, in December and January. 
Q.	And you are aware, aren't you, that while Mr. Renzaho was in Congo he formed part of the umbrella committee of the RDR party that was set up there in 1995? 
A.	I was not aware, and I am not aware of that, because I left Congo in February 1995. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you now refer to the MRND party or the RMD party?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
RDR. 

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you agree, Mr. Witness, that the RDR, then known as, "Rassemblement pour le retour des réfugies et la democratie au Rwanda" was created in Congo in 1995? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Interpreters, could you pick up that phrase.  It is a well-known concept, please read it out again. 
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Rassemblement pour le retour des réfugies et de la democratie au Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now the English version for the English transcript. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is the "rally for the return of refugees and democracy to Rwanda". 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree that that was a party set up in Congo in 1995? 
A.	Yes, I do confirm that.  But the president of that movement or rally is someone who lived in Belgium, the former minister of the economy under President Habyarimana. 
Q.	And do you agree that that is a party that was set up by -- or to include ex-FAR officers and Interahamwe in opposition to the RPF? 
A.	I would not understand how a party would be created to involve the FAR and the Interahamwe, because the person who came from Belgium to meet those who were in the refugee camps in Congo, if that person had come with someone else to create such a movement for the return of the refugees, I do not see why he would have to seek to involve the Interahamwe, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, do you accept that you were and are a member of that party? 
A.	Yes, I do acknowledge that I am a member and I am still a member of that party.  But I only became a member of that movement in 1996 when I was already in Belgium. 
Q.	Do you accept that you contributed to a document entitled:  "UN Security Council misled about the presumed Tutsi genocide in Rwanda"? 
A.	Could you please repeat, because I did not quite understand what you said?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was:  "Do you agree that you contributed to a document entitled:  United Nations Security Council misled about the presumed `Tutsi genocide` in Rwanda"?  
THE WITNESS:
	I have no such recollection.  I don't remember that document. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps the witness could be shown, I believe it's the seventh document in the bundle that was provided.  There should be a copy in both English and French.  That is the English I see, no, the one below, the one on the table. 

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	There are two copies.  And if you flip through it you see the typeface changes after about 30 pages and perhaps you will find it easier to look at the French version.  Would you like assistance in finding the French version of that document, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Just tell me the page, Madam Prosecutor. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is the front page.  The front page contains the title and 12 persons contributing to the document.  Do you see that?  
THE WITNESS:
The French page?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The French page is the first page of the French part, after page 37 of the English version.  So it would then be the 38th page, but there is not any number there, no pagination.  Have you found it?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I am there.  The introduction.  Yes. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now you see it in French, do you recognise that document, and do you accept that you contributed to it? 
A.	I heard mention of this document, but I did not contribute to it because I was in Belgium at the time.  And if you look at the names of the people mentioned who were in that location, I do not see how we could have met to draft this document.  And at the time, I had no computer and I wasn't on the internet at that time.  

Now for greater clarity, Madam Prosecutor, let me say that you must remember that I am not the only Jean Baptiste Butera.  I am Dr. Jean Baptiste Butera, not just Jean Baptiste Butera.  This has been an issue in my life for several years. 
Q.	So you are saying that name we say on that front there, number 5, that`s not you? 
A.	Now I understand your question when you asked me whether I was in Cameroon.  I was not in Cameroon.  This must be referring to another Jean Baptiste who probably was in Cameroon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the document doesn't say it was written, or contributed to, solely by persons in Cameroon, does it? 
A.	Madam, I am a politician and I gather information.  I have documents and I have seen this document elsewhere.  If you look at the list of the names of these people, you should be able to know and have information as to where they were in 1996. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Objection, Mr. President.  This document before us refers to the movement for the return of refugees and democracy to Rwanda, RDR Cameroon wing. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is true and then the word "contribution" is mentioned.  So that is a matter of interpretation.  Yes. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you deny then, Mr. Witness, that you are the head of the RDR Benelux section B-E-N-E-L-U-X? 
A.	I am not the head, I`m the co-ordinator. 
Q.	Now you've said you've seen this document, although you deny you had any involvement in its drafting.  Could you have a look, please, at page 34? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am referring to the English page number.  I will find it in French in a moment. 
THE WITNESS:
What page, please?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Around 37 or 38 in the French version maybe.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Page 38 in the French.  I'm sorry about the delay there. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Have a look, Mr. Witness, at the final paragraph on page 38. 
A.	I am waiting for your question, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	You accept, do you, that that paragraph denies that the Interahamwe conducted into ethnic massacres is described as a genocide, a Tutsi genocide? 
A.	As I already said, I know that there was genocide of Tutsi and Hutu who were killed by militia.  But I also told you that there were other prevailing situations which you did not allow me to delve into and which all contributed to the results which we are all aware of. 
Q.	And have a look, please, at page 33 in French, page 30 in the English, where in this document is it denied that the Interahamwe were a trained militia? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, can I also ask you, because I didn't contribute to preparing this document, maybe you may want to also see the document that was prepared by the Benelux section in Belgium.  I am not the author of this document, why should I be answering questions on it?   
Q.	I suggest to you that you are the author of this document; you are the Jean Baptiste Butera named on the cover, and you know that perfectly well. 
A.	Mr. President, I would like the Court to take note of what I am going to say.  There is a 
	Butera, Jean Baptiste who was a sous-préfet and who was in Cameroon and who is today a refugee in Belgium.  There is also a Dr. Butera, Jean Baptiste, chairman on the PECO party who is also currently in Belgium, a member of the RDR and of the FDU.  

I would like the Prosecutor to take note of this once and for all.  There is Jean Baptiste Butera who is mentioned in this document, and that Jean Baptiste Butera is not I.  Thank you. 
Q.	So you, as the head of the Benelux section of the RDR, disagree, do you, with the conclusion in this document that what occurred in Rwanda was a genocide against the Tutsi?  And you will see that written clearly in the conclusion at page 39 in the French, and page 36 in the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And she meant the co-ordinator, because you corrected that.  We have noted that.  You were not the head, you said. 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  But I have underscored, this document belongs to its authors, and I did not participate in drafting this document and I cannot take any responsibility for what is written here and I have no opinion to express on this particular document. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	I am asking for your opinion on the conclusion that no genocide against the Tutsi occurred in 1994.  This is a document produced, you say, by members of your own party, if not by yourself? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, I have expressed myself clearly on the question that you have put in relation to the genocide of Tutsi.  My answer remains the same, and I do not need to change it.  I told you right from the beginning that I lost members of my family.  I lost Tutsi friends and brothers.  And my position, my explanation has been very, very clear. 
Q.	Isn't it right, Mr. Witness, that the reason you live in Belgium and not back home in Rwanda at the moment is because you are accused there of crimes committed in Kigali-rural? 
A.	That is news to me.  That is actually bad news. 
Q.	And you are considered by the Rwandans to be what they call a Category 1 suspect? 
A.	I would like to repeat that.  That is some news to me.  And I would like to see the number of that list and see on what list my name is indicated. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, perhaps you could be shown this document.  It is the second document in the bundle I handed out and I apologise for the smallness of the type.  

Mr. Witness, this is a public document available on the Rwandan government website.  It forms part of a number of lists of -- as we see on the first page, Category 1 genocide suspects.  If you please turn to the penultimate page, four names from the bottom, do you not see Butera, Jean Baptiste, three columns to the right:  "Director, president of the PECO party, medical doctor, director of the national AIDS control program, PNLS."

Now, surely you agree that's you? 
A.	Butera, Jean Baptiste, president of the PECO party.  I think that concerned me.  But when a government is established and I am addressing -- when a government leaves power, a document like this one, people don't know my parents, people don't know where I live. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slow down, Mr. Witness.  

Yes, please, continue. 
THE WITNESS:
I was saying when a government which is worthy of the name and has legal experts, legal officers, comes up with a list which accuses somebody, and the names of the parents of the person are not indicated nor the place where the person is born or where that person is living, no case number, Madam Prosecutor, I am surprised that you are endorsing such a document.  

But what I would like to add is that you will see the number here is 1,144.  I have already seen this document several times.  There is Butera, Jean Bosco and there is Butera.  I don't know who else.  

It is unfortunate, but I know that I do not have any case concerned by this list.  So I would like to ask the Court to avoid considering this document as an official one because it is something that you could go to the market and find on any piece of paper. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness, I have no further questions for you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Any re-examination?   
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, on the last question that was asked by the Prosecutor.
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you prosecuted in Rwanda?  Are you aware of any legal action that was taken against you in Rwanda?  
A.	Never. 
Q.	Mr. President, to conclude on that: Were the object of any legal action for any events that were committed between the 5th April and the 31st December in another country other than Rwanda? 
A.	In another country other than Rwanda I was targeted by the media on the grounds of information found in documents that were produced by my detractors, detractors that I will not name here.  These are the people who took part in the preparation of this list.  Some media broadcast this wrong information that was manipulated and I even had to wait for seven years to have my refugee status granted because of all this.  

Lucky for me, in democratic countries there are services that work or function and that do not come up with papers like this, especially when we are talking about a government that comes up with documents like this one and have them printed in official documents.  In the country where I live, I took legal action, I sued against the person who was -- who came up with this information.  Not against the person who produced this information, but against the newspaper who published this false information.  

And, Madam Prosecutor, I could tell you that now I have a case pending at the court of appeal against the newspaper that tarnished my name and you know that when the name of a medical doctor is tarnished that hurts. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What did the court of first instance come to?   
THE WITNESS:
The journalist and myself, the court said that we had shared responsibility.  I was considered a politician, but they said my name could be tarnished without serious damage.  So I went to the court of appeal.  So the person who was behind that information who had manipulated the media took legal action as a civil party.  But his case was not considered in 1996. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when did you leave Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
I left Rwanda -- I left to Kigali, I went to Gitarama; I went to Kibuye.  And as I said, Mr. President, even us and everyone else chose itineraries that we considered less dangerous.  And from Kibuye, I went to Gisenyi, from there I went to the Congo, and from there, from the Congo, I went to the place where I currently live. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was when, not your itinerary.  Can you please answer that question?   
THE WITNESS:
I left Rwanda on the 17th July 1994. 
MR. CANTIER: 
No further question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Nothing to be tendered?   
MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. President, yes, there are four documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Will we start with this list of documents which you first referred to?   

This document about collaboration between parties, K0089892, will then have which exhibit number, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
	P. 97. 
(Exhibit No. P.  97 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next was Pean?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?   
MR. MATEMANGA:
	P. 98.
(Exhibit No. P. 98 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then the document about the United Nations Security Council?   
MR. MATEMANGA:
P.  99. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
There is an English and French, perhaps it should be A and B. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Coming to that, so, Mr. Matemanga, you make note of that as always.  
	(Exhibit No. P. 99A and P. 99B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then finally the list of Category 1 genocide suspects, Mr. Matemanga?   
MR. MATEMANGA:
P.  100. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 100 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

This marks the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you for having come a long way to the Tribunal to testify and we wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Could I ask you a favour, Mr. President?   I would like to greet the Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is no objection against that, and the witness protection unit will make sure you can do that during a break or at some other suitable moment. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Perhaps we could have our 11 o'clock break right away and then the necessary arrangements can be made to start with the next witness after the little break.  Would that be a good way to proceed?   
MR. CANTIER: 
That is fine with me, Mr. President.  I think he's ready. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And we received an email from the Defence team indicating the correct pseudonym of the next witness.  Could you just place that on record, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there's been a change again.  So the next witness will be UT, Witness UT.  

There was a problem bringing the witness that had to be here.  He did not receive his air ticket in time so we informed the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Uniform, tango. 
MR. CANTIER: 
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, the Court is adjourned for about 20 minutes.
(Court recessed at 1047H)
(Pages 1 to 16 by Melissa Hook)














(Court resumed at 1123H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness UT in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness UT in French)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you with your signature.  Isn't that so, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 47.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 47 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat the number, Mr. Matemanga, and speak into the mike? 
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 47. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Defence, please.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we would like to have the testimony of this witness taken in closed session, in view of the danger to which he may be exposed through this testimony and also considering the names of persons he will be mentioning in the course of his testimony. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it, then, your submission that, in view of the position this witness held in April 1994, it will be very difficult for you to conduct your examination-in-chief without, by necessity, revealing his identity?  Is that the submission?  
MR. CANTIER:
(Microphone not activated)...yes, Mr. President, that is absolutely correct.  He held a position, and he went on various missions that would lead to his being identified almost immediately.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No problems with that, Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will grant the request, and we will, then, therefore, unfortunately, ask those in the public gallery to leave us.  

Thank you.
