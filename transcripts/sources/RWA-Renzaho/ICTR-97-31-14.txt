P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, the Court is in session. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just two small issues before we start the testimony again.  On Friday, you talked about 
Fidèle and Ndamije and you also mentioned another one, Narcisse, because he was in charge of a cellule.  

Can you repeat the name of that cellule, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Gahirimba cellule.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that means G-A-H-I-R-I-M-B-A; isn't that so? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the right spelling, then? 
THE WITNESS:
B-W-A-H-I-R-I-M-B-A.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
"Gahirimba" (phonetic).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- says the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So are there two versions now in the courtroom; is the witness wrong? 
THE WITNESS:
"Gahirimba" (phonetic). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth says it is pronounced "Gahirimba" but spelt B-W-A-H-I-R-I-M-B-A; they pronounce it "Gahirimba". 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, well, this was really a trap.  And then the next one, Mugamije (phonetic), can you help us with that word, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Actually, it is Ngamije.  It is spelt N-G-A-M-I-J-E, Ngamije. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much to everyone.  

Defence, please proceed. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Obliged, Mr. President. 
WITNESS BUO,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, do you remember that by the time we stopped our examination Friday, you answered my question saying that you had been trained by a certain reserve lieutenant called Claude; correct? 
A.	He was not the only one.  When you had already received your training, you could train others.  As I told you, the training was not very difficult.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, I was just trying to jog your recollection about how we ended on Friday.  You referred to Claude as having been the person who trained you; correct? 
A.	That's right, Claude was our president and he was the one training us; you're right.  
Q.	Well, then, thank you, Witness.  

Do you also remember that a short while before we started talking about Claude, you had objected to the mention I made of the AK47 guns amongst the weapons you mentioned; do you remember that? 
A.	I'm going to repeat to you the types of firearms which I mentioned.  I remember that very well and I'm going to repeat it to you so that we can be at par.  I talked about:  Kalashnikovs, R4, G3 and FAL -- light-automatic weapon.  Is that not what I said, Counsel? 
Q.	Witness, I noted what you said.  I just want you to agree with me that you considered that the AK47 rifle was not amongst the weapons you've mentioned.  Do we agree on that or not? 
A.	I just reminded you of the types of firearms which we had.  Well, perhaps you had that AK47, which you're talking about, but I did not mention it. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  While Claude was teaching you weapons handling procedures, he did not tell you that the Kalashnikov was the same as the AK47 gun; he didn't tell you that? 
A.	The only name I know is Kalashnikov.  Nobody told me of that other name you are mentioning.  Perhaps you're just fabricating the name now.  Was I with you when I was undergoing my training for you to start disputing all what I'm telling you regarding what I was trained on?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, everyone has a task in this courtroom.  Counsel wants to ask questions.  Your task is to answer them.  Your task is not to argue with counsel, all right?  Now, just answer the questions.  Here comes the next one.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, kindly tell the Chamber what your training curriculum was?  The type of training you received from Lieutenant Claude and the other people? 
A.	Our curriculum entailed taking out the magazine of the guns to cross-check whether the gun had been properly loaded.  Then, we had to place the bullets in the magazine, then put the magazine and attach it to the gun.  Then, we also need to check the position of the safety pin and then we'd go and do the work which we had to do for that day; that was all.  
Q.	So, in your training system you were not told about how to use the weapon, that is not necessarily dismantling it and actually mounting it up, but tactical procedures.  You were not taught about that? 
A.	Our training tied in with the activities we had to carry out; we were not supposed to go to the war front.  Our lone activity was to kill Tutsi.  
Q.	But, Witness, do you remember what you told the Chamber on Friday that you were at the front against the Inkotanyi on the 17th of June 1994.  You yourself use the word "front", don't you remember? 
A.	Did you say the 17th of June?  I did not say that.  I explained how we fought the Inkotanyi who had come to release people from the Sainte Famille parish.  I did not give you a specific date.  I simply mentioned the month.  And at that time, we were shooting at the Inkotanyi who had come during the night.  We were trying to repel them -- to push them back.  It was not fighting in the front.  We were Interahamwe, we weren't soldiers. 
Q.	Witness, so when you used the term "front" in giving an account of that battle, you actually made a mistake in the use of the term, and you told the Chamber that you fought with soldiers under 
Lieutenant Cadence.  So you were actually mistaken, is that so? 
A.	I was not mistaken, sir.  I told you of what I did, the events which I witness -- attend -- participated in.  The Interahamwe were fighting the Inkotanyi who had come to release people at the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille.  And we shot at them when they were leaving with those Tutsi refugees; that was the front I referred to.  We did not fight against the Inkotanyi; we did not attack the Inkotanyi.  I don't know how you understand that, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, please explain to the Trial Chamber the difference you make between the light-automatic weapons and the R4 rifles? 
A.	Those rifles do not look alike and even when you use them, you don't use them in the same way.  Now, if you give me sketches of those two types of guns or rifles, then I'll be able to tell you the difference easily. 
Q.	But, Witness, if you had been taught how to make a distinction between them, then you know what their distinctive features are.  You do not need a sketch for that; isn't that so? 
A.	Well, I'm going to try.  The R4 has a butt which is not often wooden.  It is a foldable gun with a tripod.  The light-automatic weapons do not have any tripods.  The end of the R4 has a seeking light whereas that of the light-automatic weapon does not have the same features.  Also, the magazines do not have the same size and the same shape.  The R4 gun is very different from the light-automatic weapon.  
Q.	Witness, for a militiaman who claims that he was with Colonel Renzaho, it is quite surprising that you do not know that the difference between those guns is mainly the size of their magazines, because some of them have more bullets in the magazines than the others.  You weren't told that? 
A.	But, Counsel, even if you seem to be unaware of that, I just gave you that distinction and I insisted when I told you that the R4 rifle was very different from the light-automatic weapon.  
Q.	Did you say that the magazine of the R4 was different from the magazine of the light-automatic weapon?  I didn't hear you say that, Witness.  
A.	I did say that, sir, and I even said that the bullets used by the two guns are very different.  The bullets of the R4 rifle are very small.  Even if you showed me the two types of bullets, I can know which one is the one used by the R4 rifle.  And I'm making a distinction between that and the one used by the light-automatic weapons.  
Q.	Witness, you were rapidly appointed (By order of the Court, the following portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Can you explain to us how you went about operating your activities?  Start by telling us how many of you there were and then tell us how you organised yourselves.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel, our operations were not complicated.  This is something I've been explaining ever since I started giving evidence.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) that is where we had our headquarters.  That is where we were assigned the various duties.  That is where we were giving details regarding the operations to carry out the people we had to kill.  

Then, we would come and report to her -- be it for the vehicles we used, the uniforms, or the weaponry, those were all at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) when the people participating in those various operations did not keep those equipment with themselves.  

Above all, we participated in operations of massacre.  We did not have other operations because actually our organisation had been set up to carry out massacres.  So we were responsible for maintaining the equipment placed at our disposal, and we also had to make sure that the equipment was used for the purposes initially earmarked.  

We had positions at the various roadblocks which had been set up within Rugenge secteur.  Now, if you're not familiar with Rugenge secteur, I am ready to explain to you how that secteur was laid out 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are in open session.  So we will now first delete at 9:17:06 the words in the sentence, "We were based at ... ", then follows a name and we will delete that name and that place.  
And, then, we have to delete the last part of the last sentence in the response at 9:18:30.  So that the sentence will end with the words "... was laid out ..."   Whereas the last line, "And in my ..." onwards will be placed under separate cover.  

Anything else we need to delete?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, in the question there was reference to the position held.  I don't, I'm afraid, have the time code.  It was the question preceding that answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes, Defence counsel, that was not good.  So what we have at 9:16:36 must also be deleted.  We will simply say you were rapidly appointed and the rest of the sentence will be placed under separate cover, and then continues the next sentence:  "Can you explain to us ..." And this is at 9:16:36.  Let's all be cautious.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, I had completely forgotten that we were in open court.  My apologies -- and I'll even avoid dwelling on that point so as not to lead to the witness's identity being disclosed. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, let me put to you what may be actually the last question on this point.  You told the Chamber that the training sessions took place at Angeline Mukandituye's home; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, you are not mistaken; that's correct.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Please tell the Court what was the size of that residence where the training sessions were taking place? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you.  It was not necessary to have huge space.  The little space sufficed for us to carry out the necessary exercises and we were able to meet our set objectives -- that is, to massacre people.  
Q.	Witness, give us an approximate size of that area -- that space, if you remember? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I went to the place I wasn't going there to measure the sizes.  I was going there to carry out exercises.  There was a specific objective.  But there was a garden in front of the living room.  If you want, you can go there yourself with the tape and take the measurement because I did not have the time to go and carry out a survey -- a topographical survey of that place. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and there we have a new example of how you get into argument with counsel.  Can't you stop this?  We don't appreciate it.  

So here comes his next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, were those sessions carried out concurrently with the family activities in 
Mrs. Angeline Mukandituye's home? 
A.	Yes, we carried out our exercises in front of the house and in the rear courtyard where there were the kitchens and the other ancillary buildings where the family activities went on.  You see, that is where the cooking was carried out; that is where we had our meals.  So, our exercises went concurrently with the family activities within that family where we carried our exercises out.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  So you received your training under the circumstances you have indicated and about which the Defence has serious reservations.  Anyway, let's move on and talk about your campaigns.  You said that on that 21st of April 1994, you received your first package of weapons brought by Colonel Renzaho and Major Munyakaze; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is, that is what I said.  
Q.	Now, Witness, when those two people got there, did you see them arrive there? 
A.	I saw them when they arrived.  I knew them before, so I could make them out.  I cannot be mistaken regarding those two people.  
Q.	How were they dressed, Witness? 
A.	One of them was in a dark suit -- I'm referring to your client.  Munyakaze was in military attire.  
Q.	You say Mr. Renzaho was in a black suit and Munyakaze was in military attire? 
A.	Correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Is that how Mr. Renzaho was often dressed, when he had to go down to conduct operations with you, Witness?  You didn't understand my question, Witness? 
A.	You see, you are speaking in French, that is why I did not answer you, Counsel.  I'm speaking Kinyarwanda.  You're speaking in French -- or I had the impression I received the interpretation in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So now we will repeat the question.  

Will you do that, please? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, my question to you was whether Mr. Renzaho usually dressed in such an attire, which you just described, to go down to conduct operations with you. 
A.	No, sir, he changed his attire.  He was not always dressed in the same way.  On certain occasion, he came in camouflage dress. 
Q.	So on that day, for the maiden operation with you, he chose to be in a black suit? 
A.	Correct.  
Q.	What about the pickup vehicle which you talked about, Witness?  Can you give us some descriptions of it?  How many types of cabin did it have and how many people were in that vehicle when you saw it? 
A.	The vehicle which they came in on that first occasion was a Hilux pickup, red in colour.  That was the vehicle used by Munyakaze.  There were six gendarmes sitting in the rear and in the cabin were Laurent Munyakaze, Renzaho and the driver.  
Q.	And where were the weapons?
A.	The weapons were at the rear and could not have been placed in the cabin. 
Q.	How many weapons were there, Witness? 
A.	They only took a few weapons out of those that were in the pickup.  But other weapons remained in the pickup, and that is the reason for which I'm not in a position to give you the number of weapons that were in the pickup, because they only gave us a few weapons and they left with the remainder of the batch.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, I believe you cannot know -- I'm sure that you do not know how many weapons there were exactly.  But can you give us an estimate?  How many weapons did you receive on that day and did you also receive ammunition? 
A.	Yes, we received bullets in small boxes and we also received grenades.  But when they delivered the weapons to us, I should say that we already had weapons and this simply came -- these weapons simply came in addition to the ones we already had.  We already had G3 weapons, but we were having problems with such weapons and that is the reason for which they gave us Kalashnikov rifles.  
Q.	What you're describing us to us, Witness, seems to be unrealistic:  Two senior officers of the Rwandan army would be sitting in the cabin of a pickup truck with six gendarmes in -- at the rear.  And you are stating that below the feet of such gendarmes, there were the -- there was the ammunition as well as all the weapons that were delivered to you.  Is that what your testimony before this Chamber is? 
A.	I understand you, Counsel, but you were not there to witness the scene, but the description I gave you is what occurred.  On the first occasion, the description I gave you is exactly what happened and I do not understand why you're challenging what I'm telling you.  
Q.	Witness, I'm merely trying to understand because, in addition, the weapons which you allegedly received on that day -- that is to say, the G3, the R4s and the light-automatic rifles -- do you know that these are weapons that were no longer in circulation in the defence forces of Rwanda and that as a consequence, no ammunition was being ordered for such weapons.  Are you aware of that? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, I was not in charge of the stock of weapons, and I merely told you about the weapons we received.  I'm not aware of the information you have just shared with us.  I was not in charge of the weapon stocks and as for the weapons we received, we also received the ammunition and there was never any shortage of such ammunition.  
Q.	So do you believe -- that you agree it was given the priority compared to the other units of the 
Rwandan army in -- in terms of supply of ammunition?  So, were you given priority compared to the regular army; is that what you're stating? 
A.	Counsel, at the roadblock where we were there was also gendarmes and soldiers, and they would use the same ammunition as we did.  So, they would certainly have provided us with ammunition since they were aware of the work we were carrying out.  But until the day we left our headquarters, we even had to leave some of the ammunition and some of the weapons behind.  And I do recall that when I went back to the country, I was shown some of this ammunition.  
Q.	Finally, Witness, on this issue, did you know that at the time Kalashnikov rifles were not made available to all the units of the army?  Were you aware of that? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel, I was not aware of that since I -- as I told you, I was not working at the general staff of the army or of the gendarmerie.  I gave you the different types of weapons we would use and the ones we received.  And there was even another delivery of new weapons -- and some members of our group even participated in operations in Mburabuturo, where the operations were led by Bwanakweri.  And if you put the question to him, he will be able to confirm such information.  We were able to get new weapons during that operation -- and let me say that we never suffered any shortage of ammunition or weapons; we had some in sufficient quantities.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please help us with the spelling of that location where the operations took place? 
THE WITNESS:
The fighting took place in Mburabuturo and the operations were led by 
Captain Isadore (phonetic) Bwanakweri, and the Cyangugu battalion that participated in the fighting had specific weapons and we were able to get weapons from those members of the battalion who fell at the front.  So we were able to get new Kalashnikov rifles as well as additional ammunition and grenades. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you for that, Mr. Witness, but my question was only the spelling.  Now Mburabuturo is M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O, is that true? 
THE WITNESS:
You're right, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But now we really need your assistance with that name which was complicated.  Can you help us, please, the spelling? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to Bwanakweri?  It is B-W-A-N-A-K-W-E-R-I, Bwanakweri. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that was the person who led the operations in Mburabuturo, is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct and he is presently detained at the Kigali central prison.  

BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, are we to understand that you had received only cursory training -- was chosen by the two officers in order to give you useful weapons, and this to the detriment of the police, the army and the gendarmerie.  Is that what we are to understand? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, what happened in the Rugenge secteur was carried out by Interahamwe with the cooperation of gendarmes and soldiers.  And let me specify, that there the same soldiers were the ones who shot -- who started shooting first after President Habyarimana's death.  Let me remind you there was a communiqué which prohibited members of the population from leaving their houses and the soldiers were the ones who started shooting at people.  The gendarmerie and the army always cooperated with the Interahamwe and this until the last day when we left the country.  So how can you say that such officers would have taken care of the gendarmerie and the army alone and neglect the Interahamwe when the Interahamwe were also an organisation that had been created by these same people? 
Q.	Do you know whether Angeline Mukandituye's house was bombarded in April of 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The shells fell lower than Angeline Mukandituye's house.  And shells fell at Macumi where the crisis committee meeting was taking place, and which was attended by an envoy of Préfet Renzaho.  So the shells fell on the house that was at the bottom of the road.  
Q.	And, according to you, where were these bombs coming from, Witness? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, our task was to hunt down the Tutsis to kill them.  My task was not to identify where shells were coming from.  Such a question should be put to those who were handling the support weapons -- and let me specify that we did not receive any such support weapon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You gave a location indicating where the shells were falling.  Can you repeat that name?  It sounded like "Matuma".  The spelling, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I talked about Mr. Alphonse Macumi's residence, and that is the only location where I know that bombs fell and it was a residence which was located below that of Angeline Mukandituye's.  

Macumi is spelt M-A-C-U-M-I.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
And his first name is Alphonse.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, Witness, I took note of your concern.  What was your concern at the time?  And apparently, it seemed to be the same concern as that of the two officers who trained you in April.  And is it why they asked to you loot the vehicles on the 21st of April; am I correct? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Even if you're not Rwandan, I believe you can understand what the objective 
was -- and the objective was reached.  You should not shy away from reality.  The objective was the killings.  And we carried out the killings.  We obeyed the orders that were given to us by them, so they should be -- he should be held accountable for what he has done.  Truth -- the truth has to be told.  Whatever Colonel Renzaho thinks, you have played a role -- or you have played a part in what has been carried out.  And you should face the consequences just as we faced the consequences.  And you should tell the truth and confess to the crimes that we have committed -- just as I did, and I believe God will forgive us.  
Q.	Witness, let us talk about this looting campaign.  Could you remind the Trial Chamber of the circumstances under which you found Colonel Renzaho and Major Munyakaze? 
A.	Are you referring to the looting at Technoserve or the looting of the private residences, because we looted private residences as well as the Technoserve facilities?
Q.	Witness, you referred to the looting of vehicles in CELA on the 21st of April 1994.  I'm only referring to what you yourself mentioned here in this courtroom.  Could you please tell the Trial Chamber under which circumstances you found Mr. Renzaho and Major Munyakaze on the site? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When these two people arrived at CELA for the looting, the operation was the first one.  It was followed by another one -- an operation where we killed around 60 people.  I told you that the attack left from Angeline's place and I also told you that I went there on foot, whereas the two individuals had gone on board their vehicle and I also specified that on that occasion we killed two watchmen.  I believe I went into the details of this operation.  I do not know what additional information you wish to get.  I believe even the President was satisfied with the explanations I had provided.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and I'm satisfied to note that Technoserve is number 273 on the spelling list.  

Shall we ask next question?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when was it exactly that you saw Commander Bivamvagara join Mr. Renzaho and Major Munyakaze? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, when I reached CELA and when the two gentlemen arrived, Major Bivamvagara was not -- had not arrived yet.  And when he arrived, it was Lieutenant Claude who knew 
Major Bivamvagara, who told me that that man who was coming was Major Patrice Bivamvagara.  Subsequently I met him on several occasions because he would come and visit us in our headquarters, and he would come from time to time on our different positions.  And it is under such circumstances that I met Bivamvagara.  But I knew Renzaho before the war, whereas for -- regarding Major Munyakaze, I had never met him before the war.  It was during the war that I'd met him.  

Let me add that there is one other official who would come to Angeline's house -- even before the war and whom I met on that occasion.  But I would not wish to disclose his identity here for -- in view of my personal security, because he is one of the leaders of the country today.  But I promise you that I will take -- I will make your task easier and provide you with the explanations you require in order for you to understand how the Rwanda -- the genocide in Rwanda was perpetrated in the Rugenge secteur. 
Q.	Witness, when Major Bivamvagara arrived had you already killed the two watchmen -- and could you tell us whether they were, indeed, gendarmes? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When Bivamvagara arrived, the gendarmes had not yet been shot down.  They were shot when we were ordered to enter the centre to get the vehicles, and when they tried to oppose us -- and that was when they were shot.  There was no other solution.  
Q.	And you testified that Mr. Renzaho and Major Munyakaze were escorted by six gendarmes, am I correct? 
A.	I believe I was right when I gave you this number.  I had already referred to it and I notice that you are backtracking.  But, Counsel, did I not mention it in my statements?  Those were the explanations I had promised to give you.  I had promised that I would provide explanations as I went along in my 
testimony -- and if you refer to my previous statements, you will not find this information anywhere.  
Q.	Witness, I would like us to understand one another.  You are describing an event to us which starts at Mrs. Mukandituye's house where Renzaho and Munyakaze arrived with an escort of six gendarmes.  They leave that place and go to CELA.  And then you joined them there and once you joined them, the six gendarmes are no longer with them? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel -- but Counsel, if you were a soldier, do you believe you would be able to abandon your chief without being punished?  This is a childish question, Counsel.  You should understand that obviously the gendarmes were still there.  
Q.	Witness, perhaps you should be more polite because I believe there is no need for such sarcasm.  
Do we agree? 
A.	Counsel, I believe I'm answering your questions.  And this -- and taking into account the suggestion made by the President, and I'm doing so for us to be able to make progress.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the best progress is made if we all observe a minimum level of decorum and politeness.  

May I ask you, the word "Bivamvagara".  He's on the spelling list in the English version spelt with an M, just like Mike.  But sometimes it's written with N, just like Nelson.  What shall we adopt in this courtroom?  There are two versions. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I didn't know, Your Honour, that there was another version.  So I will just promote the M. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are in favour of the M.  

Your recollection, Mr. Witness, is that Bivamvagara is written with an M, is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Bivamvagara is spelt with an M as in Mike.  It is spelt B-I -- let me repeat so that you can better take note of the spelling of his name -- even if I do not really understand the question that was put to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have now very kindly assisted us -- and, with other words, in the French version, we have to change to Bivamvagara, not Bivanvagara.  Thank you.  

Now, the next question, please? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, according to you to which corp did Major Munyakaze belong in the army?  Was he a gendarme, or was he an officer of the Rwandan armed forces -- if this is to your recollection? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe Munyakaze would sometimes come without a beret, so it was not possible to know whether he was an officer of the army or of the gendarmerie.  Because the gendarmes would wear red berets whereas the officers of the army would wear black berets, and they could also wear some that were in camouflage material that was also worn by the officers of the gendarmerie.  

So it was very difficult to determine whether he belonged to the army or to the gendarmerie.  And, on some occasions, he would even be wearing civilian clothes, so it was very difficult to be able to make a distinction between the officers of the army and that of the gendarmerie.  It was much easier to know who was who with the rank and file.  I don't know whether you have any suggestion to put to me regarding the unit to which this officer belonged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine, try to speak a bit more slowly, Mr. Witness. 

Next question?  
JUDGE ARREY:
Yes, but what colour of beret was he wearing?  Was it red or a dark colour?
THE WITNESS:
I saw him with a red beret. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Red is worn by gendarmes, isn't it?  Just like in my country. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the gendarmes would wear red berets.  On some occasions I saw him with a red beret and on others with a camouflage beret.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The microphone of Your Honour.
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, Witness, you knew that Major Munyakaze was a gendarme officer, and on that 21st of April 1994, as it was observed, he was escorted by six gendarmes.  Do you think it was impossible for him to order those two watchmen to open the gate and then they will not comply immediately? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  They remained in the vehicle and told us to go and loot the vehicles at CELA.  And when the gendarmes -- who wanted to oppose us, the Interahamwe shot at them.  So after they observed that situation, the officers did not tell us anything.  We were the ones who shot at those people, not the gendarmes.  They did not want to open the gate, so we shot at them.  We wanted to appropriate those vehicles.  We had never possessed any vehicles, so it was a windfall for us.  
Q.	But Witness, I believed -- I understood that you were ordered to shoot at those people.  Who gave you that order when you arrived there? 
A.	It was Claude who ordered us to shoot at those people; he was our leader.  We could not disobey that order.  
Q.	So Claude, who was a reserve officer, deemed it not necessary to go and see the leader of the gendarmes who was nearby and to request him to order those two gendarmes, who seemed to be putting up a resistance, to comply with the orders which you had been given? 
A.	I'm not Claude, we simply obeyed the order he gave us.  I don't know what his reasoning was.  I think the answer is easy.  
Q.	And according to you, Witness, what can be proven that in the presence of those two officers, who were the leaders of the gendarmes, Claude gave you the order to shoot the other gendarmes.  What do you think can enable the Trial Chamber to be convinced about what you're saying? 
A.	Counsel, those were not the only gendarmes or soldiers who were shot down by Interahamwe.  Even a soldier who resembled a Tutsi was killed.  There were others whom we shot down throughout that war period.  I can give you another example of a gendarme we killed.  And we did not face any consequences during that period and we fulfilled our set objectives.  I think the answer is very clear.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, you were able to kill lots of gendarmes, but the problem here is that you do so under the orders and authorities of two officers who were the leaders of those gendarmes.  How can you explain that?  How do you think that can be possible? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It was Claude who ordered us to shoot and it is true that we shot the gendarmes in the presence of those officers and they did not tell us anything.  But the order had come from Claude.  I wonder whether your understanding what I'm saying.  
Q.	And for you, the sole purpose of eliminating those gendarmes was to loot the vehicles.  By the way, how many vehicles did you loot at CELA on that day, Witness? 
A.	We looted all the vehicles which were there.  I did not count the number of vehicles.  Personally, **********************************.  And apart from those two gendarmes, we did not kill anyone else.  
*************************************************************************************.  All the vehicles at CELA were looted.  I don't know how many vehicles there were.  We were told to take all the vehicles at CELA.  So we would get in, take the vehicle and leave.  Perhaps, those responsible for managing CELA would be able to give you a figure since they knew the number of vehicles which were at their parking lot. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you see the problem here, Mr. Witness?  What we need to understand is how Claude could order the killing of gendarmes in the presence of gendarme officers, who would then be assumed to protect their rank-and-file gendarmes?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm going to answer your question.  Those officers had remained on the tarmac road with -- inside their vehicle.  Now, if you see the distance between the tarmac road and the CELA gate, you understand that Claude did not have to go and seek decisions -- authorisation from those officers before he ordered us to go and shoot at those gendarmes.  They told us to go and get those vehicles.  When we got to the gate, the gendarmes prevented us from entering and Claude asked us to shoot.  After that, the officers simply observed that the gendarmes were dead; they didn't tell us anything.

Now, Mr. President, you understand that during the war we were blindly obeying orders without asking questions.  When we're asked to shoot, we shot -- without thinking otherwise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And remember the speed, all of us.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I'll do that, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	But, Witness, from what I understand from your evidence-in-chief, you were ***************************************.  And now you say you are unable to count the number of vehicles which were looted on that day, whereas *********************************************************** such an exercise.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I'm going to give you the list of vehicles which we took from that place to Angeline's home.  There were four vehicles at Angeline's place which we had looted at CELA.  So, there were four vehicles:  There was the red Hiace driven by Lambert, son of Leon Mucakari -- that was one of the vehicles looted at CELA.  
Q.	At last, Witness, your memory is coming back to you, but how can you explain to the Chamber how you looted the vehicles?  Did you have the keys of the various vehicles? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  We did not need any keys to start the vehicles; we simply connected the cables in order for them to start.  There were other vehicles which we appropriated from the owners -- for those we had the contact keys.  But for the other vehicles, we simply cut and connected cables.  
Q.	Witness, do you think that at that time Préfet Renzaho had vehicles at his disposal at the PVK? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I don't know whether there were vehicles at his disposal, but I'm telling you all the vehicles he placed at our disposal.  I did not go and see what were the préfet's working conditions at the préfecture office; I'm talking about the operations we carried out -- not what happened at the préfecture office.  I'm giving you an account of what happened at the CELA centre.  
Q.	Honestly, Witness, do you think that it was difficult -- not only for the préfet, but for the gendarmerie boss to get four vehicles and place them at your disposal, rather than go away to loot at CELA? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you.  That was not difficult.  Do you think it was more difficult for those people to give us the vehicles -- or it was more difficult to give us Tutsi?  They said we owned everything.  We even looted some vehicles owned by Tutsi and we occupied the houses of those Tutsi; that was not difficult at all.  
Q.	So it -- if it was not difficult for them to get vehicles for you without you having to go to CELA, how do you explain that they took you to CELA and authorised you to kill two gendarmes without any reaction from the FAR?  
A.	Counsel, all those operations were conducted hand in hand -- both the killings and the lootings.  In fact, they were conducted almost simultaneously.  You see, some of us were poor.  We were young people without resources.  So, it was very easy for us to kill people and take their property -- given that we would not suffer any consequences.  We took over certain homes of Tutsi.  We set their houses on fire and we destroyed some of their houses -- we even drove vehicles belonging to Tutsi.  So, there is nothing surprising that we would go and loot vehicles at CELA.  Besides, there are other buildings which were plundered.  For instance, La Rwandaise was looted.  We even looted and used UNAMIR vehicles.  We had been given the right to appropriate all types of property -- vehicles and even foodstuff.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are speaking too fast.  You see, when you speak so fast, it will be a challenge to interpret what you are saying and transcribe what you're saying and we want it all down on paper.  So, please slow down.  All right? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am sorry.  I'm going to speak very, very slowly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Counsel?
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, if you want, we can move to what you did the following day -- that is, the 
22nd of April 1994.  Witness, kindly refresh our recollection regarding the exact time when you started off that campaign of the 22nd of April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  We started that campaign in the morning.  In my testimony I did not give a specific time.  I told you it was around 8 o'clock that the operation kicked off.  So it all started in the morning and went on until the afternoon.  
Q.	And you said that the one leading your detachment that day, once again, was Mr. Renzaho; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Witness, would you remember whether that day Renzaho was also accompanied by Mr. Munyakaze? 
A.	Counsel, no mistake about that -- they were, indeed, together.  
Q.	I didn't quite hear you, Witness.  Do you say they were together on that 22nd of April 1994? 
A.	They were together during the attack against CELA on the 22nd of April 1994.  
Q.	But, Witness, you seemed to have omitted to mention that fact in chief.  Is that what we should understand? 
A.	Thank you, I did not forget to mention that.  I know that it appears even on my written statement.  So I did not forget that point of detail, I actually mentioned it.  
Q.	Is it your assertion that you mentioned it in chief? 
A.	Counsel, I've told you I cannot be mistaken because, you see, I was one of the players of what happened that day and I remember that it is in my written statement.  By the way, when I gave that written statement I did not know that one day I would personally testify before the Trial Chamber.  And I decided to be very detailed in my account of all the operations we conducted and I was relying on the confessions I have made.  And I did so voluntarily.  No one promised me anything for me to say all that.  So I am simply repeating what I had said before.  
Q.	Witness, kindly give me a simpler answer to my questions.  During your evidence-in-chief here, did you mention that Colonel Renzaho was accompanied by Mr. Laurent Munyakaze on the 22nd of April 1994?  That is a question you can answer with a yes or with a no. 
A.	Yes, I mentioned that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we have the transcripts. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, actually I just wanted him to confirm that and the transcripts will tell us who is mistaken and who is not. 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Jean Baigent)



1020H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, start by telling the Chamber how those two people were dressed when they arrived there, and in which vehicle they were.
A.	Counsel, on that day they came with three vehicles, one of which was a military vehicle, and the two others were pickup trucks.  So, there were three vehicles.  There were also those who got there in their own vehicles.  Personally, I trekked to CELA because it was not very far from Angeline's home.  So those were the vehicles which were there at CELA.  And after we had picked out the people to be killed, they left.  I believe I'd already mentioned this.  
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness, that the Defence would want you to speak at greater length about this.  When you say they came in one military vehicle and two pickup trucks, can you be more specific?  What type of military vehicle are you referring to, sir?  
A.	It was an -- it was a military jeep.  It was a military jeep. 
Q.	That military jeep you are referring to, is it the type of vehicle you would consider as armoured?  
A.	What I know is that it was a military vehicle, a jeep.  I don't quite understand what you mean by "armoured".  
Q.	Who was -- or, were in that jeep? 
A.	Your client, sir.  I mean Tharcisse Renzaho.  
Q.	How many people were with him in that vehicle?  
A.	There were two other people sitting at the rear, and he was sitting in front with the driver.  
Q.	And who were those in the pickup trucks? 
A.	Major Munyakaze was in one of those pickups.  They came to Angeline's, they got into the compound, and the jeep was very near the gate.  That is how I was able to know those inside the jeep.  So they entered into Angeline's home and held a meeting.  After the meeting, we were ordered to go and attack CELA.  Tharcisse Renzaho underscored that we had to go with our weapons.  He knew what would happen, and we usually obeyed orders.  I don't know how many vehicles left Angeline's place because I was distributing weapons.  It was after the operation that I was able to know who had actually taken part in that operation.  It was after the operation that I was able to know the number of Interahamwe who had been to CELA.  I was not charged with supervising soldiers, I was supervising the Interahamwe.  
Q.	So, as you are saying, Colonel Renzaho came in his jeep and he was with a driver beside him, and there were two soldiers in the rear.  Correct?  
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  
Q.	Witness, when -- on Friday, in answer to the question put to you by Prosecution counsel, you gave the answer I am going to read out to you, and I would like you to tell me after reading that portion whether there is an inconsistency between what you said then and what you are saying now.  

You -- this is what Prosecution counsel said:  "You said Mr. Renzaho came with Odette Nyirabagenzi.  So tell us in which vehicle they went to Angeline Mukandituye's place?" 

And this was your answer:  "They left in one vehicle".

But Witness, this morning you have forgotten about Odette Nyirabagenzi.  
A.	Counsel, you had asked me to tell you about those people who had come in those vehicles.  You did not ask me who had gone to Angeline's place.  If you had put that question to me, I would have mentioned Odette.  I am doing what the President has asked me to do, that is, to answer your question.  

If you had asked me who had attended that meeting pre the CELA attack, I would have answered you.  But I answered the question you put to me, Counsel.  You did not ask me whether Odette was there for me to tell you yes or no.  You did not ask me who had attended that meeting.  I am ready to give you the names of all the people who attended that meeting.  So there is no inconsistency between the answer I gave Prosecution counsel and what I am telling you.  I did not tell you that Odette did not attend that meeting.  Neither did I tell you that she did not participate at that attack.  You asked me that question regarding those two officers only.  Is that not so, Counsel?  
Q.	Witness, my problem is elsewhere.  You described the arrival of Mr. Renzaho on board a jeep, and you indicated who were -- who were the people who were with him, and I fail to understand why this does not tally with the description you provided on Friday and when you were placing Odette in the same vehicle as Mr. Renzaho.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I said that Odette was with Renzaho.  So Odette left with Renzaho when they were going to CELA.  Tharcisse Renzaho, the PVK préfet, left with Mrs. Odette Nyirabagenzi.  And when they arrived at the meeting, they left on board the vehicles I referred to.  And I told you that on some occasions, Odette would come with her own car.  But at the time they were leaving for CELA, they left together.  So there was -- there's no inconsistency compared to what I said to the Prosecutor.  What I'm doing is that I'm providing further explanations on what I already testified.  I promised that I would provide all the explanations necessary for things to be crystal clear.  
Q.	Witness, to conclude on this matter:  How did Odette Nyirabagenzi arrive at Angeline Mukandituye's house? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  We did not check how Nyirabagenzi arrived, and it was not our task to check Angeline Mukandituye's comings and goings.  But regarding Odette Nyirabagenzi, she could arrive at Angeline Mukandituye's house at any time, and we were not to check how she would arrive there.  
Q.	Witness, since you are referring to Major Munyakaze, could you tell the Trial Chamber what he was doing when you were all in CELA on this 22nd of April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You are asking me what Major Laurent Munyakaze was doing, but I thought I explained to you previously that I was not the one to give orders to these officers.  The orders would come from above, and would then be obeyed by the lower rungs, so I was not to pay attention to what the officers were doing.  Perhaps you should ask me what orders they gave us.  And I stated previously that if you were to ask me whether Renzaho had taken a firearm and shot down a person in my presence, I would tell you that I had never seen him do such a thing, but that, rather, he would give orders to our superiors, who in turn would give those orders to us.  

But let me say that Angeline Mukandituye, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Laurent Munyakaze, Renzaho, and Bivamvagara were always mentioned in my trial.  They were part of the same plan and they had the same objective, and the objective was reached.  Whether we were talking about the leaders of our secteur or the other people who collaborated with us, among which Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, they all participated in this plan to kill the Tutsis, and I am ready to explain how they participated in this plan and what was their part.  I was not the one to give orders, and I was not the one to entrust tasks to them.  That was not my role at all.  
Q.	Witness, it is indeed what the Defence would like you to do, describe this role.  On Friday you told us more or less what Mr. Renzaho was doing.  Now I'm asking you where Major Munyakaze was and what he was doing while you were busy doing what you described to us on Friday.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Renzaho would -- was doing the same thing as Major Munyakaze, as well as what Angeline Mukandituye and Odette Nyirabagenzi were doing.  Because their task was to supervise us in this operation of the killing of the Tutsis, like they had planned.  But please do not put questions to me on their intentions or on the other actions of these people.  I simply concentrated on the operation we were conducting, and we reached our objective.  
Q.	When you are saying that they were doing as the others were doing, what do you mean, Witness?  
A.	Well, that is no secret.  We were killers, and we would receive orders from these people.  They were killers just as we were.  They were the ones who would give us orders, they were the ones who sensitised us to commit killings.  You should not try to take them out of our group.  They were killers, just as we were, because they led us to kill innocent Tutsis.  I told you before what our objective was, but they had a plan which had been set up beforehand.  They were leaders, but I could not be aware of their true objectives.  I was not the one to give orders to them.  They were the ones who would give orders to us.  
Q.	Witness, these people, that is to say Mr. Renzaho and Mr. Munyakaze, what was their position when they would give you orders?  And did they also address the refugees?  Could you be more specific in your description of the events?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I already provided explanations on this event in my statement.  They were standing in the courtyard of CELA and they did not speak to the refugees since they had come animated with ill-intentions.  They had arrived there with the objective of committing killings.  
Q.	And do you know whether the refugees you were selecting were able to address them?  
A.	Thank you.  But how could the refugees have talked to them when we were beating them up and when we were leading them to their deaths?  The refugees could not even have approached them.  We were the ones who were beside them, and we were the ones to sort out those refugees that were to be killed.  And let me specify that they had not come there to talk to the refugees.  They had come there, rather, to supervise the selection of those among the refugees who were to be put to death.  And it was not out of pity that they were there.  
Q.	Witness, you testified on Friday that there were more than 100 refugees, which means that when you sorted out 70 out of the 100 refugees, there were not that many refugees left.  Am I correct?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not pay attention to the number of refugees who remained there, but I was rather paying attention to the number of refugees we abducted and we killed subsequently.  Whether there were few or many who remained there, that was not my concern.  My concern was what we were doing in order for me to be able to report to those who were giving orders to us.  There are people who survived this operation, just as there were survivors from other attacks we carried out.  

So I tried to give an estimation of the number of people we abducted, and the figure I gave you was of around 60 to 70 people.  And I also specified that at the outset there were approximately 100 of them.  But I also said that I had not counted them and that what I was providing was merely an estimate.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, do you recall whether among the people you abducted on that day, there was one Vincent Mugiraneza?  Which is spelt M-U-G-I-N-A-N-E-Z-A (sic), Mugiraneza.  Do you recall whether Vincent was amongst them?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When we abducted these people, we did not note down their names in any record book for me to be able to tell you today whether he was indeed one of those we abducted.  So my answer is quite simple:  I can give you the names of the people I was able to identify amongst those we abducted.  But as far as I know, I never made mention of Mugiraneza's name among the names of those people who were abducted on that day.  It might be that this Mugiraneza was among those we abducted, but I never made such a statement, and I believe I never referred to this name in my statement.  Would you, by any chance, have read that name in one of my statements?  

Counsel, I believe I'm still young and I believe I can still remember what I stated in my previous testimonies.  I confess that I perpetrated punishable acts, but I do recall the names of the people I referred to in my previous statements.  And as far as I know, this name was not mentioned by me.  However, I did give another name, that is to say, that of Zorro, and I would like to say once again that I'm here to speak the truth.  I am repeating what I said during my previous statements.  I requested that the Tribunal add the name of Zorro to the list I had provided previously.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have Zorro from Friday.  But now we must ensure that we do not simply repeat what we have heard before, but that we get the additional elements that we need.  So you must be briefer with your answers, Mr. Witness, and Defence counsel will focus on what he thinks is the essential.  
Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you, however, have the opportunity to talk about Vincent Mugiraneza in your own trial?  
A.	Did you say Vincent Mugiraneza?  Many questions were put to me, and I provided a lot of information which was useful to those who were affected by the genocide.  I believe the minutes of my trial could be covered in hundreds and hundreds of pages.  It is not only on Renzaho that I provided information.  But I am not ready to provide information contained in my trial statements, and I would not like such information to be disclosed today and be used against me in my own trial.  
Q.	Witness, on that 22nd of April of 1994, were you able to see Father Munyeshyaka at CELA?  
A.	No, I did not see him.  I did specify where I saw Munyeshyaka, but I did not see him at CELA on that date.  I already gave you the list of those who were present and whom I saw.  Let me say, simply, that I saw Jean Bizimana, who was the bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune.  So it was not Wenceslas Munyeshyaka.  And there are other people who have been charged with crimes -- or, who are being prosecuted, amongst which Gatsinzi and Bajinya, as well as Wenceslas Munyeshyaka himself, but I would not wish to mention the names here.  Perhaps I should focus on those facts for which his collaboration with Renzaho has been proven.  And I believe I shall limit myself to that, that is to say those events where Renzaho -- or, the events Renzaho has been charged with, and I would not like to talk about Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, because his trial has not commenced. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, once again, please try to focus in your answers.  Don't give these additional lengthy explanations.  Now, did you just refer to Mr. Gatsinzi?  Yes or no?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I did mention his name, and I would ask you to put that name under seal because I did not wish to provide such information.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was another name you mentioned just after that name.  Can you repeat that name, please?  This is in the context of people who are being prosecuted.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I referred to Vincent Bajinya, and I also talked about Jean Bizimana, whose trials have not started.  So I gave three names.  I talked about Gatsinzi, about Bizimana and Bajinya.  But I would humbly ask that the names be put under seal, because their trials have not yet started.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have the spelling of that name?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you help us with that last name, please, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Bajinya is spelt B-A-J-I-N-Y-A.  Bajinya.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when you state having seen Mr. Jean Bizimana, the former bourgmestre, let us call him that way, do you remember exactly when you saw him?  Did he arrive while Mr. Renzaho was still on the site, or not?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It is clear, even in my statement, Bizimana arrived once Renzaho had left.  And in my statement I also referred to questions that were put to him upon his arrival, as well as to the answers he provided.  
Q.	And when Mr. Renzaho was leaving, did he leave with Major Munyakaze, and had the refugees you had sorted out already been taken away?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There were three successive phases to our operation.  First we had the refugees come out, then we selected them, then we beat them.  And after that we put them on board vehicles and went off to kill them.  We took the refugees out in the presence of Renzaho.  We selected them and we started beating them, and it is at that point that Angeline ordered that we take them to CND to kill them.  And the order was given in the presence of Renzaho.  We were strong enough, we had weapons, and it was obvious that the refugees would not oppose us.  So Renzaho had no reason to go with us -- or, stay with us until the end of the operation.  So that was what happened.  Unless you are disputing the existence of such an operation.  
Q.	Witness, you are stating that you were the last one to remain on the site, and you are not in a position to tell the Trial Chamber what came of the refugees who had stayed there?  
A.	Thank you.  The refugees who remained after we took the group I already mentioned away, those who remained were not worried, because no one attacked the refugees who remained there.  But let me say that it was a real ordeal for the refugees who remained there.  Some tried to take refuge at the Saint Paul centre, and the others disbursed.  I was even able to see some of the refugees at the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille site, because they disbursed after that operation was conducted.  

And I recall that one of these refugees went to Bourgmestre Jean Bizimana, and the name of that person was Rose Murorunkwere, and she was the wife of Charles Rwanga who had been selected to be abducted.  And on that occasion the lady asked Bizimana, "Where did you take our family members?"  Bizimana did not answer, and sometime later Bizimana left.  So this is what I stated previously.  That lady's husband had been selected amongst those who were abducted to be killed.  
***************************************, passing -- or, rather, using the tarmac road at the location called Péage, and I even saw dead bodies at that location.  It took me 15 minutes to go to the area where the killings were taking place and which had been nicknamed CND.  I shall stop here in order not to repeat myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have had Rose in the courtroom previously, but could you kindly repeat the spelling of that name, Mr. Witness?  Her last name.  
THE WITNESS: 
Her surname is Murorunkwere, which is spelt M-U-R-O-R-U-N-K-W-E-R-E.  Murorunkwere.  And her first name was Rose.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I have two further questions to conclude on this matter, and I believe it would be better to deal with it now so that we can deal with a separate matter when we resume.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, do you know whether on this 22nd of April 1994 there were gendarmes guarding CELA when you arrived?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I arrived there, I did not see any gendarmes.  I only saw the Interahamwe who were participating in the operation.  I did not see any gendarmes.  
Q.	So, on the 21st of April, CELA was guarded by gendarmes, but not on the 22nd; is that your testimony?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I do not know whether there were gendarmes watching over the centre.  I told you about the gendarmes who were at the gate and who did not want to open to us, and -- open the gates to us and who were subsequently shot down.  But I did not try to ascertain whether the centre was guarded by gendarmes or not.  And on the 22nd of April, I did not see any.  Let me say that even on the 21st, I only saw the two gendarmes who had been -- who were shot down.  I do not know whether the commanders of the gendarmerie had sent other gendarmes to protect the centre.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I believe perhaps this time would be fitting to deal -- to break, because I shall deal with other matters once we resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Now, you gave a list, Prosecution, of the witnesses for this week a couple of days ago.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You mentioned six pseudonyms.  Did they all arrive?  

MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm afraid I don't have the list that I gave.  I think it -- as I explained to my learned friend, Mr. Cantier, this morning, there may be one person who's going to be brought forward from next week, and that is GLE, who has in fact arrived earlier than expected.  So we are now looking at, after this witness, DBN, followed by BUX, who is not in fact a protected witness.  Her name is Corinne Dufka, and the Defence are aware of that.  Followed by ACS.  And then it's possibly GLE, if that witness is ready.  If not, AWE.  Then ATQ and HAD are also lined up for this week.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  And the last name of BUX, can you spell that, please?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
D-U-F-K-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  So, our next witness is then DBN.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the estimated duration for the rest of this cross-examination now?  The witness is probably waiting in the waiting room?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, he's been here since 8:30.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I believe I will have one hour more at the maximum.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  Thank you.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1105H to 1130H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?
MR. NEKUIE: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us now look at your first major attack at the Saint Paul centre.  And in order for us to discuss this issue such that there would be no misunderstanding between us, I would like you to confirm to the Chamber the date of the attack.  As far as you remember, was that first major attack at Saint Paul centre in the month of May or the month of June 1994?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The last major attack which we launched against the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church was after the Inkotanyi had released or freed the refugees who were at those places.  I think the Inkotanyi came to that place in June, not in May.  That was the last attack we launched against those two places, the last major attack.  In fact, the most significant attack.  And it was during that last attack that many refugees were killed.  We do not have the exact number because some of them were killed during the night, and the others the following day in the month of June.  I believe I explained this last time. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  You are talking about the last attack, but my question to you was about the first attack against the Saint Paul centre.  As far as you remember, was it in May or in June 1994?  
A.	The first attack took place in May.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  And was it during that attack that you came with a list of people wanted at the Saint Paul centre?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It was during that attack that we used the list bearing, amongst others, Rukundo's name.  In fact, you are right.  That was the first attack against the Saint Paul centre during which we took away Rukundo and the others.  There were two attacks; the first one during which there was community work done, and another attack launched after the RPF had attacked the Saint Paul centre.  I don't quite understand which attack you are referring to, Counsel, the first or the second.  
Q.	I am referring to the first, Witness, and you have answered.  I simply want you now to confirm a last point.  Was it indeed that list that was signed by Mr. Jean Bizimana?  
A.	Counsel, I did not mention Mr. Jean Bizimana's signature, if you remember properly.  I, rather, talked about Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho's signature in relation to the murder of Kameya.  I think you are mixing up things here, Counsel.  
Q.	So, that list which you had with you that day was not signed by any of those people?  Not by Tharcisse Renzaho, not by Jean Bizimana?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I explained to you how Angeline and Odette were not able to agree on the people to be killed.  One of them said it was necessary to kill everybody, and the other person said, no, only those whose names were on the list were to be killed.  When Renzaho came they showed him their list, and it was on that occasion that the decision was taken to go by Angeline's list.  That was Renzaho's decision.  You see, Odette and Angeline could not agree, so it was Renzaho who solved that problem.  I explained to you how they went close to him.  I wonder if you did not construe me properly.  
Q.	Witness, now, please tell this Court whether there was any signature at the bottom of that list.  That is a new question I am putting to you.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I really don't know why you are focussing on this signature.  Let us, rather, talk about the operations which were carried out.  Let us talk about the people who were killed.  I wonder whether you are challenging the fact that Renzaho was there?  Were you there?  I don't know.  Let us not talk about the signature.  The list was there, and I saw it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are coming back to your bad habits.  We don't want argumentation; we want answers to the question.  The question he is asking is very relevant.  Now, the question is:  "Did you see that list yourself, and if so, was there a signature on the bottom of that document?"  
THE WITNESS: 
I actually saw the list which was in the hands of Madam Mukandituye, but there was no signature on that list.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, when you spoke in your evidence-in-chief about a document signed by Bizimana, you were referring to the arrest of the journalist, isn't it?  The arrest of a certain Michel, who you said was a journalist, when you go inside for reconnaissance.  Is that the document you are referring to?  I think we are all mixed up about this signature.  At least to my recollection, that's the only document you said was signed by Bizimana for Prefect Renzaho.  Am I right or wrong?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, in my evidence I talked about a document signed by Renzaho, and which was in the hands of Odette Nyirabagenzi when we were going to look for André Kameya at the Sainte Famille church.  That was not a list which had been given to Michel.  Michel, rather, had a picture of Kameya.  

And, Your Honour, I think Defence counsel's question concerned the attack against the Saint Paul centre.  We were not yet at the level of the incident concerning Mr. Kameya.  So that document was in connection with what had happened concerning Kameya.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as far as you can remember, who gave that list to Madam Angeline Mukandituye?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Angeline was our leader.  I cannot know who had given the list to her.  We were simply following instructions we had been given.  She showed us the list without explaining who had given the list to her.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to read to you a portion of your statement of 12th of September 2006, given to investigators of the Prosecutor, in which statement I believe you are referring to that first attack against Saint Paul centre, after which you will tell me what you think about it.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
The K number of that statement -- actually, I'm on page 8 of the French version of that statement, Your Honour, with the K reference K0378075.  K0378075 for the French version.  And the portion I want to refer to is the first and sixth lines of paragraph 3 on that page.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are now referring to a previous witness statement of this witness, which apparently is dated the 12th of September 2006.  Was that what we just heard you say?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Quite so, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If you look on page 7 of the summary in the Prosecution's bundle, there are two witness statements of this witness -- or, one dated the 9th of August 2006. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, actually, I think he signed just one statement, though he was interviewed several times, and the date he signed the document was 12th of September 2006.  I think -- as far as I am concerned, that was the only document disclosed to the Defence concerning this witness.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, it's a mistake in the summary.  The date is the 12th of September; it is the only statement of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  And now the pagination number, not the K reference.  Can you help us with that?  What is the page number?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, unless this is a mistake as well, it should be 1968 for the English, and 1980 for the French, which is what my learned friend is referring to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, now we have it.  Page 8 of the French version.  

There is only an English copy in my bundle.  Has anyone got the French version?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I have the French, but I don't have a copy of it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we could try page 8 of the English version, the bottom of page 8.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I think the French version comes in after the English version.  The pagination number, Mr. President, is PG001975.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It would have been nice to find the French version there; it is not.  Now I have page 8 of the English version as suggested by the interpreter, thank you.  

And what is the first sentence of that paragraph, just to find it in the English version.  Can you help me?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the first sentence is "Sometime in June 1994", in the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Very good, thank you.  Let's start now.  Thank you.  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, I am going to read out to you a small excerpt of that statement, starting as follows:  "Sometime in June 1994, I was involved in an attack on Saint Paul centre at which Renzaho was present."  I am going to skip what follows, because it is of no interest to me, and I will move to the next sentence.  

Well, let me read everything.  "...at which Renzaho was present."  And you continue as follows:  "I am not sure of the precise date.  Myself and about 50 other Interahamwe and many local people arrived at the Saint Paul at about 7 a.m. on the orders of Angeline Mukandituye, who had given us a list of Tutsi people to find and kill.  When we arrived at the Saint Paul, we could not find Father Munyeshyaka, whom we needed to help us to locate our victims."  

Let me stop the reading and put two questions to you, Witness.  Question number one:  Was it in June or in May 1994 that the attack took place, or are you referring to another attack?  

Question number two:  Was it not Father Munyeshyaka who drew up that list and subsequently gave it to you?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church site were attacked many times.  But regarding the Saint Paul centre, I mentioned two attacks.  The first one was launched under the guise of the community development work called umuganda, and the second one was the one following the raid launched by RPF troops.  

Concerning the list, it was not Munyeshyaka who drew it up.  It is true that Munyeshyaka was working together with us, but he was not the one who prepared that list.  Rather, as I told you, it was Munyeshyaka who had the key of the room where Emmanuel Rukundo was.  And in order to take Rukundo out of his hiding place, Yusuf (phonetic) Mazimpaka had to put on the cassock of a priest so as to mislead Emmanuel Rukundo.  So, there were two attacks, the first of which took place in May, and the second in June.  
Q.	That attack which, in your statement, you place in June 1994, and which concerned a list in the presence of Renzaho, according to you, would that one be during the first attack or the second attack?  
A.	That list was used during the first attack.  During the second attack, there was no list.  I don't know how what I said was recorded, but I am giving you an account of the operation like someone who was present in and participated in the attack, or the operation.  I am saying this to you because I was a player, but you should understand that I was not the one who recorded my statement.  

So I am explaining to you how the two operations were conducted.  We launched the first attack in May, and there was a second attack in June at that same centre, as well as the Sainte Famille church.  And each of those attacks had a specific objective.  That, however, does not rule out the fact that there were other attacks launched by small groups with their own objectives.  
Q.	Am I to consider that the Prosecutor has included a wrong statement in your statement dated 12th of September 2006?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I do not know whether it was the Prosecutor who took note of my statement.  I told you under what circumstances my statement was given, and I do not know how this statement was processed.  But you should not concentrate on the amendments or possible manipulations on this statement, but you should, rather, focus on the testimony I am giving today.  Because I am speaking as a person who was present on the site and who acted.  I provided sufficient explanations to you.  I do know that sometimes there might be problems which arise from the translation, but I am present in this courtroom today and I would like you to take into account the version of the events -- the account of the events I am giving to you today.  

The operations took place, and I am not the only person who is in a position to tell you what happened.  I was not the only attacker.  And on the side of the survivors, there were a number of people who survived.  There are other persons who are in a position to confirm what I am stating.  Perhaps you should focus on the explanations I am providing.  I am present before you today, and I am willing to give you all the explanations you might require because I was there when the operations took place.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must again appeal to you, Mr. Witness, not to give these long answers.  Just answer the questions without the comments, and then your testimony will soon be over.  All right?  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well, Mr. President.  But if I give long answers, it is because the questions given to me by Defence counsel require that such long explanations be given, because he was not present and he needs to understand what occurred during the operations.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, were you aware, on that date, of who -- of which priest was in charge of the Saint Paul centre?  
A.	Counsel, we knew who we were working with, it was Munyeshyaka.  Don't put questions to me on the responsibilities of the other priests; I am not aware of them.  We would collaborate with Father Munyeshyaka, and he was ready to grant us all that we requested from him.  
Q.	And on that day you did not see any other priest on the site?  Since Father Munyeshyaka was not there, did you find another priest?  
A.	I told you about the people we would collaborate with during that time, but that does not mean that Munyeshyaka was not present on the site and that we did not see him.  This does not, either, mean that we had problems in the conduct of our operation.  We decided to have the people we were looking for come out, and we were able to reach our objective.  But I did not see any other priest.  
Q.	Witness, when you went to the Saint Paul centre on that day, you did not find any gendarmes or leaders there, and you immediately entered the premises with your list; is that what we are to understand?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I explained how we entered the Saint Paul centre for that first attack, with the pretext of carrying out umuganda.  We were with the Interahamwe, as well as the members of the population, and I already explained to you what our objective was.  So we did not need anyone.  We entered the centre and we started to seek -- or, to hunt down the Inyenzi, the pretext being that they would shoot at us all night long.  And if you wish for me to repeat my explanation, I shall do so, just as I did on the previous occasion when the question was put to me.  
Q.	Witness, let us now move on to the case of journalist André Kameya.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, may I ask you for clarification.  You said that:  "Father Munyeshyaka was ready to grant us all that we requested from him".  What did you mean by that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka is one of the people who assisted us in our operations, in the killings we would perpetrate in the religious centres.  And as I stated previously, the information on the Tutsis who were at the Saint Paul centre, or at Sainte Famille, or CELA, were provided by Munyeshyaka to Angeline.  And that would enable us to prepare our operations.  Furthermore, Munyeshyaka is one of the people we would go to in order to locate the people we were looking for.  He would provide information to us, and the information he provided would be reliable and would enable us to locate the Tutsis we were looking for, and then we would go and kill them.  

So Wenceslas Munyeshyaka is one of those who provided assistance to us, and he also delivered foodstuffs to us.  During that period, Munyeshyaka would deliver some foodstuffs to us, and the foodstuffs were kept in containers located at the Saint Paul centre.  And there was porridge, for example, that he would deliver to us.  Munyeshyaka was a great friend of Angeline's and he always assisted us because he was quite active.  And when we were trying to enter the site of Sainte Famille church, he did not oppose that because he was collaborating with us.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
I also thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, since you are referring to Father Munyeshyaka, did you know that at the time he supplied the refugees who were in the area, under the control of the RPF, with goods, foodstuffs?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was not aware of that.  All that I can tell you on this matter is that the refugees who were given food were the Hutu refugees who were in the courtyard.  And I can give you the name of the individual who would provide the foodstuffs to these refugees.  He made a number of statements on Munyeshyaka, on Renzaho, as well as on the person who was in charge of the store at the time.  And you can also interview Augustin Rutabana, who was responsible for the feeding of the Hutu refugees. 

You are referring to the food -- the assistance in terms of food provided to the Tutsi refugees, but that was no concern of mine.  My task was to kill them.  And when I arrived on the location, I do not believe I even saw -- I do not believe they even had water to drink.  So this is my answer to your question, Counsel.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the witness has referred to a name and I do not know whether the Trial Chamber would like it to be spelt out before I continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It may not be available in both languages.  Can you help us to identify the name, please?  Are you referring to the name starting with Augustin?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do we agree, Mr. Witness, that that is spelt R-U-T-A-B-A-N-A?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
(Pages 17 to 31 by Kirstin McLean)









1215H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, to conclude on this aside on Father Munyeshyaka.  As far as you know, were there refugees in Sainte Famille who died of hunger? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I would go to that centre to abduct the refugees we would subsequently kill.  Perhaps some of them died of hunger or of thirst, because all those refugees were Tutsis, and Munyeshyaka did not like them and did not want to see them at that location, and they were in a centre that was led by him.  I already told you about the group of refugees who were given assistance and the other group who were not.  My mission was to kill the Tutsis, it was not to determine whether the Tutsis had received food or drink.  Under such circumstances, there might have been some of them who died of hunger, and there are even Tutsis who died of hunger in their very own houses because they could not supply themselves with food.  So I cannot deny that there might have been refugees who died of hunger on those sites where refugees were harboured.  
Q.	Witness, let us come back to the issue of journalist André Kameya.  You testified before this Trial Chamber that a photograph of this journalist had been provided -- brought to you while you were on your reconnaissance mission.  Am I correct?  
A.	Counsel, me and the people who were with me from **************************, were conducting a reconnaissance mission that was -- that we were ordered to carry out by Angeline.  So we were looking for those Tutsis who had escaped from us, so we did not go with Michel on this reconnaissance mission. He found us there, and that is why I paid attention to the reason for which he was coming there.  And he arrived with a photograph of André Kameya.  This is what I testified to.  I have just explained to you why I was there and under what circumstances Michel joined us on the site.  I asked him what was happening, and he gave me explanations, and then we went to the vehicle in which Angeline was.  We had André Kameya aboard the vehicle, and the vehicle went back. 
Q.	So what you called "reconnaissance mission" at the time was, in fact, looking for those Tutsis who had escaped.  Am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, because our mission was to hunt them down and kill them. 
Q.	You stated that Angeline would read out the contents of the document where André Kameya's name was and which also bore Mr. Renzaho's signature.  Were you able to hear what Odette Nyirabagenzi was reading out on that day?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You are mistaken.  There is a confusion between Odette Nyirabagenzi's name and Angeline.  It was Odette Nyirabagenzi who brought Kameya and not Angeline.  
Q.	Yes, I meant Odette.  Please answer my question.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please remember the speed, Mr. Witness.  Not too fast.  And now the question.  

BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, Witness, I was asking whether you had heard Odette Nyirabagenzi reading out the document where the name of Mr. Kameya and Mr. Renzaho's signature appeared?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  This will be my answer.  Apart from the fact that I did see André Kameya's name and that I saw Renzaho's name at the bottom of the document, as I stated, I did not pay attention -- or, rather, I did not read the whole document.  And that was the explanation I gave you, because it was not my responsibility to supervise those who were, in fact, my superiors.  Odette was one of my superiors, and it is for that reason that I stated having seen that a document was given to Odette and that I saw her reading the document when she was in the cabin of the vehicle.  And on that document there was André Kameya's name and at the bottom of the document there was Renzaho's name.  And it is for that reason that I stated in no uncertain terms that it was Renzaho who had handed over André Kameya to Odette.  So this was what I was an eyewitness to, and the operation was carried out by myself and those who were with me.  
Q.	Witness, was Odette reading that document out loud for those who were around her or in silence, and in what language was the document written? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There was no one else following what she was reading because her mission was to locate André Kameya. She located him and she took him elsewhere.  So she would not have been reading out the document to me.  She was reading the document to herself, and when I took a look at the document, I saw the two names.  If anyone were to give you a different version of the facts, you should consider it a lie, because I am testifying on events I participated in and events I eyewitnessed.  I would not wish to mislead the Trial Chamber.  These are the events I witnessed.  
Q.	Witness, you referred to Laetitia Kameya when you -- when questions were put to you on André Kameya.  When was it that you got to know Laetitia Kameya?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I met Laetitia Kameya after the war.  And when we asked what was the relationship between that Laetitia and André Kameya, those who were with me told me that there was indeed -- that they were indeed related.  But let me say that the person who was killed was André Kameya.  And when I heard Laetitia Kameya's name subsequently, I was just curious and wished to know whether there was any relationship between that Laetitia and the André Kameya who had been killed.  
Q.	Did you also come to learn that André Kameya had a son whose name was Olivier? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not carry out any investigations on the family members of André Kameya, but we were asked to say what we had done and to also mention the incidents we had witnessed.  I had no other reason to take interest in the family members of Kameya.  I therefore don't know whether he has a son or not.  I do not know him.  
Q.	Witness, I have in my possession a document which I will have circulated in the courtroom.  It is an article dated 28th of August to -- 28th of August 1995 from Reporters sans Frontières in which Mr. Kameya's death or the circumstances thereof are described.  I shall first have the document distributed and then I shall put questions to you on the events that are contained in the said article.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page and paragraph, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I shall focus on a small part of page 20 and a brief part of page 21, and I shall not go any further.  This is what I would like to bring to the attention of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And on page 20, we start with which paragraph?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We shall start with the last-but-one paragraph, where it is said, "At the time, an officer in the Rwandan patriotic army".  On the fourth line of the last-but-one paragraph, 
"At the time, an officer in the Rwanda patriotic army Olivier Kameya."  

Fourth line, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, we found it.  We just want you to continue to read.  Just go ahead.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I will read out what Reporters sans Frontieres had to say about the assassination of André Kameya, and I quote: 

"At the time, an officer in the patriotic Rwandan army, Olivier Kameya, elder son of journalist André Kameya, director of Rwanda Rushya, assassinated on the 15th of June 1994 by the Interahamwe, accuses him of having told the militia members where his father was hiding.  He accuses Athanasie, and Olivier Kameya is quoted, "Athanasie came to Sainte Famille under the pretext that her brothers' Interahamwe wished to kill her.  Even though she was a Tutsi, Athanasie had brothers who were Interahamwe."

I shall not read out the next two lines, and go on to the last three lines of this quotation.  

"It was only when he came back to our neighbourhood that Kinyamateka, where André Kameya had sought refuge, started being attacked regularly by the same brothers of Athanasie.  'Tell us where Kameya is, since we know that he is here.  We are well informed.'  Would they tell the watch man." 

I shall not read out the testimony of the watchman, but will go to the last line, Mr. President, Your Honours, where we are told it has not been proven -- and this brings us to the next page -- that the latter was killed by the Interahamwe who looted Kinyamateka.  

MS. MELLUISH: 
I think that misrepresents what the document says.  It actually says "it isn't established".  It is no more established that this last person was killed by the Interahamwe that looted Kinyamateka.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where we are told that, "It has not been proven" (French spoken).  Just as he said in French, we have it in English.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am sorry, I didn't hear that said in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  No, he has spoken quite correctly.  But do we have it correctly on the record now?  

Why don't we do that again so there is no ambiguity?  Will you do that please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I am obliged to take the time to read the entire last paragraph for the purposes of consistency.  So I am going to read that last paragraph, which says as follows:  

"The watchman, Vincent Murefu" -- spelt M-U-R-E-F-U -- "partly confirms this observation of the account, especially the information to the effect that one of the militiamen who regularly attacked the head office of the Kinyamateka was most likely a brother to Athanasie, but does not explicitly accuse Athanasie, who herself never went to Kinyamateka.  In fact, I wanted to end at this stage, because page 21 is just a comment from Reporters sans Frontieres and is of no interest to me. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So I would like to stop at this stage here, and to tell you, Witness, André Kameya's own son states that his father was flushed out from Kinyamateka and subsequently killed.  But you are stating that it was at Saint Paul that you saw him and handed him over to Odette.  What do you have to say to the proposition I am putting to you?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I mentioned the Sainte Famille site and I maintain my evidence.  We saw her at -- saw him at the Sainte Famille church, not at the Saint Paul centre.  And, as you just read in this document, the person or persons talking are not categorical, but I am telling you of an incident which I witnessed.  I will understand you if you put it to me that André Kameya was not abducted.  But I am describing to you the beginning of the operation, how it unraveled, and what the objective was.  I gave you information regarding the circumstances under which the refugees were abducted from the CELA centre, the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church.  But you are telling me that those persons may not have been at the Sainte Famille church.  But I am really at a loss here because whenever I want -- or whenever I have to repeat my testimony, it pains me.  You see, the version I am giving you is what I had already given you because I was there.  I participated in the operation.  I was a member of Interahamwe, and I was the one participating at that operation.  Who else is better placed to tell you of the attacks than me?  I know the people who attacked the Kinyamateka building.  One of the attackers is called André Mugisha, and I can even give you the contents of his confession.  I can give you a copy of the confessions made regarding the massacres perpetrated in Rugenge secteur.  Rugenge is where I was born, where I grew up.  I know that area very well.  And some of the people committing those killings were people of the same age as me, people with whom I grew up.  Counsel, kindly take my version because it is the one which corresponds with the reality.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What happened a few minutes ago was that we read out something where there was an objection because of lack of clarity.  Then we recapitulated this, but by reading out the first part of the section, not the lines on which there was an objection.  Now, in order to dispel any doubt, even if it is true, as Defence counsel said, that the following two lines are comments by Reporters san Frontiers and not quotes from witnesses, I still think you should read those two lines so that we have this in context, otherwise the record will be unclear.  Can you read, kindly, from (no interpretation).  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am going to read it, Mr. President.  

"So there is no witness, nor is there evidence that Athanasie allegedly told the Interahamwe where Kameya was hiding.  Neither has it been proven that the latter was killed by the Interahamwe who looted Kinyamateka." 

The Defence is not disturbed by this portion, Mr. President, given that it will have the opportunity to establish that it was indeed at Kinyamateka where Mr. André Kameya was found and subsequently killed.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, it would be my wish for your answers to be shorter, but I am not going to interrupt you.  Just move on as you want.  

Do you remember, Witness, that during your own trial, the André Kameya matter was referred to and people were tried and judged regarding that matter? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was not charged in connection with Mr. Kameya's murder.  And I explained what happened regarding the accusations brought against me.  So, Mr. Kameya's case does not concern me.  I was not asked to give explanations regarding that incident.  I simply gave explanations regarding my own case, regarding specific questions put to me -- (Microphones overlapping). 
Q.	In order for us to move on, let me tell you what answer I am expecting from you.  Perhaps I misput my question.  During your own trial, were there certain people tried on account of the events at the CELA and the Sainte Famille?  Were there 56 co-accused with you or not?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  You are right.  There were other accused persons -- co-accused at my trial.  But some of them were not tried, either because they were not in the country or because they are dead.  But look at the document containing my confession, especially the top of the last page, and you will see the answer to your question.  It is true that there were people who were found guilty regarding those crimes.  I can give you their names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the answer to that question, was "yes", simply.  Here is the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, on that occasion, did you hear any mention of the case of the one Ntambara, Daniel -- N-D-A-M-B-A-R-A (sic), first name Daniel.  Did you hear any mention of his case or did you follow his trial in one way or the other?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I did not follow Daniel Ntambara's trial and I did not hear of him.  I don't know Ntambara. 
Q.	So if I were to put it to you that Daniel Ntambara is the one who admitted to have abducted Mr. André Kameya from Kinyamateka and killed him on the orders of Odette Nyirabagenzi, what would you say to that?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Now, you acknowledge that Kameya was abducted by Odette.  I know nothing about Ntambara.  I have told you the truth, and I notice that you have started understanding the truth.  I am not changing anything to my evidence because I was there.  I know nothing of the other people you are talking to me about.  
Q.	Witness, my proposition to you is that Daniel Ntambara acknowledged having abducted André Kameya from Kinyamateka, not from the Sainte Famille site as you are saying.  What do you have to say to that?  Whether Odette was at the centre of those two operations does not change anything.  What is your reaction when Ntambara confesses to the crime, whereas you keep on saying what you think? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I am not telling you what I think, I am giving you an account of what happened.  I know nothing about what you are saying.  I am giving you an account of things I witnessed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you ever heard of Daniel Ntambara, Mr. Witness?  Yes or no.  
THE WITNESS:
No, never.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us now move to the ultimate face of your war campaign, that is, that much talked about attack of the Inkotanyi of the night of the 16th to the 17th, and on that occasion you were indeed at the front.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I have explained to you where I was.  I believe my explanations were quite limpid.  How could I have gone to the front, whereas I was an Interahamwe?  The soldiers, gendarmes and Interahamwe worked together to prevent Inyenzi infiltrations.  I told you of the person who moved from one roadblock to the other explaining to us the operations which we had to carry out.  And I told you that on that day ******************* Interahamwe activities at the roadblocks.  On that day, Claude did not work, and I remember mentioning Lieutenant Cadence's name.  Our duty was to stop Tutsi or other people who did not have identity cards during the day and kill them.  And during the night we were to stay at the roadblocks.  And the other people assisted us in making sure no Inyenzi could escape from us.  I was not at the front.  I was not a soldier.  I don't know whether that is what you mean by "being at the front", Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, during that night, what tactical arrangement did you make, together with the soldiers who you were with.  And before answering you (sic), I would like to tell you that on page 28 of your transcript -- of the transcript of the trial of Friday, on lines 3 and 4, this is what you say:  "Whether it was a night attack or the attack the following day, I participated in those two attacks because it was a front, it was a war, and we operated as if it was a war."  So I am simply reading back to you your utterances, Witness.  And now I am asking you, since it was a war, what tactical arrangements did you employ?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I will not change anything in my testimony, rather, I will buttress it with more details.  The Inkotanyis attacked the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church.  I told you that they prevented us from shooting at them when they entered, and to wait until they went out of that centre.  That is the information you were seeking, Counsel.  I told you the location where we buried the people who were killed.  We buried them at the mass grave at Serutsinga's place. We shot at those Inkotanyi on their return after the attack.  And you understand that they fired back.  They also shot at us.  They took some refugees along with them.  Other refugees remained at the centre, and we killed them and buried their bodies in a mass grave which was at Mr. Serutsinga's place.  Another thing, when Cadence told us to gear up for that attack, he told us to be careful not to go to the Inkotanyi zone so as to avoid being killed.  So we had a discussion together on how to properly conduct the operation, given that the Inkotanyi had come to our zone.  

I explained to you how we shot at those Inkotanyi, and how the following morning we went and launched an attack against the Tutsi refugees who were in those centres.  I believe I have been elaborate enough.  
Q.	And at the end of that entire battle, there were only two persons killed amongst the Inkotanyi, and none of you were killed? 
A.	We were firing at the Inkotanyi, who were running and who were taking some refugees with them.  None of us died.  And the Inkotanyi were not dressed in their usual uniforms.  Subsequently, we realised that they were in RPA trousers.  That is how we were able to recognise those two Inkotanyi who had been killed -- by their uniforms.  We also killed two of the refugees who were going with the Inkotanyi. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to complete the last ten minutes in a closed session with the witness, because there were certain issues of identity which I would like to raise with him.  With your leave, of course.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 40 to 44] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).
(Pages 32 to 39 by Judith Baverstock)
































(Court resumed at 1450H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Re-examination, please.  
MS. MELLUISH:
I wonder if the registry or somebody can move the curtain back a little so I can see the witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Counsel for the Prosecution, before you start, I would like to request the Chamber to allow me time to handle my disclosure duties to the Prosecutor.  I was saying that the document I had was from the Prosecutor -- a disclosure from the Prosecutor.  And that was wrong information.  So I just want to correct that impression that I gave.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that.  And we will, of course, come back to the tendering of documents.  As soon as we have sent this witness out of the courtroom, then we will deal with the administrative matters.  But, now, we will hear the last part of the testimony.  

Prosecution?  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, an extract was read to you from the judgement against you, and the name Claudette Mujawabera was cited.  Could you tell us, please, is that person the same as the Claude that you have mentioned many times during your testimony?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness doesn't seem to hear the interpretation.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	I will repeat the question:  In the extracts from the judgement against you that were cited earlier, the name Claudette Mujawabera was referred to.  Could you clarify, please, for the Court, whether that person is the same or different from the character named Claude that you have talked about a lot during the course of your testimony? 
A.	Claudette Mujawabera, as you can see in the document containing my confession, was the secretary of the Interahamwe.  But since there was -- since there were problems relating to this judgement that you refer to, I mentioned her name.  She used to work with Angeline, Claude, and **********, and she herself recognised this -- admitted this.  This you can see on the list of the directors of the Interahamwe.  And you can find that at the bottom of this document that you are referring to.  
Q.	So is it right then that there are two people, Claude and Claudette, one is a man and one is a woman? 
A.	That is correct.  Claudette is the wife of Simon Pierre Niyoyita, whereas Claude is a man.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need these names, now.  Let's start with the last one, shall we?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
The last one it is in the document that was produced by the Defence.  It's N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you find that name in the three paragraphs that were read out?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, it's in the middle of those three on page 85.  And there also appears the spelling of Mujawabera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, then, in the transcripts, we have Mujawabera referred to as a man, not a woman, whereas -- 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mujawabera is a woman.  Claudette Mujawabera.  Claude is a man.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am aware of that, Mr. Witness, thank you.  I am just reading from the English version of the transcripts.  All right.  That's now clarified.  Is there any other name we need to spell?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, we are in open session at the moment so please don't refer to the position that you were appointed to.  But, when you were appointed to that position, can you recall how that appointment took place? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  Angeline Mukandituye told me this personally and then later on she informed my colleagues.  And in the evening of the 28th she explained that Claudette, too, had been appointed secretary of the Interahamwe.  This was in the month of April.  I was appointed to this position on the 20th of April 1994.  I recall clearly.  I cannot forget it.  It's a date I cannot forget.  
Q.	And when you were in that position was there any special clothing or equipment that you had that could identify you as being in that position to other members of the Interahamwe? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Defence feels constrained to object at this stage, because counsel for the Prosecution should not start the examination anew.  She should deal with issues that were dealt with by the witness in cross-examination and not to start a re-examination -- her examination-in-chief all over again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the last question actually arise from cross-examination, Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
In my submission, it does, Your Honour, because it is suggested by the Defence that the witness is in some way an impostor; that he was not in the position that he was in.  It is, in my submission, perfectly reasonable for me to elicit from him, as a result of that, any additional information that might convince the Judges that he isn't such an impostor.  I am not intending to labour the point, at all.  This is my last question, in fact, on that issue.  But I would say it is completely legitimate re-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you recall the question, Mr. Witness?  Can you answer, or shall I repeat?  
A.	You can repeat the question, Counsel.  
Q.	In the position that you say you were appointed to, did you have any special clothing or insignia or anything that might distinguish you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Melluish, can't you speak more slowly?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I am sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Anything that might distinguish you in that position in the eyes of other Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  There was no specific insignia I might have had to show that I was holding such a position.  Angeline announced it to the Interahamwe and introduced me to Claude and to Nkeshimana for us to be able to work together.  There was no campaign, there were no elections, as was done in the past before the genocide.  I was simply appointed during that exceptional period.  And when I deemed it necessary, I even wore the uniform of the Interahamwe and used the weapons I required.  But there was no specific insignia to prove to the others that I was holding such a position.  And, besides, everybody knew who I was.  My leaders knew, and some Interahamwe also.  Those who were often at Angeline's place knew that I was holding such a position.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, finally, Mr. Witness --  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the registry please provide the bundle of photographs to the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this arise from cross-examination?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Because, Your Honour, it was suggested for quite some time by the Defence in their questioning that this witness was not able to distinguish between different types of gun, and I simply want him to see if he can identify some of the guns photographed in this book.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the Defence did not make use of the pictures to deal with this matter with the witness, because the Defence deems that when one has received training, one does not require any photographs in order to be able to say what training one received.  So, I fail to understand why such an exercise should be carried out using the photographs.  So this is why we wish to object to this procedure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Here I am afraid I have to overrule the objection, because it is true that there are guns in these photographs, and it is arising in the sense of knowledge of guns, what we are now about, presumably, to hear.  

So which photograph do you go -- are you going to show us now, Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps if the witness could just look at the first photograph, number 1.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Are you able, Mr. Witness, to identify for the Court any of the weapons that we see -- the guns that we see photographed there? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  I can show you some specific types of weapons.  There is one firearm which is held by a person who has something in his mouth, and it is an RK gun -- R4, sorry.  And that person is holding the butt at his belt.  So this is an R4 type of weapon, the one I am just showing you.  

There is another person who is not very tall and who is wearing a beret and a camouflage dress.  That person has in his hand an Uzi gun, it was the same type of weapon that (unintelligible) had.  

And the person who is in the middle, and who is wearing a hat, a cap, also has a firearm that is not quite visible, but I can see that it is a Kalashnikov rifle  There are two magazines on this last weapon which are attached with a black piece of material.  

And then at the right-hand corner, there is another R4, but I am not positive about that one.  So R4, Kalashnikov, and Uzi, in the order I just indicated.  
Q.	Thank you, I have no further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We have reached the end of your evidence.  Thank you very much for having come the long way to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you also, Mr. President.  May God keep you and bless you.  May peace be with you.  
(Witness excused)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You started with the statement of 12 September 2006.  You want that in English and French.  The English version is signed by the witness and is the A version, French being the B version.  

Mr. Matemanga, next exhibit number for the Defence, please?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 14.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal, thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. 14A and D. 14B admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we have the document elaborated by Reporters sans Frontieres.  This document is an excerpt, namely, page 20 to 22 of a more general document.  Do you know when that general document was published?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Date of publication appears on the first page, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So my question is then, really, whether the 4th of July '94 to the 28th of August '95, which is 13 months, can be considered the date of the document?  My interpretation was, rather, that this was the relevant period.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  In fact, this is an annual report which was published in 1995 following work carried out from 1994 to 1995.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Published in '95.  All right.  That is noted.  

Ms. Melluish?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I do object to this being exhibited by the Defence.  It wasn't actually shown to the witness.  It was simply -- or, some of the words in it were referred to when he was asked to comment on the gist of the story.  He didn't recognise the document or anything of that sort.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am afraid we have to overrule this.  It was used; it was read out.  It was meant to be put to the witness, and it is legitimate to enter it.  
Next number, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 15.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. 15 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then there was the judgement of 24th October 2003, pages 85, 145, 146 and 168, plus the front page, apparently, page 1.  No problem with that?  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 16.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The fact that this witness's name appears amongst many would probably lead to it being placed under separate cover? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, I think so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 16 admitted, under seal)
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before the next witness is being brought in, I see that we are now approaching DBN, is that so?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it now clear that Alison Des Forges cannot testify during the present session and that there is a need to split this up?  Has there been any contact between the parties concerning the timing of Alison Des Forges, if she will at all testify?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, is it all right if I intervene here?  The situation is that we are awaiting the translation from her report which was filed a couple of weeks ago, from English into French.  So it's not a long report.  And even -- I think it's 16 pages.  We have identified the material which has already been translated from the report which has been used in other reports and given that to the translation service.  I think we got an indication last week that they hoped to have completed the translation by the end of last week or early this week.  But that hasn't -- it hasn't come through yet, and so we'll make some inquiries this afternoon as to what progress has been made.  So far as the effect of that, I suspect that my learned friends, once they receive the translation into French, I suspect they will be wanting some time to review that in French.  

She was -- Alison Des Forges was initially scheduled to come during the week of the 21st of February; that was on the basis we were doing half days.  She is available the week after that.  As well, I have been in touch with her the last couple of days.  So she is also available during the last week of February.  And I can make inquiries to see if she is available during the week after that, as well.  She would be one -- if I can just indicate briefly, and put it on the record now, Your Honour -- it appears there is one of our witnesses, ACK, who we have been advised is to undergo an operation in the next week or two, and we are hoping to get a medical certificate to that effect today.  And we have drafted a motion, which we will be filing once we have the medical certificate, to request that that witness's evidence be heard by way of video link from Canada.  If it is subject to Your Honours' ruling in respect -- in regard to that and if that was granted, then it would be -- we would be, I think, asking for her to be given two or three weeks to recover from her operation.  And, so, that last week in February or if -- first week of March might be suitable -- her evidence is not long, perhaps an hour, hour and a half of testimony, and then cross-examination.  So there would be Dr. Des Forges, that witness -- Your Honours, have also indicated to date that you have not been prepared yet to admit the ************ because of concerns about it, where it came from.  We appear to have tracked down the person who made the tape, and we are in the process of trying to get a statement from that person.  And if that -- it may be that that evidence, which might take half an hour, we might also ask to be heard -- and we would be seeking to drop a witness, BX, who was another witness who was going to testify as to the identity of the speaker.  So it would be -- there is possibly a motion to add and drop a witness, which might also -- so, potentially, if I can say, Your Honours, at the end of next week, we expect to have completed all witnesses, subject to Dr. Des Forges, the sick witness, and this brief evidence as to who recorded that audio tape.  

I can confidently advise Your Honours that, subject to any time that may be spent arguing regarding Dr. Des Forges's expertise -- which I don't know if we are going to have a voir dire as to that, as has been the case in some of her -- before some of her testimony; but, subject to that, I would not expect to take more than half a day in leading her evidence.  So if -- I don't know if that assists Your Honours, perhaps half a day of testimony from her, half an hour -- if we are able to get this other witness, and Your Honours allow us to call this witness who taped, and perhaps an hour and a half, at most two hours, in respect of the witness who is currently ill.  So, there is perhaps a day's evidence in chief which may -- we -- which, subject to Your Honours' -- obviously Your Honours' obligations and the Court schedules, if there was time at the end of February or beginning of March, if that was more suitable to Your Honours, I am in Your Honours' hands regarding that.  I don't know if that assists you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Do you have any comments on this, Defence, concerning timing of this --  what could be a couple of days remainder?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President.  I am listening.  I am trying to make my own calculations.  But, for the time being, I have no specific observation to make on the projections that were given to us, especially regarding Witness Alison Des Forges.  I have just heard that half a day would be sufficient to the Prosecutor to examine her.  As far as we are concerned, I am not in a position to provide any estimation at this point in time because this would require that I have some knowledge of her expertise.  But if the projection focuses on late February, early March, I believe that would be correct, because then we will be able to observe the 21-day deadline regarding Mrs. Des Forges and will leave us time to prepare ourselves.  Because, as you well know, all the statements that she made in previous trials has been disclosed to us, and this requires a lot of work.  So I have no specific objection to make on the timetable that has been proposed to us. 
(Pages 45 to 52 by Judith Baverstock)






















1525H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All we can do now is to note what has been said, and in particular, the availability of the parties to hear the rest of the testimony, probably late February or early March.  Let me simply say that the dates that have been circulated -- namely, the 26th, 27th and 28th of February -- will not be possible because some of us are away those days.  So there will, then, be a need to look into the total court schedule, including Judge Arrey, who is sitting in Bikindi, and some other matters.  But the window that has been mentioned should be our aim, as it's suitable to both parties.  Thank you for this.

Let's, then, bring in the next witness, please.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness DBN in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth.  And the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness DBN in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document in front of you, Mr. Witness, bears your signature, isn't that correct?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that indeed is my signature. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 74. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 74 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution?  

MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I wonder if we could go into closed session for a matter of minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will do that. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 55 to 56] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 53 to 53 by Vicki Eastvold)































MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness DBN, we are now in open session, and your examination-in-chief continues.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, as of the 7th of April -- on the 7th of April, where were you?  
A.	I was outside Camp Kanombe. 
Q.	For how long did your battalion remain stationed there after the 7th of April?  
A.	I think we stayed there for about a year, because the RPF was shooting at us from Kabuga, Rusororo.  And when there was sustained firing, we were forced to leave that camp. 
Q.	I'm not sure if this is --
A.	We stayed there for about a month. 
Q.	Thank you.  And when you left, where did you go to?  
A.	We went in the direction of Kicukiro, and then towards the centre of Kigali town, and then we went to Gitarama. 
Q.	The 7th of April, did you know Tharcisse Renzaho? 
A.	I knew Renzaho because he was a member of that battalion.  We know that that was before he was appointed to his new position. 
Q.	And what position do you mean, when you say his "new position"?  
A.	Around '87, '88, '89, he was a member of the paracommando battalion.  Later, he was appointed préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture, and that is when he took leave of us. 
Q.	And do you recall when he was a member of that battalion, what position he held within the battalion? 
A.	He was known as the S3.  
Q.	Can you explain to the Court what that means, "S3"?  
A.	S3 is someone in charge of military operations within a battalion.  It is, therefore, the person who -- in other words, it is the person who is in charge of military tactics.  He was also in charge of all training within the battalion. 
Q.	And do you recall during that period of years what rank, or ranks, Renzaho held? 
A.	While he was in our battalion, he was, first of all, commander.  And then he was promoted to the rank of major.  Those are the various ranks that he had.  
Q.	And in April 1994, do you know what rank he held then? 
A.	In April 1994 he was a lieutenant colonel. 
Q.	Now, after the 7th of April, 1994, did you ever see Renzaho? 
A.	I saw him in the Kajagari neighbourhood downhill from the military camp. 
Q.	When was this that you saw him? 
A.	I saw him before noon. 
Q.	Are you able to assist with a day, or date, when you saw him? 
A.	Let me try to estimate, because that was a very long time ago.  This was, I believe, two days following the death of President Habyarimana, or possibly three days later. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This neighbourhood is on the spelling list as 98, "Kajagari" spelled with an R.  In other cases, sometimes it's spelled with an L, and sometimes even with an A before the K.  What shall we adopt in the present case?  Kajagali or Kajagari?
MS. MELLUISH: 
I've taken the spelling from the indictment, so it might be better in this case to stick with the R for consistency. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's do that for consistency.  We hereby adopt number 98, on the spelling list for this trial.  Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said you saw Renzaho in the Kajagari neighbourhood.  Can you tell us what you were doing when you saw him?
A.	I went out during that period.  I was going to give supplies -- deliver supplies to the soldiers stationed in the residence of President Habyarimana.  It was during that movement that I saw him.  
Q.	And can you tell us, please, where it was that you first saw Renzaho?  Where was he when you first saw him? 
A.	I went out of the camp going in the direction of Kajagari.  He was on the road Kigali-Kanombe, from Kigali to Kanombe, and I saw him aboard a vehicle at the turning, close to the military camp.  That is, the turning -- or the junction of the road coming from the town centre, and the one coming from the military camp.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you think you would be able to draw us a simple map of the area you're talking about? 
A.	Since you do not know the locality, I can try to draw a sketch.  
MS. MELLUISH:  
I wonder if the witness could be given some paper, and pen -- or I can give him paper if there isn't any available.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Unless there is an objection from any party, our preference would be that sketches are drawn up in connection with the preparatory meeting with the witness, and that it's just presented. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Certainly, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Almost done, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm just about finished, Mr. President.  

I've finished.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
We must ask the booth, kindly, to translate a few Kinyarwandan words.  

Shall we ask some questions now, please?  And then we can maybe come back to this sketch, if you need it, when it's all copied with the translation on the map.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you drew a picture of a little car and you wrote "Renzaho".  I saw that on the map.  
Is that -- did you mark that to show where you first saw him, in answer to my question, or is that showing something else?  
A.	Yes.  I wanted to indicate the direction he was coming from when I saw him the first time. 
Q.	And referring, if you could, to your map -- I know you haven't got it in front of you, but if you'd just tell the Court where on your map you were when you saw him there.  
A.	I've also indicated my position by drawing a larger -- a bigger vehicle, and I wrote on that vehicle "witness". 
Q.	And at that time, can you describe what Renzaho was doing when you saw him? 
A.	You want to know what he was doing?  He was in his vehicle, and he was coming from the Kigali town centre on his way -- going the direction of Kajagari.  Since I was also going in that direction, I let him go ahead of me, and I followed him.  
Q.	What kind of vehicle was he traveling in, if you recall?  
A.	He was aboard a Hilux vehicle, a four-wheel drive, white in colour. 
Q.	And how is it that you knew that it was Renzaho in that vehicle? 
A.	I've spent sufficient number of years with him to be able to recognise him.  Even at night I'm sure I can recognise him.  
Q.	And can you tell us, if you recall, was he alone or with others in that vehicle? 
A.	In the back cabin of this vehicle, there were Interahamwes wearing kitenge.  Several Interahamwes. 
Q.	Are you able to estimate the number? 
A.	Between 20 and 30.  
Q.	And can you describe for us what these Interahamwe were doing? 
A.	The Interahamwe were in the vehicle.  They were singing and whistling.  Some of them were almost perched on the vehicle.  That is what I saw.
Q.	Do you recall what they were singing? 
A.	They were chanting Tubatsembetsembe, which means "Let's exterminate these Inyenzi Inkotanyi".  
Q.	Now, when Renzaho's vehicle reached the crossroads, in which direction did he go? 
A.	He proceeded towards the -- he proceeded downhill.  I have not indicated that on the sketch.  But that was in the direction of the Kajagari neighbourhood. 
Q.	You told us that you allowed him to go ahead of you, and you followed.  Were there any other vehicles, or people, or anything in between your vehicle and his when you were following?  
A.	No.  There were no other vehicles between us.  But when he was going downhill, there was another vehicle that came from the president's residence.  I let it pass.  But in the meantime, Renzaho had gone ahead, and I followed him.  And between him and my vehicle -- between his vehicle and my vehicle, there was no other.  
Q.	Do you know where he went in his vehicle?  
A.	The Kajagari neighbourhood is a trading centre, a commercial centre.  He moved in that direction.  
Q.	You said that you let him go ahead.  Did you catch up with him at any point? 
A.	Yes.  Since I was going further than him, I got close to his vehicle when he stopped in the Kajagari neighbourhood.  And since the road was narrow, I had to stop myself.  
Q.	Do you know why the préfet's vehicle stopped?  
A.	I realised that the vehicle stopped, and the Interahamwe were -- who were at the rear of the vehicle got off and went into the various houses.  I saw the Interahamwe entering the buildings. 
Q.	Now, you say you realised that the vehicle stopped and the Interahamwe got off.  Did you actually see them get off?  
A.	Yes.  I saw them when they got off the vehicle, because I was behind their vehicle.  It was on a roadway, vision was clear, so I saw them getting off their vehicle. 
Q.	Did you see whether they were armed or not when they got off the vehicle? 
A.	Yes.  They had all the necessary equipment:  spears, machetes, clubs.  They had all those equipment. 
Q.	And when you came up behind this vehicle, where was Renzaho, do you know? 
A.	When the vehicle stopped, he got off the vehicle and stood not far from the vehicle. 
Q.	And for how long did you remain in that place behind him?  
A.	About five minutes. 
Q.	And can you perhaps explain in a little more detail why you were unable to pass? 
A.	I was driving a big vehicle, and the road was narrow; so narrow that I could not easily overtake Renzaho's vehicle which had stopped. 
Q.	And so how was it that after a period of about five minutes you were able to pass?  
A.	He came to move his vehicle, and I was able to pass.  I even realised that I stopped there for quite some time.  
Q.	You said you saw the Interahamwe entering houses.  What kind of houses were these? 
A.	These were residential houses.  Houses belonging to residents of Kanombe. 
Q.	Are you able to comment, for example, on the wealth of the people who owned or lived in those houses? 
A.	The houses belonged to different categories of people.  Some of the residences belonged to people who were quite well off, whereas others belonged to people who were not very poor.  I would say that they belonged to the middle class. 
Q.	And what about the ethnicity of the people who lived in those houses?  Do you know anything about that? 
A.	I had just spent a lot of time in the neighbourhood, and I knew a number of Tutsis who lived in some of the residences that -- in which the Interahamwe went.  
Q.	Do you know what the Interahamwe were doing inside the houses when they entered them? 
A.	I am not aware of what they were doing.  I could not see inside the houses.  I was on the road.  However, since I was aware of the context prevailing at the time, I understood that they were hunting down the Tutsis. 
Q.	Can you describe briefly how you saw them entering the houses?  
A.	There were many of them, and they went from house to house.  There were many houses, and they entered them with their weapons.  And sometimes when the doors would be closed, they would break down the doors or the windows.  They did not enter the houses as visitors.  They entered the houses by force. 
Q.	Did you see the Interahamwe come out of the houses? 
A.	Some of them would enter houses; would go out and enter yet other houses.  There was some disorder, because there were many Interahamwe on the site. 
Q.	Did -- as far as you know, did the Interahamwe find anything that they were looking for in the houses? 
A.	I saw the Interahamwe beat people.  I do not know whether they had found the people in the houses or elsewhere, but I saw with my very eyes the Interahamwe beating people with -- beating three people with their clubs.  I do not know to which group these people belonged; but given the situation that prevailed at the time, I assumed that they were Tutsis. 
Q.	And when you saw that, how far away were those Interahamwe who were beating the three people from you?  
A.	I was not very far.  The houses were right next to the road, and these people lived on the road.  So there was a distance of around five to ten metres between the place where I was, and the area where the scene I just described was taking place. 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe say anything when they were beating these people? 
A.	The Interahamwe were saying that they had just found Tutsis in houses.  They were saying that they would have to search all the houses, even those houses where the doors were open. 
Q.	And while these people were being beaten, where was Renzaho? 
A.	Renzaho was standing there.  He did not go away.  Even if his house was in Kanombe, he did not go to his house.  He stayed there, and everything happened before his very eyes. 
Q.	You said that he got out of the car and he was standing beside it.  Did he remain in that position for the entire five minutes that you were behind his car? 
A.	He was standing and was looking at what the Interahamwe were doing.  Subsequently, he moved his vehicle, and I left.  But he did not leave that position.  He stayed standing there.  
Q.	Now, when you left, where did you go to? 
A.	I was heading towards the residence of President Habyarimana.  I went there, and I supplied them with food.  And it's not far from that other location, so I dropped the food over there.  
Q.	I wonder if you could explain to the Court, looking at your map, the president's house is on the far left.  But Kajagari, or Kajagali is shown to the south.  Why was it, as you've explained to us, I believe, you didn't turn right towards the president's house to deliver the food, but followed Renzaho down to Kajagari? 
A.	We were not authorised to use the asphalt road.  The president, alone, would use that road.  There was another road we would use which passed through Kajagari, and then we would turn to arrive in the rear courtyard of the president's residence.  The asphalt road was only used by the president and his guests. 
Q.	How long did your delivery of food at the president's house take? 
A.	I did not stay at the presidential residence for very long.  I did not remain there for more than ten minutes.  Those who were there merely took the delivery of food, and I left.  
Q.	And then did you return by the same route that you've come, or did you take another route? 
A.	I used the same route, because that was the route we would always use.  We were not authorised to use the asphalt road.  
Q.	Did you see Renzaho again that day? 
A.	When I was on my way back, they were still there where I had left them.  They were still moving around the neighbourhood and had not left yet.  
Q.	What about Renzaho?  Where was he? 
A.	His vehicle was still there when I came back.  They were still at the same location.  I don't know when they left, but on my way back he was still there where I had left him. 
Q.	And did you find out what happened to those three people you had seen being beaten up?  
A.	I did not try to learn what had happened subsequently, but it was obvious that they would not survive. 
Q.	After you returned to your camp, did you ever go back down to that area of Kajagari? 
A.	I would use this route every day because ************************************ of those who were stationed at the presidential residence.  So the following day, I used the same route. 
Q.	And that following day, did you notice anything in particular in that area? 
A.	As a matter of fact, from the day the president died, onwards, there were always dead bodies in that neighbourhood in Kajagari.  There was one vehicle that was entrusted with the -- that would pick up all the dead bodies.  But for four or five days, we could see dead bodies along this road.  
Q.	Do you know why that area was a target for attacks? 
A.	This neighbourhood was targeted for the attacks because after the presidential plane was shot down, most of the soldiers attacked inhabitants they already knew, and killed them.  That was the first thing they did immediately after the plane crashed. 
MS. MELLUISH:  
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have no further questions for you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The duration of the cross-examination for this witness, approximately?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it would be between half an hour and three-quarters of an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there a witness in the waiting room?  Very good.  Please proceed.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I wish to deal with matters pertaining to the witness, and I believe perhaps we should sit in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we do that, do you want to enter this sketch?
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Ben Salimo?
MS. BEN SALIMO:  
P. 75, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't think we have to place that under separate cover.
(Exhibit No. P. 75 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have to go into closed session for some time in order to ensure that the witness's identity is not revealed. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 64 to 79] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 57 to 63 by Vicki Eastvold)












MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, just before the witness is sworn in, I wonder if I could ask whether there is any objection if, following her swearing in, she meets with the Prosecutors this evening.  If there is, I would ask that we can swear her in tomorrow morning.  She's the photographer, I don't think there should be any particular objection.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there's no objection from our side.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's very helpful, thank you. 

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are testifying under your own name, I understand?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Corinne Dufka in English) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you there with your signature?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I do.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this means that the information contained in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 76.  
(Exhibit No. P. 76 admitted) 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will now adjourn for the day, because we have been sitting from 8:45 this morning, and we will start your testimony tomorrow morning at 8:45.  

We have not been informed that we have to continue in this courtroom, so there is every reason to believe that this witness will then testify tomorrow at the fourth floor, in the Laity Kama courtroom, the normal courtroom.  But should there be any last-minute change, please read Patrick Enow's notice very carefully this evening to avoid any misunderstanding.  

So the Court is adjourned until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1731H)
