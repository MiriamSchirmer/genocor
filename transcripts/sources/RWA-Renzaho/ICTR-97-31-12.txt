MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now start your examination-in-chief in closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 57] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MS. MELLUISH: 
Mr. Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness BUO, we are now in open session, and your examination-in-chief continues.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, you mentioned Angeline Mukandituye, and you said the Interahamwe were headquartered at her house.  Do you know how long she had been in charge of that group of Interahamwe?  
A.	From 1993 when the person who was in charge of the Interahamwe, that is to say, Scolastique, was shot, the Interahamwe set up the headquarters at Angeline's house.  And in 1994, it was common knowledge that their headquarters was at Angeline's -- Angeline Mukandituye's house. 
Q.	And when you joined this group of Interahamwe, what happened in general at these headquarters?  What were they used for, as headquarters?  
A.	In general, at the headquarters of the Interahamwe at Angeline Mukandituye's house there were a number of activities, and the Interahamwe would be trained to handle firearms.  They would also be informed of the reason why it was necessary for them to learn how to handle firearms, and there was also the monitoring of the activities of the Interahamwe.  
(Page 58 by Kirstin McLean)





















	1630H
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Were you provided with weapons? 
A.	Yes, we were. 
Q.	And where did these weapons come from? 
A.	The first batch of weapons I was able to see was provided to us by Tharcisse Renzaho.  And when the weapons were delivered to us, Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho was the one who brought them in the company of Munyakaze, Laurent.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us when this happened?
A.	This delivery took place on the 20th or on the 21st and it was on that date that we launched our first attack on the CELA centre.  So on the 22nd, we launched a second attack against the same centre. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which month, please, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
On the 21st we attacked the CELA centre, and on the 22nd of April 1994 we launched a second attack against that same centre, CELA.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you, we will come on to that in a moment, please.  For the moment, you said those were the first weapons received, those that the préfet brought.  Prior to that, had you had any weapons as a group of Interahamwe? 
A.	Thank you.  When I joined the Interahamwe, they already had weapons, but I am not in a position to tell you where such weapons had come from.  I can only refer to those that were delivered when I had already joined the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Prior to Renzaho's delivery of weapons, what if any weapons did you see at the house of Angeline Mukandutiye? 
A.	There were G3 guns, a few R4 guns, as well as light automatic weapons, and around five Kalashnikov rifles.  And if such is your wish, I could even give you the names of those who were using such weapons. 
Q.	When you joined this group of Interahamwe on the 8th or 9th of April, did you know how to use any of these weapons yourself?  
A.	Before answering that question, let me tell you that I did not join the Interahamwe in September, rather it was in April.  And before I joined the Interahamwe militia, I had not been trained in weapons handling.  It was only when I joined that group that I learned how to handle a weapon, a firearm.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was just a little mistake.  Everyone in the courtroom is aware that you joined on the 8th of April, Mr. Witness.  You have told us that, Mr. Witness.  But, now, the answer:  The question was whether you had been trained previously to use any of these weapons yourself. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, the witness has answered that question.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us how you learnt -- and I mean briefly please -- how you learnt how to handle a firearm once you joined the Interahamwe? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President. I was trained in weapons handling by one Fidele Habimana, also nicknamed Castar.  He was very instrumental in the killings.  He was the one who personally trained me in handling firearms.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Fidele Habimana is number 74 and Castar is number 39 on the list.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Generally speaking, after you joined this group of Interahamwe how often did you go to Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
A.	I went to Angeline's on a daily basis.  Whenever I wanted to go there, I would go there.  Her place was like family. 
Q.	At this time, where were you staying yourself, sleeping? 
A.	Sometimes I would spend the night at Angeline's, and at other times I could spend the night with my own family.  It all depended on me.  
Q.	And how far from Angeline' house was your own home?  
A.	Not at all far, it was quite close by.  We were neighbours. 
Q.	Is there any kind of daily routine that occurred at Angeline's Mukandutiye's house that you could describe to the Court, or were your activities quite different on every day?
A.	At Angeline Mukandutiye's we decide on a programme on a daily basis.  We would prepare the programme to carry out, and at the end of the day we would brief her. 
Q.	Generally speaking, what kind programme or programmes did you prepare? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  It was not really wholesome or positive programmes; actually, programmes towards conducting massacres.  Since massacres were the order of the day, we did not realise that we were actually indulging in a programme of committing crimes which was punishable.  
Q.	Whose idea was any particular massacre?  Was it something -- was it a collective decision that you would go, as you said, "conduct massacres", or were there orders coming from any particular individuals?  
A.	Thank you, ma'am.  There were people who had to give us orders, tell us what to do, and it was either Angeline or Renzaho.  Setting-up operations were even carried out in their presence. 
Q.	Talking of Renzaho, as at the 8th or 9th of April, how did you know Renzaho, if at all? 
A.	Thank you.  During that period, we did not realise that the situation was critical.  But I got to know her after Habyarimana's death.  However, even before that incident, I knew that he was the préfet of Kigali-ville, and it was not the first time I was seeing him.  I had seen him, and I knew he was the préfet of Kigali-ville and I used to see him at Angeline Mukandutiye's place, and sometimes I saw him when he was present during the operations we were carrying out.  I can give you specifics, if you want.  And it was a "he", not a "she".  
Q.	Can you recall the first time that you saw Renzaho at Angeline's house after the 8th of April 1994?
A.	I remember:   It was on the 21st of April when they issued us with the weapons I have already mentioned.  It was in 1994.  He was accompanied by Major Laurent Munyakaze. 
Q.	Can you recall the time of day that Renzaho and Munyakaze came to Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
A.	In the forenoon.  
Q.	And how did they travel to her house, if you know? 
A.	They came in a Presidential Guard vehicle.  It was a pickup truck because I personally saw him.  And I even mentioned this during Munyakaze's trial.  I think even Renzaho himself can confirm that. 
Q.	Do you recall whether there was anyone else in the vehicle with Renzaho and Munyakaze? 
A.	I didn't see anyone else other than the driver and the members of escort.  They too entered the compound of Angeline Mukandutiye's house.  On that occasion, they spoke to us and we even did something. 
Q.	But after they entered the compound, what did they do? 
A.	They got inside and spoke with Angeline.  When they came outside, Angeline asked us to go to the CELA centre. 
Q.	You mentioned earlier the delivery of weapons, can you explain what you meant by that? 
A.	The weapons they gave us were firearms, and those firearms were used. 
Q.	Can you recall how many firearms were given to you? 
A.	On that occasion, they gave us firearms, grenades, and ammunitions.  They dropped the firearms and ammunitions in that room, which I mentioned.  Only 12 firearms were taken from that room, and they were used, but I cannot tell you what happened to the other weapons. 
Q.	You say that "they spoke to you".  Who do you mean by "they"?  
A.	Angeline Mukandutiye, who asked us to go to CELA, when she told us that Laurent Munyakaze and Renzaho were present.  So we went to that place.  So I left last.  If you want me to give you details regarding what happened at this place, I am ready to oblige you. 
Q.	Can you clarify please whether you saw Renzaho yourself at Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
A.	I saw him with my own eyes. 
Q.	And was he present when Angeline Mukandutiye told you to go to CELA? 
A.	When Angeline Mukandutiye told us to go to CELA, Renzaho was present, just as he was present when we arrived at CELA. 
Q.	And did she tell you what to do at CELA? 
A.	We respected the order we had received to go to CELA.  We did not have to argue with the people giving us the order, and I wrote down in writing what happened at CELA.  If you wish, I can tell you about it. 
Q.	Please do.  But, first, could you tell us how far CELA was from Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
A.	Not far.  Angeline Mukandutiye lived along the road passing below the cemetery, and the next road was that of the JOC centre.  Angeline's house faced the two roads, so it was close by.  The distance between the two was not long.  I can even explain to you.  If you go down to that area, then you can ascertain for yourself.  
Q.	And did everybody leave Angeline Mukandutiye's house --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the witness is continuing.  
THE WITNESS:
The CELA centre has a wall separating it from the JOC centre. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did everybody leave Angeline Mukandutiye's house? 
A.	Some people had to leave, others had to stay.  Those who had to leave, that is, those who had been assigned the work to be done at the CELA centre, left. 
Q.	And what did you do? 
A.	When I finished distributing the weapons to my comrades, I left and went to CELA, and I'm even ready to tell you here what I did at CELA. 
Q.	You said that you found Renzaho when you got to CELA.  Where was he?  More specifically, I mean.   
A.	Renzaho came to CELA twice.  The first time he was in the vehicle with Munyakaze.  That is where Major Patrice Bivamvagara joined them, and the persons who had refused to open the door were gunned down.  ******************************************* a brand new white Toyota Corolla.  When Bivamvagara arrived there and greeted them, they left immediately.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, to be entirely clear, can you try to tell this story more slowly.  You say that Renzaho was in a vehicle with Munyakaze and that Major Bivamvagara joined them.  Now, where were you at that time? 
A.	By then I was already at the CELA centre.  That is, I had already left Mukandutiye's house and I was already at CELA. 
Q.	Where within or without the CELA compound was Renzaho? 
A.	You should make a difference between the two attacks, because that centre was attacked twice.  During the first attack, he remained by the road.  It was only during the second attack that he entered the centre premises.  But, for now, I am still talking about the first attack.  In due course, I will tell you of the second attack during which he entered the centre premises.  
Q.	Yes.  Please can we focus on the first attack for the time being, Mr. Witness?  

You had said he didn't enter during the first attack.  Can you recall how long he was present outside the CELA building?  
A.	I left Angeline's residence.  I found them at that place.  Then Major Bivamvagara arrived there and found them at that place where Renzaho was chatting with Munyakaze.  Bivamvagara told us we had to go and take the vehicles which were at that centre.  When the two gendarmes guarding the entrance to that centre wanted to put up a resistance, they were gunned down.  So we entered, we looted the vehicles and left.  During attack number 1, no one else was killed. 
Q.	Can you remember whether Renzaho was present when the gendarmes were gunned down? 
A.	When those gendarmes were gunned down, Renzaho, Munyakaze and Bivamvagara, were actually present.  The entire scene unravelled before their own eyes, because they were the ones who had just given us the authorisation to go and loot the vehicle. 
Q.	And what did you do with the vehicles once they had been taken from CELA? 
A.	We used the vehicles during our operations, either to ferry the victims to be killed or for the movement of Interahamwe during our operations. 
Q.	And as far as you can recall, was it just your group of Interahamwe based at Angeline Mukandutiye's house that used the looted vehicle? 
A.	In Rugenge secteur, there was no other group of Interahamwe apart from us, and we were working together with the gendarmes and the police officers of Kigali-ville préfecture office.  There was no other group of Interahamwe operating within Rugenge secteur. 
Q.	You may not be able to, but can you explain to the Court why the préfet, Renzaho and Munyakaze and Bivamvagara, would have been involved in the looting of these vehicles from CELA? 
A.	In a nutshell, they had their set objective, which was met even after the looting of those vehicles. 
Q.	And what was that set objective? 
A.	Their set objective was for those vehicles to be used together with the weapons we had just been issued with in order to carry out the slaughter and extermination of the Tutsi. 
Q.	And why do you say that? 
A.	I am relying on the fact that the weapons and vehicles were used only within the framework of the massacres.  Those vehicles and weapons came in very handy in connection with the massacres.
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I was going to move on to the following incident.  I wonder if this is an appropriate time to break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will do that.  

Anything of a practical nature?  Do you already know the witnesses for next week?  Do you want to revert to it tomorrow morning?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, I have the list here and I am happy to read it.  The order may change slightly, but, in theory, we have DBN, followed by BUX, then ACS, HAD, ATQ and AWE.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
If there is nothing else, we will then begin again tomorrow.  

And continue the proceedings, Mr. Witness, at 8:45.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
