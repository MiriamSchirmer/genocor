MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a document, a personal information sheet for this witness?  What is his pseudonym, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  This is Witness BDC.  

I see that you have signed a document, that it has not yet been photocopied.  Mr. Witness, you have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the witness told me that he had some additions to make to the document, which he had already signed.  I therefore think that it, perhaps, may be better to put the question to him regarding that document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will do that, as always, but only after we have sworn him in. 
(Declaration made by Witness BDC in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have your identification sheet in front of us.  Is that a correct and complete correction of the relevant information?  
THE WITNESS:
Right up to the small addition which relates to my occupation, my occupation up to the 6th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes.  Now, your occupation up to the 6th of April, could your correction -- we are now in open session -- disclose your identity or is it unproblematic if you make this correction in open court?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I asked the question alternatively in English, but realise that in French it was interpreted in the alternative that you think that it may reveal your identity.  Why don't you simply make the necessary changes on the document, as you like it, and then we get it back to you?  Then we do not have to do this orally and there is to need to close the proceedings.  

And with these additions can we conclude that the information in this document is correct?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga.  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 51.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 51 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then make copies of this amended version and distribute it to everyone in the courtroom.  

Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS BDC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, the first question the Defence will put to you is the following, that is, as part of our examination-in-chief:  In what circumstances in April 1994 did you hear of the crash of the plane in which President Habyarimana of Rwanda was found - or, was? 
A.	Counsel, I lived on a hill that was opposite the Kanombe international airport.  I lived in Kicukiro.  In terms of distance, the distance was about five kilometres on a straight line.  The missile shots that hit President Habyarimana's plane, I saw them.  I saw them live.  I saw them with my own eyes from where I lived in Kicukiro.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, did you have any particular reaction following that accident? 
A.	Yes, I was working on a document that -- I was torn between that document and watching a football match which was being shown on the television at that time.  I did not have a personal reaction, apart from being afraid because the missile shot was not identified as at that time.  It was later on in the evening that gendarmes brought two - rather, three persons in my house and I felt that the problem must have been a very serious problem.  Therefore, we started thinking of all that was -- or all that may have happened.  Much later in the evening, we were informed of what happened over the national radio.  Therefore, it was a whole night that followed, a night during which we asked ourselves many questions.  We asked ourselves questions personally.  And the entire family was affected by widespread fear.  In my family, and around the place where we lived in Kicukiro, everybody was affected by that general fear.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And in the days that followed, did you continue carrying out the normal duties which you carried out at that time? 
A.	It was a Wednesday.  Carrying out my normal duties must have been the following day, that is, going to work, but it wasn't possible to go to work.  There was a general blockade, and there was also the fact that the national radio advised the entire population - or, advised everyone to stay home rather than go out because that could be the cause of insecurity or that could expose their lives to danger.  
Q.	How many days did you stay home?  And during the events, did you stay home during that period, that is, from April to July 1994? 
A.	No, there is the following fact.  Because of the special nature of my family, my family is a mixed family, ************************************* so between the 6th and the 10th, be it at the international level or national level, there were messages addressed **************************************, which at any time told them that they had to be evacuated.  So I stayed until the 10th with my wife and children, and I prepared for their evacuation, *****************************, as I just said.  In fact, I was tempted to be among those to be evacuated by the French forces -- Italian forces as well, who in fact were picking up expatriates from every neighbourhood.  

But I decided to stay behind, because well before that tragedy in my capacity as *********************** at a higher level, that is, ************************************************ of the Red Cross society, I was a ********************************************************************* the Red Cross committee, which at that time was developing all sorts of strategies to intervene in the event of catastrophe.  So I felt it a duty not to leave the country at a moment when one of the most -- tragedies that we had not foreseen was taking place.  I had problems explaining to my wife and the entire family that I was staying behind in order to make myself available to the humanitarian action of the Red Cross movement, the Red Cross movement of which I have been a member since I was a young man.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, so you stayed.  How did you go about serving that movement, the Red Cross movement, which you say you were a member of since you were a youth?  
A.	The Kicukiro neighbourhood straddled a front line opened by the RPF rebels.  The rebels had taken over the entire area, particularly the strategic areas.  It happens that Kicukiro is halfway between the CND -- I think CND is already an acronym known here -- and Mount Rebero.  It is at the highest and most strategic point.  I am speaking in military terms here.  I think the rebels intended to occupy that very strategic point.  There were people going forth and backwards, that is, the rebels were moving forth and backward and that prevented me from reaching the headquarters of the Red Cross.  As a matter of fact, I was unable to move until the 14th, I believe, and thereafter I was able to reach the Red Cross headquarters on the 15th of April.  That is when I effectively started my work as head of Red Cross operations in Kigali town.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you tell the Court who you were cooperating with as a senior official in the Red Cross movement at that time? 
A.	I would right away explain that when there is war, a conflict of that nature, the International Red Cross, which comprises international Red Cross societies, the federation of these national societies, that is the federal organ, and you also have the International Committee of the Red Cross.  It is the International Committee of the Red Cross which leads operations in all situations of armed conflict.  This means that this modus operandi also applied to Rwanda.  Therefore we placed ourselves under the orders of the delegate of the International Red Cross Committee, and that delegate was Mr. Philippe Gaillard.  It is with him as well as with a team of expatriates -- expatriates in his team, that we carried out Red Cross relief operations.
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, the name of Philippe Gaillard does not seem to appear on our additional list.  Perhaps I will request the witness to spell that name for the benefit of the Chamber.  
THE WITNESS:
Philippe, I believe that is no problem.  Gaillard is spelt as follows, G-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what are the first actions that the Red Cross undertook and carried out in Kigali town at that time, that is, during the period that followed the crash of the presidential plane? 
A.	Well, the situation was very difficult for everyone up to the time when the government was formed.  I believe the government was formed on the 9th.  So there were two days of emptiness or an institutional void.  The Red Cross always operates as an auxiliary of public authorities.  Now, there was no public authority under whom we could serve as auxiliary, therefore, this was a problem.  The institutional void was a serious problem.  

When the government was formed -- I must specify here that I was in permanent contact with the headquarters.  We had a radio communications system that was very well organised, just like you have in the army.  In fact, the Red Cross is referred to as the third army.  So being a member of that third army, so to speak, I was well equipped with communication radios.  So we were in constant communication.  

I believe it was around the 10th that -- or perhaps the 9th when the government was just formed, that the Red Cross really started to be effective.  I believe that on the 10th of April, Mr. Gaillard launched or mooted the idea of a meeting, which meeting had to determine a number of priorities, including the priority regarding the wounded.  The wounded were taken in a disorderly fashion to the various hospital centres.  But we also had to make decisions regarding a catastrophic situation where already there were many people who had died, people who had died here and there at the various neighbourhoods of Kigali.  So it was necessary to act very fast.  

Mr. Gaillard informed the minister of public health of this danger.  The minister, I believe with his colleague of the ministry of public works, convened a meeting.  That meeting I believe took place around the 11th or the 12th -- I believe the 11th.  So these are the specific acts which marked the beginning of our operations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must speak more slowly.  Will you do that?  Thank you.  Everything has to be interpreted and transcribed, and we need some more time, so please slow down.  Here comes the next question.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I take due note of that.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you complete your answer to the question I put to you, which question you were answering? 
A.	Well, I mentioned the three humanitarian actions that were carried out on the 10th and the 11th.  They included the initiative to mobilise the ministers of public health and public works.  This initiative was taken by Gaillard.  Then there was a meeting, a summit meeting that had to discuss, in the main, matters related to humanitarian activities.  The meeting took place on the 11th.  So I was saying that with these two actions, we marked the beginning of our humanitarian operations.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, since you are a specialist of humanitarian activities, perhaps the Chamber would like to know why at that time you thought it was urgent to address the issue of the number of deaths in Kigali town? 
A.	Yes, that was a very important issue.  In fact, it is obviously an important issue.  In all international resolutions, for example, the Bamako resolution or the Alma Ata resolution, these are resolutions that underscore the importance of all that is related to primary health care, and secondary health care, or public health care.  These are matters that received the same priority.  It is as if there is a motor accident and that those carrying the stretchers are reanimating the victims, and those carrying the stretchers sort of identify the area where the accident has taken place.  These are activities that must take place concurrently.  Because if you do not do any one of them, there is the risk of causing more death amongst the people.  Therefore, the public health component and the relief component, providing relief to the wounded, are two components of humanitarian activities that must be carried out concurrently.  So we give them the same importance.  So for someone in the field this is obvious.  It was therefore very urgent to address the public health issue.  Because if we did not do that there was danger of an epidemic which could break out and that epidemic could be more serious than perhaps the number of wounded caused by the militia here and there.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would nevertheless like to emphasise this point and focus your attention to the specific case of Kigali town.  Which are the factors, in your opinion, which at that time made the possibility of an epidemic real? 
A.	In some neighbourhoods of Kigali town basic facilities, electricity, for example, water, were no longer available.  That was one point.  On the other hand, we are here in the month of April.  In April - or, April is a period when it is -- a period characterised by hot as well as cold days.  These are the typical equatorial climatic conditions and they accelerate -- those conditions accelerate the decomposition of corpses, and an accelerated decomposition of corpses would mean that there is a possibility of water sources being contaminated, water sources that provide water to the population.  I do not think it is necessary for me to explain further to prove that the danger of an epidemic was clear.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  From an answer you gave me, Witness, you are saying that the initiatives to sensitise the authorities to these matters was taken by Mr. Gaillard on the 10th.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's a very leading question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I am just reminding him of an answer which he had already given me.  I do not know how that becomes a leading question because he had already said that Mr. Gaillard had sensitised the public authorities, so I am simply reminding him of an answer that he had already given.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the borderline sometimes between leading questions and recapitulating previous evidence can be blurred; you are right.  But a good line of conduct in such a grey zone is simply to avoid it, then we will avoid any discussion about it.  So it's always smart to choose caution instead of recapitulation, if it can be done without too much time.  So here comes the next question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, where and in whose presence did the meeting of the 11th take place, the meeting that you mentioned?
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, with the greatest of respect, the witness has indicated he didn't begin his work with the Red Cross until the 15th.  I wonder how the witness can give useful evidence to the Trial Chamber on a meeting which he was not present at?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you have any information about this, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said that I was constantly communicating with the high command of our army, that is the Red Cross.  So I had internal information through the radio on the one hand.  On the other hand, when I arrived on the 15th at the headquarters, I was immediately absorbed in what was referred to as the general staff of the Red Cross.  So there was a briefing on all that had happened.  I was not physically in the meeting, but I have an idea of all that had transpired from the 10th to the 15th when I arrived at the Red Cross headquarters. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, can the witness now answer my question?  I wanted him to inform the Chamber of the circumstances in which the meeting of the 11th took place and those who attended that meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you given information about the participants at that meeting when you heard of this meeting later, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. Gaillard was there.  The representative of the ministry of public health was there, as well as the representative of the minister of public health.  You had over 50 people -- between 50 and 80 people in that meeting.  Of course, there was also the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture  because it was in the conference room of the préfecture of Kigali-ville that the meeting took place.  
JUDGE ARREY:
From the English translation we heard that the representative of the ministry of public health was there as well as the representative of the minister of public health.  That's what you said.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Public works, we are sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have clarified it.  In the French version you said "ministère travaux publics" the second time.  So you referred to two different ministries; isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, can you, therefore, tell the Court, since you have information on the said meeting, what was discussed during the meeting? 
A.	Well, I remembered what concerned us, that is, humanitarian issues.  It was important for us to ensure that those who were wounded were transported under safe conditions.  It was also urgent to bury the corpses that were scattered here and there in the various neighbourhoods of Kigali.  
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications, Witness.  And what were the practical activities, from what you know, actions that were carried out with respect to burying the corpses?  
A.	Concretely speaking, Counsel, the two ministries and the préfecture of Kigali town, with regard to the burying of the corpses, presented logistical difficulties that they faced -- logistical difficulties in burying the bodies.  What I mean is difficulties related to fuel.  The préfecture of Kigali-ville did not have the necessary fuel.  The ministry of public works had vehicles, but did not have fuel either.   And that is where the International Red Cross Committee made available to that operation fuel.  So we supported the picking up of the bodies by distributing - or, making fuel available.  By the time I arrived on the 15th, the burying of the bodies continued with the logistical support of the International Red Cross Committee.  We even utilised, quote, unquote, this transportation aspect:  Policemen and all the drivers who were transporting the bodies, were neutralised, quote, unquote.  In other words, what we mean by this is that none of them was armed.  The transportation of the bodies was carried out by people who were not armed; and the transportation vehicles bore the Red Cross flag - or, they carried the Red Cross flag. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, can you be more explicit, more clear on the identity of the person who was préfet of Kigali-ville at that time, if you know him?  
A.	Yes.  I know Tharcisse Renzaho.  I had known them -- him for a long time.  I believe I knew him since 1986 when he came to do his higher studies or when he came to do his studies -- military studies in Germany.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  So he is someone that I know very well.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen.  Is there a risk this last answer could reveal the identity of the witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Probably, Mr. President.  But I do not want to request brief closed sessions.  I think I have agreed with the witness that he could take some risks when providing information to the Trial Chamber on what he knows about the events of April.  But if you want to put this section under seal; I think I will agree with you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete the sentence starting with "At that time, I was also completing my studies..." until the penultimate sentence concluding with "without difficulties".  This will be placed under seal, the last sentence will remain in the open session.  

Mr. Witness, when there is a risk that answers may reveal your identity kindly exercise caution and don't be too specific.  If necessary, we'll have to go into closed session when we come to those issues, or write it on a piece of paper.  

Next question, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I told counsel that I needed my own personal protection here, and I think the Tribunal granted that.  But I know that any sentence that that I mix up here identifies me.  I was involved with those operations at the Red Cross.  I told Counsel Nekuie that what I needed here was my personal security.  With regard to the truth, as regards knowing who I am, I have no problem with that, if my identity is revealed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you are now testifying under pseudonym and when you are doing that the Tribunal has according to the Statute and the Rules a responsibility to look after your protection.  Are you saying that you want to testify under your own name?  
THE WITNESS:
That is a technical aspect that I did not understand, but I would insist, and I would like to say that I am not afraid that anybody should know who I am.  I was only afraid for my personal security.  The rest is not important for me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue to refer to you by pseudonym.  And the questioning continues.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, talking about the support granted by the Red Cross regarding these operations, you indicated that the Red Cross made available to the administration fuel.  How do you explain this fact that the administration is running out of fuel and that it is the Red Cross that is supplying fuel for its operations? 
A.	My functions that I described on the identification sheet, places me in a position to tell the truth, the government had run out of fuel because, effectively, the strategic deposits of fuel which we had, the company called Petrorwanda, which had only three depots for fuel, three strategic depots.  And one of the depots in the country was already under the control of the rebels, and access to these strategic depots was impossible.  I know that the Red Cross would not freely give fuel.  This was a situation of emergency. But the truth is that the government was cut off from its major source of supply for fuel and there was no fuel in Kigali, the Gatsata - Gatsata is spelt G-A-T-S-A-T-A -- and this was the biggest depot in the country, the Gatsata depot.  And on April 10th, this was already under the rebel occupation.  
Q.	Thank you, for that clarification, Witness.  Witness, still regarding this issue of the bodies that were strewn all over the town of Kigali, did the Red Cross know how these people had been killed?  Were they killed by conventional weapons or by blank (sic) weapons? 
A.	They were killed by both types of weapons, but basically by -- up to the 15th this was a time of military conflict and confrontation and most of the victims at that time were killed by military weapons. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the witness's previous answer we have in English that on April 10th this depot was already under the rebel occupation.  In view of what he said in French, I think we shall just add "the rebels of the RPF".  That's what the witness said, just to avoid any ambiguity.  

Now, the next question, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you not receive information at the time stating that the collection of bodies was a manoeuvre - or, rather, an activity initiated by Mr. Renzaho with the intention of concealing the results of his activity? 
A.	No.  I do not say.  It was common knowledge.  This meeting that I talked about was announced over radio.  Everybody who was listening to the radio knew that there was a meeting that was to take place at the préfecture in Kigali convened by the two ministers that I talked about.  And this was a meeting organised by the government.  And there was no direct relationship with Mr. Renzaho, but for the fact that it was held in his préfecture, so I do not see my relationship between Renzaho -- any direct relationship between Renzaho and this mobilisation -- this important humanitarian activity that was mobilised. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this meeting, was it convened by the two ministers or by the two ministries?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I cannot recall whether it was the ministers convening or the ministries convening.  I cannot recall, but it was constantly announced on radio that the minister -- ministry of public works and the ministry of public health were convening its workers for a meeting at the Kigali préfecture.  Whether we are talking about the ministry or a minister, for the people in Kigali -- for the people of Kigali that meant the minister, because he was the only one -- or they were the only ones who could take that initiative.  Even those who signed such a communiqué signed in -- signed for the minister.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
That's the question I wanted to ask.  Who signed the communiqué that was being broadcast over the radio?  Who signed it?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I did not see the signature for the communiqué, but I heard the radio announcement.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
But the radio announcement, it said who was convening the people to this meeting, because somebody has to invite people to a meeting.  Who convened them to this meeting?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I believe that it might have been a bad translation.  I said that I do not remember whether the term used was the ministry of public works or the minister of public works convening the meeting.  And I don't remember whether it was the minister of public health or the ministry of public health convening.  So I can't tell you whether it was the minister or the ministry.  I do not have a proper recollection of that fact.  But as I have said, in the minds -- in the normal minds of the people, people understood the minister and I presume that the person who had signed that document had done it in -- on behalf of the minister.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it was the ministry's -- either through the minister or someone acting on behalf of the minister, not anyone else.  Is that the evidence?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I even remember that on the 10th of April -- the meeting of the 11th was prepared on the 10th.  Mr. Gaillard, if I remember well, had seen Dr. Casimir, the minister of health that he knew very well, on the 10th or 11th, once his appointment as minister was confirmed.  So this meeting was not convened by chance; it was not spontaneously convened.  It was prepared, and the agenda for this meeting had been prepared before between the various ministries concerned, and Gaillard was part of those who had initiated the meeting.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, to conclude on that point and move on to others, could you tell the Trial Chamber, if you remember, the places where these bodies that were picked up with the help of the administration were buried in the town of Kigali? 
A.	Towards the end of April, I think, at that time already, the cemeteries in Kigali were still accessible.  I think that is where they were buried.  I did not accompany any truck that was transporting the bodies, so I cannot give you any specific location.  All I can say is, generally speaking, towards the end of April the four or five cemeteries of the Kigali préfecture were still accessible.  So that is where the bodies were buried.  It is towards the end of April that we were obliged to improvise and bury people in various corners. 
Q.	And this improvisation that you are talking about was this still the initiative of the Red Cross or an initiative taken by other people? 
A.	No, the Red Cross could not take any initiative in designating sites for burial.  This was the responsibility of the public authorities.  
Q.	And was this done in collaboration with the Red Cross? 
A.	No, not at all.  The operation became somewhat independent.  Even regarding the respect of the basic conventions we had to be neutral.  This operation became independent, there was no problem.  The Red Cross was no longer concerned with it because it had become a traditional activity -- the operation.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How did the Red Cross organise itself to carry out its other humanitarian activities?  You talked of the wounded.  Were there other operations that the Red Cross was carrying out during that period?  
A.	Yes, there were injured people who had to be moved, on the one hand.  Particularly there was also the accommodation of people who were being sought after.  There was also the distribution of food sites -- food supplies in the various sites where displaced persons were.  For example, the Sainte Famille church, the  Saint Paul site; almost all embassies, and particularly the German embassy and the embassy of the Congo; the churches, generally speaking, including the Baptist church; schools, for example, the college Notre Dame de Cîteaux, and so on.  

For the population, these were areas that provided -- could provide some security for them and these were the areas that the people went to.  But they went there only with the clothes they had on him -- that they had on them, and these were impoverished people.  So particularly for the most vulnerable groups, like the children, we had to provide them with water and milk and look for firewood; in short, food supplies.  And we also had to provide drugs because people were becoming ill because of the cold weather at the time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you talk about the population that was moving towards these sites, who are you talking about exactly?  Are you talking about the entire population of Kigali or are you talking about a specific group?  Could you be more clear on that, Witness?  
A.	Initially, the internally displaced people who rushed into the country -- into the town.  The Chamber knows that on the 6th of April we had more than 900,000 displaced people and one of the displaced -- one of the biggest camps that received these people was at the entrance of Kigali, Nyacyonga.  It is spelt N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A, Nyacyonga.  And these people had been pushed into the front line because the rebels were coming.  

On the 13th, the RPF forces had left the general command or general staff for Kigali.  These rebels were meeting, and the people who were caught up between these rebels ran away from -- Kigali was full of people who were rushing in, and you had bombs falling from all over.  Sometimes there was a small area that could be exposed to the bombs and everybody felt that they were in danger.  So everybody was running, even ministers were running.  So everybody was looking for a place of refuge where they could find personal security.  So, generally, without the need for me to characterise or describe the people, I would say that everybody in Kigali, all civilians, were the ones seeking refuge. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But could you please help the Trial Chamber by indicating the ethnicity of the population?  The people you have just described as being at the entrance of Kigali and, on the other hand, those who were already in Kigali who were seeking refuge, as you had just described.  
A.	I would like to tell the Trial Chamber that I have not indicated my own ethnic group.  Personally, I am against this manner of describing Rwandan citizens.  I am talking about Rwandan civilians.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is a very understandable question of principle or attitude of principle, Mr. Witness, but in 1994 you had an identity card, was there an H or a T on that card?  

THE WITNESS:
I requested for my identity card in Kigali, through my parents, they brought me my identity card.  I had given them a picture, and they came back with an identity card with the letter H.  But I remember -- and this is true, I swore here that I would speak the truth -- at that time my son was six and had just started primary school, so he had trouble for an entire week and was sent back home.  He was dismissed from his primary school because I had refused to identify him in this manner.  So my own son, at the age of six and seven, knew; and now my children know that they should not identify themselves using these three letters.  And that is my principle.  My son was dismissed, Mr. President, and that was a drama.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that very well, and I commend you for your attitude of principle.  May I ask you, when it came to this group of refugees, you remember the question of Defence counsel, can you still assist him to get the information he seeks, which according to him is relevant in the case?  Just answer the question, please.  Your position is noted.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, to be realistic regarding the Hutu and Twa or Tutsi ethnic groups, it is very difficult for one to identify the ethnicity of various individuals.  All the people who were available to me, whom I trained, the people whom I prepared psychologically every evening, I emphasised the fact that they should not think of that.  I do not know why I should be thinking of it now.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I understand you.  I will not seek to embarrass you any further.   

Witness, when finally you took up your duties at the Red Cross headquarters, did you personally have the opportunity of taking care of those sites where those people were? 
A.	Yes, I was - I immediately took care of the sites at the Congolese embassy.  The situation there was very grave; nobody had thought of that site.  So I took care of the site at the German embassy.  Moreover, I had the keys to many German cooperation staff.  I went everywhere where Germans had their residences, right up to the embassy where there was a concentration of people.  I took care of the site very intensely.  ************************* Saint Paul and Sainte Famille sites.  I participated in arriving at a decision that the person appointed by the préfet, Mr. Simpunga, S-I-M-P-U-N-G-A, he was sous-préfet in charge of social affairs, he was someone who was very active.  Moreover, he was ill at the time; he had just come from hospitalisation.  He just came out of hospital.  He was convalescing. That person, Simpunga, was very active in the distribution of food supplies.  And, as I was saying, I was the ********************************************************** in his pickup for the distribution of the various sites where you had displaced persons. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did he come out of hospital?  Do you remember?  

THE WITNESS:
When I arrived on the 15th, I believe he had in the meantime -- well, he was convalescing, he was on crutches, but I am unable to specify the date when he came out of hospital.  All I would say was that he was convalescing, he was on crutches.  I believe he was still undergoing treatment when the 6th April tragedy happened.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you arrived on the 15th, he was already in action performing many tasks, is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I would say yes, but he was on crutches.

1000H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, your intervention staff, did they include medical teams, or medical staff?  
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel.  Could you please repeat it?  
Q.	I will rephrase it and make it clearer.  Did you have medical intervention teams within the context of your operations on those sites? 
A.	Yes, in our teams we had doctors, surgeons, medical staff of various specialisations.  Indeed, we had medical teams in those sites.  At the Kigali hospital centre, which I forgot to mention, we had a medical team.  Then at the Sainte Famille site, we had -- we had decentralised a small health care team.  We had a nurse, a male and female nurse who were in charge of the team.  But, for the other sites, it was not necessary to immobilise -- or, to assign a dedicated member of the Red Cross, and to move to those other sites it was quite easy.  Therefore it was not necessary to assign a permanent Red Cross staff there -- or, medical team.  
Q.	How did you operate with regard to the wounded?  In other words, what did you do with them?  Did you have health facilities to receive them as well?  
A.	Initially, yes.  The Kigali hospital centre is a very complete health facility.  At the time referred to, and I believe right up to now, it is an advanced hospital.  It was our referral hospital.  But in Rugunga in Kiyovu, we created a rural hospital that -- it was specific to the International Red Cross Society.  We had, in that area, a rural hospital where physicians and surgeons were working round the clock, 24 hours out of 24.  And those medical teams, therefore, in our own hospital, that is, the rural hospital of the International Committee of the Red Cross, provided health care, as should be the case, to everyone.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Was it the Red Cross that led patients to the facilities you just described, or was it the préfectoral administration?  What happened, in concrete terms, on the ground?  
A.	The 3,000 or more wounded who were at the Kigali hospital centre -- yes, you had over 3,000 people at that hospital centre.  The patients we had came from -- or, from various areas.  Some came on their own initiative, some came on their own.  Because public means of transport were not available, people transported relatives.  In some cases, some patients were brought by private citizens in their own vehicles.  But there were also patients that we brought ourselves.  So, the bringing of patients to the health facilities was carried out in various forms and manners.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How did you, personally, transport those who were in your centre?  How did you organise that?  Can you be more precise?  
A.	There was a medical team, a Red Cross medical team, comprising those bearing stretchers -- or, stretcher bearers who were trained for that purpose.  They know how to pick up patients, how to treat the patient on the way to a health facility, that is, between the place where the patient is picked up and the hospital or health facility.  So these were teams of ambulance workers who transported patients in ambulances.  Some of the patients would be lying down, depending on the state of their wounds.  Others were seated, sometimes against all the usual rules and practices.  
I am, in particular, thinking of -- at some point in time, I believe on the 14th or 15th -- in any case, around those dates, 13, 14, or 15th, particularly around the 14th, as a result of the need to transport as many patients as possible because of the danger -- well, we had to balance between the danger they ran by being packed into the same vehicle or being left on the spot, because the militiamen were taking some patients away from us and executed them.  This was on the 14th.  So, well, depending on the conditions of the moment, we transported sometimes in a professional manner, but at other times we transported people in a chaotic manner, depending on the urgency of the situation.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you talk of militias, who are you referring to?  Can you explain the circumstances when they created such incidents?  
A.	It is very difficult to define the militias.  They were a group of people -- or, groups of people who had taken drugs and alcohol -- alcoholic beverages, who inspired fear.  Their eyes were red as a result of the fact that they themselves did not sleep.  They only kept themselves awake by taking drugs and narcotics, alcohol and so on.  They were armed with all sorts of weapons, bladed weapons, automatic weapons, and what have you.  Indeed, they were young people.  Some were even bandits.  And these also were the various -- well, these characteristics varied from roadblock to roadblock.  Each roadblock had the kind of people available to them.  The most aggressive -- some of them were very aggressive, and at other roadblocks it was easy to cross.  So it is very difficult to give them a uniform description.  But this was the broad image that they presented.  

Regarding their membership of political parties, contrary to what is alleged, they were not the militia of a given political party.  They were desperate youth, desperate young people who found themselves together.  So it was no longer possible to relate or assign them to a given political party.  Moreover, in a meeting that we organised, we thought it necessary to invite all political parties, because we felt that the militias belonged to various political parties, and the idea was to have the political parties sensitise their young people.  These parties included the PSD, the MRND in Kigali town, the PDI, that is the Islamic party.  The Islamic party also had an active young wing.  So these were a group of young people who were mobilised for the same purpose, namely, to ensure their personal security, and also ensure the security of the republic.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Remember the speed, Mr. Witness.  And much of this is known to us.  Could you try to be a bit briefer in your answers, please? 

The next question.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
A question on the last part of your answer.  You said this way, young people who were mobilised for their own personal security, to ensure the security of the republic.  Are you saying, to ensure the security of the republic, it was necessary to remove people from the Red Cross camp and hospitals; is that what you want the Chamber to believe?  
THE WITNESS: 
Not at all, Your Honour.  Moreover, we protested in the most vehement manner against this tragedy of 1994 during which patients were taken away from us.  I do not at all justify the methods used by these young people to defend themselves and defend the republic.  In any case, that is what they said.  I do not -- do not approve of what they did.  It was atrocious, it was traumatic.  I would even say it was animalistic behaviour.  It was the animalistic behaviour and a devilish behaviour that was set in motion.  Therefore I do not at all approve of their conduct.  On the contrary, I was always in various teams that protested against their conduct, and we sought to see that our relief operations were carried out successfully.  But all I'm saying is that we had great difficulties with these drugged militias, these bandits, these criminals.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, for the guidance of the Chamber, can you remind us -- or, tell us the reasons why these militias targeted the patients who were in your ambulances?  There must have been some specific reason for that conduct.  
A.	There was generally mistrust according to which all that had organised attracted their mistrust.  RTLM had already started broadcasting rumours to the effect that the Red Cross was transporting the enemy.  This was broadcast over the -- over RTLM radio.  There is also the fact that when our vehicles moved about in various neighbourhoods in order to pick up corpses or the wounded, these wounded were survivors.  These wounded sometimes were people who were about to be exterminated.  So if you failed to kill someone, and you see that person being evacuated, you would want to get hold of the person.  

Also, in view of the psychological state of mind that I talked about earlier on, according to those militia, we were viewed as people who sought to save those the militias had targeted for murder or extermination.  We were therefore not liked under those conditions.  And this would enable you to understand that, at the various points where we passed, there was some kind of complicity among the militia seeking to withdraw patients from our ambulances.  So this would be easy to understand.  And this is the context in which the situation and the danger should be understood.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, do you know whether those militias had any relationship whatsoever with the préfet of Kigali-ville, that is, Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho?  
A.	I should be very candid on this point and say no.  If I have to give various reasons, I may be lengthy -- that is, reasons on which my personal opinion is based.  
Q.	Can you please -- can you please give the reasons, briefly?  This will be a good idea for our understanding.  
A.	First of all I visited Mr. Renzaho more than ten times in his office.  I visited him from the 15th (sic) of July -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- or, rather, the 3rd (sic) of July when he left in the morning -- when he left -- or, 4th -- on the 4th of July when he left the préfecture of Kigali, I believe I met him more than four times.  Everyone went there to meet him.  I met him more than ten times, and personally I noticed that -- well, in answer to your question, that those militias could not come -- could not have come under his authority because apparently he himself was threatened by them.  All his staff, including his sous-préfets, had been molested by the militias.  There were attacks organised by the most dangerous militias, and those attacks had been organised in his préfecture, in his -- or, targeted his préfecture and his office.  

There were displaced persons -- this was something that I'd mentioned -- forgot to mention.  There were displaced persons in the courtyard of the préfecture, displaced persons of all ethnic backgrounds.  These displaced persons in Kigali town were themselves targets of the militia groups.  Personally I know, because as I said I know him very well, I know from a discussion that I had with him that he had no news from his family.  His wife in particular, he had no news about her.  And the wife came from the two ethnic groups -- the two main ethnic groups of our country, and she had difficulties being evacuated to safe areas because she was threatened by those militias.  I do not believe -- not only do I not believe, but I -- I do not think that he had any authority over these persons who threatened him directly, and also threatened his family.  

To be specific, once more, when our operations were -- came under serious threats around the end of April, we had to unblock the situation which constituted a humanitarian emergency.  I was the delegate of the International Red Cross Society who went to see Mr. Renzaho to explain to him what he already knew, in fact, the security situation had become very grave.  This was around the end of April.  It was around the 22nd -- the 25th of April.  During that time we decided to manage the movement -- or, monitor of our relief -- the movements of our relief workers.  The situation was becoming unbearable, because we thought that we should not endanger the lives of our relief workers.  And the préfet said, "Well, things are not moving.  Can you help us so that the militia should allow us to pass?"  The manner in which -- or, the manner in which this specific question was answered when we -- well, when we asked for assistance from him, he -- he thought that was impossible.  

So I personally took the initiative to go and see those militias in their headquarters.  I knew where the militias had their headquarters.  I went to see him at the Muhazi garage.  Muhazi is spelt as follows:  M-U-H-A-Z-I.  This was in a building belonging to a technical school, in the south -- 500 metres to the south of the lycée Notre Dame de Cîteaux.  There I met those militias.  The leader of those militias, in particular their president, Kajuga, Robert -- Kajuga is spelt as follows:  K-A-J-U-G-G-A -- K-A-J-U-G-A.  His deputy was Rutengwa.  Rutengwa is spelt as follows:  R-U-T-E -- I take that all over again.  R-U-T-E-N-G-W-A.  Personally I negotiated for those militias to allow us past.  The manner in which Renzaho reacted -- in fact, he told us he could not do anything because he told us he did not have any authority over them.  And that confirmed to me that he did not have authority over them, neither at the roadblocks nor over their command, which I have just described.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Still too fast, still too lengthy.  

Now, Mr. Witness, let us backtrack a little bit.  You started this extremely long answer by referring to some dates.  We agree that you visited Mr. Renzaho more than ten times; isn't that so?  Yes or no?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
These ten visits took place from when to when?  And just the dates now.  What was the commencement of this period?  
THE WITNESS: 
The first visit took place on the 15th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, so that goes on record.  The witness misspoke when he said July a couple of times previously.  Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I would, nevertheless, like us to clarify that point.  Mr. Renzaho was the préfet of Kigali-ville and had under his authority the police of Kigali-ville, or town.  How do you explain that police was unable to have authority -- or, in any case, could not be used to -- or overcome the militia who were causing you problems?  
A.	There were over 20 -- did you say there were over 20 policemen at Kigali préfecture?  I don't think so.  I do not even know the exact number of policemen who were available to the préfecture, but I do not think that I saw more than 30 policemen in the préfecture.  So this number of policemen, in the face of a huge number of organised militia who were at various roadblocks, it was impossible for that number of policemen to overcome the militia.  I -- I am sorry, but the militia were better armed than the police of the préfecture.  The police had obsolete weapons.  They were not even properly attired.  They did not have proper clothes on.  They could not -- they didn't weigh much against experienced and well-equipped militia.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During the period in question, the fuel that you had placed at the disposal of the préfecture, did you ever hear that such fuel was distributed by Mr. Renzaho to the militias?  
A.	I do not remember hearing that Mr. Renzaho gave fuel to the militia.  
Q.	You never heard, either, that Mr. Renzaho distributed food to the said militia groups?  
A.	It is a reverse situation that would have happened, it is the militia that would have been giving food to Mr. Renzaho.  The militia were people who had built up stockpiles of food at roadblocks.  They called them "war food supplies".  They would break into warehouses and get food.  Even those of us who were neutral could not give them food -- well, thinking of Renzaho distributing food to the militia, no.  I visited Renzaho in his place of refuge, and there you saw poverty, whereas the -- the militias had good mattresses, good beds, and so on.  So I think the militia were in a better place to feed Renzaho.  So my answer to your question is no.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How, therefore, did you negotiate your situation with these militia whom you went to meet?  What was the outcome of your negotiations?  
A.	Mr. Kajuga and Rutengwa signed a document, which document was authoritative.  They gave -- issued us a safe conduit which we gave to our ambulance vehicles, and they could use that safe conduit to go past various roadblocks.  So the two leaders, Kajuga and Rutengwa, had authority over their men, everywhere where the militias were.  
Q.	Thank you.  You talked about laissez-passers.  Should we understand that these laissez-passers issued by the militia leaders had more authority than the laissez-passers issued by the préfet?  
A.	The Red Cross would not even have thought of asking Mr. Renzaho to issue laissez-passers.  He was the senior authority, I know that; I had taught in the military academy and I'm well informed of the terms of the Geneva Conventions which Rwanda had signed.  It is clear that a humanitarian organisation like the Red Cross does not need laissez-passers for its humanitarian operation.  So we would never have thought of asking Mr. Renzaho to issue us laissez-passers.  According to the Geneva Conventions themselves, it is stipulated that humanitarian teams of the Red Cross should enjoy the support of public authorities in such circumstances.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, to obtain such a document from the militia leaders, was that in agreement with the Geneva Conventions you referred to?  
A.	I said that that was an exceptional measure.  Normally we do not ask for laissez-passers or safe conduits for our relief operation teams, but on that occasion we had to breach that rule, or convention, in order to save human lives.  And this was a priority issue.  We therefore asked the militia groups to sign -- or, issue us a document that would be used as a safe conduit on roadblocks manned by Interahamwes.  We did not foresee such a -- such a situation with respect to the government forces.  That would have been unthinkable.  We did not even foresee such a situation with respect to the rebels.  The rebels did not need to give us such laissez-passers.  We had to use such an exceptional measure -- or, remedy for the specific case of the militias.  
Q.	Thank you for that answer, Witness.  Witness, you talked about roadblocks.  At that time, didn't you learn that it was Mr. Renzaho who was in charge of control at the roadblocks?  
A.	I believe I have challenged that theory in the answer that I gave.  The President said with regard to that answer that I had been lengthy, but I gave all the details which, once more, lead me to answer no.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And, on the side of the forces you describe as rebels, that's the RPF forces, did your team -- did your teams encounter any problems with these rebel forces with your humanitarian activities?  
A.	Several times.  I think I can remember four -- four occasions.  First of all, when the Kigali hospital centre was bombed, where we had an humanitarian annex.  And one day after that -- I think it was in May or June, I do not remember the exact date.  But when the Kigali hospital centre moved following the bombings because the medical staff felt that they could no longer provide health care, the hospital moved.  And some of the sick people came to our hospital, our rural hospital in Rugunga.  And, strangely enough, the rebels started bombing our hospital once again.  That was the second occasion.  Third occasion:  The headquarters itself of the International Committee of the Red Cross was bombed.  And I think one or two people died -- in any case, we had some people had died, and a few others were injured.  And the fourth occasion was when transportation of humanitarian aid towards Kabgayi, where there were many displaced people, was again targeted on the road between Kigali and Gitarama.  So, generally speaking, the fact that sometime in the middle of May the RPF forces had occupied almost half of the country.  So the section between Kigali and Katumbu (phonetic) and Rusumbu (phonetic).  So it was impossible to transport humanitarian aid, and it was not possible to negotiate exceptional measures for the transportation of humanitarian aid, so we had to use the Bujumbura-Kigali road.  And this also made it difficult for us to carry out our operations, our humanitarian operations rapidly.  That is all I recall.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, the names that have been mentioned by the witness, Rugunga is 71 on the list.  And Kabgayi is 72 -- 72.  Kabgayi.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I would like to come back to the sites that were responsible for, namely, the Sainte Famille site.  You said that you were responsible for that site personally.  Am I correct?  
A.	Yes, I supervised that site, but I had a permanent team there.  That is correct.  
Q.	Witness, as from what date, if you remember, was your permanent team set up there, and for how long did they stay there?  
A.	As from mid-May, I believe, more concretely.  As from the time that the RPF bombarded that site on the 1st of May, we had some 100 wounded and 15 dead.  The most seriously injured were moved to our rural hospital, and those who were not so seriously wounded were treated on the spot.  And as from that time, the health team, the medical team was set up permanently there.  And I would also like to say that, regarding the injured that we received at the hospital, the Red Cross rural hospital, once we looked at the capacity we would bring them there.  And that is the -- that is what explains the need -- the obligation for us to go there on the spot to check on their health situation and to check up on them and follow them up.  
Q.	Merci -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question was, when was it set up and for how long did they stay there?  Can we get an answer to the second part?  With other words, from mid-May until when?  
THE WITNESS: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Thank you.  Up till the end -- I think up till the 4th of July.  Even further -- further on.  The centre was not evacuated on the 4th of July.  I remained in Kigali from July to September, which is when I left Rwanda.  The centre continued existing even though its official -- or, representative, Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, was not there.  M-U-N-Y-E-S-H-Y-A-K-A.  He left on the 5th of July with the people -- most of the people who were leaving the capital.  But the centre continued existing and the relief workers even remained there.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, your relief workers who were there on a permanent basis, did they give you daily reports on the cases that they were working on?  
A.	Yes, they were obliged to give me reports; that is part of the modus operandi.  They had a book and every day they wrote down what happened, and that was part of medical practice in the Red Cross.  And as I said, we were run like combatants, we had a general command, we were called a third general staff, and we organised ourselves in the same manner as the army.  So they made reports.  
Q.	During the -- this period, were you able to see any reports on cases of sexual assault perpetrated in the sites?  
A.	I have no recollection of such specific cases.  I heard about -- was it because the team was led by woman -- a woman who might have had trouble expressing or explaining that?  But otherwise I don't think I was aware of any cases of rape or sexual assault.  
Q.	Were you -- Mr. Witness, did your team ever tell you that Mr. Renzaho often visited the site, particularly to meet the official whose name you have just mentioned?  
A.	Mr. Munyeshyaka did not even know the préfet, Préfet Renzaho.  He was a very discreet father.  And I know -- knew him, first of all, through the media long before the 6th of April because he had refused to officiate for a son of a conseiller near his parish, Sainte Famille parish.  I even remember that.  This case led to a lot of controversy, or noise.  But when I met him for the first time, it was somebody who was not known by the authorities.  And to say that Mr. Renzaho went there, 80 per cent of the time he was in his office.  

The only time I remember when I was with him, it was I think middle -- in the middle of May or June, I'm not sure when.  We accompanied a delegation, we accompanied a joint multiparty delegation composed of the UNAMIR, the ICRC, the préfecture of Kigali-ville, and he was a member of this official delegation.  I think it was on the 16th -- the 15th or the 16th of June, and that is the only time that I personally saw him there.  Now, to say that -- now, whether he went there without my knowledge, I have no idea.  But my team never told me that Mr. Renzaho came to the site.  

I can even sketch the office of Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, because I went there very often.  It was a presbytery, and I wonder how two people could have seen Mr. Renzaho there and not informed me.  But, generally speaking, the person who was constantly on the move, on a daily basis, maybe five times to a day, was a sous-préfet, Simpunga.  So I would respond in the negative.  
Q.	Witness, should I understand that your permanent teams working on the spot never reported to you that Mr. Renzaho carried out -- or, supervised any massacres? 
A.	No, he did not tell me that.  He never reported that fact to me.  
Q.	And did you in any way learn, between April and July, that that ever happened?  
A.	No, I never heard that.  I did not understand the question. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Did you learn in any way -- or, through other sources, I mean, that Mr. Renzaho led expeditions at the helm of militiamen, at sites where people were being massacred?  
A.	No, I never heard anything like that.  I'm learning that -- I'm hearing that for the first time in this Honourable Chamber.  I'm hearing that for the very first time.  
Q.	The visit that you mentioned in the company of Mr. Renzaho, and which you situate sometime in mid-June, if you remember, could you please say which official of UNAMIR was at the head of that delegation?  
A.	It was General Anyidoho.  I would have trouble spelling that name -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Aniyidoho, I believe.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's number 38 on the Defence spelling list.  

Shall we continue?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes.  
A.	And he had taken the initiative because the major discussion at the time was the setting up of safe humanitarian zones.  And that was the purpose of the visit.  And that was the problem -- that was the problem that could only be resolved with guarantees from the UNAMIR -- from UNAMIR, that is, the setting up of safe humanitarian zones.  So Sainte Famille had to be made a safe humanitarian zone.  But since we were overcrowded, we also had to think of other centres that could be set up, and that was the purpose of the visit.  We were part of the delegation so that we could talk about ensuring safety of the population to ensure that, during transportation, there would be no problems, and people would be placed in a safe humanitarian zone.  So that is how he was heading the delegation, Aniyidoho.  
Q.	And what do you think Mr. Renzaho's role was in that delegation?  
A.	In his capacity as préfet of Kigali-ville, he was the public authority on the spot.  Decisions involving displacements of the population could only be taken in the presence of people of his rank, like the préfet.  Even before, in the -- early May in Kagugu, I believe -- this is Sopecya, the Sopecya petrol station -- S-O-P-E-C-Y-A.  At this petrol station, Sopecya, UNAMIR definitely had some good intentions and had taken some civilians from the Hôtel des Mille Collines, and I'm sure their good intention was to move them to safer camps on the other side of the front line in the RPF zone, where there was an unfortunate event.  

	People who were piled in trucks were shot at by militiamen who were shouting at them that they were stealing their people and that they had no permission to move people.  And they said that UNAMIR was doing a task that was not their responsibility, but that of the government.  So UNAMIR could no longer attempt any such operations without the presence of a public authority.  And Mr. Renzaho was representing the public authority -- the public authorities in that delegation.  
Q.	And, Witness, did you know whether that safe humanitarian zone was ever established? 
A.	No, it was no longer possible, because I think on the 7th (sic), in the evening, the population was attacked by a well-organised commando force that -- that assigned some commandos and created a corridor for the evacuation of people.  And once again we picked up so many people who had been injured because of that commando operation.  And the -- subsequently, this idea of a safe humanitarian zone died because it was no longer possible to talk about it.  And the interim government no longer believed that it was possible to set up a safe humanitarian zone.  
Q.	Thank you, sir.  When did you pick up these wounded people that you've talked about following this attack?  
A.	Very early in the morning of the 17th.  Our teams went on the spot and they brought back several wounded people to our rural hospital. 
Q.	Do you remember how many times it took your team to carry out this operation, that is, picking up the wounded people and bringing them to the site?  
A.	No, I have no idea of how much time it took.  
Q.	If I said -- or, if I suggested that they were there -- that it took them all morning, what would you say to that?  
MR. MOSES: 
I would say, Your Honour, it's a very leading question.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I will rephrase, Mr. President.  I renounce the question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let me ask you another question still regarding the dates when your teams went out to pick up the wounded people.  Would you know whether, on that day, Mr. Renzaho went to the site in question?  
A.	No, I have no idea whether Mr. Renzaho went there on the 17th.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, you talked about meetings that you held regularly with Mr. Renzaho.  Was it the same for Mr. Philippe Gaillard with whom you collaborated?  
A.	It was not -- the telephone system in town was working and we divided our roles.  Mr. Gaillard was the head, but it was also his duty to contact the rebels, and he assigned me the task of contacting the authorities on the government side.  Otherwise, on several occasions, there was an official from the government who came, and Mr. Renzaho also came to our place, and we went to -- with Mr. Gaillard to his office.  So he was also on -- on a regular basis in contact with him.  It was our role to continue being in touch with the authorities who could, in some way, facilitate our humanitarian activity.  That was the duty of the officials of the Red Cross at that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are close to our 11 o'clock break now.  How much is left of the examination-in-chief, approximately?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel's microphone.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
About 45 minutes or one hour, Mr. President.  Or less.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And it may be less, in particular, Mr. Witness, if you try to answer briefly.  Because that's the technique in a courtroom.  You can very often just say yes and no, and then if counsel needs more information, he will ask a follow-up question.  So please think about this while we have this 11 o'clock break.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1129H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maître Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, we were discussing the meeting between Mr. Gaillard and Mr. Renzaho.  I believe this was the point we were on when we went on break.  And you confirmed that there were often meetings between the two people.  Can you now tell the Court whether, in the context of your high command, Mr. Gaillard thought that cooperation with Mr. Renzaho was good or not?  Did he happen to give his opinion on that cooperation? 
A.	Yes, he thought the cooperation was very good.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you remember a complaint that the Red Cross made around the end of April, a complaint that lodged with UNAMIR, and that complaint -- complaint was against the militia and also the Rwandan government? 
A.	Yes, a complaint launched with the Rwandan government, that is possible.  But a complaint launched with UNAMIR, that would be unthinkable.  We could not contact -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, Mr. President, the witness is not clear and it is too fast.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes, yes.  Now, you are now briefer, but still too fast.  Please begin your answer again.  Will you do that, please?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
We are sorry, Mr. President, he begins the sentence in the middle.  We can't make head or tail of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes, yes.  Mr. Witness, when you start your answer from the beginning, then you must kindly also start from the beginning of the first sentence.  So please start now with a complete first sentence so that we can get it in context.  You have the floor.  
THE WITNESS: 
I do not even remember how the sentence was phrased.  If I was helped -- if I was enabled to continue, then I would do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel will now ask the question again, and then you will answer again.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, my question was to know whether you remember a complaint that the Red Cross lodged with UNAMIR against the militia or against the government around the end of April 1994.  
A.	My answer is categorically no.  The operational measures or modalities of the Red Cross are such that that possibility does not exist.  It is even unthinkable.  Because we complain -- we complain about the operational methods of the two belligerents, and in that case we would contact the belligerents themselves, that is, either the Rwandan government forces or the rebel forces.  It would be unthinkable that -- to complain through a third party.  That is how the ICRC operates.  I think the case you mentioned is even unthinkable, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in the Red Cross operations of that time, was it the practice for you to issue communiqués regarding your operations?  
A.	Yes, we usually issued communiqués.  
Q.	With the permission of the Chamber, Witness, I am going to show you a document which you would please identify.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That document is in the Defence binder, tab 6 volume 2.  Tab 6, volume 2, the Defence binder.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, this document before you, is it a release or a communiqué issued by the Red Cross committee at that time?  
A.	It is a communiqué, or release, published in Geneva which certainly summarises what we communicated to Geneva every day.  So I think this reflects -- or, rather, this comes from the ICRC.  
Q.	Perhaps I will spare the Chamber of a reading of this document, which would be -- which reading would be fastidious.  But, Witness, at the top of the page, the page dated 21 April 1994 -- have you seen that page?  
A.	Yes. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Do you think that the urgency reflected here is the urgency mentioned by Mr. Philippe Gaillard as early as the 10th of April, and which led to the issuance of this communiqué? 
A.	I've never yet read the content of the communiqué.  But as of this date, that's the 21st of April -- why the 21st?  Even before the 21st the urgency relating to humanitarian issues was already there.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes.  Please slow down and observe the pause between question and answer, and answer and question.  

Now the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, please move on to the next tab, that is, tab 7.  There you will find another document, and please kindly identify that document as well.  
A.	It is a photocopy, but it has the insignia of the ICRC, and I can assure you that this photocopy reflects the original.  
Q.	So, it is indeed a document that comes from Geneva, like the first document we just saw; is that right? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And you would note that it is dated 25 May 1994.  Does that reflect the frequency of the communiqués that the Red Cross movement published regarding the emergency situation that existed? 
A.	As far as we were concerned, we had a permanent -- we had permanent contact -- were in permanent touch with the headquarters in Geneva.  Every day we could in fact publish as many -- or, issue as many communiqués.  The headquarters managed its information appropriately in a manner as to mobilise humanitarian aid.  And this corresponded to the -- or, rather, we could, every day -- or, on a daily basis publish such communiqués.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, with the leave of the Court, I would like you to be shown a document which we disclosed this morning to the Prosecution, and we apologise for this late disclosure.  That document is referenced K0337831.  That is the French version -- the identification for the French version of the document, K0337831.  I would like you to look at page 6 of that document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And without identifying any of the speakers in this document, what is now the question?  
(Pages 15 to 28 by Kirstin McLean)





















1145H 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I wanted to make sure that the witness is on page 6 of the document.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm on that page.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted and filed under separate cover) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why on Earth did you ask such a question?  We'll place that under seal as well as the response.  
That is why I said, "Without identifying any speakers in this document."  

What is now the next question?  Now, that should have been a good hint to you that you shouldn't identify any speakers, so what is now the next question?  
MR. NEKUIE:
I'm sorry, I apologise for that; I failed to take note of that hint.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, this statement, which is quite long -- we are not going to read it -- do you think it is minutes from its author? 
A.	Indeed, I have not read the statement, I do not even see the date of the statement.  
Q.	Witness, perhaps, to refresh your memory, you can read the first paragraph to the Court.  
A.	Yes, Counsel I will do so.  

"It is difficult to know the assistance that Rwandans could give us because the 2 millions that I talked about were taken to areas that you know where famine already is endemic.  

"In my opinion, this would be asking -- it would be asking too much from someone from Gikongoro to provide beans and sweet potatoes to those who have taken refuge in that area.  I believe that would worsen the situation of the individual from whom such assistance is sought."
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Does that remind you of the context in which this statement was made? 
A.	Yes, I believe it was in the course of an interview over the national radio.  During the interview, we had to present the situation -- the humanitarian situation in Rwanda -- that is, the prevailing humanitarian situation in Rwanda as at then.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  

Witness, still with the leave of the Court, I would like you to be shown a document referenced K0344542, page 9 of that document.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 9 is the middle of the intervention of a speaker identified on page 7 of this French version, and we note that person's identity.  And which part of page 9 shall we look at? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like the Witness to read to the Chamber the last paragraph of this page.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The one starting with, "Yesterday, Friday"? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That's correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you now read, Mr. Witness, please read slowly.  

We are listening. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

"Yesterday, Friday 15 April, the préfet of the préfecture of Kigali-ville chaired a meeting of representatives of political parties in Kigali town.  To that meeting, were invited the high representative of the International Red Cross Committee, Mr. Philippe Gaillard, who was accompanied by the delegate of the Rwandan Red Cross."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Defence counsel -- 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Please do not pronounce the name that follows.  
A.	"Were also present at that meeting, the representatives of the MRND, MDR, PSD and PDI political parties in Kigali town.  

"The officials who were absent were attending other meetings dealing with the restoration of peace throughout Kigali."
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, after that reading my question now is as follows:  Is that the meeting you talked to us about, that is, the meeting with political parties -- the meeting you talked about during your testimony-in-chief? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Witness, do you know whether during this meeting the militias that we talked about throughout this examination-in-chief were also present? 
A.	There were party officials.  All of them were dressed in plain clothes, so if there were militias dressed in plain clothes I would be unable to identify them.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, you testified that you personally knew Mr. Renzaho.  Indeed, that you had known him for a long time.  Do you think that at the time referred to Mr. Renzaho had anti-ethnic -- you do not want to use terms that are against your principle -- so, as I was saying, was Mr. Renzaho an ethnicist or tribalistic? 
A.	No, he wasn't.  He has never been tribalistic, so to speak.  
Q.	For the benefit of the Chamber, I would like to be clearer.  Did you ever notice that he was particularly hostile to the Tutsi ethnic group? 
A.	This morning, I testified before this Chamber that even displaced persons in the premises of the préfecture were of mixed ethnic origin.  And this morning, I also said that even his personal situation -- his family situation was such that the families of mixed family -- perhaps I forget to specify that he comes from an area which I know very well; namely, the eastern region where I did my secondary studies -- secondary education.  And where as a young man from the north, I can confirm here that 
that -- that an ethnicist feeling did not exist or does not exist in the eastern region.  It is a mixed region or area.  
For those of us who come from the north -- in fact, I learnt to live like the people of the east in that area.  The ethnicist feelings do not exist in the eastern region.  Therefore, by virtue of its upbringing, he could not be tribalistic and he is not.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for that answer.  

Witness, once more with the leave of the Court, I would have you listen to a tape recording and after listening I will put my question to you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like to have the witness listen to the exhibit produced by the Prosecution.  

Perhaps the registry has a copy of the exhibit? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just play it please, we know this well.  

As usual, interpretation and transcription will not be necessary.  

Shall we start? 

MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, we -- we have technical problems.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any other questions to this witness, apart from questions relating to that tape? 
MR. NEKUIE:
In fact, my question will deal with that -- with the tape -- with the recording. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you played this tape to the witness previously so that he knows of it? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Couldn't we then just ask the witness, "Mr. Witness, having heard this tape, where we now have a technical problem, did you, listening to that tape, recognise..." and now you can formulate your question, Mr. Nekuie.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I will ask him the same question as I did ask him when I had him listen to the tape recording.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Did you recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice in the tape recording which I had you listen to when you were being prepared? 
A.	I -- I would even say what I said at that time.  I said it seems rather strange that a recording of whosoever -- a recording of a private utterance would be made available to me.  I was disturbed, but to be precise, I did not recognise Renzaho's voice.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  I also thank you for the trouble you have taken to come before this Chamber to say what you know in the Renzaho trial.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have come to the end of the examination of chief of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want to tender any of the four documents you asked the witness to comment on?

All right, the first document is his Red Cross news communiqué, dated the 21st April, A for the French, B for the English.  Which number is that, Mrs. Ben Salimo?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 52, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 52A and D. 52B admitted)

MR. PRESIDENT:
The next document is the communiqué by the Red Cross dated 25th of May 1994, A for the French, B for the English.  

Mrs. Ben Salimo, number? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 53, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. D. 53A and D. 53B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then follows the document which is a transmission of the radio programme.  Do we know which radio station this comes from?  Is it Radio Rwanda? 
MR. NEKUIE:
It is Radio Rwanda, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do we know the date of the programme? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That document was identified on the 15th of April 1994.  The reference can be found on the very first page of the document and that will clarify us on that.  
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, it is the 15th of May. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see on the top of this document, on the right-hand side, the 17th of May 1994.  Is there agreement that that is the date? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I was looking at another document, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems to be the case.  At any rate, there seems to be no objections to the tendering of this document, and that will then be, Mrs. Ben Salimo?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 54, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No.  D. 54 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then, finally, another radio transcription, this time apparently dated the 15th of May, according to the front page, at least.  

The K number of the previous document D. 54 was, as we see from the transcripts, K0337831.  
The K number of the present exhibit which we are just about to enter is K0344542.  

Mrs. Ben Salimo? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
D. 55, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. 55 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we think that we will place D. 54 under seal.  

Mr. Witness, you said you met Mr. Renzaho ten times from the 15th of April to the 3rd of July; is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
I confirm, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you able to remember on which occasions you met him, the dates of these ten times, or is that too far back for you to recall now? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I cannot remember the dates, so I cannot specify on what dates I met him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is quite understandable.  Now, if you look at these ten occasions, would you say they were mostly in April, mostly in May, mostly in June, or is it not possible to say that there was a dominance of meetings or a majority of meetings during a particular month.  What is your view? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would say that those meetings were held over regular intervals.  I remember that at one time we were both victims of a bombing in his office, and we were obliged to go down to the basement where we spent the night.  That is one occasion that I remember.  So the meetings were held over regular intervals; they were regular meetings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution?
JUDGE EGOROV:
I'm sorry, Mr. Witness, what was the purpose of those meetings?  Did you discuss anything?  Did he invite you or it was your initiative to see him? 
THE WITNESS:
Once we had gone there to visit the displaced persons who were there on his site -- to whom we had to distribute food supplies.  On other occasions, when people were being moved from his site, these people were being bombed, and we had to move them towards the Hôtel des Mille Collines or towards Sainte Famille.  

It would be difficult for me to explain exactly, but these were the times when we went there for some specific missions.  And I went to his office to greet him when we went to his site for those specific missions.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, you told us that you got a laissez-passer from Robert Kajuga, who is the leader of the Interahamwes.  Is that right? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  
JUDGE ARREY:
And with this laissez-passer, you passed through the roadblocks without any problem by showing that laissez-passer? 
THE WITNESS:
Somewhat, yes, we had a few difficulties, but we had less difficulty with the laissez-passer than without the laissez-passer. 
JUDGE ARREY:
But earlier on in your testimony, you had told us that you couldn't say those militias were Interahamwes, and yet with the document from the head of the Interahamwes you were able to pass through the roadblocks without any molestation? 
THE WITNESS:
The militiamen recognised the authority of Kajuga and his deputies.  Whatever the parties they belonged to, they recognised his authority.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Another question:  How can you say that Father Wenceslas, who was in charge of Sainte Famille (inaudible), did not know Mr. Renzaho who was the préfet of Kigali-ville?  How could you tell us -- how are you in a position to make that statement? 
THE WITNESS:
I must use relative terms -- I must clarify the term, they did not have any personal relationship as such; that the préfet of Kigali is somebody everyone knows and he's a public authority, everybody knows him.  So in that capacity let me correct myself, Wenceslas knew the préfet like everyone else, but I just wanted to say that they had no personal relationship. 
JUDGE ARREY:
And my last question:  In answer to a question put to you by the Defence counsel, you said 
Mr. Renzaho never went to the Sainte Famille site at all? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember one occasion when we were all part of a delegation on that site, and the -- on the other occasions, I received no report from my teams there, nor had never witnessed him come there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour, I'm going to need to begin my cross-examination in closed session as there are some matters which will identify the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The estimated duration of the closed session? 
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps 30 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will close for 30 minutes, and then those in the public gallery are welcome back again.  
MR. MOSES:
There are a number of documents also, Your Honour, which may be referred in the course of cross-examination, and I'll have those distributed to Your Honours and Defence counsel now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then move into closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 37 to 49] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 29 to 36 by Jean Baigent)












MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness BDC, we are now in open session, and your cross-examination continues.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, you have told the Trial Chamber you became actively involved in the operations involving the International Red Cross on the 15th of April 1994; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And just so that we are quite clear, you were not part of the International Red Cross Committee, you were part of the national association; correct? 
A.	Not the association, but the national society. 
Q.	And, in fact, one day prior to you becoming involved, there was -- the International Red Cross suspended its operations in Kigali after six injured persons were taken from an International Red Cross ambulance and killed by militia in the presence of government soldiers; correct? 
A.	Yes, on the 14th, there was that incident, and the Red Cross no longer sent its ambulances outside of its headquarters.  But its activities continued.  Food continued to be distributed and medical attention was granted to patients in various hospitals.  
Q.	And there was an international outcry in the media by Mr. Gaillard? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, yes, there was a protest.  
Q.	And the Rwandan government was extremely concerned about its image as a result of that incident.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	That is correct, yes.  
Q.	Because not only had refugees been taken from the ambulance, but they had been killed in the presence of government soldiers, which indicated a support from the military.  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	That was on the 14th.  And I was not there to determine whether there were soldiers at that location at which wounded persons were taken out of the ambulance -- out of the Red Cross ambulance. 
Q.	But, Mr.  Witness, you have told us that you -- about meetings that you weren't present at which you received daily updates in respect of.  This was an incident reported through the world press, which indicated that there were soldiers present while the militia killed those refugees in the Red Cross ambulance.  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Well, a group of soldiers may have been at that location, but I don't know whether that is an important fact.  It might be possible, if that information has been cross-checked and is correct.  I therefore do not see any reason why I should challenge it.  I simply take note of it, unfortunately, 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Were you told that soldiers were present in 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not have a clear recollection of that specific fact.  There were soldiers, but I remember that the area was mentioned, quite close to the Kigali hospital centre at a roadblock which was well known for its atrocities.  We wept when we found out about those who had been taken out of our ambulances and killed.  But the fact relating to the presence of soldiers is not something that stands out clearly to my mind -- or to my memory.
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps the witness could be shown document 5 in the bundle.  It's a document from the ICRC in Geneva dated 15 April 1994.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I know from the information sheet that you can read English, Witness, and I would ask you to look at the first paragraph.  This is a communiqué or update on the ICRC activities dated 15 April, written by Mr. Harald, H-A-R-A-L-D, de Gruneck, spelt D-E, G-R-U-N-E-C-K.  

Now, Witness, you have told us that you were kept informed as to what was going on.  Can I suggest to you that what is described there, which was reported in many international newspapers, was that an ambulance of the Rwandese Red Cross was stopped and six wounded people in the ambulance were shot dead by militiamen while soldiers of the armed forces looked on.  Can I suggest to you -- does that refresh your memory? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it does.  And I had said earlier on that if the soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces were there looking on, I do not have that detail in my memory.  I simply take good note of it now.  I can even say that, indeed, soldiers -- some soldiers themselves were guilty of those types of crimes committed here and there.  

I do not have details in memory, so to speak, not such that can enable me to speak clearly on these issues.  What I am saying is that the facts pertaining to that situation are not fresh in my mind in respect of that particular aspect.  But here and there, there were soldiers who indeed took part in those types of crimes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If we look at your question, Mr. Moses, at 14:54:14, it was said that six injured persons were taken from an International Red Cross ambulance and killed by militia.  It seems to be the correct version, according to the document you have just given us, that it was from the national Red Cross ambulance; isn't that so?  
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  With other words, from the same organisation as this witness belongs to.  Is that so, Mr. Witness?  This was actually your organisation and your ambulance; do I understand this correctly?  
THE WITNESS:
I said that in times of armed conflict, the Rwandan Red Cross receives orders from the International Red Cross Committee.  So I think the issue here is one of identifying the type of vehicle that was used with all the relevant details.  The entire infrastructure and the Red Cross transportation fleet is put under the authority of the International Red Cross Committee.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who owned the vehicle?  Do you know; yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
The Rwandan Red Cross.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You see, what I am suggesting, Witness, is, in fact, that you becoming involved on the 15th of April 1994 was part of the Rwandan government's public relations exercise to try and get some goodwill back from the international community after there had been this widely publicised incident which had tainted their image.  Would you agree with me?  
A.	No, that is only a presumption, and I say no to it very categorically.  

Well before the 6th of April, and even before -- well before, during the times of civil war, I had worked with the international committee as an adviser on these types of issues.  So my intervention at that time had nothing to do with any public relations campaign whatsoever.  
Q.	Well, once you became involved on the 15th of April, were you told by Mr. Gaillard or others who had been involved themselves in the collection of bodies from the city of Kigali that there had been as many as 67,000 bodies picked up off the streets of Kigali by the préfectoral authorities?  Were you told that? 
A.	Did you say on the 15th of April?  
Q.	Any time during -- let's make it broader -- any time during April were you advised that the authorities had picked up as many as 67,000 bodies from the streets of Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, there were even more bodies to be picked up in Kigali.  There were more than 67,000 bodies that were picked up, and that must have been at a period where the bodies were 67,000.  But the teams that were picking up the bodies gave whatever figure they pleased.  So it must have been during that period -- it may have been correct to mention that figure during that period. 
Q.	And did you, in your role, manage to discover what the vast majority -- the ethnicity of the vast majority of those persons were? 
A.	War-wounded victims, yes.  But I do not understand your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is something lacking in the interpretation.  Please repeat your question.  It is understandable that he didn't understand.  
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	Did you manage to discover what the ethnicity was of the vast majority of those victims? 
A.	Yes, the first victims were the Tutsis, as it was said.  On the other hand, there were people who were opposed to the ideology represented by the majority of the militias who manned the roadblocks.  Therefore, you had both Tutsis, as well as members of opposition parties whose ideas were opposed to that espoused by the militia.  
Q.	And did you observe, Witness, that the killings were systematic?  Persons were identified by virtue of their ethnicity and killed by reason of their ethnicity? 
A.	I noticed that clearly around the end -- or, rather, mid-June, or perhaps early June, end of June that was obvious.  But during the early moments of the month of April, no, I mean, mid-May right up to the end of June, during those initial moments of the month of April, I can only refer to the declarations themselves -- the declarations of the RPF itself, which said that it is not a conflict, an ethnic conflict, but rather a political conflict and the victims were political victims.  It is Mr. Dusaidi who said that -- he said that over international radio stations.  And that opinion prevailed until early May when the Pope himself talked about genocide.  The UN also started talking about a genocide.  Therefore, it was not only us on the spot, but also the various observers.  Well, the various observers had not yet agreed regarding that point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which name did you refer to, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Dusaidi is spelt D-U-S-A-I-D-I.  He was ambassador of Rwanda just after the RPF took over power in Rwanda.  He was at the United Nations in charge of public relations.  So if it was a way of going over all his declarations, he was categorical.  He said that the massacres were not ethnic in nature, but, rather, political.  

Up to the moment when the Pope himself and France started talking of genocide, we did not have as humanitarian workers a basis to start talking of genocide.  Personally, I came to know the definition of genocide later on.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Would you agree with the proposition, Witness, that in the first weeks after the death of President Habyarimana, the Red Cross were evacuating wounded people who were all Tutsi?  This is in April.  
A.	I cannot be categorical on that point because it is very difficult, especially in Kigali, to make a distinction between a Hutu and a Tutsi on the one hand.  On the other hand, the Red Cross had strict instructions to avoid venturing into identifying victims on the basis of their ethnicity.
Q.	Well, Witness, you didn't have any difficulty, did you, in identifying those persons who had taken refuge at the préfecture office as being both Hutu and Tutsi.  So I am wondering why you are having trouble -- or had trouble identifying those who had been wounded as being either Hutu or Tutsi.  
A.	If you want, very well, there were wounded persons both Hutu and Tutsi.  If you please, that's the answer I should have given you.  
Q.	Were you aware that Mr. Kambanda, the Rwandan prime minister, had asked the Red Cross for assistance to evacuate the dead bodies in Kigali, but that he had -- but that Mr. Gaillard had refused, until the killings had stopped?  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Perhaps laying down security as a condition for us to operate, well, we were aware that we would not send our people on the ground because bombs were falling all over.  So I would imagine that Mr. Gaillard laid down security as a condition.  This condition must have been put to the government troops, but also to the RPF.  But massacres were all about us.  We could not put an end to our activities.  We had to continue operating.
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I am wondering if the witness can be shown -- there are two documents, both in the bundle which have been provided to Your Honours and the Defence; the fourth and, I think, fifth document.  They are both speeches of Mr. Gaillard.  I think they are stapled together. 

Sorry, Your Honour, can I just approach to make sure it's the right document?  

Perhaps if that document, which the registry had, could be shown to -- 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, that is a document off the International Red Cross website, which is a transcript of a speech given by Mr. Gaillard on the 18th of October 1994 at the international museum of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Geneva.  What I would like to bring your attention to is page 4 of that document, and it's the 7th paragraph -- it's about two-thirds of way down the document commencing "On two occasions".  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In that document, Mr. Gaillard says:

"On two occasions in 1994 our ambulances were stopped at militia roadblocks and the wounded were forcibly unloaded and killed before our very eyes.  RTLM announced that the ICRC was transporting enemies of the republic disguised as mock wounded.  We explained, protested, had Geneva issue press releases that were picked up by the western media.  The effect in Rwanda was immediate.  The Rwandan government and media changed tack and set out to polish their badly tarnished image by mounting an awareness campaign on the right of the wounded to take -- wounded to care, and on the role of the Red Cross.  Within a few days our ambulances no longer had any difficulty in moving about freely in Kigali." 

Do you agree with the statement recorded there, Witness?  
A.	I think this was Gaillard's opinion as at then, an opinion according to which the government sought to improve its image.  That is a matter of personal opinion.  When we -- when we contacted the government, it was always on the basis of the Geneva Conventions that we made our requirements.  We told them that the conventions that you have signed provide the following:  That you are guilty of a breach of the conventions to which you have subscribed.  And I believe they did that because of that.  But, in any case, this is the opinion of a colleague, and I respect that opinion.  I cannot discuss it.  I cannot question it.  It is for him to explain it.  It's not for me to explain or comment on his opinion.  
Q.	Say you went and spoke to Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Rutaganda; is that right. 
A.	Yes, I did that. 
Q.	And that is because, presumably, they were those who were in charge of the militias that were causing you problems at the roadblock; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And following on from the question earlier from Judge Arrey, would you agree that those persons were not just leaders of unorganised militia, they were, in fact, leaders of the MRND Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, Kajuga was a member of the MRND, and so were the members of his team.  I met them at that time. 
Q.	And you will agree Mr. Gaillard is saying that the -- as a result of the government intervention, there were no further problems at the roadblocks for the ICRC after a few days; correct?  
A.	I do not know whether he's specifically referring to that aspect.  When I went to see the militias -- but I did not have the impression of seeing among the militias a government representative.  I had before me leaders of the militias, and those leaders had sort of become independent of the government, and they had authority, because the paper they issued me was sufficient.  It served its purpose and it maintained -- or, it had the desired effect; it enabled us to go past roadblocks manned by militiamen. 
Q.	You will agree with me the government was dominated by MRND ministers.  We can at least agree on that?  
A.	No, there were all political parties represented in the government.  I do not have the list before me.  I don't even think that the MRND had the majority of the ministers.  I would be making a mistake if I venture into giving you a precise number of ministerial portfolios the MRND held.  
Q.	Would you agree that the MRND was, at least, one of the most important political parties in terms of numbers in the government? 
A.	I think I just answered that question.  I would be repeating myself, but I would say that I do not know the exact number of portfolios that were given to the MRND party.  But I said that I do not think that they had the majority of ministerial portfolios in the government. 
Q.	They were a significant -- well, we can at least agree, can't we, that they were a significant force in the interim government?  Or you won't agree with that? 
A.	Not only in the government, but throughout the country.  The MRND was an important political force; you are right, Counsel.  
Q.	And the youth militia of that significant party, after intervention by the Red Cross complaining about the activities of the militia, were able to control that same militia in persuading them not to attack the Red Cross.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	No, because I said that the militia -- the militias were groups of people who were drugged.  They reflected the devil or a demon coming to descend on us.  Those militias, led by the young people of various parties, actually respected the authority of Mr. Kajuga and Rutagengwa (sic).  Did they, by reason of that, also respect the authority of the MRND?  I do not know.

1530H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last name was?  Which name did you mention after Kajuga?  We got it not quite clearly.  
THE WITNESS: 
I only mentioned Kajuga and his team.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I believe the name started with an R, Mr. President.  It sounded like Rutengwa.  
THE WITNESS: 
R-U-T-E-N-G-W-A.  Rutengwa.  Is it Rutaganda -- Rutagengwa (phonetic)?  I'm sorry, there is a possible confusion between Rutengwa and Rutaganda.  
MR. MOSES: 
All right, I am sorry, Your Honours.  I'll -- no, it's okay.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you'll agree that the Red Cross was able to get food to the larger centres, such as Sainte Famille and Saint Paul's.  
A.	Yes, that is right.  
Q.	And did the Red Cross, to your knowledge, ever turn down requests for food for those persons at either of those places -- or anywhere, for that matter?  
A.	The translation talks of refusing aid.  I don't think that is -- that would have been possible.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that, apart from the attacks on the Red Cross ambulances, there were also problems that the Red Cross encountered with the militias stealing food from the Red Cross that was intended for delivery to other -- other refugees?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, they blocked not only the wounded but all movement to sites that needed our assistance.  We had difficulties with them, and this was on a daily basis.  Therefore, if you are aware of a specific case, that case would be part of our daily difficulties in our operations.  The militias blocked us, and as Mr. Gaillard says here, the militias even sought to portray us as people collaborating with the enemy.  They even asserted that the people we were transporting were not wounded people but rather an enemy who were disguised as wounded people.  
Q.	So, if -- if a statement was put to you, namely, that -- I'm sorry, I'll -- I'll rephrase.  

Would you agree that at the end of April the ICRC suspended its operations for a while because of security issues?  
A.	End of April, yes, yes.  But indeed, as was the case always, these were mobile operations.  Internal humanitarian action where we were continued.  But for reasons of insecurity, we had to stop the movement of our teams at some point.  And I believe that was around the end of April. 
Q.	And would you also agree that it -- it was certainly not an exaggeration to -- to say that the militias had been removing patients and killing them, and also that the militias were stealing food?  Would you agree that those propositions were not -- what I've just said to you doesn't exaggerate the situation?  
A.	No, that's correct.  
Q.	So if the Accused in this case had said to the UNAMIR representatives on the 28th of April, when that scenario was put to him, that he -- that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerating somewhat in that kind of report, you wouldn't agree with what the Accused might have said at that time about such a report.  
A.	A Red Cross report, you mean?  Addressed to whom?  To UNAMIR?  Well, the Red Cross did not report to UNAMIR.  The Red Cross had direct access to all warring parties, or all fighting parties.  Would that report have been to the UNAMIR, to the government, to the préfet?  Well, there was no report made to the UNAMIR, as such.  But if any such report was submitted, I -- I would not believe, in the -- the truth of that report within the given context.  
Q.	All right.  Roadblocks, Mr. Witness.  Would you agree that roadblocks in Kigali, throughout the month of April -- months of April, May, and June prevented Tutsis from moving safely around Kigali?  
A.	I am sorry, I did not quite understand your question.  Maybe you expressed yourself well, but I was a little absent minded.  
Q.	Would you agree that the roadblocks which were established in and around Kigali city, during the months of April, May, and June, prevented Tutsi from moving safely throughout the city?  
A.	That is correct.  You know that at those roadblocks they were checking for the famous identity cards, and the people you have referred to had more problems than other members of the population.  
Q.	When you say "problems", they were killed at the roadblocks, weren't they, when they showed their Tutsi identity cards?  
A.	Some Tutsi who were members of parties -- well, some also survived because they shared a common ideology with the militia or with the political parties.  Counsel, let me tell you that Mr. Kajuga himself, the head of the militia, must have been, if not entirely Tutsi, was a member of that ethnic group in one way or another.  The militia also included people of Tutsi extraction.  That is why Mr. Dusaidi, whom I referred to, appeared at that time to be in a correct position, namely, that to the end of -- towards the end of April/mid-May, he appeared to say that the -- belonging to the militia was more relevant to survival than belonging to a specific ethnic group.  But I don't have any concrete details to substantiate this fact.  Mr. Kajuga himself gave an interview, as we regularly did.  He said that there were Tutsis among us, and that we were defending ourselves, we were acting in self-defence.  And I'm sorry if my answer is not specific enough.  That is my answer to that very specific question you put.  
Q.	Well, I'll put it another way.  Are you saying it was safe for Tutsis to travel through the roadblocks on the streets of Kigali?  
A.	Yes, if they displayed their belonging to the militia, some were able to survive.  Some also survived without belonging to the militia in -- in real terms, but who adopted that strategy for purposes of survival, namely, embracing the ideology of the militia with a view to surviving.  And that's how they survived.  It -- it is a little bit complicated, you know.  That problem is a rather complex one, you know.  
Q.	Well, putting aside the militia, the vast majority of Tutsis, the overwhelming majority of Tutsis were not members of militia, were they?  
A.	No, no, not at all.  And not the vast majority of Hutus were members of the militia either.  It was a diabolical creation of the times which, I must say, did not represent the majority of Hutus, did not represent the Rwandan people, did not represent the Hutu.  So my answer to your question is yes.  
Q.	And these roadblocks were set up, to a large extent, by the civilian authorities, namely, in particular, the Accused in this trial, Tharcisse Renzaho; isn't that the case?  
A.	I have already stated this morning that the mental status of the members of the teams of the militia at the roadblock -- or, that I saw at the roadblocks does not correspond to the image I had -- or, the knowledge I had of Mr. Renzaho at that time.  My idea was that those who were militia threatened him, they threatened his staff, and threatened the whole concept of public security which he stood for.  
Q.	That's not the question, Witness.  The question was:  These roadblocks were set up, to a large extent, by the civilian authorities, namely, in particular, the Accused in this trial, Tharcisse Renzaho.  Do you agree that he was responsible for ordering these roadblocks to be established?  
A.	The overall message was for people to group themselves together as they knew themselves, and to ensure security.  That, in broad strokes, was the general thrust of the message.  Now, talking about the setting up of those teams as they were constituted, and whether they were under his authority, my answer has consistently -- and will consistently be no.  
Q.	So you didn't hear him on the radio on the 11th of April, the 12th of April, the 19th of April, the 21st of April, telling the population to establish roadblocks, telling the population to man roadblocks?  You didn't hear any of those speeches by the Accused on the radio; is this what you're telling us?  
A.	The call for members of the population to set up roadblocks was a daily occurrence on Radio Télévision Mille Collines.  Within 30-minute intervals that was being done, and I think the officials also called on the population to mobilise themselves in that manner.  But, referring particularly to Mr. Renzaho, I said that I do not recall -- or, that I do not have any facts that lead me to say that he organised the establishment of roadblocks or militia within his préfecture.  
Q.	Would you agree, Witness, as at the beginning of May 1994, it was relatively safer for Tutsis -- Tutsi refugees to be in those larger groups of refugees, namely at Sainte Famille, Saint Paul's, than it would be for them to be in their homes? 
A.	That would apply to everyone in the city.  The overall feeling was for all citizens to move towards the places where there were groups, for psychological reasons, and even more so for the Tutsi.  And, further still, for those who didn't embrace the ideology of the criminals who spontaneously surfaced from the 6th of April. 
Q.	If the Red Cross had told all the Tutsi refugees, at the beginning of May, to leave Sainte Famille and go home, what do you think would have happened to them, bearing in mind your observations as to what were happening to Tutsis at the roadblocks at that time?  
A.	That is an impossible speculation, because the Red Cross would never have done any such thing.  It would never have gone to a camp of displaced persons and talked to Tutsi.  So I cannot answer a question which presupposes the impossible.  
Q.	Well, Witness, let's put the Red Cross to one side.  If you had gone, as an individual, to Sainte Famille at the beginning of May and told the Tutsi refugees to go home, what, according to you, would happen -- have happened to them at -- having regard to what you had been observing at the roadblocks?  
A.	I would never have done any such thing.  And, furthermore, to answer your question, we were in the month of May, isn't it.  At that time there were roadblocks at every 500 metres across the city.  And anyone who was in a premises like Sainte Famille enjoyed some measure of psychological security.  And whether they were Tutsi or not, such a person would not have done that kind of thing because they would be moving straight into death.  So I think that it is understood that death would have been expected, isn't it.  
Q.	Thank you.  You'd agree that it was -- it would be as good as sending those persons to their death?  
A.	Yes, absolutely.  
Q.	And therefore, if, as we have heard in this trial, Mr. Renzaho had made such a request in respect of the refugees at Saint Paul's, you'd also agree that such a request or order amounted to him giving them a death sentence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Objection, Mr. President.  I do not know whether the Prosecutor is speculating as far as Mr. Renzaho is concerned, or is he putting it to the witness that Mr. Renzaho made any such statement?  Because otherwise it would be rather insidious.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, we have heard from Witness KZ, who you will recall gave evidence that he had a telephone conversation at the beginning of May with the Accused, during which time the Accused told KZ to send the refugees home.  It's based on evidence that Your Honours have heard, and I think it's a very fair -- well, it's a fair question to put to this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have had such a testimony; that's true.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  What we would like is for the Prosecutor to tell -- to state that a previous witness has made such a statement, rather than put suggestions to him without laying the proper foundation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, if it's true, as one witness has stated, that Mr. Renzaho made such an order, what would be your comment, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, if that witness didn't lie and the facts are true that he did so, well, that is the only thing I can say.  And I would like to say that I never heard any such thing, I never heard Mr. Renzaho saying any such thing, or ordering the refugees at Sainte Famille to go back home.  Which home?  All the homes had been destroyed.  And the problems of mobility or access were real, and they were serious, even for those of us who had the ability or resources to go about -- to move about.  Now, that is the witness's opinion.  Whether it is the truth or not, well, he swore to speak the truth.  I have taken the oath to speak my own truth.  And I don't have to make any judgement on what a previous witness has said, I can only speak about those things which I witnessed.  He probably witnessed something which he has told the Court, and that is his right.  It is for him to be responsible for the truth or the lie that he told.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  To conclude, Witness, you've known the Accused for more than 20 years; that's your evidence, isn't it?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And can I suggest to you that you've shared political ideologies with the Accused as well?  
A.	No, I don't think he was a member of a political party.  He was an administrative official, he was not a member of a political party.  And I have told you that I never, never, never, up till April 1995, I never belonged to any political party.  So there is no way in which we can refer to any political ideology.  
Q.	You told us earlier today that you had written to the Accused prior to his arrest; isn't that right?  After the genocide and prior to his arrest?  
A.	Yes, it is possible.  I said that after 1995 I became politically active, and this is an open secret.  I therefore would crave the indulgence of the Court not to focus on something that didn't concern the period, because this is a civic right and inalienable right that one can enjoy relating to a personal letter that I might have written to a friend.  How -- how does that become relevant in this matter?  
Q.	You know, don't you, Mr. Witness, that the Accused was leading armed forces in the Congo after the end of the genocide, between 1994 and the time of his arrest, and that those armed forces included the ex-militia who you have been talking about who were responsible for a lot of the killings?  
A.	Well, maybe we will talk about that when we are in a tribunal that will deal with the crimes of that period.  For now we are dealing with the crimes of 1994, aren't we?  
Q.	Witness, are you aware that the Accused was leading the armed forces in the Congo during that period?  
A.	I will not answer that question.  
Q.	Why's that?  
A.	Am I not entitled to desist from answering a question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was that the last question?  
MR. MOSES: 
One final question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can I suggest to you that you know the Accused well, and you know very well that it is his voice that was on the audio tape that you listened to, who was the préfet who was speaking on that tape and who was ordering the extermination of persons -- of Tutsi in that tape?  What do you say to that?  
A.	I was not able to recognise his voice, and I have said that already.  If it is the same document you are referring to, I say that I was not in a position to recognise his voice.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, that's the end of my cross-examination.  I don't know whether you want to have the documents tendered now, as Prosecution exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, let's do that before re-examination.  The first document was Mr. Guichaoua's report?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French, B for the English.  Mr. Matemanga, the number?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 101.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you just repeat the number, please?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 101.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 101A and P. 101B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next document was the letter to Colonel Simba.  Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 102. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, the Prosecutor showed me this document.  It is a personal letter about a friend, the story of a friend -- Mr. Simba is a friend.  And since he is an elder, African tradition requires that I refer to him as my elder brother.  But, Mr. President, if you read this letter, there is nothing in the content, except matters dealing with somebody for whom I have much respect, and in which I seek to know from him, issues that relate to the matters of trade representation which he was familiar with at the time.  And that is what I was asking of him.  I must, therefore, insist that private correspondence, I believe, should also enjoy some respect in this Tribunal.  And I really want to register my opposition to the use of private mail.  And this is on the grounds of the law and traditions and practice, namely, that there is some measure of protection of private correspondence.  Because, indeed, it is private.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There are rules prohibiting some evidence to come in, but we have no information to see that any of those rules apply here.  We note what you just said, and let me assure you that there is a difference between admitting the document and the weight of the document.  

But this is then P. 102.  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the -- there is only one language version.  Simply P. 102.  Is that so, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. MOSES: 
I wonder whether it should be under seal, bearing in mind it has the -- is signed by the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Absolutely.  
(Exhibit No. P. 102 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The next document was the meeting report of 29th March to 3rd April 1995.  That was the period of the meeting.  A for the French and B for the English.  Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes, P. 103.  
(Exhibit No. P. 103A and P. 103B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then it was the statement by the FAR high command, following its meeting of 28 and 29th April 1995.  Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 104, A and B.  
(Exhibit No. P. 104A and P. 104B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Then the Geneva document of 15th April 1994 with the title "blood bath continues".  Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 105.  
(Exhibit No. P. 105 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then, from the ICRC website, a reference of somebody of a speech made by Mr. Gaillard on the 18th of October 1994.  Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 106.  
(Exhibit No. P. 106 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Those were the documents you used.  

Re-examination.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I would like to clarify a number of points with you, the points that were raised by counsel for the Prosecution during cross-examination.  

Witness, when you went to see the leaders of the militia, namely Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Rutengwa as you mentioned, did you go to see them in your personal capacity, or on behalf of the Red Cross?  
A.	I went on behalf of the -- the humanitarian action that needed to be efficient in order to meet its objective of saving human lives.  So it was on behalf of the Red Cross.  I had no personal reasons to meet them.  
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Was it on behalf of the national Red Cross, or on behalf of the International Red Cross?  
A.	Let me repeat, for the sixth time, that in times of armed conflict the national Red Cross comes under the authority of the International Red Cross.  So I was acting on behalf of the International Red Cross.  
Q.	Thank you.  The safe passage that you were able to obtain for those people, was it for your personal use or on behalf of the Red Cross on whose behalf you conduct those negotiations?  
A.	We photocopied that document which was like a cheque, a very precious cheque, which we distributed to all drivers of ambulances, and they would display them whenever they were stopped at roadblocks by the militia.  And as Mr. Gaillard himself said, that led to the situation where we no longer faced any problems.  
Q.	Now, Witness, there were incidents at which some Red Cross -- some wounded patients of the Red Cross were taken out of ambulances and killed.  In that connection, the Prosecutor argued that it was in the presence of soldiers.  Now, Witness, do you know whether soldiers in Kigali town were under the authority or command of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho?  
A.	No, not at all.  He was not even a -- a staff of the ministry of defence.  A préfet is an administrative officer who comes under the jurisdiction of the minister of the interior.  So, even in that respect, apart from his being a colonel, which, may I say, was a matter of chance, he had no direct links with the ministry of defence.  He did not command, and he had no capacity to issue orders to the soldiers.  The only security force available to him was the communal police, which I believe also falls under the ministry of the interior.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, we talked at length on roadblocks.  I think the Prosecution also discussed roadblocks with you.  Did you ever hear Renzaho tell you that he was the one who initiated the setting up of those roadblocks?  
A.	No, not only could he not tell me that, but I am saying that the spontaneous nature of how these roadblocks came into being, the disorganised manner in which they came into being, the general aspect of drugged young people, indicates that hell had broken loose.  The situation was such that -- and I continue to say no, he couldn't have been at the origin of the setting up of the roadblocks.  Maybe somebody else will make allegations to that effect, but I am saying no, there are no -- or, there is no basis to confirm such an allegation.  
Q.	Did you hear over the radio -- I'm asking you the Prosecution's question.  Did you hear Renzaho's message around the 10, 11, 12th of April, asking people to set up roadblocks? 
A.	On the 10th of April, did you say that?  
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Did you ever hear messages from Renzaho, personally, messages broadcast over the radio and asking people to set up roadblocks?  
A.	We, the senior staff of the Red Cross, no longer listened to the radio.  We had staff who were specifically appointed to take down all declarations broadcast over the radio, and the person in charge of information in a meeting will come and brief us.  But he would always insist on messages which were harmful to our humanitarian activities.  I do not remember any briefing from our officer-in-charge of information which would confirm your question.  So, unless I did not listen to that broadcast, and that would be normal because I was constantly on the ground or in the field, I do not remember, from memory, anything that would enable me to say yes to your question.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, during the period of April to July 1994, did -- were you debriefed, or, did you have briefings on any message whatsoever that Mr. Renzaho may have published during the period referred to, messages that he may have had broadcast over the radio, messages of what -- of any nature whatsoever?  
A.	No.  To be more precise, I noticed that Renzaho informed me of all that he was doing, of his problems.  I believe that, from a humanitarian standpoint, I am aware of his concerns.  So I did not need to listen to the radio.  I would go and contact him.  I went to his office and came out at any time I chose to.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, now, I would like to come back -- and that would be the last point we'll be dealing with.  I'd like to come back to the period of April, that is, from the 6th of April to the 30th of April 1994.  Was there fighting in Kigali town during the period referred to?  
A.	Half of his entire préfecture -- I should be precise.  Half of his entire préfecture, or even move than half of his entire préfecture, in absolute terms, because the two communes, Kacyiru, which is spelt as follows.  K-A-C-Y-I-R-O (sic), that was the first commune.  The second commune was Kicukiro.  K-A-C-U-R-O (sic).  These two communes were practically occupied.  His administrative territory had reduced to almost nothing.  He was reduced to Nyarugenge -- Nyarugenge which is spelt as follows, N-Y-A -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping).  Thank you.  

Now, did this arise in cross-examination?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness's answer:  
THE WITNESS: 
So there was fighting -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
-- says the witness -- 
THE WITNESS: 
-- in Kigali préfecture.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, perhaps the question was not phrased.  But in answer to a Prosecution question, the witness talked about bombs which were falling on the town, unless I am mistaken.  In any case, the transcripts are there to bear me out.  Perhaps I should -- I'll ask him the question, the source of the bombs.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Can you answer that question?  Where did bombs that you mentioned during your -- during the cross-examination, where did they come from?  
A.	Yes, indeed, bombs were falling from all over.  They came from all sources occupied by the belligerents.  The Rwandan armed forces were bombing, the RPF was also doing same.  I also specified that some of the bombs of the RPF army fell on us, and that we had many wounded persons and dead people amongst us.  So there were bombs, and they were thrown by the two belligerents.  In fact, we were victims of some of the shelling.  This was at the Kigali hospital centre, the Red Cross hospital in Rugunga, and even at the very headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Now, the victims.  Were the victims -- were they people who were killed by the bombs you just mentioned?  Or, rather, were they the victims of a specific ethnic group?  
MR. MOSES: 
I don't know if this is a follow on from this question, but we've checked:  The question of bombs arose in evidence-in-chief.  It did not arise in cross-examination, Your Honour.  And so if this is a question following from the previous one, then I'm objecting because it's not a matter arising.  
(Pages 57 to 66 by Kirstin McLean)


1615H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have virtually exhausted the re-examination now, haven't we? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That is what I'm trying to do, Mr. President, if the Prosecution would allow me to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is that according to the rules of this Tribunal one cannot venture into new areas or follow up in examination-in-chief with questions if those areas were not covered during cross-examination.  That is the procedural situation we are faced with now.  So the objection of the Prosecution is well founded according to our practice.  

Any other questions? 
MR. NEKUIE:
In that case, Mr. President, I have just two more questions -- my last two questions and that would be the end of my re-examination of this witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, during your cross-examination, mention was made of about 67,000 dead -- and you said the number was even higher -- 67,000 dead in Kigali at the beginning of the fighting.  Do you know whether this figure corresponds to the Kigali population as you knew it at that time -- that is, in April 1994? 
A.	When I answered that question, I didn't have the necessary time.  I'm saying that there were even more dead than 67,000 in Kigali, and I would've liked to be asked the dates when that figure was put forward.  But that figure must have been possible at some point in time during the conflict.  Moreover, the figure was exceeded in absolute terms, but the second part of the question was not clear to me -- or, rather, I do not remember it.  Could you please repeat it?  
Q.	I wanted to know whether that figure reflected or corresponded to the Rwandan population in 
April 1994? 
A.	Well, Counsel, it was no longer just a matter of the Kigali population, it was just a matter of the Rwandan population.  You had all these displaced people -- the hundreds of thousands of people who fled to places where they thought they would find safety.  They came from several préfectures, particularly from the north in Ruhengeri, Byumba and Kibungo.  They also came from the préfecture -- or, rather, the préfecture of Kigali-ville is a small préfecture in the province of Kigali.  

So, people also came from the surrounding areas of Kigali-ville, that is, from Kigali-rural as it was known.  So it is very difficult to give you an exact number of Rwandan citizens who had come into the capital city.  In fact, perhaps, you may even have had more victims than the population of Kigali town.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, now my last question:  When you undertook to work exclusively on behalf of the Red Cross at that time, was that a mandate of the government that you were carrying out or was it a voluntary choice made by you? 
A.	No, I have been a member of the Red Cross since the age of 13, and as I said, in secondary school, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover), I became a Red Cross instructor.  **********************************************.  I was a Red Cross instructor, as I said, I had international training, and as I told you I did not belong to any other organisation, be it political or any other organisation.  I belonged only to the Red Cross.  

I acted on my own volition to put my strength and energy at the disposal of the Red Cross.  It was not because of any order whatsoever; it was not an obligation arising from the government.  It was my own personal decision which, moreover, put me in difficulties with my family, because without this commitment to the Red Cross, I would have accompanied my family when all foreigners were evacuated on the morning of the 6th of April.  
Q.	Witness, I thank you and I wish you a safe return to your place.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours the re-examination of this witness has come to an end.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- well, let me first ask:  I saw there was a reference to a secondary school here.  Shouldn't we place that under seal?  Indirectly through the knowledge of Mr. Renzaho's birthplace, we suddenly got some information, didn't we?  Do you agree, Defence? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That's entirely correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So at 16:18:08 in the English version, we will delete the words after:  "As I said in secondary school..." then follows the deletion, and then we continue with, "I became a Red Cross instructor".  The rest is maintained but these words are under seal.  

Then, a question for you, Mr. Witness.  

You said you met Mr. Renzaho ten times from the 15th of April to the 3rd of July.  Can you recall how he was dressed during these occasions? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sometimes he was in military uniform and at other times in civilian clothes.  The civilian clothes were rare given the conditions in which he lived.  He would wear a pair of trousers -- a military pair of trousers, which enabled him to feel more comfortable in the conditions in which he was.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that you had your team in the Sainte Famille church.  What kind of team was that?  How many people and what kind of work did they carry out? 
THE WITNESS:
I am thinking particularly of two officials who were at Sainte Famille.  They had full powers to use medical staff.  Amongst the displaced persons, we also had medical staff who helped our teams.  The tasks which they were asked to carry out -- I think I spelt them out.  As people recovered and as the hospital was being emptied -- which hospital was overcrowded, we decided to take some patients into the camps so that the ambulance health care delivery should be continued to be provided to them in those camps.  

So, we continued delivering them health care from the ambulances -- as we also provided them with food supplies, we also wanted to make sure that the food supplies were not misused.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Your two officials were busy in looking after people who needed some attention? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, those who were wounded and who had to continue receiving health care. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
And they were inside the church? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, each of -- each of them had a room made available to them.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
And how many hours did they spend there? 
THE WITNESS:
They were there on a permanent basis.  In fact, it was also for security reasons that they were there on a permanent basis.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This team was a Rwandan team or foreigners? 

These two persons were they Rwandans or not? 
THE WITNESS:
The permanent team comprised nationals, or locals, but the daily visits were also carried out by our expatriate colleagues.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Munyeshyaka, was he a good man or a bad man during the events in '94 in relation to the refugees? 
THE WITNESS:
I would say that Munyeshyaka rendered significant services to our humanitarian action in Kigali town.  A short while ago, we were talking about a letter written about him.  I remember that he was somebody who was very efficient.  He had problems with both belligerents.  There was some kind of defamatory campaign that was waged against him.  He was a victim of that defamation campaign.  I believe he's somebody who needs justice.  

Knowing how he was committed -- before the 6th of April and after the 6th of April, and the problems he had before he fled to France -- the problems he had in refugee camps.  I do not know that -- somewhere or somehow, you have been told that he was threatened by the militias before he fled.  
So, I am saying that this is a good person and he deserves some justice, and you will find much truth from him regarding what I'm saying.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this defamatory campaign, when did it start, according to your knowledge?  
THE WITNESS:
It started -- or, rather, it was started by the Interahamwe well before the 6th of April.  I think, I mentioned this fact.  He refused to -- or to mediate for a group of Interahamwes and he became their enemy.  

I've also been told that from the 1st of May when the Sainte Famille church was bombed -- in fact, that was indeed on the 1st of May, on that day 115 people were wounded and, I believe, about 
10 or 15 people died there and then.  

Shells fell repeatedly on the site, more than six shells.  I do not know what happened.  So on the spot, there were journalists of Radio France, I believe, who came there.  They gave an interview or they conducted an interview and that was against the rebels.  

So, from the 1st of May, Mr. Munyeshyaka became a target to be killed -- a target to be killed by the rebels.  So I have specified the dates when this defamatory campaign against him started.  This was trivial to him; he had problems with both belligerents, and I think he needs justice, this gentleman.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  That was the end of your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much indeed.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Can I be authorised to greet Mr. Renzaho? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, when the hearings are over today, then I'm sure that can be looked into by the witness protection unit.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the pseudonym of the next witness? 
MR. CANTIER:
It's PPV, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
While that witness is being brought in, should we deal with a couple of administrative issues?  

You may know that this Chamber will hear a very little portion of a new trial, which we will be starting before this summer vacation.  I'm referring to the Nsengimana trial which starts on the 21st of June.  The purpose of this is only to hear a very few witnesses, approximately five.  And the reason why we are doing this is that if we do not start this trial now, it will be difficult to ensure progress of that trial after the recess when this trial will be more or less completed.  

But the Bench is very anxious to ensure that that interruption caused by the Nsengimana trial will not cause any disruption in the flow of witnesses in the present trial, and we look to the parties in order to see how we can in a very smooth way find a way, for instance, when there is a need for a little break in-between witnesses, allow a few days for that trial, while we are ensuring the witnesses in this trial to arrive.  

So I'm just mentioning this, and we will consult with the two parties as to how to do this in the most efficient way.  I am mentioning this now already three weeks before the situation arises so that you can plan, and the Bench is at your disposal so as to facilitate the situation.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm conscious of the fact that there is a witness in here.  But I'm also conscious of the fact that in the last ten days we have had communicated, I think, two personal information sheets of the remaining 14 -- last 13 or 14 witnesses.  We do not have any other information about the remaining witnesses, or official information as to who, if there are going to be some that are to be dropped, or whether they are still to -- all to be called.  

I raise it now, Your Honour, because we do have the pending motion.  

Now, I must put on the record, Your Honour, that it's now at least six weeks after the date in which the information was meant to be provided to us.  I am gravely concerned, especially if the Accused is to testify, which from my understanding if he was to, it would take perhaps a week or so.  It reduces the amount of time from today's date until that last week to a point where I am not able to assure the 

Trial Chamber that we could conduct investigations.  There are, I believe, four cases in Defence mode with limited resources in Kigali and elsewhere to carry out proper investigations.  We still don't have the information -- and apart from those for whom we have received it, I must say the motion which I had hoped may be moot, I'm afraid is not moot, and I wanted to draw that to the Trial Chamber's attention.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will revert to you very shortly.  We will just sort out some administrative issues before your testimony starts.  Please bear with us for a moment.  

Maître Cantier, do you have any comments to what we just heard the Prosecution say?  

You are saying, Mr. Moses, that you still lack sufficient basis to investigate 12 witnesses, is that so? 
MR. MOSES:
I believe it's 11.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you indicated exactly to the Defence which 11 these are?  The Defence knows that? 
MR. MOSES:
We indicated that last time we met, I believe, Your Honour.  It's from Witness HIN, who is the one who is subject to the motion for an amended amendment of the protected measures, down to number 36, HEC.  

Of those witnesses, we have now received personal information sheets for number 26, Witness BIT; and Witness 29, NAH.  

We don't have any further details or official confirmation as to whether, which of those other witnesses have been contacted, which of them are refusing or not prepared to testify, which are going to testify.  So we have to proceed on the basis that they are all wanted by the Defence to testify, and yet here we are on the 4th of June and we still don't have the details.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the question, Maître Cantier, from number 24 to number 36 only the situation in relation to number 26 and 29 is clarified.  Do you any comment?  

And what is particularly interesting is not whether you are doing your very best, which I'm sure you are doing, but when there will be a result? 
MR. CANTIER:
Well, I do understand, Mr. President, that we need to get results, and I understand what the Bench is saying.  

Let me say that we used last week to make progress, and I can say that Wednesday at the latest we should be able to know exactly which witnesses will be able to appear or able to come.  

As we have received the personal identification information sheets, we have passed them on to the Prosecution.  

Now, Mr. President, for the weeks ahead of us, and in relation to what you just said, it was my understanding that we will not be sitting next week.  Is that the case? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that is not the case.  We will be sitting not only this week, but also the next week and the week starting on the 18th.  And in that week, we will sit on the 18th, 19th and 20th.  It's only from the 21st that the Nsengimana trial may interrupt us.  
MR. MOSES:
If I can assist my friend?  I'm sure that we were advised -- and I'm sure my friend is saying that because I believe the parties were advised that there was a difficulty with Trial Chambers next week, and that there were going to be -- that we were not sitting next week.  I believe that was -- the parties had been advised of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This Trial Chamber is available.  This Trial Chamber is ready to hear this trial in this courtroom.  
MR. MOSES:
Good.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But in view of what you are now telling us, I will double check.  
MR. MOSES:
Yeah, I -- I just wanted to say that, because I think that's the reason why my learned friend is saying that to Your Honours, because I think there was an understanding from the parties that we had been advised of that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the source of this information? 
MR. MOSES:
I'll -- I'll have to go and check emails, et cetera, Your Honour, but I understood there were going to be three blocks, as it were, anyway.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so this will be looked into and clarified by tomorrow.  

But you had more to say, Maître Cantier, and we are listening with great interest.
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, that was my first concern, because we organised the arrival of witnesses or the flow of witnesses based on that information that came from your cabinet, Mr. President.  

So we had anticipated an interruption for next week and thought that we would resume on the 
18th or the 21st of June, as we had been informed.  But, last week, we were told that we will resume effectively on the 18th of June, that is, the 18th, 19th and 20th of June.  And then there would be a pause from the 21st of June -- the 21st and 22nd of June and the week following.  It is on the basis of that programming that was given to us that we organised the arrival of witnesses.  

Mr. President, if that information were to be incorrect, then we would need to reschedule and work again with the WVSS to address things differently.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is probably some lack of information.  By tomorrow morning, we will clarify the situation, rest assured.  

Maybe we do not possess all the necessary information here now.  Maybe what you have heard is correct.  Let me double check, but tomorrow we will know.  

That was the first point.  Is there any other point in view of what we've heard from the other side? 
MR. CANTIER:
Not really, Mr. President, except to restate that by Wednesday we should be able to provide a conclusive position with the Prosecutor, and we have maintained contact with them regularly in respect of the witnesses who will ultimately appear in this Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And could the situation be that, in fact, the number of witnesses may be less than from 24 to 26? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, absolutely, Mr. President.  Mr. President, yes, less than the maximum number because we went to see those witnesses and asked them whether they would come to testify.  And in our planning and in view of the information that we received, we thought that it would be possible to hear our witnesses before the 13th of July, except for the expert witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  There will be less than 13, and there is reason to believe that we can finish the exact number before the 13th of July.  

We will then come back to this on Wednesday, and we thank you for your explanations.  

The next witness is Witness PPV.  

Good afternoon, again, Mr. Witness.  You are a protected witness and have to tell the truth.  
The registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness PPV in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there with your signature, Mr. Witness, isn't that so? 
THE WITNESS:
That is very correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, very correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 56. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No D. 56 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, I'd like to request that we go into closed session for the testimony of this witness, in view of the attendant danger that may arise from the disclosures in his testimony, and the fact that he might be easily recognised and, therefore, exposed to danger.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If there is no objection, we note the particular situation of this witness and his title, so we will then move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 76 to 79] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
