P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your examination-in-chief continues.  

Prosecution. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, just before we continue with the cross-examine -- the cross-examination, I wonder if I could just raise a -- housekeeping matters.  

Last night Your Honour referred to the bringing of witnesses to court and trying to anticipate having some extra witnesses.  This brought to mind a possible conflict between what we're anticipating and the Court -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are aware of that, and you know that in about three hours we will know that schedule.  The moment we know the schedule, we will inform you.  It's a matter of hours now.  We are struggling.  
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm grateful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
WITNESS ALG,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell the Court, please, what the situation in Rwanda was in early October 1990? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  In early October 1990, the very first days of that month, there was a communiqué from the Rwandan government forces, making it known that Rwanda had been attacked by the enemy, and, according to that communiqué, the enemy had come from Uganda.  

The communiqué further explained that fighting had started in Mutura and that the Rwandan government forces were tackling the enemy.  That was the situation as described in the first communiqué.  

It was mainly the Rwandan army high command which was relaying communiqués via Radio Rwanda, and in those communiqués, the high command and the government was -- were calling on Rwandans to be vigilant and to support their army so that the army could keep on fighting.  That same government explained that the enemy which had attacked the country was mainly a group of Tutsi who wanted to restore monarchy and who had refused the republican regime.  So the enemy wanted to restore that regime which had oppressed the Hutu before 1959.  

So army officers and préfet were saying such things during meetings, which they organised for members of the public.  I remember that in Kigali city where I was living Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho organised a meeting, which I attended, a few days after his appointment as préfet.  That meeting took place at Kimihurura. 

Do you want me to spell that name?  Kimihurura is spelled K-I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 

So it was in Kimihurura secteur.  The préfet echoed the words I just repeated to you.  He said the enemy which had attacked the country had come from Uganda, and that enemy was mainly Tutsi who were nostalgic of the period of monarchy which had oppressed the Hutu before 1959 and that -- that the enemy wanted to abolish the republican system.  

So after he was appointed préfet, he organised a community work system called Umuganda, during which period he said it was necessary to clear away all bushes so as to eliminate the Inyenzi, who were also known as the Inkotanyi.  He said most of those Inkotanyi had infiltrated the country; that is why it was necessary to clear all bushes and shrubbery.  

But there is some important element which I did not mention, if you allow me to backtrack a little bit.  In the night of the 4th to the 5th of October of the year 1990, Rwandan armed forces fired shots throughout Kigali city, throughout the night.  It was just a stage-managed issue, and during that period they even used heavy weaponry in their propaganda.  They said the Inkotanyi had entered the town.  

So it was after that event that the community work system, dubbed "Umuganda," was organised to chase out all Inkotanyi.  All woods and shrubbery were cleared.  Then meetings were organised for members of the population.  One of which meetings was the one I just mentioned, the one organised at Kimihurura by Colonel Renzaho, and other actions were taken to chase the Inkotanyi.  
I remember that around the 10th I went to the Nyamirambo regional stadium, where those considered as accomplices and who had been arrested had been rounded up at that place.  There were between eight and ten thousand people who had been rounded up and placed in detention under rather unacceptable conditions because they were not even allowed visitors.  They were famished.  They were thirsty.  They were living in unsanitary conditions.  The situation was so deplorable.

But, subsequently, a commission was set up to carry out some form of sorting.  The commission had to study the situation of those people being rounded up at the stadium, and the others who were still being arrested, so as to pick out those who were the real accomplices of the Inyenzi and make a difference between them and those who were not accomplices of the Inyenzi.  

At the end of the deliberations of the commission, only members of the population who were not influential were released.  But others, such as traders, civil servants, private businessmen, or employees of NGOs and international organisations, were moved to prisons, especially the Kigali men (sic) prison, the Nyabisindu prison in Butare préfecture, and the Gitarama prison, as well as two other prisons.  

During that period in Kigali city -- --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we realise that you may wish to place matters in context and provide background, but this is quite long, and I'm not sure that you are getting exactly what you want.  Wouldn't it be better if you asked precise questions in order to get from the witness, in a brief form, what you need for the case?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I'm happy to do that.  I just have a slight reluctance to interrupt when -- when I can see that he's still talking, and I don't want the microphones to overlap.  But I shall certainly try to do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me generally say that each counsel in the courtroom, when he or she is conducting an examination of a witness, if counsel thinks that the witness is not responding to the question or we are wasting time, Counsel is certainly authorised to interrupt the witness.  It is even encouraged. 
MS. MELLUISH:
I'm grateful for that indication, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us, briefly, please, Mr. Witness, who organised the rounding up of -- of Tutsi that you described. 
A.	It was conducted mainly by soldiers and gendarmes.  They were the ones carrying out the arrest, but it was obvious that the drive had been organised by the government.  The authorities were aware of that.  Let me give you an evidence:  In the sorting commission, all security organs were represented. 
Q.	Do you know whether those rounded up were charged with any crime? 
A.	Those rounded up were charged with being either Inyenzi, Inkotanyi, or accomplices of the Inyenzi, Inkotanyi. 
Q.	And do you know how long any of them were held? 
A.	Some of them were released after a brief detention, but others stayed long in detention.  From November they started releasing them in small waves, up until the month of June 1991.  That operation continued because it was around that date that the last were released.  In the meantime, some of them died in detention.  
Q.	Do you know why people were released? 
A.	As the war was on, there were some talks going on between the government in place at the time and the RPF Inkotanyi, but there was also the pressure put to bear by human rights bodies who were criticising the Rwandan government for not respecting human rights.  Following such pressure, those who were arrested were being released in a gradual way. 

In the meantime, some of the people arrested were tried and sentenced to death, whereas others were released.  That happened in 1991. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to the property of those who were rounded up? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you.  During that period, the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture set up a committee charged with seizing and selling the property of people who had fled.  And most of those who had fled were rather Tutsi, whereas some of them were Hutu who were opponents of the regime. 
Q.	And how did you know about this committee? 
A.	********************************************************************** regarding those things.  I hailed from Kigali city, and I lived in the same city.  Subsequently, I was also able to get information from those who were members of that committee.  
Q.	Can you tell us who were the members of the committee, briefly? 
A.	The members of the committee charged with seizing and selling the property of those who had fled were the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune.  At the time he was the chairman.  He was called Jean-Pierre Bakomera.  The other members of the committee were the conseiller of Nyarugenge secteur, Mr. Gabriel Mbyareyehe.  

I also remember that there was a representative of the ministry of trade, a ministry of the urban police, a representative -- correction, of the urban police, a representative of the prosecution office, a representative of the economic affairs service of Kigali-ville préfecture.  

Those are the members of that committee that I remember today.  
Q.	Why was it decided, if you know -- 

JUDGE EGOROV:
Just a moment, excuse me.  

Mr. Witness, if you -- the word "property" was used.  What do you mean saying "property"?  Does this include the land belonged (sic) to those who fled the country?  
THE WITNESS:
Actually, when I talk about property, since we were referring to an urban setting, it was mainly buildings, commercial buildings, as well as the property in those buildings.  That is what I mean when I refer to by "property."  I am not too sure whether landed property was sold at that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now some of the names.  The first name was Jean-Pierre -- could you spell his last name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Bakomera, spelled as follows:  B-A-K-O-M-E-R-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And yesterday we were told that the conseiller for Nyarugenge was Gabriel M-B-Y-A-R-I-Y-B-H-E (sic).  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness said something.  Could we have the interpretation, please?  

Could you repeat your comment or answer after my spelling, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, what I said was that it was correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So these were the two names. 

Now, Counsel, how much do you actually need of this 1990 stuff?  It's way out of the time span of the Tribunal.  You may way have -- you may well have some legal arguments concerning certain notions, but this is general.  It is not really focussed on the Accused.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I've actually come to the end of this material and was going to move on in any event.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  But please bear this in mind so that we only focus on what is strictly necessary.  

Thank you.  What is your next question, please?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Can you tell us, if you know, when the Interahamwe was set up? 
A.	If I remember properly, the Interahamwe was set up towards late 1991 or early 1992. 
Q.	And do you know what the purpose of the setting up of the Interahamwe was? 
A.	The Interahamwe movement was set up by the MRND party.  It was that party's youth wing -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	-- which had to take on those who did not share the party ideals. 
Q.	Do you know whether before April 1994 Renzaho had any involvement with the Interahamwe? 
A.	There is a comment I would like to make in this connection:  The proof of his collaboration with the Interahamwe is the military training that those Interahamwe underwent.  

Counsel, do you want me to elaborate on this point?  
Q.	Yes, please.  What training are you referring to? 
A.	In early 1993, Interahamwe received military training in military camps, and it was Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, who at the time was a préfet, who informed us. 
Q.	How did he inform you? 
A.	He summoned some commune and secteur leaders to his office, but it was not an ordinary meeting.  He received them in various groups, and on that occasion those convened were members of the MRND.  So he gave us that information, telling us that the army high command, in consultation with the chair, or the leadership, of the MRND, had decided that the Interahamwe would receive military training so as to be able to assist the -- the army in fighting the enemy, namely, the Inyenzi, Inkotanyi, if war were to resume.  And he said the Interahamwe would participate in operations towards securing Kigali city.  

On that occasion he told us it was confidential information which was not to be divulged to members of the public so that the political parties which were MRND opponents should not know of it and thus undermine the implementation of the programme.  He did not give us the specifics of the programme.  He simply wanted to inform us so that, if we ever were to see Interahamwes leaving for a certain period of time, we should not be surprised, we would know exactly what was happening.  

That is how we got that information.  That was one of the clues, but there could be others.  All this shows that Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho was collaborating with the MRND leadership, the military command, and the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Can you remember the date that you were informed by Renzaho in this way? 
A.	Counsel, that happened a long time ago, so it is not easy to give you a specific date, or month, for that matter.  But approximately I would say it was during the first three months of 1993, somewhere between late February and early March 1993.  
Q.	And were you told where this training was taking place? 
A.	He did not mention the camps where the trainings were to take place.  It was only subsequently that we got the information from other sources.  He simply told us that the trainings would take place in army camps, without mentioning any particular camp.  

But subsequently, in our individual capacities, we were able to get some information regarding the camps where those Interahamwe were being trained.  Now, if you so wish, I can give you some of the names which I got.  
Q.	Briefly, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, again, when you do that, one name after the other.  Counsel will find out whether we have it on the spelling list.  If not, we will ask for your assistance, please.  

Let's start.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

The best-known camp where the trainings took place was the Gabiro military camp.  At the time Gabiro was in the Mutura region, in Byumba préfecture.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not need the spelling of any of those names.  What is the next?  
THE WITNESS:
The second camp was Gako in the Bugesera sub-préfecture in Kigali rural préfecture. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's G-A-K-O.  Thank you.  Yes.  
THE WITNESS:
The other camp was Bigogwe in Gisenyi préfecture. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine.  Next, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Those are the only camps I was aware of.  But it was also said that the Interahamwe were being trained even in other military camps, but the Interahamwe who were from Kigali followed those trainings in Gabiro, Gako, and Bigogwe camps.  That is the information I was able to gather.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Were you aware of how many people were being trained? 
A.	No, I did not know how many of them were being trained.  There were many of them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
These three camps, Mr. Witness, belonged to which forces, if any?  Gabiro, was that a military camp, a gendarmerie camp, or what kind of camp?  Just give us an indication, briefly.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  All those camps were army camps.  They were not gendarmerie camps.  They were all Rwandan army camps. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you know, Mr. Witness, whether it was at that time legal for party -- political parties to train militia? 
A.	Actually, the law did not allow that.  I have read the law on political parties, and if my memory is not failing me, section 4 of that law forbids political parties from having militia or any other association -- any other affiliated association which would be operating like militia.  It is, therefore, obvious that the training of those militia was not authorised by law.  

Furthermore, I believe I told you those training sessions were covert.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, yesterday you told us that, with the advent of the multiparty system, Renzaho ceased to be the MRND chairman for the préfecture.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct, ma'am. 
Q.	Now, after he ceased to be that chairman, was he involved, as far as you were aware, with the MRND in an active way? 
A.	Even though as a soldier, he was not supposed to be a member of any political party, the fact remains that he kept on collaborating with MRND leaders.  An illustration of this is the trainings which I just mentioned.  Besides, certain sources mentioned that amongst the people who had prepared those trainings were officers and MRND leaders, and his name was in that group of people who had prepared the trainings.  
Q.	Are you aware of whether Renzaho attended any MRND rallies? 
A.	Personally, I did not see him, but I remember a meeting of the party -- a meeting of parties in which the MRND was represented and that which he attended.  It was a meeting of the various power factions of the political parties.  It was a rally which had been organised after the march of those parties.  It took place on the 23rd of September (sic) 1993 at the Nyamirambo regional stadium.  Colonel Renzaho was in attendance. 
Q.	You mentioned the various power factions of the political parties.  Can you briefly tell us what you mean by that?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I refer to the term "power," I am actually alluding to the rally which I just mentioned, where the factions of the political parties which advocated that power should remain in the hands of the Hutu.  At the time those factions were referred to as Hutu Power. 
Q.	You said that Renzaho attended that meeting.  Was he simply present, or did he participate actively? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that rally was organised after a march, which march aimed at demonstrating against the death of the Burundian president at the time.  And if I remember properly, the Burundian president died on the 21st of October.  So those people who carried out that march did so in collaboration with Burundian nationals.  And I remember that Colonel Renzaho spoke during that march.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, have you now referred to one meeting or two meetings?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have referred to a meeting, or rally, organised on the 23rd of October 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So with other words, it was on the 23rd of October.  It was not on the 23rd of September.  Isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, the rally took place on the 23rd of October 19 -- 1993. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And did you participate during the rally when the power-faction parties were present?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I attended that rally.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, previously in the transcripts, we have the statement of you saying that "Personally, I did not see him, but I remember a meeting of the party."  Can you explain what you meant by this?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like to explain further.  This is what I said:  I said that I did not see him in the MRND offices.  Furthermore, I did not see him during ordinary meetings of MRND organs, but I saw him during that rally.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, at this meeting, rally, of the 23rd of October, you said that Renzaho spoke.  Can you recall what he spoke about? 
A.	It is not easy to remember exactly what was said on account of the length of time that has passed.  But if I were to try to give you an account of what was said and under what circumstances and the tone of his address, I would say as follows:  It was said that the Burundian president had been murdered by Burundian soldiers because he was the first Hutu-elected president of Burundi.  That is the reason why he had been killed, because he was a Hutu.  

And all those who spoke during that rally tried to echo the same thing.  Each of the speakers said that they supported the Burundian president, that they were against those who wanted to restore monarchy in our country.  And it was explained that the monarchy was a Tutsi regime.  It was, therefore, obvious that Renzaho was in league with those political parties who were against the return of monarchy in the country.  
Q.	Now, between October 1990, when he became préfet, and April 1994, are you aware of whether Renzaho was promoted? 
A.	I have told you already that, when Renzaho was appointed préfet, he was a lieutenant colonel by rank.  In 1994 he was already a full colonel.  
Q.	Do you know when that promotion took place? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, that would be asking me too much.  I do not remember exactly when he was promoted, but all I know is that he rose to the rank of colonel. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the préfecture office, you described its location yesterday.  Between -- before April 1994, can you tell us who was based at that office?  And I don't mean individual names; I'm talking generally, please.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, would you please kindly repeat that question so that I may understand it properly. 
Q.	You told us that the head of the préfecture was the préfet.  Who else, if anyone, operated from the préfecture office? 
A.	Thank you.  From my understanding of your question, I would answer as follows, that the préfet and his collaborators administered the préfecture from that location.  These included various service heads, who worked with the prefect.  They were referred to as heads of services in Kigali préfecture, but in other préfectures they were referred to as sub-prefects.  Those were the prefect's collaborators. 
Q.	How many heads of service were there? 
A.	Let me mention the services one after the other, just to make sure that I am not mistaken.  There was the political, administrative, and legal affairs service, which was headed by Jean Baptiste Mutura.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have the spelling of this name?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I believe it's number 28 on the list, but perhaps the witness could clarify it begins with a B -- whether it begins with a "B" or an "M." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, "Butera" or "Mutura"? 
THE WITNESS:
Butera, Butera with a B-U, Butera, Jean-Baptiste, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That was the first one.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The other service was the economic and financial affairs service, which was headed by one Fabien Bunane. 
MS. MELLUISH:
It's number 26 on the list.  
THE WITNESS:
Then there was another service, the social, cultural, and educational affairs service, headed by one Simpunga, Aloys. 
MS. MELLUISH:
It's a hundred and ninety-eight.  
THE WITNESS:
If I'm not mistaken, there was a service in charge of infrastructure, equipment, and urban development.  It was headed -- headed by one Munyakazi, Faustin.  Yes, I think it was Munyakazi, Faustin, indeed, who was head of that service. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have that name.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Those are the services that worked closely with the préfet.  There was also an immigration service, headed by one Rubwejanga, Tharcisse. 
MS. MELLUISH:
It's a hundred and sixty-two. 
THE WITNESS:
Then there was also a préfectoral intelligence service, headed by Mr. Bigega, whose first name I forget. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Number 10. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam Prosecutor, those are the services which worked closely with the préfet from the location, namely, the préfectoral office.  

Let me say that any of these service heads could have signed on behalf of the préfet in his absence.  It would appear to me that the rules allowed for one or the other of these heads of services to sign on behalf of the préfet in case of his absence.  But most often it is Jean-Baptiste Butera, who was the head of the political, administrative, and legal affairs service, who would sign on behalf of the préfet.  

I'm sorry, Madam Prosecutor.  I have just remembered that there was another very important service which escaped my mind and which I didn't mention.  There was a service in charge of the urban police, and it was headed by gendarme Major Nyamuhimba. 
MS. MELLUISH:
A hundred and forty-seven. 

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So can you tell us, these heads of service that you've mentioned, who could sign on behalf of the préfet, were they superior to or of the same rank, as it were, as the bourgmestre? 
A.	As far as the organisation chart goes, I cannot say that they were more important, or at least equal to, the bourgmestre because the text of the law does not allow for that kind of comparison.  All I know is that the bourgmestres and other officials would go to the préfectoral office and, upon arrival, would address their concerns to the various service heads.  And then it would be the person in charge of political, administrative, and legal affairs who appeared to be the senior head of service and to be in charge of all the other heads of services. 
Q.	In March 1994, how many communes were there in the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	There were three communes in Kigali-ville préfecture.  
Q.	And can you tell us in March 1994 who were the bourgmestre of those communes? 
A.	In 1994 the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune was Jean Bizimana.  The bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune was Pierre Claver Nyilikwaya. 
MS. MELLUISH:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you -- can you repeat that?  The mike was not -- your mike was on, but also another mike was on. 
MS. MELLUISH:
One hundred fifty, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
The bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune in the month of April, that is, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), was called Evariste Gasamagera. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Number 41. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	How many secteur were there in the whole of the préfecture? 
A.	Relying on my memory, I would say there were 19 secteurs in Kigali-ville préfecture, and I can remember that Nyarugenge commune had ten secteurs, including four -- rather, five secteurs for Kacyiru, and then Kicukiro had four secteurs as well.  So I think that is it:  Ten for Nyarugenge, Cyangugu five, and Kicukiro four.  That adds up to 19.  
Q.	Yesterday you mentioned the names of some conseillers.  One of those was Odette Nyirabagenzi, who was, you said, conseiller for Rugenge in March 1994.  Can you tell us, if you are aware, whether she, besides the position of conseiller, had any other function or position? 
A.	I think that she did not hold any other position, other than being a conseiller.  But she was also a member -- or, a leader of the party within Nyarugenge commune and at the level of the préfecture.  

Please, allow me to explain this to you better.  She was not holding a very high office, but she was a member of the various governing bodies of the party within the commune and within the préfectoral -- within the préfecture.  I will even be more specific:  She was a close collaborator of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	What do you mean by that, by the term "close collaborator"?
A.	This is what I mean:  The MRND party had what could be referred to as ordinary members, but there were some members who were more active, more militant, and who visibly, or openly, supported the Interahamwe.  So in addition to their ordinary membership in the MRND, they demonstrated their inclination towards the Interahamwe.  

You may want to know that all members of the MRND were not Interahamwe, but she spoke out openly and said that she was Interahamwe.  
Q.	You also mentioned yesterday a conseiller called Rose Karushara.  Can you tell us, was she a member of a political party? 
A.	She was also a member of the MRND party.  
Q.	Did she have any other functional position besides being a conseiller and a member of that party? 
A.	She did not hold any other position, as such, but she was an influential member of her political party.  She was in the leadership of the party at the national, préfectoral, and communal levels, and she was very zealous and openly demonstrated her belonging to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Now, in March 1994, what was the relationship -- aside from the employment relationship, what was the relationship between those two conseiller and Renzaho? 
A.	Besides the professional relations that may have existed, most of the conseiller had good relations with Renzaho, but not all of them.  This is only my observation.  What I noticed is that the bourgmestre who replaced Bakomera and the conseiller who had previously held that position had worked for a long time with Renzaho, and they knew themselves very well.  So, obviously, he was a member of the MRND, and one could see that Renzaho fully supported that political party.  

Conseillers would go to consult with him in his office, breaking all protocol rules.  So these people would see him without any difficulty, and sometimes reports were channeled directly to him without going through the bourgmestre of the concerned areas.  
Q.	You said that most conseiller had a good relationship with Renzaho.  Who, if anyone, did not have a good relationship with him in March 1994? 
A.	For Nyarugenge commune, the conseiller of Nyakabanda secteur did not have good relations with him, and his name was Emmanuel Kanyandekwe. 
Q.	And do you know why they did not have good relations? 
A.	Kanyandekwe himself told me in the course of a discussion that he did not have very good relations with the préfet because he was a member of the MDR Twagiramungu faction.  So the conseiller told me that that was the bone of contention in his relation with Préfet Renzaho.
Q.	Can you tell us briefly, please, what were the primary functions of the conseiller? 
A.	In a few words, the duties of the conseiller were to cover activities in the secteurs under his -- under his jurisdiction.  Security, social affairs, and development of the various secteurs were his areas of endeavour. 
Q.	Did a conseiller have an office? 
A.	Yes, the conseiller had an office. 
Q.	What powers did a conseiller have? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Madam Prosecutor. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	What powers did a conseiller have? 
A.	The conseiller had significant powers in his or her secteur, and that could be observed de facto.  But the conseiller's powers were diminished with the advent of multiparty politics.  Conseillers who belonged to any given political party and who had inhabitants in their secteurs belonging to other political parties saw their authority challenged because the inhabitants would not respect the conseillers.  

The conseiller of Nyakabanda, for example, whom I referred to a short while ago, even if by the text of the law he enjoyed some powers, in practice, his power was diminished because he didn't enjoy the support of the préfet.  
Q.	You began by answering that the conseiller had significant powers.  Please, can you explain what those powers were? 
A.	That is what the law granted him.  If we take, for instance, the single-party period, he had sweeping freedoms.  He was a -- the head of the communal council.  At the same time, he was also the party chairman at secteur level.  And, of course, that gave him wide powers.  So at the time of the single party, that is, in 1991 before the establishment of multiparty democracy -- 

Do you want me to move on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
THE WITNESS:
So as I said yesterday -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not sure whether we want you to move on.  

Isn't there other material about this in the case?  Is this disputed, the powers of the conseillers?  It's well-established information in the Tribunal.  We have heard many, many cases about bourgmestres and conseillers.  How much do we need to enter into the bulk of evidence in the present case? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Perhaps it would be helpful if the Defence could advise whether it is a matter of contest.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you help us with that, Defence?  I would assume that the functions of bourgmestres, conseillers, at least, would be undisputed.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honour, believe you me, I am as surprised and perplexed as the Bench because this is information which is known by everybody in this court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So didn't this come as a relief?  Let's try to -- 
MS. MELLUISH:
Very much so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- focus maybe on what you wanted to get from this witness, namely, what is his -- in the summary of Prosecution witnesses in the pre-trial brief.  And -- and we would really prefer to hear individual events instead of general information from this witness.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you know how many urban police there were? 
A.	I didn't know how many of them there were, Counsel, but, in any case, there were many of them.  
Q.	Where were they based, the policemen themselves? 
A.	They had an office at the Kigali-ville préfecture office.  
Q.	Can you tell us, if you know, what was the relationship between the préfecture office and the gendarmerie? 
A.	I cannot claim to be very knowledgeable about the relationship between gendarmerie and a préfecture, but what one could see is that in each préfecture was a gendarmerie squad.  And the préfet, who was the chief security official within the préfecture under his jurisdiction, worked closely with that squad.  He could request the assistance or intervention of the squad in specific cases.  Even the commanding officer of this squad was one of the members of the security committee at préfecture, or city, level.  
Q.	Can you tell us what the main services of the préfecture office were? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a question which is different from the services which were headed by the seven persons he already have listed, hence we have identified -- 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- seven services? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, Your Honour.  It is different. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So it is different.  Now, in what way is it different? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, perhaps if the witness could start his answer, and if he's repeating what he's already said, then I'll stop him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you understood the question, Mr. Witness.  Let's make an attempt.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, that question is not quite clear because I thought I had already given the names of the various services at the préfecture office.  Rather, I think that perhaps Prosecution counsel would like to know what the organs of Kigali-ville préfecture were.  Am I right?  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	I thank you, ma'am.  

Kigali-ville préfecture had three main organs:  the city council, then the préfet, and the préfecture security council.  Those are the three organs of Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	How often did the -- prior to April 1994, how often did the security council meet? 
A.	The city security committee met once a month usually.  It could also meet whenever necessary.  
Q.	And, briefly, who were the members before April 1994 of the security council?  
MS. MELLUISH:
If -- if the Defence wishes to make admissions in this regard, I'm happy not to lead this evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, one way of doing this could be that there was contact between the Prosecution and the Defence concerning structural, general organisation, persons holding posts, et cetera.  And based on that, the parties could together create a paper or a note, and it could be entered as an exhibit and we could avoid all this evidence.  

Now, now we have gone through most of it, it seems to me, but could you now briefly tell the Defence what you think the witness is going to say, and we will then see whether they agree?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, Your Honour, it's actually in one of the Prosecution exhibits.  The -- at tab 7.  If they're happy to accept -- page 912 at the top.  If they're happy to accept that those are the people who attended -- it's P. 14.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the title of tab 7?  You remember that there was a change afterwards.  You see, it's the 1990 document.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes, legislative act number 35 slash 90 concerning the administrative organisation of the préfecture of Kigali-ville. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So it's article 17, yes? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yup. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  There cannot possibly be any dispute about what's in article 17.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, during the presentation of exhibits by the Prosecutor, I believe we clearly stated that we did not challenge the admission of legal instruments because we also intended to use them.  So, essentially, don't expect any objections from this side with regard to those legal instruments.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So that was the second relief.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us where you were on the morning of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	I was at home, Counsel.  
Q.	And did you go to work that day? 
A.	I mean, where my house was located.  

No, I did not go to work.  
Q.	Why did you not go to work? 
A.	Early on the morning of the 7th of April, a communiqué from the defence ministry was broadcast by the radio station, forbidding citizens from leaving their houses.  Even civil servants were not authorised to go to work.  According to the communiqué, the head of state's plane had been shot down by unknown persons and that the head of state, along with the other passengers, had died in that attack.  

So I also felt concerned by the communiqué.  I decided to stay home. 
Q.	How long did you stay at home as a result of that communiqué? 
A.	I stayed at home for about one week.  
Q.	Did you leave your home at all during that period? 
A.	During that period I did not move about except perhaps on one occasion.  That was around the fifth day.  We had run out of foodstuff and supplies, so I had gone out to get supplies.  I was accompanied by a policeman.  I asked him to go to a shop located near my house to find out whether the shop was open.  But he noticed that the shop had been shut down, and the shopkeeper had already left.  So we continued our way, and about one kilometre away from my home, we saw some people whose shops were open, but we were not able to get supplies.  

So we returned home empty-handed.  It was on the following day that I left my neighbourhood to go to the city centre.

	1015H
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't really need the story about the trip to the shop in vain and back again, did you, Counsel?  
MS. MELLUISH:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Counsel is asking precise questions.  Most of them, now, can be answered by a yes or no.  We appreciate your wish to provide a full picture, but we would like to try to make some headway now.  So, try to be as brief as possible.  Will you do that, please?  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	During the time that you remained at home, did you hear any news of what was happening in the city? 
A.	No.  All what I heard was gunshots from all directions. 
Q.	Did you return to work at any time? 
A.	Yes, at some point in time I went to my place of work. 
Q.	Can you remember when it was that you did that? 
A.	It is difficult to give a specific date but it was about one week afterwards.  I would say perhaps around the 12th of April 1994. 
Q.	And why did you decide to return to work on that day? 
A.	I just had a communiqué from the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture calling on functionaries of the préfecture, as well as the communes of that préfecture, to go to their workplaces.  That is why I decided to go to my workplace. 
Q.	And how did you get to your workplace? 
A.	I had a (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) vehicle.
Q.	And on your way to your workplace, did you notice anything unusual? 
A.	Yes, the situation was different from the other periods.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just listen carefully to this question.  You described the vehicle with which you went to work.  Were there many persons having that kind of vehicle or were you more or less the only one or there were only few?  Do you understand the question?  
THE WITNESS:
In my neighbourhood of residence, I think that that was the only vehicle moving about, but within the city centre there were other vehicles similar to that one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we don't have to place it under separate cover then.

MS. MELLUISH:
Well, I'm not sure the answer -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It did.  Your view is that it is not necessary.  All right, we will not place it under separate cover.  That's fine.  

It referred to something.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You answered that the situation was different from other periods on your journey to your office.  Can you tell us in what way? 
A.	I've already told you that while I was still at home, after the plane crash, ever since that evening, there was constant gunfire.  On the morning of the 7th of April it continued and even intensified during the afternoon.  So, there was gunfire in the various parts of the city, and further let me state that my home was near a military camp where presidential guard soldiers were based.  So, there were roadblocks on the roads, and there were soldiers, gendarmes, and members of the population manning those various roadblocks. 
Q.	And what were they doing at the roadblocks? 
A.	At those roadblocks those people would intercept passers-by, checking their identity cards, wave certain people through, others stayed there for some time, and others who passed through immediately, but there were also people who were killed at those roadblocks. 
Q.	Were these things that you observed during that particular journey? 
A.	I was given a rather general description of what was happening at the roadblocks and when I was going to my place of work I realised that people were being stopped at roadblocks because, personally, I, too, was stopped at those roadblocks.  I was not able to see anybody being killed, however.  I was able to see dead bodies.  So, I thought the bodies were of people who had been killed at those roadblocks. 
Q.	Can you recall what happened when you got to your office? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I wonder whether it might be safer to go into closed session for him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will do that.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 21 to 68] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
