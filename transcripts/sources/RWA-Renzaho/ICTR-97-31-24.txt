 P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  I understand that we are in open session.  

This is the beginning of the Defence case.  Will the Defence make any opening statement, or will we proceed directly to the first witness?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes.  I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I have some difficulty with my headset, so I didn't hear what you said.  I'm replacing it right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have CaseView in front of you so that you could just read what I said?  
MR. CANTIER:
I can hear you very well now, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was whether you intend to make an opening statement or whether we will proceed with the first Defence witness now.  

It's absolutely up to you.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we were not requested by the Trial Chamber to submit a brief, so we didn't request -- we didn't draft any such document.  But, for purposes of clarity and transparency towards the Prosecution, and in order to ensure that the Trial Chamber properly follows what we will be doing with our witnesses, it might be necessary to make a preliminary statement.  

This I have prepared, and I am ready to deliver it to the Trial Chamber, except, as proposed by the Prosecution, it were better to start with a status conference to look at our current status, particularly in view of a motion from the Prosecution to exclude some evidence.  

If it so pleases the Court, I could move directly into my preliminary statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see that the witness is here.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now first discuss how to organise this morning's work.  Just bear with us for a moment, Madam.  
What is the estimated length of your opening statement, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER:
At the very most, half an hour, and I will be speaking slowly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then I think the best way is to ask the witness to leave the courtroom because she will be much more comfortable in the waiting room. 

Madam Witness, we will come back to you in about 45 minutes.
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As for the choice between the opening statement and the status conference, the Bench has received the Prosecution motion, and we understand what is behind that motion.

It is clear that we do need a status conference at some stage, but the most practical way to proceed now would seem to be that we start with the opening statement, and then you can address us after the opening statement, Mr. Moses, as to whether you have any objections to hear the first witness. 

You have the floor, Maître Cantier. 
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have provided a copy of my opening statement to the interpreters and to the court reporters. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Renzaho stands accused of genocide; complicity to -- in genocide; murder as a crime against humanity; rape as a crime against humanity; killings as a violation of Article 3, Common, of the Geneva Convention of 1949; and rape of -- under Article 3, Common, of the same convention.  

Mr. Renzaho has pleaded not guilty to all these accusations.  As I said a short while ago, and with a view to proceed in an atmosphere of clarity prior to various testimonies, we want to present our case and the various evidence that we will be using to support our case.  

Our case is built on two grounds:  First of all, planning of the various crimes that are purportedly committed from the 6th of April 1994 and which are referred to as genocide and crimes against humanity; secondly, the involvement of Mr. Renzaho, or his participation in such crimes, because -- on the basis of his personality, his past, and his behaviour during those events.  

Those are the two pillars on which the Prosecution case is built, and the Defence will challenge the theory of premeditation of the killings, particularly in regard to the killings and genocide of Tutsis from the 6th of April 1994, as well as claims by the Prosecution that -- that Mr. Renzaho belonged to a group of extremists, as well as allegations that he purportedly provided assistance, both in his capacity as préfet and in his individual capacity, assistance which he extended to the Interahamwe prior to the events.

Secondly, Mr. Renzaho denies these accusations which appear under counts 1, 2, 3, and 5, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the statute.  

He, therefore, rejects all the accusations relating to orders that he purportedly gave to the soldiers, gendarmes, militia, and local population, as well as demobilised soldiers and other individuals, to set up and man roadblocks in the -- in the Kigali-ville préfecture, with a view to stopping, identifying, and killing Tutsis.  

Secondly, he denies the accusations, whereby, from the 7th of April 1994, he gave orders over Radio Rwanda to the same category of people to set up and to man roadblocks, with a view to stopping, identifying, and killing Tutsis.  

Third -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we get into the third prong, this is going very well, but could you just slow down slightly?  Not too much, but just slightly.  
MR. CANTIER:
Well, I tend to speed up when I start talking, Mr. President, but I'll slow down.  Thank you.  

I was speaking on the third count, whereby, on the 10th of April, or thereabouts, he purportedly held a meeting at the Kigali-ville préfectoral office, during which he is said to have ordered conseillers and cellule responsable to set up roadblocks and operate them with the assistance of the same category of persons mentioned above, with a view to identifying and killing Tutsis.  

He also rejects the fourth charge, whereby, on several occasions in April and May 1994, he convened meetings, at which he ordered the administrative authorities to be vigilant at roadblocks and to ensure that Inyenzis do not succeed to hide within the population, all of this with the same view of identifying and killing Tutsis.  

On those four charges relating to the roadblocks, Mr. Renzaho will demonstrate the following:  One, that he was not behind the initiative to set up roadblocks, some of which were already in place before the 6th of April 1994 and some of which were set up later on, generally, at the behest of the population.

Mr. Renzaho will also argue that he did not exercise any measure of control over those roadblocks because he did not have the resources to do so, although he had requested on several occasions that these roadblocks be dismantled.  

Still under Article 6(1), Mr. Renzaho also denies the charges relating to killings that were conducted in Kigali-ville préfecture under paragraphs 11 to 23 of the indictment.  And for the roadblocks, the reference would be 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the indictment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask you a question in relation to the third issue you raised that related to the meeting on the 10th of April, the alleged meeting?  Is it, then, the Defence case that there was no such meeting, or is it that nothing reproachable happened during that meeting?  
MR. CANTIER:
We challenge the holding of that meeting of the 10th of April.  

In criminal matters, generally speaking, and particularly in this case, it is often difficult to determine the exact date on which an event may have taken place.  It is for this reason that the Defence would rather challenge the decisions that are being ascribed to us rather than systematically relate to these dates, and all of that with a view to facilitating the pursuit of justice. 

Now, let me, then, return to the killings which have been ascribed or charged to Mr. Renzaho.  

He, therefore, denies charges relating to events that occurred between '93 and '94, in which he regularly authorised and encouraged Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi groups to meet at his home in Kanombe.  He will provide evidence to refute the allegations brought forth by the Prosecutor.  

Secondly, Mr. Renzaho denies having distributed weapons and munitions to members of the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, both in Kanombe and elsewhere.  He will establish that the -- the Kigali-ville préfecture did not have any stock of weapons and that no weapon was distributed at his initiative or under his authority. 

Third, Mr. Renzaho denies the allegation, whereby he purportedly facilitated and provided fuel vouchers and passes, as well as food supplies, to the Interahamwe, various militia, soldiers, and gendarmes to move about and to have equipped accordingly. 

Mr. Renzaho shall establish that such documents were, indeed, being issued by the PVK, that is, the Kigali-ville préfecture, but that such documents were issued to the population at large without any discrimination, including Interahamwe, militia, soldiers, and gendarmes, who, may it be said, did not require any authorisation from him to move about or to obtain equipment.  

Four, Mr. Renzaho dismisses the accusation, whereby he purportedly went to Kajari in 
Kanombe commune on the 9th of April 1994 in the company of some Interahamwe.  He shall challenge the Prosecution witnesses' credibility and state that he no longer went to his house in Kanombe at that location from the 8th of April 1994. 

Five, Mr. Renzaho denies having held a meeting on the 16th of April 1994, or thereabouts, as is purported by the Prosecution, at which he allegedly ordered conseillers to obtain firearms from the ministry of defence for distribution in various secteurs.  

On that issue, Mr. Renzaho shall seek to establish lack of credibility on the part of Prosecution witnesses.  And on that issue of distribution of weapons, he also intends to show various contradictions and thereby establish the irrelevance of such testimonies. 

Six, Mr. Renzaho denies having dismissed Conseiller Célestin Sezibera on the grounds that he purportedly believed that he was hostile to the idea of killing Tutsis.  

Mr. Renzaho shall go on to state and demonstrate that -- I was saying, in relation to the dismissal of Conseiller Célestin Sezibera, that Mr. Renzaho will establish that his withdrawal did not -- cannot be attributed to Mr. Renzaho, or cannot be explained by the fact that he was not enthusiastic about the killings, as has been purported.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you now referred to number 262 on the general spelling list, yes?  

You can just proceed, Counsel.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. Renzaho also denies having been present at a roadblock near Hotel Kiyovu in June 1994, particularly in the company of Colonels Setako and Bagosora.  He shall question the credibility of the lone witness who has testified on his presence at that roadblock, and he shall prove that the two persons mentioned, namely, Colonels Setako and Bagosora, who were supposed to have been with him, could not have been present at that location on that day.  

Mr. Renzaho shall state that he did not issue any order on the 27th -- 22nd of April 1994 for some 
60 young Tutsis to be expelled from the CELA, who, according to the Prosecutor, were abducted and killed by soldiers and Interahamwe.  However, Mr. Renzaho would like to shed light fully on this issue and also establish his own level of responsibility.  And it is for this reason that he acknowledges having been present at that location on that date because of the unrest that was occurring at that location.  

He shall affirm or assert that he contributed to pacifying the situation, after which he went back.  He shall, therefore, challenge those facts and would state that, even though these things may have happened, they cannot be totally ascribed to him.  

Mr. Renzaho also denies the accusation, whereby, on the 14th of June 1994, he is alleged to have ordered that 60 Tutsi boys, who were at the St. Paul site, be expelled and murdered.  He shall show that no credible witness has testified against him in that matter and that the administrative document put forth, or exhibited, by the Interahamwe in order to take those young persons was not signed by him.  

Mr. Renzaho further denies having ordered soldiers, militia, and criminal policemen on the 
17th of June 1994 to attack Tutsi who had sought refuge at the St. Famille church.  He shall demonstrate lack of credibility on the part of witnesses who purportedly stated that he was present, and he shall adduce evidence to the contrary.  

I have just dealt with the charges or items falling under paragraphs 11 to 23 of the indictment.  

Mr. Renzaho further challenges the charges, whereby, on the 28th of April 1994, he purportedly ordered Interahamwe to go to Nyarugenge commune to seek and kill nine Tutsi.  Mr. Renzaho shall underscore the fact that Prosecution witness (sic) do not formally establish his participation or involvement in these crimes.  

Mr. Renzaho also denies involvement in the killing of André Kameya, the journalist.  

André Kameya's name is on your list, Mr. President. 

(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...it's number 105 on the -- of the big list.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, we shall make sure that both lists are available in Court henceforth. 

I was, therefore, saying that Mr. Renzaho will deny any involvement in the murder of André Kameya, the journalist who was killed on the 15th of June 1994.  He shall establish that the circumstances surrounding the death of that journalist have not been clarified and that there is no formal determination that he was the killer or an accomplice in that killing.  

Now, regarding the alleged criminal responsibility of Mr. Renzaho under Article 6(3) of the statute, Mr. Renzaho is accused of not having taken necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the crimes referred to in the indictment because it is alleged that his subordinates committed criminal acts and that he did not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the commission of such crimes or to punish the perpetrators thereof, even though he knew, or had reasons to know, that his subordinates were about to commit, or had committed, such crimes.  

Mr. Renzaho denies these charges on three grounds:  First of all, and contrary to the Prosecution's allegations, Mr. Renzaho's subordinates did not include officials and members of the Rwandan armed forces; troops of the Presidential Guard; Interahamwes, including those who have been named as being his accomplices, that is, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandutiye, and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka; or, referring to the terms used by the Prosecution, his subordinates did not include members of the civil defence, militiamen, or gendarmes.  

The second ground is that the Prosecution does not provide evidence of the participation in the crimes alleged of certain persons, in particular, Father Wenceslas and Mr. Ngerageza.  Neither does the Prosecution provide evidence, clear evidence, that the civil defence forces participated in the commission of the alleged crimes. 

The third ground, Mr. Renzaho submits that he did not have the means to prevent the commission of the alleged acts by the persons named in the indictment; neither did he have the means to punish the said perpetrators.  Mr. Renzaho will prove that the situation which prevailed in Kigali town, from the 6th of April and until the 5th of July 1994, the date when he left the town, that that situation could not at all be brought under controlled (sic), and for various reasons.  

First of all, the war, the war which resumed as from the 6th of April, the evening of the 6th of April, between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF; then, the population was displaced, was moving as a result of the existent war.  

There was also the presence in Kigali of thousands of refugees and displaced persons who had lost everything and sought vengeance.  

The third reason, the presence of RPF infiltrators, who contributed to the situation of disorder.  

The fourth reason -- and this relates more directly to Mr. Renzaho, the fourth reason, the collapse of the state apparatus, as well as his authority with regard to the population, as well as the disruption of the functioning of the administrative apparatus in Kigali-ville préfecture.  

Mr. Renzaho will prove that in such a situation the means available to him were ridiculous because the only forces available to him were the municipal police, who, after the 6th of April 1994, amounted only to a handful of policemen.

Mr. Renzaho will prove that, with the meager resources still available to him, he continued helping the population without discrimination.  He did help them by continuing to organise the supply of food and drinking water in Kigali town; by providing persons in danger -- or, helping persons in danger; by delivering, without discrimination, those who wanted to leave Kigali town laissez-passers; by personally intervening, at the risk of his life, in several situations of grave danger, for example, at CELA on 22 April 1994 or, yet again, during the transfer of the population to Kanogo in the month of May 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which location would you -- did you just refer to?  We didn't get that in our two languages.
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, it's -- that's -- it's -- the place referred to is Kanogo in Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is spelt?  
MR. CANTIER:
K-A-N-O-G-O.
MR PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. CANTIER:
I repeat, K-A-N-O-G-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And while we have this little interruption, you referred to, as one complicating factor, the presence of RPF infiltrators in Kigali.  Is the submission of a general nature or is it more specifically alleged that these RPF infiltrators, in fact, committed some crimes with which the Accused is charged?  
MR. CANTIER:
What we will be arguing is that RPF infiltrators participated in the commission of crimes, particularly at roadblocks, crimes which are ascribed to the Interahamwe, militia groups.  And we are supposed to have authority over those Interahamwe under 6(1).  We have said that we did not prevent them from committing crimes, and that is why we mentioned the presence of these RPF infiltrators who contributed to the killings and the situation of disorder.

I will continue.  

Furthermore, witnesses will come here to testify that Mr. Renzaho tried to put an end to the acts of violence perpetrated by several killers whose identity was revealed to him.  He had them arrested and detained at the jail, or cell, of the Kigali-ville préfecture.  We will also establish that the said persons were subsequently released as a result of the threats that their detention at the Kigali-ville cell brought to bear, on the staff as well as the refugees, and also because the judicial system, as well as the prison system, was no longer operational.  

Contrary to the Prosecution's allegations, Mr. Renzaho has never tried to conceal the circumstances that prevailed in Kigali, particularly by causing the disappearance of corpses of the persons killed.  Mr. Renzaho submits that the situation required that the bodies be picked up and buried for reasons of public hygiene and sanitation and that, if the services of the préfecture participated in picking up the corpses and buried (sic) them, this was done under the supervision of the International Red Cross Society -- or, Committee, as will be testified to by several witnesses.  

Mr. Renzaho denies any responsibility relating to the rapes that are alleged to have been committed in his territory, in the territory under his jurisdiction.  He condemns these heinous acts, which, unfortunately, he never had power to prevent, nor to punish.  Mr. Renzaho challenges the allegations of a lone witness who accused him of having, under 16th of April 1994, incited militiamen to commit such acts.  

Mr. Renzaho will argue that the conspiracy with which he's charged is only a figment of the imagination.  The Prosecution case, or theory, on the existence of such a conspiracy is based, in main -- in the main, on the fact that the Accused had privileged relations with certain persons who were well known, and such persons being Interahamwe, in particular, Odette Nyirabagenzi, Angeline Mukandutiye, and Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka.  

The Defence will submit that the first two persons named above, namely, Odette and Angeline, have never been prosecuted nor tried for having committed the crimes that are ascribed to them today.  

As regards Father Wenceslas, he's being prosecuted in France, where he's seriously challenging the charges brought against him.  And, like every other citizen in a democratic country, he is presumed to be innocent.  

In -- as concerns -- as concerns Father Wenceslas, the Defence will produce evidence and documents which will establish the falsehoods of the charges brought against this priest.  Better still, the Defence will establish that it was on destruction of the present authorities in Kigali that a case file was prepared against him, against this priest.  

Lastly, and this is not to be overlooked, Mr. Renzaho denies having had any special relations with these three persons, who have never been part of his circle and who, therefore, he could not give any instructions to for the purpose of committing crimes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please help me.  Is Angeline and Odette still alive, both of them?  
MR. CANTIER:
We carried out some investigation.  From what we were told -- but this is hearsay -- from what we were told, both of them are dead.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you know when they passed away and where?  
MR. CANTIER:
No.  The date of their passing away is not -- was not given to us, but, from what we were told, they took refuge to -- or, they fled to the Congo, and they were amongst the hundred of thousands of people who disappeared in the Congolese forest.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. CANTIER:
(No interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, that wasn't clear to us, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When I thanked you, there were overlapping microphones.  Can you just repeat your comment or addition just now?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Since we were talking about the disappearance of these two persons, amongst hundreds of -- hundreds of thousands of other people in Congo, from the summer of 1994 -- and I was saying that these crimes were -- were -- could not actually be explained.  

There was -- as the Chamber knows, an investigation was ordered by the United Nations.  The secretary-general and the security council ordered an investigation.  The investigation was entrusted to Mr. Robert Tukatuko (sic), and the investigator determined that the crimes against humanity were committed, but there was no follow-up of this report by the investigator.  The international community did not follow up the report of the investigator.  

That is what I said, Mr. President, but it has no bearing on my opening -- or, preliminary statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But since you now referred to a surname which is not so easy, can you help us with the surname of Mr. Robert?  Can you spell it, please? 
MR. CANTIER:
The secretary-general of the United Nations set up a commission of investigation, which was headed by a Chilean citizen called Roberto -- that is his first name -- and Garreton.  Roberto is R-O-B-E-R-T-O.  Garreton, G-A-R-R-E-T-O-N, Garreton.  Garreton, G-A-R-R-E-T-O-N. 

I believe his report is dated 1998.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Now we have Roberto and Garreton, G-A-R-R-E-T-O-N.  

And then there was this sentence, "(French spoken)."  What did you mean by that?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, the concept of loss and -- profit and loss is an accounting concept, and in accounting, as you know, there are amounts which cannot be considered as loss or profit, or benefit.  So they are just considered as losses and benefits.  That means that they are no longer mentioned and they do not cause any problem.  The problem is shelved -- or, such losses are shelved.  They are no longer taken into consideration. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So now everything is clear. 

Thank you.  Please proceed.  
MR. CANTIER:
I would like to tell the Chamber that, like (unintelligible) with our colleagues of the Prosecution team, we will be offering a defence of alibi, a single defence of alibi, regarding the distribution of weapons on the morning of the 7th of April 1994, which distribution was mentioned by Prosecution witness -- by Prosecution witness AFB. 

We will prove that on that morning Mr. Renzaho was attending a meeting which held -- or, which took place at the military academy, the EMS (sic), École Supérieure Militaire.  

We will have a witness who will testify to this, and, above all, if I may say so, we will have documentary evidence regarding the holding of that meeting and the participants thereof.  Because the said meeting is part of the historic meetings that took place after the 6th of April. 

The Prosecution thought it had established the genocidal intent that motivated Mr. Renzaho by tendering a cassette that recorded the utterances made by Mr. Renzaho and by asking several witnesses whether they recognised Mr. Renzaho's voice in those recordings.  

The Defence denounce, and continues to do so, the use of such evidence, but since the Chamber decided, subject to its analysis and, therefore, its assessment, to still keep the cassette, the tape will have to be listened to by several witnesses who will tell the Court whether or not they recognise Mr. Renzaho's voice. 

Mr. Renzaho will also give evidence himself.  He will give evidence on his career and his commitment to the service of his country.  He will give evidence on how he went through the period preceding the 6th of April 1994.  He will give evidence on his role and activities during the period of the events, and, of course, on -- his evidence will also related (sic) to the crimes with which he is charged on the basis of 6(1) and 6(3) of the statute.  

Mr. Renzaho will prove, with the assistance of Kent Roach, a criminologist of international repute, the grave danger -- 

I spelled Kent.  The person's name, Kent, is K-E-N-T, and Roach is -- Roach, rather -- or, Roach is R-O-C-H (sic), Kent Roach -- no, R-O-A-C-H, Kent Roach.  

So Kent Roach is a criminologist of international repute.  He will appear before this Court to explain the grave danger that the use of informers as witnesses poses to the Court. 

Professor Lugan, a historian, will come to challenge the theory put forward by Mrs. Alison Des Forges, theory regarding, in particular, the planning of the genocide; the setting up and operation of the civil -- civil defence programme; and, in more general terms, he will be dealing with historical facts on the Rwandan tragedy up to date and the involvement of Mr. Renzaho in this tragedy.  

Lastly, Mr. President, Your Honours -- and this will be the end of my presentation -- the Defence will subscribe to and confirm the fears expressed at the beginning of the trial on the 8th of January 2007.  

Shortly after the end of the first session, we went to meet witnesses, witnesses which we had previously contacted.  Mr. Nekuie, my co-counsel, went to Rwanda.  Personally, I did not have the -- the possibility of going to Rwanda.  And there in Rwanda we had the confirmation of the defection of a key witness.  And, in my mind, in my culture, when I say a "key witness," this witness is crucial to the Defence but also to the cause of justice.  He's essential -- essential because of his closeness to the Accused during the period of the events.  

A second witness, who is also an important witness, refused to have any contact with us, even though he had told me during an earlier mission that he was available and even enthusiastic to appear before this Court in order to give evidence for Mr. Renzaho.  

Among the witnesses who, in the final analysis, accepted to come and give evidence, at the end of last April, we learnt that three of them henceforth refuse to come here and give evidence and that a fourth witness had just fled from his country as a result of the threats against him.  

As for the witnesses who are still accepting to come -- and here I'm referring to witnesses coming from Rwanda -- they are requesting -- particularly one of them, they are requesting exceptional, or special, protection measures which will be the subject of a motion we will be filing.  And, for now, they refuse to have any contact with the representation of this Tribunal in Kigali. 

Lastly, several witnesses, that is, Rwandan witnesses, have expressed fears of reprisals, reprisals against they, themselves, and their families living in Rwanda.  These are Rwandan witnesses who, today, do not live in Rwanda.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, we are compelled to condemn the situation, a situation in which today, nobody, and in particular the Tribunal, can afford to overlook.  This Trial Chamber heard the historian, Madam Alison Des Forges, assert that she, herself, when she went to testify on behalf of Father Theunis, was threatened, even though everyone here knows how close she is to Rwanda, the theories that she defends in favour of the tragedy, and his international -- and her international -- her international reputation, her reputation both in the international community and in Rwanda.  

The Defence has already tendered in evidence reports from human rights organisations, Amnesty International, which reports condemn the dictatorial nature of the present regime in Rwanda and the attitude of this regime regarding national and international judicial bodies dealing with the genocide issues. 

Under these circumstances, the Defence is deprived of access to crucial evidence, and the Tribunal only has part of the truth. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, it is not the persons, the men and women, contributing to this international justice who are being accused.  It is the system that has been adopted in the treaty setting up the Tribunal and the nature, as well as the conduct, of the regime in Kigali. 
Even if, today, the international community is losing interest in this situation, just as it is losing interest in the activities of our Tribunal, I cannot believe that one day, or -- that one day it may not become necessary to meticulously analyse what happened in Rwanda and what happened in this Tribunal.  

By choosing the profession of lawyer, or counsel, we chose the profession of free men and women.  To begin with, we have the blessing of exercising this profession in a democratic country. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm exercising this freedom today -- or, rather, I'm putting this freedom today at the service of Mr. Renzaho and international justice.  

I accepted the assignment given to me in January 2003, but since then the situation has evolved.  We became aware of a number of things regarding the history of Rwanda.  The Defence wants to accomplish, go to the end of, its mission, or assignment, but it does not, in any manner whatsoever, want to give the impression that it is not aware of the situation which prevails today. 

I will give you a terrible example and which may make one laugh if it were not tragic.  I heard that a number of witnesses -- because the Tribunal's work is coming to an end, that a number of witnesses are asking for compensation for them to end their contracts.  I do not have evidence of this, but that is what is being said.  

But what is being said, what we know, why is your Tribunal not saying it?  It is because nobody takes interest any longer in what we are doing.  But in the present-day society, you do not have watertight walls.  I am not criticising those who are not disseminating information.  We have.  This is because we are all trying to do the work assigned to us, namely, to discharge the responsibilities or duties assigned to us.  

But the advantage we, as lawyers, have -- and that is why I want to denounce the situation.  The advantage we have as lawyers is that we are in an independent profession and nobody can prevent us from speaking.  Nobody can prevent us from speaking and to say, loud (sic) and clearly and publicly, what we know and what we should say.  

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Maître.  

On that last point, have you reported the alleged threats concerning certain specific witnesses to the WVSS? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, yes.  We mentioned this right from the beginning.  Because, right from the beginning, as regards witnesses in Rwanda, all of them, today, do not want to contact the Tribunal's office in Kigali because they think that once they go there they will be indexed by the Rwandan courts, they will be profiled by the Rwandan courts.  

I do not want to engage in some form of confession.  I'm not both a witness and Defence counsel.  But I cannot keep quiet regarding what I know.  

As regards the Tribunal's office in Kigali, Mr. President, Your Honours, with a number of officials in this Tribunal, that is, people who have authority, it is not possible to talk with them in the premises of this Tribunal.  

I was a direct witness of this situation.  I asked the person I was talking to whether the witnesses should come here to testify -- testify.  He said no, and I understand him.  

We talked about it, Mr. President, to the section, WVSS, I suppose, and we are trying to find ways 
of (sic) means of circumventing the Kigali Tribunal's office.  But, at the same time, WVSS does not have any significant resources or means of protecting those witnesses, especially if it is heard that they have testified here and -- or, rather, they have -- WVSS has no way of protecting them once they have testified here and return to Rwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you said raises two issues:  The last one is about the modality for ensuring that reluctant or fearful witnesses nevertheless will testify.  And that is something you are now in contact with the WVSS to sort out.  

But the first question, and that was my question to you, is whether you have indicated specifically that certain particular witnesses say that they have been threatened to the WVSS.  Have you drawn the attention of the WVSS to this specific situation of those witnesses?  And, if not, kindly do so.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, over the past two years, things have developed in Rwanda to the extent that there is more repression and social control, and that is the reason for which witnesses are behaving in this manner.  This has been pointed out to the section, and the section is fully aware of what is happening.  

We have two categories of -- or, rather, three categories of witnesses:  One, the witness whom I referred to a short while ago as a key witness is the kind of witness who has refused to appear before the Court -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not need any recapitulation now.  I only want to ensure that you are now in contact with the WVSS concerning both your key witness -- or, the two key witnesses, and the three who refused, and the situation of number four, who just fled.  And just make sure that the WVSS gets all the details, and then we will see further what can be done in that connection.  But we can leave it at that for the time being.  

I just want to assure you that, of course, the Tribunal takes these matters seriously and always investigates such allegations.  And I wanted to make sure that you have, indeed, drawn attention in a specific way to these matters, and I understand that you have.  Is that so?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  However, we are in a very terrible situation because the witnesses who have refused to appear to testify before the Court, I believe that if there were an investigation to be conducted in Rwanda, I'm not sure that they will be easily identified.  

The context for the Prosecution is different from ours, and the issue here, then, would be that such an investigation could properly be conducted in the United States or in Canada.  But there is a totally different situation in Rwanda, which has become completely a closed society.  So we have reported to the section that which we could report.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Thank you for your introductory statement.  

Prosecution, do you have any comment on the introductory statement or on whether there is any problem now in calling the first Prosecution (sic) witness? 

You have the floor. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

A brief comment regarding the last points, and I'm glad Your Honour raised the issue also with Defence counsel.  

Firstly, I just want to mark the record by saying we don't accept the statements regarding the situation in Rwanda as set out by the Defence.  There are all sorts of reasons why witnesses decide to change their mind.  There are all sorts of reasons why -- that are provided to counsel why witnesses changed their mind.  The two don't always coincide with each other, which is why there is a necessity, and we would strongly urge the Defence to take the matter up and have an investigation.  Because, certainly, we would not support in any way threats being made to witnesses for the Defence, and we would be supporting any actions that were taken to investigate and bring such matters to light.  We certainly don't want those sorts of things swept under the carpet.  

That's the only point I want to make regarding the opening statement. 

Your Honours, whilst there is no problem with the witness commencing, there are some matters of a general nature which I do think do need to be addressed.  I'm happy to do that in open court now, Your Honour, if that -- they won't take long.  I've only got two or three matters that I want to -- to raise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And on your first point, you will have noted that I said investigation of "alleged threats." 
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's why it's so important to clarify the factual situation. 
MR. MOSES:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, please proceed. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

Your Honours may have seen that we did file a -- a motion earlier this week.  I have had the opportunity to discuss some of the matters with the Defence counsel informally in a way in which, hopefully, does not cause -- to try and create the least conflict as -- as we possibly can.  

It is fair to say, Your Honour, that we are concerned at the incomplete and late disclosure that has been provided to the Court and to the Prosecution, and, in particular, I wish to put on record that the Prosecution should not be handicapped by the late disclosure that has been made to the Prosecution.  We are trying to get the statements that have been provided in the last three or four days translated.  There are a number of will-says and statements as well which were provided only -- we received them on Tuesday.  

I don't want that to necessarily stop us from proceeding, Your Honour, but I also want to indicate at this stage that, when we conclude our cross-examination, it will be concluded subject to any further cross-examination that may be necessary by reason of matters which have come to light late and out of time.  And I simply want to place that on record.  

I don't believe, Your Honours, that the Prosecution -- the onus should be on the Prosecution to have to file an application to re-call witnesses for reasons which have occurred because of late disclosure and breach of court orders.  We will attempt to conclude, and it may be that there aren't matters which are needed to be put to the witnesses who we are cross-examining.  But I just want to highlight that as an issue now, Your Honour, because I don't want to be put into a difficult situation where we -- the onus was, as it were, shifted onto the Prosecution to have to justify re-calling the witnesses when such an application would not have been necessary had it not been for the late disclosure.  

Your Honours, we still do not have complete disclosure of a number of documents that are in the -- relate to the list of witnesses for whom have -- the most recent list. 

And if I can identify -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you proceed, the most recent list has which date?  
MR. MOSES:
14th of May.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, yes. 
MR. MOSES:
The issues, if I can just briefly go through them, Witness 16, PPO, the Defence say that there was an identity sheet disclosed on the 14th, but we haven't received one and I don't believe there was one filed with the -- with the Court.  

Similarly, Witness 21, NAZ, the Defence indicate on their sheet that the identity sheet was disclosed, but on the 25th of April, we don't have it.  

Witness 24, HIN, we don't yet have the name of that witness provided to us.  

Now, so that Your Honours are aware, I had spoken to the Defence earlier this week.  They indicated that they were going to file a motion, asking for late disclosure of that witness for security reasons.  With the greatest of respect, we still don't have it.  

We're about to start trial.  We don't know who the witness is.  No such motion has been received by the Office of the Prosecutor, and holding back that information is in clear breach of Your Honours' orders, both of the order for witness protection and the order to disclose the information by the 23rd of April.  

So that's a matter which, to be blunt, Your Honour, should have been done, or at least a motion filed some considerable time ago, asking for an alteration of -- or, variance of the witness protection motion that was granted.  So that's a concern.  

Witness 26, the Defence say that a will-say was disclosed, but we have no record of a will-say being filed, or no information regarding that person.  And Witness 35, PAN, once again, we have no they say a will-so -- -say was disclosed, but we have no such will-say in our possession that was disclosed by registry. 

So those -- those are the issues in relation to the factual witnesses.  

Can I also say that, having heard from my learned friends in their opening regarding the purported evidence that they wish to lead from Mr. Roach, it is of a nature, shall we say, that the Prosecution would clearly be objecting to, to talk about informer witnesses.  Now, I'm not sure whether we have, in fact, had any informer witnesses, whether they are relating -- in fact, meaning -- the translation came through was "informer witnesses."  Whether he, in fact, is going to talk about detainee witnesses, I don't know.  

But, in any event it's -- from what has been identified in the opening, it would seem to be sort of evidence that will clearly be objected to.  

Now, why I say that, obviously, the earlier a report is provided to the Court, the earlier an application can be made so that the Court can decide before any arrangements are made to bring -- to fly Mr. Roach from, I believe, Canada.  It would seem sensible that the Court decide the issue as to whether or not that sort of evidence is to be allowed.  So I would simply ask that the report be provided to the Prosecution at an early stage so that the Court can rule on that -- on that issue. 

And then the final issue, if I can say, Your Honours, is in relation to exhibits.  We -- yesterday, the Defence came up to see us with a binder of documents and a list which they provided to us, but they couldn't give us a binder because they were going to make copies.  We still don't have -- 

I -- I just see an indication from the Defence that they may have them, but we don't -- we don't have them in our possession.  And it's rather difficult to -- to prepare where we haven't been provided with those materials. 
That's -- those are the matters, Your Honours, I wished to raise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness 26, that is BIT, is it?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes.  Your Honour, there is one further -- further matter -- can I say this?  

On this last order, the last 13, I think, witnesses, 24 to 36, are all will-says.  If one looks at the will-say provided by Witness TOP, which is about a page, very -- very brief, the estimated duration of that witness, according to the Defence, is going to be six hours on the basis of three hours' evidence in-chief and three hours' cross-examination.  

Now, it would seem to me, either they have got their calculations way wrong or the will-says are woefully inadequate in terms of the degree of information that the witnesses are going to provide.  

And I simply -- this is another matter which can raise its head in terms of late disclosure.  It's not in the statement.  It's in the will-say.  We have, if one goes down there, HIN, eight hours, six hours, four hours, five hours.  Now, even if one halves those amounts, they are relatively long periods of evidence in-chief, which would indicate that they are going to say a considerable amount.  

And it's a concern which I just want to flag now, which -- which is of a concern to the Prosecution.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your comments are on record.  

As regards Witness 26, just so that I understand this correctly, you know the witness's name but nothing else?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, that's correct.  We don't have the personal identification sheet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  There is obviously a need to sort out matters of a practical nature, and we will do that at an appropriate moment.  

Is there anything the Defence wants to say now, in light of what we just heard?  Maybe that could facilitate the situation.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  I met my learned friend to give him explanations that I had to give him.  The truth is that the work that we have to do, considering the importance of the case and the circumstances under which we found ourselves, is because the time was very short.  When we learnt that some witnesses will not come, effectively, we had to go to find other witnesses to fill the gaps.  And that is why we came up with the -- an initial list that goes up to number -- number 23.  

There were some errors of communication, and there are other people that we are in contact with.  And we note what they can testify, but we do not yet have declarations.  So we are not yet certain that these other people will be able to come and provide evidence.  So that is some work that we still have to do.  

I know that what is a concern for my learned friend and the Court is the respect of adversary proceedings and the fitfulness of the -- and there are representations, I -- we will make every effort necessary for them to obtain all the elements that they need for their cross-examination. 

With the 20 days we have, I think we will be able to do that.  We have another witness.  I think that is HIN, number 24 on the list, and we shall be filing a motion relating to him tomorrow, requesting special protective measures.  He's somebody who is coming from the country we were referring to a while ago.  And there are some other mistakes relating to disclosure.  There is a disclosure error on the will-say, but that is a detail that we will be addressing with my learned friend on the other side. 

What -- on the 6th of January we took a -- sorry, on the 6th of March, we took a commitment to do everything possible to respect the deadlines that we had set.  Mr. President, I assure you that we have respected that commitment.  It was an obligation of resources for me.  It was more an obligation for resources than for results.  We shall be able to start today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that explanation, and I note -- the Bench notes what you have indicated and, in particular, the fact that you will certainly be doing your utmost to ensure that the principle of contradiction is adhered to.  And this probably means, then, that Witness PPO, there is a need to ensure whether the identity sheet has, indeed, been disclosed on the 14th of May.  But, if not, maybe you have a spare copy to the OTP.  That was Witness 16, Witness 21, NAZ.  

Similarly, we note what you said about Witness 24.  The motion will be coming tomorrow.  

Witness 26, there, too, there is lack of information, according to the Prosecution.  Please get in touch with the Prosecution.  
And, finally, Witness 35, PIN, there is a problem there as well, and I'm assured this can be sorted out outside the courtroom, but as soon as possible. 

So if you have further problems in not receiving this immediately, Mr. Moses, we would like to be apprised of the situation.  But we expect this to be given to you very soon indeed.  

Should we, then, call the first witness?  

The witness pseudonym is?  
MR. CANTIER:
Witness ABC, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
I would leave -- I will hand over to Mr. Nekuie.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning again, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness ABC in these proceedings.  

You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness ABC in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you there. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your signature is at the bottom.  Is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  I have signed the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, therefore, the document is correct?  The information contained is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 42. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 42 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS ABC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, I will start with your examination-in-chief.  
MR. NEKUIE:
But, before that, I may want to turn to the Bench. 

Considering the special circumstances of this witness, to pray the Court to order that this examination-in-chief proceed in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All of it or some of it?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I think that it will be the entire examination-in-chief because all the questions will be related to her person. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to give further reasons for this request.  And do you need a closed session to explain the reasons?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Maybe, Mr. President.  That will be more practical. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will then move into closed session in order to hear the arguments in favour and against closed session for this witness. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 25 to 60] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
