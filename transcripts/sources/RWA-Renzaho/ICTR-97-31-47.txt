P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning.  The Court is in session. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness TOA in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness TOA in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there a personal information sheet concerning this witness, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I just wanted to explain the difficulties that we are facing.  This morning we were not able to open our door, the lock had a problem.  So part of the team had to call in the 
security service to break down the lock and bring out the personal information sheet. 
So, I don't know what happened between last night and this morning.  

Maitre Cantier has asked me to express his apologies, but it is related to the problem we had with the lock.  So the personal information sheet will probably come in during the examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So we are expecting it then. 

We have received some information about this witness in connection with the motion.  But for the time being, I think we can just start the examination-in-chief and await the document, just as you suggested, Maitre Nekuie.  

You have the floor.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Fortunately, we have the document here.  I don't know, maybe the 
registry officer will help circulate the document?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it has arrived.  Thank you to the Defence for having been able to provide it so promptly in spite of this unforeseen development with the door. 

Mr. Witness, you have a document in front of you.  Is it your signature at the bottom of the second page and the first page?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it is actually my signature. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So this means the information contained in this document is correct.  Isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the information is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
111. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 111 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I would like to have five to ten minutes of closed session with this witness to start with my examination-in-chief, and thereafter we can move into open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No problems with that.  That means we will have to close these proceedings for ten minutes and then we will open again.  We will then move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 4] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness TOA, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness TOA, when and under what circumstances did you learn of the assassination of 
	President Habyarimana? 
A.	I learnt of it in the morning of 7 April 1994.  I got the information on Radio Rwanda and it was announced that President Habyarimana had been killed. 
Q.	Witness, did that information have any kind of consequence on the attitude of the inhabitants of your secteur in April of 1994? 
A.	From 7 April there were riots in the neighbourhood in which I lived.  Unusual roadblocks were erected and unusual firing was heard.  So there was a major change. 
Q.	Now, concerning yourself, Witness, did you remain indifferent to that information or did you also modify your daily behaviour? 
A.	After I heard the news I was afraid, and my neighbours too.  My neighbours and I got together and commented on the news.  And life seemed to have come to a standstill and professional activities too came to a halt.  And, as I said earlier, it was as if life was standing still. 
Q.	Did you have any opportunity to leave your home after you had the comments with your neighbours; did you or did you not? 
A.	I was able to get out of my house. 
Q.	On what date did you leave your house, Witness? 
A.	I left my house on 10 April 1994. 
Q.	And when you left your home on 10 April 1994, where did you intend to go? 
A.	When I left my home, the RPF had just launched an attack, that is, in the Gisozi area.  Many people were shouting saying the RPF had attacked Gisozi.  Many people fled.  And I, personally, and my group, we decided to seek refuge at the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	Witness, what was your itinerary when you left to go to the Sainte Famille church from your home? 
A.	From my home to Sainte Famille I took the paved road passing through Kinamba.  And I moved up through Muhima through the area called Yamaha.  Then I followed the paved road to the Sainte Famille church. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I will spell out that name, Kinamba, K-I-N-A-M-B-A, Kinamba.  And I think Yamaha is a well-known name but I'll spell it out:  Y-A-M-A-H-A.  And Muhima is number 303 on our list. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, on your way did you cross any roadblocks? 
A.	I crossed three roadblocks from my home to the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	Witness, how did you manage to cross those roadblocks without being stopped? 
A.	When I fled I was part of a large group of people coming from Gisozi.  And when the persons who were manning the roadblocks started checking the passers-by, we slipped through the roadblocks. 
Q.	When you say you slipped by at the site of the roadblock, can you be more precise?  You moved just next to the roadblock or you moved around the roadblock, from the area around the roadblock? 
A.	We used little paths, paths not far from the roadblocks.  Given that there were many people manning the roadblocks.  It was possible to slip the crowd of people unnoticed and to use the paths, footpaths that were not far from the roadblocks. 
Q.	At what distance from the Sainte Famille parish was the last roadblock that you crossed to get to that church on that day? 
A.	The last roadblock I crossed was found at some 150 metres from the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	And, Witness, when you got to the Sainte Famille church, how many of you were there, approximately, if you can recall? 
A.	When I got there on 10 April 1994 there were about 500 persons within the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	Was there any person or any persons within the church to receive you when you got there, Witness? 
A.	When we got to the Sainte Famille church, we found other refugees who had got there before us.  And they were received by Father Munyeshyaka and he was assisted by other young persons who were in charge of the reception service.  And it is the same group, of Munyeshyaka and his assistants, who received us. 
Q.	At what precise point within the Sainte Famille church were you settled, Witness? 
A.	I, personally, was on the left side, if you stand on the altar and you're looking down on the congregation.  So I was on the left side close to the wall. 
Q.	Should we then understand, Witness, you were inside the church or outside? 
A.	Within the church building, I mean.  Your Honours, I've just mentioned that I was near the altar and you know that the altar is inside the church, so I was to the left of the altar inside the church building.  And when you are looking down on the congregation, I am on the left of the altar. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  You have mentioned a number of refugees who were at Sainte Famille on 10 April 1994.  Can you tell us, Witness, from the moment you were settled there how you organised yourself to meet your needs:  Your feeding needs, your health needs, your hygiene needs? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you do that, Witness, what was your time of arrival on the 10th at Sainte Famille?  
THE WITNESS:
When we got to the Sainte Famille it was afternoon already. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the answer to Defence counsel's question, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, given that there was an overlap in the two questions I would like to ask you, Mr. President, to authorise counsel to take over his questions. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Willingly, Witness.  I was asking you how you organised yourself as from 10 April 1994 to take care of your feeding, health and body needs.  I am talking of all the refugees because there were quite a few of you there.  
A.	As far as food was concerned, the food came from the stores of Father Munyeshyaka.  It was 
	Father Munyeshyaka himself who saw to the problem of food.  With regard to health, it was the 
	Red Cross who took care of us.  There was even a Red Cross ambulance that took away those who were seriously ill.  

Now with regard to the issue of hygiene, Father Munyeshyaka asked us to dig holes in the garden of the parish.  That is where we had our latrines, emergency latrines.  These emergency latrines were found in the garden of Sainte Famille. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  From that date on which you settled at the Sainte Famille church and to the end of April 1994, did you have occasion, Witness, to receive visits from the local préfectoral authorities? 
A.	From the date of my arrival at the Sainte Famille church, I personally never saw the authorities visit the area.  But I heard from the other refugees that the sous-préfet had come with members of the 
	Red Cross bringing us food items.  It was the other refugees who were with me who provided that information. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And just so the Chamber can clearly follow your story, can you give us the date on which you left Sainte Famille parish as from 10 April when you got there? 
A.	As I've said before, I got to Sainte Famille church on 10 April 1994 and I left that church on 4 July 1994 when the RPF took over control of the city of Kigali.  That is when RPF soldiers made us leave the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	Very well.  Witness, up until the end of the month of April 1994, did you have any kind of attacks from militias at the Sainte Famille church? 
A.	There was just one attack, and it happened on 22 April.  That was the first attack that was launched on the Sainte Famille church and it was on 22 April. 
Q.	At what time of the day did the attack happen?  And can you briefly describe the circumstances of the attack? 
A.	On that day between 10 and 11 a.m. we were receiving refugees from CELA.  Given that there were very many of us at the Sainte Famille church, we had to change our positions.  And so I left my former position and I went to the door, to the main entrance, that is when the attack was launched on the Sainte Famille church.  

I and other refugees moved inside the church.  The Interahamwe identified some persons amongst us and they told them, "So you're hiding.  And you thought we'd not find you?"  
Q.	So, how many people or how many persons were thus identified and what did you do with those persons, Witness? 
A.	I was not able to count the number of persons who were kidnapped by the Interahamwe, but I think there were between 10 and 15 persons.  After having identified them, the Interahamwe had them brought out and taken away.  So, after they crossed the gate of the church I cannot tell you what direction the Interahamwe took.  I just saw them forcing them into a vehicle, but I cannot tell you what direction they took. 
Q.	Witness, were you able to know on that occasion if, amongst the Interahamwe, there were some of them who acted as leaders, leaders of the group? 
A.	In the group of the Interahamwe that came to the church, they were all sporting the Interahamwe uniform.  None of them had an official uniform, so they all had on the Interahamwe uniform. 
Q.	Did it appear to you on that day that they were obeying orders from some authority, Witness? 
MR. MOSES:
That question, I'm objecting to it, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and that objection is sustained. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I will move on to another question, of course. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us move away from that incident on which you have properly enlightened us, in the Defence.  In the month of May did any incident happen, any major incident during your stay that you can still recall today, Witness? 
A.	In early May there was a major event; a shell, a shell was fired from the Gisozi area.  We called these shells katiouchas.  One was fired on Sainte Famille church.  That is the major event that happened in early May 1994. 
Q.	Still in that month of May, did you face any attacks from militiamen, Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before that, Mr. Witness, what was that word you referred to?  "We call these shells" -- and then you said something.  Please spell that word. 
THE WITNESS:
Those shells that were regularly fired on the Sainte Famille church were called katiouchas, katiouchas. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the spelling?  Can anyone help in the Courtroom?  Could it be K-A-T-I-O-U-C-H-A?  According to the eminent French court reporter.  Thank you. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is correct, Mr. President, at least the Defence thinks so. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I don't know if the Prosecution wanted to raise an objection to my last question.  The question was as follows:  Did you in the course of May face attacks from the militias?  Do you recall, Witness, of any such attacks or not? 
A.	In the month of May the Interahamwe -- I have mentioned before that the attack that took place was launched on 22 April 1994. 
Q.	Does that mean, Witness, that after the 22 April 1994 attack you had no further attacks from the militias during your stay at the Eglis Sainte Famille? 
A.	There were no further attacks from the Interahamwe.  After that initial attack, a group of gendarmes that were supposed to take care of our security came in, and thereafter we were no longer attacked by the Interahamwe. 
Q.	To be more precise, Witness, does it mean that up until 4 July 1994, when you left, there were no further attacks at all?  
MR. NEKUIE:
	It is not a leading question.  
MR. MOSES:
With respect, it is, Your Honour.  And I'm objecting to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know, when you are insisting over and over again after having a negative answer, it is becoming a bit suggestive.  So this is an example where the common law people would say that the question is asked and answered. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, were you shelled in the course of the month of June during your stay? 
A.	In the month of June there was shelling on a number of occasions, in that month of June. 
Q.	Can you tell us where this shelling was coming from, and the dates, if you can remember? 
A.	In the night of the 16th to the 17th we were awakened by firing.  And in the course of that night there was a lot of firing, and people knocked on our door.  Then there was noise coming from outside.  And the next morning we learnt from the clergy that were there that the Inkotanyi had attacked and had taken away the refugees that were at the Saint Paul centre.  And so we learnt that there was an 
	RPF attack on that night.  The next day, on the 17th, we were discussing the incident, the Inkotanyi attack.  We were disturbed.  And we saw Interahamwe coming, at about 8 a.m. 
Q.	What were the Inkotanyi coming to do that morning at about 8 a.m., as you say, Witness? 
A.	That morning at about 8 a.m., we saw the Interahamwe coming.  I was sitting close to the door that opens out on the garden of the church.  We saw the Interahamwe coming.  They closed the gate and they came in firing.  They headed towards the church garden and they were heading towards the church itself.  I, and the persons who were with me, sought refuge within the church and I moved close to my family.  At the time I had a child.  So I stayed with my family and I told myself that it was better to die with my family, because we thought we were going to die. 
Q.	And for how long did you remain in that state with your family, Witness? 
A.	I would say that I stayed that way for about 20 to 30 minutes.  Well, that is an approximation, but I was disturbed, so I cannot be sure of the timing.  The Interahamwe started firing.  But I can say that it lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. 
Q.	Were you able to know why the Interahamwe were attacking you and why they stopped, Witness? 
A.	Why the Interahamwe attacked Sainte Famille is not clear to me.  But what was being said on that day was that the Inkotanyi had attacked Saint Paul and we could see where.  We were at Sainte Famille, so we expected Interahamwe to attack us because they were constantly saying that Inkotanyi were hiding in the church.  So they attacked because the Inkotanyi had evacuated the refugees at Saint Paul. 
Q.	How long did that attack last then, and how did it end? 
A.	The attack lasted about 25 to 30 minutes.  I raised my head and I realised that there were soldiers telling us that there was no more problem.  So I suppose that it was the soldiers who put an end to the attack. 
Q.	Were there any victims in that attack, Witness? 
A.	There were victims at the time of that attack.  There were deaths, injuries, so there were victims. 
Q.	What was done with the victims, especially the people who died?  Were there people to take care of the injured, or not? 
A.	As usual, it was the Red Cross who took care of those people.  The Red Cross removed the corpses and tended to the wounded as was customary.  That's what happened on that day. 
Q.	And how long did the soldiers referred to, Witness, stay on the spot? 
A.	Those soldiers did not stay long inside the church.  I was inside the church because I was very afraid.  I did not exit.  I don't know how long they stayed outside the church.  I was still afraid.  That's why I stayed inside.  I was trembling.  So, I cannot tell you how long they stayed within the perimeter because I stayed inside the building. 
Q.	Did you hear it said, or did you have occasion to see the préfet of Kigali there on that day? 
A.	I did not see him on that day.  However, some people told us that they had seen him on the 6th, and he was with UNAMIR troops and the Red Cross.  So those people told me they had seen me on the 6th, but I did not see him. 
Q.	The 6th of which month, Witness? 
A.	In fact I'm referring to the 16th because the Interahamwe attacked us on the 17th.  The préfet came on the 16th of June.  That's what we learned.  I did not see him personally on that day, the 16th. 
Q.	And that day when the Interahamwe attacked you, Witness, where was Father Munyeshyaka? 
A.	When the Interahamwe attacked, it was about 8 o'clock.  I did not see Father Munyeshyaka.  I don't know where he was.  When we saw the assailants arrive we entered the church, so I cannot tell you where Father Munyeshyaka was at that time. 
Q.	Did you see him -- Witness, did you see him on that day, the 17th, afterwards at anytime on the 17th? 
A.	Yes, I saw him in the afternoon.  He was trying to reassure people.  He was very sad because of what had happened.  That is when I saw Father Munyeshyaka. 
Q.	Were you able to learn whether -- on that day after the attack whether Préfet Renzaho visited 
	Father Munyeshyaka? 
A.	We never learned of that and we never learned that Préfet Renzaho and Father Munyeshyaka met.  I did not see them together and I did not hear it spoken of. 
Q.	Witness, you have told us that you left Sainte Famille parish on the 5th -- 4th of July? 
A.	That is quite correct.  I left the church on the 4th of July 1994. 
Q.	Until that date, Witness, up to that date the 4th of July 1994, did you, while you were staying at 
	Sainte Famille, note any cases -- learn of any cases of rape within the perimeter of Sainte Famille parish? 
A.	Personally, I did not witness any rape nor did I hear it spoken of, and moreover we were one on top of the other inside the church.  We didn't have enough room to turn over when we were lying down.  There were people everywhere within the church and it did not smell good because it was very dirty.  And I don't think rapes could have been committed in view of this situation in which we were.  

	People from the Red Cross would come to help us, and if there had been rape, the victims would have appealed to the Red Cross.  In May, after the shelling, UN journalists came and the victims would have spoken of it at the time.  So, personally, from what I saw there were no cases of rape and I did not hear it spoken of. 
Q.	Thank you for that answer, Witness.  Witness when you left Sainte Famille parish on the 
	4th of July 1994, where did you go? 
A.	When the Inkotanyi took control of Kigali town, they asked all men ***************************** to help them, so I left.  They gave me ************ and I began to work with the RPF military. 
Q.	What were your activities with the RPF troops, Witness? 
A.	I was asked *********************************************************** that would take people from roadblocks -- people who had been arrested by the RPF at the roadblocks, and we took them to places where they were killed. 
Q.	Could you be a bit clearer, Witness?  You carried people to places where they were killed.  Did you know why those people were killed and who they were? 
A.	When they took control of Kigali, there were many Interahamwe left in town who had not run away.  Others were members of the MRND.  In the majority, it was those people that we found at the roadblocks manned by the Inkotanyi and it is those people ********************************. 
Q.	Did you undertake those activities in Kigali town, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  I first began my activities in Kigali town and we continued on the way to Gisenyi.  That is where I exercised my activities ***********************. 
Q.	How long did you exercise those activities with the RPF troops, Witness? 
A.	I worked with them for a year. 
Q.	And why did you stop working with them? 
A.	I stopped working with them because I had to look after my family.  We were not paid.  Peace was restored.  So I had no reason to stay with them.  I was not a soldier.  They'd asked us to help them and that is why I did it.  That is the why and wherefore of my working with them. 
Q.	And when you left them, Witness, what was your next occupation, and until when did you exercise it? 
A.	I became a driver, which activity I exercised until I went into exile. 
Q.	When did you go into exile, and why? 
A.	When I understood that the truth was being hidden; that they were not telling the truth about what had happened in Rwanda.  I decided to testify and that's when they began to chase me.  I learned that four civilian drivers who worked with Inkotanyi had been killed.  And I understood that I would be killed because I held proof, some proof, and therefore I decided to leave the country in 2004. 
Q.	Can you tell us, briefly, what sorts of proof you say you had, Witness? 
A.	The first proof is that those civilian drivers who died and were killed in unexplained circumstances and those drivers knew many secrets they might reveal at any time.  And the second proof is that someone was killed very near to my home when I was coming back from work one evening, someone was killed. 
MR. MOSES:
I am sorry, Your Honour.  I have been happy for them to lead this material, which isn't directly relevant to the matters Your Honours had to decide, because there had been some reference in the statement to the part as to his activities after 1994 in the final paragraph.  

We're now getting into matters of which there's been no notice provided to the Prosecution.  And, therefore, I am objecting to it on that basis.  As I say, I was happy for the matters we'd received notice to be led, even though they're not directly relevant.  But we're now getting into additional matters of which there has been no notice.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  We did not want to end this session in a polemic, and we will hold out our hand to the Prosecution.  

I will end that line of questioning there and I will very shortly have finished with my examination-in-chief. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, where did you settle in exile and on what date did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I found refuge in (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted from the transcript and kept under separate cover) and I arrived there in 2004, and it is still there that I live. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, please do not give any indication about where you might be staying.  We will delete the reference to the country at 9:55:26 and place that under seal. 
Video booth, please do not transmit that. 

And now, the next question. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you have any personal relations with Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	I never had any personal relations with Mr. Renzaho.  I didn't even know him personally.  I knew he was a figure of authority, but I never had any dealings or relations with him. 
Q.	Have you any personal interest in coming here to testify on his behalf in here? 
A.	I have no personal interest.  I'm even risking death because before leaving the country where I live -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has mentioned the country again. 
THE WITNESS:
I met RPF soldiers who had come with President Kagame to that country and they asked me if I had gone there to seek refuge.  I came here to speak the truth because I am a man and I believe in God.  I have no other personal interest.  I might have to bear many consequences because I came here to testify. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth points out that the witness has pointed out the country twice. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Interpreters, for your caution. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And, Witness, thank you for your testimony.
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, we have at this stage concluded.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  And I think we will also avoid sending out, video booth, the last part of the witness's answers in case the Kinyarwanda version can be heard.  

And we thank the interpreters for having acted as witness protection officers.  Thank you.  

Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, why didn't you go through the roadblocks directly on the way from your home to Sainte Famille on the 10th of April? 
A.	The reason is a simple one:  It was concern for my safety.  You know that at the roadblocks some people were killed.  And it is very simple.  That is the reason why I did not go through the roadblock directly for my own personal safety.
(Pages 5 to 14 by Melissa Hook)


































1000H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you for that.  

So, do I understand that it was clear to you, as early as the 10th of April, that you were at risk -- you and your family, were at risk going through a roadblock because of your ethnicity? 
A.	I and my family did not dare to cross roadblocks because they were manned by people who were hostile of anyone who is of another ethnicity.  And as you know, there were people killed at -- on those roadblocks because of their ethnicity. 
Q.	And is that also the reason why you stayed at Sainte Famille from the 10th of April till early July, because you considered it was still too dangerous to leave Sainte Famille because of the dangers for you and your family? 
A.	Yes, I stayed with my family at Sainte Famille out of safety considerations.  
Q.	Would you agree that at Sainte Famille there were several thousand people staying in the 
Sainte Famille compound, not just inside the church, but in other parts of the Sainte Famille compound? 
A.	Where I was inside the church, I could only see the people in the church garden.  And the only estimate I can make is as to the people who were inside the church, and in the church garden.  So I cannot give estimates for you of the people who were elsewhere within the Sainte Famille perimeter.  
Q.	All right, thank you for that.  And do I understand your testimony correctly that you personally never saw the Accused during the entire period of your stay at Sainte Famille? 
A.	The entire time I stayed at Sainte Famille, I personally never saw the Accused.  But I did hear it said, nonetheless, that the Accused had come to Sainte Famille on the 16th of June, but that is hearsay.  
I did not see him personally.  
Q.	And similarly, you never personally saw the sous-préfet, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  Personally, I did not see the sous-préfet; it was a team that brought us food that told us that they saw the sous-préfet in the company of the Red Cross that brought us food items.  
Q.	Did you know a person by the name of Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
A.	I do not know that person who goes by the name of Odette Nyirabagenzi.  
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Angeline Mukandituye? 
A.	No, I do not know Angeline Mukandituye. 
Q.	The incident -- sorry.  Were there gendarmes present at Sainte Famille when you arrived on the 
10th of April? 
A.	When I arrived at Sainte Famille, I personally did not see gendarmes there.  But I learnt that there were gendarmes in Saint Paul, but from the area where I crossed to get into Saint Paul, I did not see gendarmes.  But I was told that there were gendarmes in Saint Paul.  
Q.	And on the incident, you told us some 10 to 15 people were taken from Sainte Famille, was that including men and women? 
A.	That was an estimate -- actually, I gave the figure of 15, and among those persons there were men and women.  
Q.	Thank you.  Do you recall seeing any roadblock just beside Sainte Famille during the month of 
May 1994? 
A.	I learnt that there were roadblocks besides Sainte Famille, but personally I did not see them, because I did not go out of Sainte Famille church.  But, the information I received reported that there were roadblocks erected not far from Sainte Famille.  
Q.	And as you have said quite fairly in your evidence, bearing in mind that you remained within the 
church -- the building itself for most of the period you were there, it's not possible for you to say -- to give direct evidence about all that went on outside the church.  That's fair, isn't it? 
A.	The information that came into Sainte Famille was circulated; information moved around.  The refugees within the Sainte Famille church shared information.  If you got into Sainte Famille church from the paved road, there were people who were there and there were people who were outside, and who gave us information on activities that were happening outside Sainte Famille church.  
Q.	All right, but bearing in mind you were inside the church, you relied upon other persons to tell you, rather than what you saw yourself.  That's -- that's fair, isn't it? 
A.	Given that I was inside the church, and that I was sitting next to the door of the church, everything that was happening outside the gate of Sainte Famille church was narrated to me by persons who were outside.  
Q.	All right.  Yes, but it's a simple question, Witness, it only needs a simple answer.  You couldn't see personally everything that was going on outside Sainte Famille church, because you were inside the church for most of the time; it's just common sense.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I have told you that I could not know what was happening outside the church, even though I was inside, because other refugees told me what was happening outside the church.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is what you could see, Mr. Witness?  What could you observe yourself?
THE WITNESS:
Personally, I couldn't see what was happening outside the church.  Nonetheless, if I could climb up to the mezzanine of the church, I could see what was happening outside, but I'd never gone up there.  And that mezzanine was commonly referred to by the refugees as "America".  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MOSES:
I've got no further questions of this witness, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 

MR. NEKUIE:
No, Mr. President, we don't have.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you indicated a number of 500 refugees when you arrived at Sainte Famille? 
THE WITNESS:
I stated that when I got into the Sainte Famille church, there were about 500 of us, and we found about 100 persons.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, how many persons were there in the church where you were, approximately, inside that building?  Let's say, in June or on the 22nd of April, just to take two dates, approximately? 
THE WITNESS:
On the 22nd of June, there were about 1,000 persons.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A mistake from the booth, Your Honour, the witness said that in the month of April, there were 
about 1,000 persons; and in the month of June, there were about 4,000 persons within the church.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And how many times did you hear of the arrival of the sous-préfet at Sainte Famille?  
With other words, according to what you were told, how many times was he there? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot tell you the number of times that the préfet came to the Sainte Famille church.  As I have said, I was told that the sous-préfet had come to the Sainte Famille church in the company of the 
Red Cross team.  Then, thereafter I did not get any other information to the effect that the sous-préfet had come to the area.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we were now talking about the sub-prefect, weren't we, Mr. Witness?  That was both my question and your answer, wasn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, I spoke of the sous-préfet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

That was the end of your testimony.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Should you wish to meet with the Accused, the witness protection unit will arrange for that visit.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Effectively, I would like to greet him and I would like to ask another question:  I'm very concerned about my security, and I would like to ask you to take that into consideration.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Rest assured that the witness protection unit will give its utmost consideration to that issue.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses. 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, from the last witness, I believe there's a Pros -- there's a Defence exhibit, and also there was the use of the transcripts from the Rutaganda trial, which I used in the cross-examination of Mr. Lugan.  

And there was also the map that he had prepared and, I believe, both those -- before we conclude the proceedings, Your Honour, I'd be asking that -- certainly I'd be asking for the transcripts to go in, and I believe my learned friends will also want the map. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's first ensure that the transcripts get in; that was a Prosecution exhibit.  

Mr. Matemanga, number?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 118.  
 (Exhibit No. P. 118 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Defence, did you discuss with the expert witness, and do you now have a copy of his sketch so that we can tender it, or did he insist to keep the original to himself? 
MR. CANTIER:
It has been done, Mr. President.  So, we managed to -- to make a colour photocopy, which is to line scale; that is what we worked on and we'd like to tender that as an exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have it in the courtroom now? 
MR. CANTIER:
We'll get it right away, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But there will be no objections there, so we can tender it right away.  

The next exhibit number, Mr. Matemanga, will be?  

MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 112. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 112 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Is there anything else of a practical nature that you want to raise, Defence, before your case is closed? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, that was our last witness.  So what we would like is that the Chamber should enlighten us on the way forward -- that is, the deadlines for the submission of briefs and then the final session.  So if you would like to do that now or later, we are at the disposal of the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This trial will continue in a moment in the form of a status conference.  This means that there is nothing else to be said in connection with this trial.  

This was the end of Mr. Renzaho's trial, which started on the 8th of January this year.  
The Prosecution's case closed on 6 March, after the appearance of 26 witnesses in the course of 
21 trial days.  The Defence case opened on the 14th of May and closed today.  
Twenty-seven witnesses were heard in 28 trial days.  We have, therefore, heard a considerable number of witnesses in this single-accused trial.  In fact, we have heard 53 witnesses in the course of 
49 trial days and some of them were half days.  

So, we have achieved a lot within a reasonable time.  This is due to a large extent to the efficiency of the Prosecution and the Defence teams.  The OTP, led by senior trial attorney Moses always cooperated to ensure the smooth running of the trial; and Maître Cantier and Maître Nekuie have also contributed greatly to our efficiency whilst still vigorously defending the interests of their client.  I want to thank, on behalf of the Bench, the two teams for their professionalism, efficiency and courtoisie in the courtroom.  

The registry represented daily by Mr. Matemanga and Mrs. Ben Salimo have, thanks to their huge experience in the courtroom, ensured a steady flow of documents, and all that needs to be done in the trial took place without any problems whatsoever; and Mr. Diallo has supervised it all in an exemplary way.  

Our dear interpreters have made sure that there were no interpretation problems or communication problems.  They have even acted as witness protection officers from time to time in order to avoid that the witnesses disclose their identity.  The quality of the interpretation was superb; the speed amazing.  
Our team of English and French court reporters has performed their task with distinction as usual.  With an incredible speed, they have captured everything.  Even when the rest of us do not quite understand all that is being said, the screen is always there when we wonder.  

The realtime system has been a huge success, and the transcripts were always ready in the afternoon allowing us to prepare for the next day.  

The court video booth has also worked very well during this trial; thank you very much indeed.  

Thank you also to the security officers who have been with us throughout the trial.  

Thank you to all of you.

And, we will now continue, while we are sitting here with a status conference.  
(Court adjourned at 1025H)
