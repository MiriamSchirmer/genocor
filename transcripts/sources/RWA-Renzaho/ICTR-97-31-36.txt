MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness BIT, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and have to tell the truth, the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Antoine Théophile Nyetera in French)
THE WITNESS:
May I, Mr. President?  I wish to testify in open court; I'm not a protected witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted.  So, with other words, you are willing to testify without a pseudonym under your own name and everyone will know that you actually testified here, is that the situation? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will then note that we are about to start the testimony of 
Antoine Théophile Nyetera.  

You have provided a document with your personal details.  It's your signature at the bottom there, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this information is correct, the one contained in the document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 72. 
MR. PRESIDENT:

MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence? 
ANTOINE THÉOPHILE NYETERA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, your identification sheet states that you are Belgian? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	My question is as follows:  Is that your nationality of origin? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, you are both speaking French.  It is very important to have a pause between the question and the answer, as well as between the answer and the question.  The reason for that is that we need time for interpretation and time for transcription, so please slow down and observe the pause.  

The question was whether the Belgian nationality was that -- you have had throughout your life? 
THE WITNESS:
My present nationality was not a nationality I had at birth.  I was a Rwandan at birth.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber what your family background is? 
A.	If by that you mean where I -- in which group I am when taking into account the three ethnic groups that constitute the Rwandan community, and has done so for centuries, I am a Tutsi by ethnicity, and I am a descendant of the royal family.  I am the son of Kigeri III, K-I-G-E-R-I, 
Kigeri III, Ndabarasa, N-D-A-B-A-R-A-S-A.  The monarch who reigned towards the end of the 
18th century, he was the 10th king of the Niyigena group, N-Y-I -- N-I-Y-I-G-E-N-A.  
Q.	Thank you for this information.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel.
MR. NEKUIE:
I do not know whether the spelling of these two words was indeed taken note of.  Mr. President, I don't know whether that was done because I do not have the transcript before me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we may wish the word after Kigeri to be spelt.  
MR. WITNESS:
K-I-G-E-R-I, the III -- Roman numbers -- Roman numeral III.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Kigeri was the one we had, so I would appreciate the spelling of the word following that word.  It sounded like Ndabarasa. 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  N-D-A-B-A-R-A-S-A.  This is the surname, whereas Kigeri is the dynastic name.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as a descendant of the royal family, were you in Rwanda between October of 1990 and July of 1994? 
A.	I was in Rwanda even prior to these dates.  
Q.	Where did you reside at the time between October of 1990 and July of 1994? 
A.	I resided in the capital city -- in the Nyarugenge commune, let me spell it out -- N -- no, let me continue, and the Nyamirambo secteur.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, did you know who the préfet of the capital was at the time? 
A.	The préfet of the capital city was called Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho.  
(Pages 17 to 19 by Jean Baigent)



















1030H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	In October of 1990, were you among the people who were arrested on a massive scale after the attack by the RPF? 
A.	I was never arrested.  As for the massive scale of the arrests, I would not say that this characterisation is correct.  There were a number of people.  There were many people who were arrested, that is true, on the 5th of October of 1990.  
Q.	Did you know some of the people who were arrested? 
A.	I knew many of them.  I would not be able to list them all.  It would take too much time because most of them were Tutsis and Hutus. 
Q.	Did you have any of your relatives amongst the persons who were arrested, Witness? 
A.	No, Counsel, I had friends and acquaintances. 
Q.	Witness, at that time, do you know how these persons were treated?  Do you recall whether they were subjected to torture or persecution? 
A.	As far as I know, there were no acts of torture, and I know it because the people who were released, because they were all released after six months, even those who had been convicted benefitted from an amnesty and they all told me what happened.  The only thing being that with the arrests of many people, food was lacking.  There were 8,000 people.  So there was a shortage of food during the first days when they were assembled in the regional stadium.  Once they were jailed, they were given food and drinking water. 
Q.	Witness, did you manage to know if the préfet of Kigali town was among the officials of these arrests? 
A.	It's a bit surprising, because Préfet Renzaho was appointed to his post long after the arrests of these persons.  Secondly, those persons were arrested by the central intelligence service.  Renzaho was not a member of the central intelligence service.  They were arrested by the office of the prosecutor and the gendarmerie, but Renzaho was not part of that.  He was not even préfet then.  
Q.	Witness, after 1990, with the advent of the multiparty system in Rwanda, were you personally interested in political activities? 
A.	I don't quite understand your question -- or, I will just try to answer the question according to my understanding.  
Q.	I can rephrase it for you, Witness.  Let me situate you after 1990 and from when multiparty political activities had started in Rwanda.  Were you interested in these political activities?  Am I clearer now, Witness?  
A.	The word "interested", if that is intended to mean a choice of a political party, then my answer is I did not choose any political party.  I only closely followed and gathered all information relating to the political parties.  I was also interested in reading the manifestos of political parties.  Finally, there was a proliferation of political parties to the point that in two years we already had 17 political parties.  I never belonged to any political party.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, when you say that you did not belong to any political party, but that you were interested in the activities, or at least read the manifestos of political parties, for what reason did you engage yourself in this exercise? 
A.	First of all, all self-respecting intellectuals should be interested in the political life of his country.  Secondly, since my young days, I have always been interested in the social-political history of the country, and that for professional reasons as well.  And, thirdly, since the first political parties -- or the first multiparty system, which was decreed in 1959 by the security council, there were political parties then.  There, as well, I was not interested in any political party in a partisan manner.  There were many.  So I wanted to see if there was a change of political mentality after 30 years.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer, Witness.  Since this appeared to be part of the work that you were carrying out, are you able to tell the Chamber, Witness, if during that era of polit -- multi-political parties, if you knew the main political parties competing against each other in Kigali town? 
A.	I have just said there were a multiplicity of political parties, but, indeed, there were the main ones.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  The Chamber is well versed in the political parties, or the spectrum after the advent of multipartyism.  What is it you want the witness to tell us, Maître Nekuie?  Can you assist so that we focus on the essential parts, according to your approach, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I can do that, Mr. President.  Indeed, it is not necessary for him to describe these parties.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, at that time, did it appear to you that the préfet of Kigali town may have been one of the -- a member or a leader of any one of these political parties? 
A.	That is not possible for two reasons: The first reason is that the préfet, Tharcisse Renzaho, was a soldier -- a soldier by training, and like all Rwandan soldiers, no soldier can be a member of a political party.  

Secondly, he was in an executive position under the ministry of the interior, and all executives cannot belong to or be a member of a political party, otherwise they will not be able to accomplish their duties as executives.  
Q.	Witness, do you know if at that time the préfet of the town was giving certain favours to the militia of any one of these political parties?  
A.	The préfet, as I have just said, did not have any relation with any -- with any politics, not even with the politicians.  So there were no favours because the militia depended on their political parties that formed them.  They only took instructions from their political leaders. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a general statement or is it based on your personal knowledge of Préfet Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, this is the general situation.  The youth wings, which are referred to as militia, were recruited by the parties.  Each party will recruit its own militia.  And a préfet had no hand in the formation of these youth wings, except when there were demonstrations, political rallies, then the préfet had a major role to play for reasons of law and order during the demonstrations, and he is the one who will call on the general staff headquarters of the gendarmerie, and that was it.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, you just told us now that no soldier can be a member of a political party in Rwanda.  Can you cite a text to that effect or are you just talking?  Can you cite the law to the Chambers?  
THE WITNESS:
This flows from the constitution, which I do not have here in front of me. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Okay.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, coming back to the question that the President put to you, let me clarify.  If the préfet of Kigali town gave an ex -- extended any favour to any of these militias, you, in particular, were you in a position to know? 
A.	Counsel, I think this question is not very clear.  Favours as reasons of what?  In relation to what::  Food, uniforms, clothing, money?  What do you mean by favours?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
More generally, Mr. Witness, we are listening with interest to your testimony and would wish to know your approach.  Is your approach a general analytical one or is the information you are providing based on concrete observations of what Préfet Renzaho did, because you followed his activities?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I answered this question a while ago:  That the préfet had no relation with the militia.  The militia were under their leaders of the political parties.  All préfets, be it Renzaho or préfets in other préfectures, préfets, bourgmestres, had no role to play in the militia, who operated exclusively under their political leaders.  It was a fact -- a known fact, and it is in the implementation of law and order, and if he were involved in the militia he would be partial - or, impartial.  But, in any case, I do not see what kind of favour this will be.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you were indeed present in Kigali during that period of the multiparty system, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is.  
Q.	And you used to observe and were in contact with the political actors in one way or the other.  Is that true? 
A.	I will not say that the founders of political parties were my close friends.  They were acquaintances and sometimes friends.  I knew them in their various positions before they went into the multiparty activities.  As a civil servant of the country, I had a possibility to know a lot of people.  I will even say that a lot of people knew me without me knowing them, for reasons which I will tell you later on.  
Q.	Do you think, Witness, that if these political actors had any grievances against the préfecture authorities, and particularly against the préfet, Renzaho, would they have informed you of such grievances? 
A.	To my knowledge, from my experience, I do not know of any grievances because the préfet, be it Renzaho or others -- other préfets, dealt with the politicians in their application or requests to hold a political rally each time that a political rally of any political party was going to be held in Kigali town, they will require the authorisation of the préfet.  For the other préfectures, it was the ministry of the interior to authorise the movement of politicians to other communes, other préfectures.  Renzaho was limited to the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  I never heard of any misunderstanding between the préfet and politicians. 
Q.	Thank you for this answer, Witness.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
	The witness has not answered the question, so why are you thanking him?  You asked him whether there was any grievance in his knowledge.  He has not told us whether they had to tell him or not.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Your Honour, it's just that I did not want to insist.  I didn't want to dwell too much on a question for fear that I might not have any clear answers, but since you have remarked on this, let me go back to the question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what I wanted to know is that since, as you did say, you were in contact with the political actors, were you in a position to know if these actors had any grievances against Mr. Renzaho?  Were you in a position to know of those grievances on account of the contact you had with these political actors?  
A.	I thought my answer was clear, but if you wish I will clarify it further.  I never heard of grievances, complaints or any misunderstanding between the Préfet Renzaho and politicians.  I would have known because not only were there political parties but there were too many newspapers.  Each political party had at least two newspapers which were published weekly.  Any wrong act or action of préfecture authorities were published in the newspapers.  It was the one and only medium for everyone to know of what was happening between the political parties and the préfecture authorities.  
Q.	Witness, during that era of proliferation of political parties, what was the political climate prevailing in Kigali town, based on your observations?  
A.	The security climate prevailing in Kigali town was very precarious.  Some political parties encouraged the population to disobey the préfecture authorities, particularly the ministry of justice.  That led to a climate of insecurity.  The office of the prosecutor could no longer handle the situation.  People were being arrested and there were people who were engaging in offences.  If people were arrested in the morning, the political party would demonstrate, to the point that the office of the prosecution was paralysed.  They thought their way of expressing their democratic right was to demonstrate and it was a situation of anarchy. 
Q.	Witness, when you say people were engaged in activities, what kind of activities are you referring to?  
A.	Very well, that's a very good question, indeed.  The actions or the activities of political parties, they did not find any better means of enlisting members, but to force them.  Those who refused to join political parties were beaten and those were some of the activities of political parties. 
Q.	And, Witness, which ones, of the political parties, were engaged in these activities? 
A.	Three political parties to my knowledge: MDR party led by Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu. 
Q.	Can you please spell the names when you mention them?  We did not discuss that earlier on.  
A.	That party relied on the previous political party that won the legislative elections in 1960-61.  The leader of the party, Faustin Twagiramungu, was an in-law -- and still an in-law -- of the first president of the republic.  

The second violent party was PSD with a youth wing, because the name of the youth wing reflects their activities.  It's a Swahili word which they give themselves:  Wakombozi, the liberators.  
Q.	Witness, can you spell the words when you use them, for the purpose of the transcripts.
A.	Very well.

The youth wing -- well, the parties was called the PSD, democratic socialist party with a militia, wakombozi; it's a Swahili name.  Wakombozi, W-A-K-O-M-B-O-Z-I.  It's a Swahili term which means liberator/liberators.  

The third party, which is just as violent as the two previous ones, is the PL party, the liberal party.  The chairman of that party was a Hutu called Justin Mugenzi, who is here; his vice chairman, a Tutsi, Landouald Ndasingwa, N-D-A-S-I-N-G-W-A.  

This third party brought together the totality or all Tutsis.  This is the political struggle that was carried out at the national level.  It was not a political ideological struggle; it was a political regional struggle, and even ethnic, and that is why we had the insecurity.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President. I don't know if we should take the break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a good moment now.  We will have a break of 25 minutes.

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1132H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, when you were listing those political parties whose youth wings were engaged in political rallies and demonstrations, you mentioned three.  Do you think these are the only three whose youth wings were engaged in this confrontation at that time, Witness?  
A.	Those three parties that I had listed had formed a coalition against one party, the MRND.  All those three parties were seeking to take over the members of the MRND by force and enlist them in their own party. 

Now, since the three parties in question had met with the RPF in Brussels in 1991 to form a common front so as to chase out or to get President Habyarimana to resign, that is why I did not mention the fourth party because that party had nothing to envy from the other political parties. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And which fourth party did you refer to now, indirectly, or are you saying that violence was restricted to these three?  
THE WITNESS:
I answered that question by clarifying that the three parties, including the RPF, which was not registered in the country, had formed an alliance against the MRND, which was the one party since 1973 -- 1975.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I heard your answer very well, Mr. Witness.  Let me be more concrete.  What about the CDR?  Any violence there?  Its youth wing, for instance?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, the question is a good one.  I did not talk about the CDR, and that's because that was a latter formation -- a latter party, and it was not a member of the alliance of the four parties that I mentioned.  
Of course, the CDR was also attacked by the four parties that I mentioned a while ago: MDR, PSD, PL and RPF.  And the latter one, RPF, was operating under the ambit of PL.  So, in short, it's the PL that represented the RPF.  CDR was also targeted by the four parties that I had mentioned.  The violence was directed at CDR and MRND.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So maybe that party was targeted, but did it exercise any violence itself?  What was the role of Impuzamugambi?
THE WITNESS:
The role of the CDR youth wing, the Impuzamugambi, was defence against the coalition formed by those four parties.  It was on the defensive, but they were not recruiting members by force.  They were on the defensive. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, to your knowledge, did the parties, prior to the 6th of April and after, especially after the president's death, did they have good, sufficient control over their you -- young -- youth wings? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  This presents me with a good opportunity to tell the Chamber that following the death of the president, Habyarimana, what was referred to as political parties disappeared into thin air.  The entire population had focussed on the war.  It was a question of survival, life or death.  Political parties did not exist.  All the youth wings of the other parties were together.  This crystallised the ethnic problem after the death of the president.  There was no control whatsoever over the youth, to my knowledge.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Yes, Witness, you have spoken about the other parties having a youth wing.  Did the MRND not have a youth wing, and if so, what was it called?  
THE WITNESS:
The MRND established its youth wing in fourth position.  First position -- the first position, MDR had it's youth wing called Inkuba, I-N-K-U-B-A, that means "thunder".  Second position, I mentioned that earlier on, PSD, who had its youth wing, Wakombozi.  PL had its youth wing; it had no other name but JDR, socialist youth.  And, fourth -- and since all these youth wings had the sole mission or objective to counter the political movement, MRND, so MRND then created their own youth wing called Interahamwe.  And then the fifth, the last, was the CDR, with the Impuzamugambi.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
And did the Interahamwe engage in violence, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I did say that the Interahamwe were playing a defensive role among the youth wings.  That is to say that these were young people who were fighting each other, and their role was to prevent the MRND from holding its political rallies.  So one could say that they were militia, youth wing against youth wing, not against the population. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So also that group exercised violence, but for a defensive purpose.  That's the testimony, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Indeed, Mr. President, I am saying that the violence was perpetrated during political demonstrations -- during political rallies.  

Some wanted to prevent the population from attending a political rally, and the young people even erected roadblocks to prevent the politicians from advancing.  They would shout at them.  They would throw stones at them to prevent the other party from holding its political rallies.  That was the reason for the confrontation.  Outside the political rallies, there were no problems.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, in Nyamirambo secteur where you lived, when the Interahamwe or the MRND, during those demonstrations were forced into a defensive position did they -- or were they supporters -- supported by the police force of Kigali? 
A.	At each demonstration, given the experience of the authorities that each time there is a demonstration there is a confrontation of the youth wings, the préfecture authorities will position gendarmes or policemen, but more specifically gendarmes at the venue of the political rallies, so that -- so as to prevent any disorder.  The authorisation is requested by the préfet, who himself had no gendarmes, but who had to refer to the chief of staff of the gendarmerie. 
Q.	And when there was -- there were disorders, the intervention of the gendarmes, the police, was it in favour of one particular youth wing or a particular political party against the other political parties? 
A.	When there were demonstration and disorder, the police force or the gendarmes would separate the persons involved, because, generally, these young people -- some of the young people had distinctive signs, T-shirts with the insignia of their party.  The role of the gendarmerie was to separate them, and sometimes carry out administrative arrests indiscriminately.  Because the gendarmerie, as I said earlier on, was apolitical, had no political leanings and its role was to calm down the demonstration. 
Q.	Witness, outside -- or apart from the demonstrations, did you observe any other acts of violence in your area in Nyamirambo, and do you know who were the perpetrators of these acts? 
A.	Quite honestly, I never saw or heard people say or talk about confrontations outside the political demonstrations or rallies, except that this multiparty system, as I said earlier on, created some kind of suspicion, because let's not forget that the multiparty system -- what the Chamber needs to note as important -- an important factor is the fact that the multiparty system came after the war; that was in 1991.  And the war was in 1990, when there were infiltrators, when there were grenades going round from hand to hand.  There was a climate of insecurity and the bandits could buy grenades for 100 Rwandan francs.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, this Chamber knows a lot about the situation in Rwanda, and we certainty know the sequence of events of '90 to '94.  Could you kindly assist us, Defence counsel so that we focus on the elements you think we should be apprised of in the context of the present case, please?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President.  What I would like to submit to the wisdom of this Court is that, like the Witness, to shed light on a certain number of facts that he knows about and which the interpretation of which event is normally not clear, but I will respect your directive.  But I will ask the witness one last question on this issue.  When he made reference to infiltrators, who is he referring to and what were they doing to create this situation of insecurity in the town?  
THE WITNESS:
The RPF infiltrators, they used war tactics of trickery, of terrorism.  I am saying this because I saw them before the war.  I believe that is the answer you are seeking.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, that should be enough for me, Witness, for us to move on to the events beginning April 1994.  

Witness, when and under what circumstances, did you hear about the crash of the presidential plane which occurred on the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	I was informed, just like all other Rwandans, by the national radio on the 7th of April at 6 a.m.  When I woke up, as always I switched on my radio at 7:30 at the time of the news.  Unusually, I heard classical music.  I believe it was the Requiem of Mozart, if my memory serves me right:  Curiously, 15 minutes on, they announced the death of the president.  They first referred to an accident, a plane accident -- accident of the plane that was bringing him back from a trip, without referring to the circumstances. 
Q.	Witness, I am sorry, to interrupt you, since you have already answered my question, I would just like to move on.  

I understand that you got to know that the president was murdered or, in any event, his plane was shot down that morning, early at dawn.  Now, let me ask you the following question, what did you do when you heard this news on radio?  
A.	Well, Counsel, this question can have a different interpretation. What could one do?  We did not do anything.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly, that question can be interpreted in many ways.  And you certainly do not want the itinerary of the witness or the details of what he did on that day, probably.  You want his observations.  Can you assist the witness so that he immediately can convey to us what you think is relevant, Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I think indeed the question was open to interpretation. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I wanted to know if you left your house that morning when you heard the news.  That was the specific question that I wanted to put to you.  
A.	I would like to apologise to the President and Your Honours, and to you, Counsel, about my manner of answering your question.  That might not please you, but that is in my nature to go deep into things.  I was going to say, following your question, that after the announcement of the death of the president, a press release by the military committee requested us -- even ordered us not to leave our houses and to remain calm and have confidence in the military committee.  They added that the funeral had been -- the funeral of the president had been decided -- or programmed to cover one week and that the public service would not operate.  That was it.  So we would remained at home.  
Q.	When you said "We remained at home" are you referring to yourself specifically or to yourself and other inhabitants of your neighbourhood.  
A.	The press release referred to -- was addressed to all Rwandans, all Rwandans, wherever they maybe.  
Q.	Am I then to understand that on that 7th April 1994 in Nyamirambo secteur, nobody got out of his house?
A.	Nobody.  
Q.	And for how long did this situation last, Witness?  
A.	This situation was followed by another press release.  And this one on the 8th -- 8th of April, announced a curfew to the effect that no one was going to move outside his secteur, and even within the secteur, that the curfew started at 1800 hours to 7 a.m.  That was observed for a short while, just for a short while.  
Q.	This short while that you refer to, approximately how many days did that last? 
A.	From the 10th, if my memory serves me right.  It might have been from the 10th to the 11th, the préfecture authorities attempted to open markets and supermarkets because people could not stay without eating.  We then went out a little to buy from the closest supermarkets while still respecting the time limits. 
Q.	Did any violence occur in your secteur during that period where you were restricted to your residence? 
A.	If the Chamber will allow me, let me begin by talking about the process that was in place at the time.  The violence --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe this answer, actually, could be -- this question actually could be answered by a yes or no.  Did you see any violence from, say, the -- is it from the 10th, Mr. Nekuie, or from the 7th?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
From the 7th.  I was referring to those days when they were limited -- restricted to their houses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that's the question.  Did you yourself observe violence and then you can answer yes or no.  What is the answer?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I am sorry to interrupt.  It may be my peculiar circumstances, but I am incredibly hot still.  And I understand there is a conflict between myself and the Bench regarding the thermostat.  May I have permission, at least, to take off my robes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
By all means.  

But there is no conflict, just for the record, between the Bench and any party in this courtroom.  

Mr. Nekuie?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you explained that from the 10th of April shops were opened and some markets as well, and that you could go to these places.  Now, when you decided to go these places, did you come across roadblocks in your secteur? 
A.	The roadblocks in question were not erected before the 12th.  Sorry -- before the 10th, after the formation of the interim government and the speech of the prime minister requesting the population to ensure that there were no infiltrators or unknown persons coming into the secteur.  That is how the roadblocks were erected.  In fact, in front of my house 50 metres -- at 50 metres, there was a roadblock for people going to the markets.  
Q.	Who were those persons who erected those roadblocks, Witness? 
A.	The roadblocks were erected on the orders of the conseiller de secteur and responsable de cellule who selected the persons who should man these roadblocks. 
Q.	Do you know whether at that date there was also a message of the préfet of the town requesting that roadblocks be set up? 
A.	But since it had already been done, the only message by the préfet heard on the 12th stated that people were to be careful not to set up roadblocks in a haphazard manner, everywhere, in a disorderly fashion.  But he could not say that roadblocks could not be set up, since the issue of defence had already been decreed by the prime minister and the interim president.  It was not the préfet who said that roadblocks were to be set up, not at all; the order came from the prime minister.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this statement by the prefect on the 12th, transmitted through the radio, did you hear that yourself?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, with my own ears, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	This message of the 12th of April which you personally heard, Witness, was it the first message from the préfet that you heard? 
A.	I believe it was the very first one.  There were other messages, but as far as I am concerned, the one on the 12th was the first I heard. 
Q.	The roadblocks that were erected following the message by the prime minister and the president of republic -- of the republic, as regards such roadblocks, what was being done exactly at the roadblocks by those who manned it -- manned them? 
A.	From my personal experience, the roadblock which was closest to me was at a distance of 50 metres from my house at the entrance of the market.  What was done there was that identity cards were being controlled, in which one could find the commune and the secteur of origin of the bearer.  And, this, in order to determine whether there were no unknown persons who would be passing through that area. 
Q.	You were at a distance of 50 metres from such a roadblock.  Were you ever controlled in that manner at the roadblock? 
A.	I did not cross the roadblock, but the control took place under different circumstances.  There were visits in the homes of residents, and that was where the most serious checks would take place. 
Q.	Did you personally receive any visit of that kind at your residence? 
A.	On the 12th, I received a visit by two soldiers -- two armed soldiers, and when such people would come to your house they would ask you for your identity cards.  So that was routine.  I showed him my identity card.  "Do you have any hidden weapons?" "No, sir. The house is wide open, you can search it."  They searched and they didn't find anything and they left.  

I had a number of such visits of searches, so to speak, by the youth wings, and even on one occasion by two gendarmes.  And the purpose was always to look for people who were hiding, or for hidden weapons.  That is what I can say. 
Q.	When you would receive such visits and you would show your identity card, the persons you referred to did see -- would see your ethnicity as indicated on that card, wouldn't they?  
A.	Yes, indeed they would.  
Q.	And what is your ethnicity?  Can you remind the Trial Chamber, Witness?  
A.	It was written "Tutsi" on my card.  I wish to show to the Trial Chamber what this identity card looked like.  I kept mine for posterity, and if I am granted leave to do so I wish to show it to you.  
Q.	Witness, that won't be necessary.  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	Witness, when the persons you referred to would discover that you were a Tutsi, how can you explain that they did not take them with you -- take you with them, sorry.  
A.	Well, I believe that was not their mission, and I was not the only one in the house. 
Q.	Do you mean to say that there were other people of Tutsi ethnicity in your house? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And they were not faced with any difficulties, in spite of their ethnicity? 
A.	No, they were not.  
Q.	Did you know of any other Tutsi residing in your secteur at that time, Witness? 
A.	I knew quite a number of them.  The example I can give you is that of my elder brother, who did not live with me, but who lived at a distance of 600 metres from my house. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber whether the -- these persons encountered any difficulties by virtue of them belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group in your neighbourhood?  
A.	Well, I cannot say that they encountered any difficulty, but during the war everyone was worried.  But they displayed their identity cards, and when those who would search the houses would realise that they were Tutsis, they did not act on it.  But -- and there is a "but", Mr. President -- those that were specifically sought after were the infiltrators and those who had collaborated with the RPF, those who had paid dues to the RPF, had sent their children to join the ranks of RPF, those who had weapons. Those were the ones who were especially sought after.  
Q.	But, Witness, how could one identify the collaborators and the infiltrators you are describing?  
A.	Well, Counsel, let me tell you about the system that would enable one to know who was who.  You have the secteur level, people from the same secteur knew one another.  The secteur is divided into cellules.  The cellules are divided into the heads of ten households.  So everybody knew everybody.  Those who has paid dues were known, those who had weapons was also known.  It was also known who was holding secret meetings.  So people knew each other.  So that was the system that enabled everyone to know who was who, especially in the same secteur or the same cellule.  
Q.	 When the préfet made that message requesting that roadblocks not be set up in a disorderly manner, as you stated previously, can you tell the Trial Chamber, Witness, whether that message from the préfet was heard by the inhabitants of your secteur? 
A.	They heard the voice over the radio. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps I did not explain what I meant correctly.  Was there any implementation of the contents of the message by those who were manning the roadblocks? 
A.	I don't think so.  
Q.	What am I to understand by your answer when you are saying, "I don't think so"?  Was that what you were able to observe or you didn't have the opportunity to notice anything in your secteur? 
A.	The words of the préfet, after the government left the capital, were meaningless, were forgotten.  There was no valid authority or official who would be listened to.  The population was deploring the fact that the government had fled, and anything Préfet Renzaho might have said was meaningless. 
Q.	And, in concrete terms, what did it imply as regards the roadblocks?  Were there more roadblocks set up in a disorderly fashion or less after that message from the préfet? 
A.	Counsel, once again, let me tell the Trial Chamber that the said roadblocks -- perhaps one should abandon this issue of the roadblocks.  The problems were at the level of the visits that were made in people's residences.  Very few people would pass through roadblocks.  One could use side paths.  The inhabitants of Kigali -- there were very few roads.  Kigali is 25 square kilometres; there were very few roads, and there was no town planning, which means that people would use paths.  Those who were perpetrating acts of violence did not necessarily pass through roadblocks.  There was no control -- no serious control by the authorities.  There were no gendarmes, no policemen.  There was no one who would be able to organise patrols in residents' areas.  People did as they pleased.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, still with reference to the roadblocks.  Do you know whether there were Interahamwe manning roadblocks during that period? 
A.	Counsel, may it please the Court, one needs to understand one thing, once and for all.  After the resumption of the hostilities by the RPF and when the town was invaded, there were no Interahamwe.  All the youths were together, all the Rwandans were together.  There was no organisation whatsoever.  It was helter-skelter.  And perhaps you will have the opportunity to put the question to me, but the situation that prevailed at that given point in time from the security standpoint -- 
Q.	Witness, when you are referring to the situation that prevailed at the time, are you referring to April of 1994? 
A.	Yes, we are still in the month of April.  We are talking about the month of April.  
Q.	Since you referred to the situation, could you be more, explicit?  I realise that you wish to describe the situation.  Could you briefly do that, Witness?  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  Let me attempt to summarise it briefly.  I don't know whether I would be able to do that.  

What happened exactly after the resumption hostilities?  Well, there was panic within the population, especially in Kigali.  The displaced persons, who were at a distance of eight kilometres from the capital, flowed into the city.  There were prisoners from the Kigali prison, since the prison warders had fled, opened the prison gates, and they all flowed into the town of Kigali, and this led to disorder.  This is a version of the events that was not mentioned often before the Trial Chamber.  So there were hoodlums throughout the city perpetrating illegal acts.  There were prisoners flowing through the city, so this led to havoc.  People were looting, killing.  Mr. President, the situation was dire.  And there were -- there was also gunfire everywhere.  That was the situation prevailing in Kigali. 
Q.	Witness, was the situation you just described, the one prevailing in your secteur and at the location where you personally were? 
A.	That was the situation in all the secteurs, and in mine also.  

I knew what was happening beyond my secteur.  I was at an altitude of 1540 metres, and if I could hear the gunshots as well as the shouts of the population -- I do not wish to go any further.  And I am quite tall.  
Q.	And the people who were perpetrating killings and lootings, what types -- what type of weapons would they use for that purpose? 
A.	They would use bladed weapons, machetes, knives.  My answer is as follows.  The weapons I would see -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you really need an answer to this?  I think we know what happened -- the method used during the killings.  We have had so many witnesses. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, but, Mr. President, some of my questions are a prelude to more essential questions, and are simply introductory questions, even though they deal with known situations.  And if I do not proceed in that manner, my fear is that the logic behind my examination will not be apparent.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, do you remember the answer you were about to provide? 
A.	Yes, I remember it perfectly.  The question had to do with the weapons used.  I answered that bladed weapons were used, such as swords, clubs, or spears, and sometimes arrows.  I rarely saw any firearms, apart from the people who had grenades, as I stated previously.  Even those who were manning roadblocks did not have firearms, at least with the roadblock that was in front of my house.  
Q.	Do you know how those who had firearms, the ones you rarely saw, had acquired such firearms? 
A.	Well, I would not know about that because I did not ask them, "Where did you find a gun, a Kalashnikov an R4?"  Never.

	1230H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	At that time, Witness, we are still referring to April of 1994, did you learn that the préfet of the town of Kigali was distributing weapons or was having weapons distributed to the civilian populations in order to ensure the defence of the secteurs? 
A.	This is the first time I hear of it.  I am not aware of any distribution having taken place -- distribution by the préfet, distributed to whom?  How?  In such a case all the youths would have been armed.  
Q.	Witness, do you know whether Tutsis were tracked down and arrested at some roadblocks in the town and killed only because of their ethnicity? 
A.	I don't believe I ever heard such a thing.  And by way of clarification, let me say that if they were tracked down, there would not have been any people -- or Tutsis who would have sought refuge at the 
Sainte Famille parish, at the Mille Collines hotel, at the St. Michel parish, at the Saint Paul college. These places were filled with Tutsis who were forced to leave their secteurs, crossed the town and went to those places.  
Q.	Witness, with reference to the -- these Tutsis, were you able to know at the time how they were welcomed in the different locations you listed, and by whom?  How were they treated in those locations? 
A.	In such places there was no such thing as a welcoming committee such as -- for example, the Mille Colline hotel was a hotel from company Sabena.  But people went there.  Those who were fleeing went there.  And when they went to the different parishes, they were welcomed in a spontaneous manner and protected by the gendarmerie and by a few of the remaining policemen of the préfecture.  And on one occasion, UNAMIR troops were able to intervene to a certain extent at the Mille Collines hotel, but they left because in general they were Belgians and they left Rwanda immediately after the ten Belgians from their company were killed.  
Q.	Were you at the time able to hear about, or know, what was the attitude of the préfet of Kigali towards the Tutsis in general? 
A.	I heard in the communiqués broadcast over the radio, in no uncertain terms, that the préfet of the préfecture of Kigali distributed food, clothing to the Tutsis who were in such places.  And that was what was -- what I heard in the radio programmes.  
Q.	Apart from the message of the 12th of April 1994, from the préfet that you heard, did you ever hear other messages from the same préfet during the period from April to July of 1994? 
A.	No, I did not hear any message, because the radio was no longer operational.  Radio Rwanda no longer broadcast its programmes.  The FM network which used to cover the whole country was no longer operational.  
Q.	And do you recall, Witness, when it was that Radio Rwanda stopped operating? 
A.	Yes, I do remember it quite clearly because the FM -- the FM transmitters were destroyed, were shot at, on the 20th of April, and that was the day when there was a general shortage of drinking water and a general power failure.  The shortwaves frequency transmitter which was protected by the Germans, what is called Deutsche Welle which broadcast on -- 49 metres, was operational but they did not have a studio. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that after the 20th of April, Radio Rwanda stopped operating?  There were no further radio transmissions after that date? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I clarify that FM transmissions which would cover the country audibly covered only shortwave of 49 metres, and there was no studio for the préfet to broadcast messages, so there was no message from the préfet that we could hear.  Not even the government.  It had no more messages to transmit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the answer to my question is, yes, you are of the view that there were no radio transmissions after the date I mentioned, the 20th of April?  That is your answer, isn't it?  The answer is yes? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, regarding the FM. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see, radio transmissions may use different waves, and one thing is whether you can receive on certain waves.  Something else is whether the radio is operating and whether someone is sending anything out.  Now, did anyone send anything out after the 20th of April?  What is your testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
On shortwave, Mr. President, transmissions on shortwave to the -- outside the country, but within the country, we used to listen to the FM, and we could not hear that anymore.  But those who were outside the country could receive the signals on the shortwave, 49 metres. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could anyone in Rwanda hear any word coming out of Radio Rwanda after the 20th of April, yes or no? 
THE WITNESS:
Those who could tune in to the shortwave could hear something.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, am I to understand that the message broadcast on radio on the 12th of April coming from Préfet Renzaho is the only announcement that you heard on radio between April and July 1994? 
A.	It is the only message or announcement that I was able to hear.  
Q.	During that period, Witness, did you lose any one of your relatives? 
A.	Counsel, I'm always careful about making reference to a relative.  Each time I come here, I insist that we do not talk about this because the sentimental aspect prevails over the other aspects; but to answer your question directly, yes, wife and children.  
Q.	I'd like to apologise to you by striking a sensitive chord with you, but to conclude on this issue, because you nonetheless gave an answer, are you able to say under what circumstances these relatives disappeared and in which town in Rwanda? 
A.	The woman, or my wife, wanted -- the mother who was in Kicukiro did not come back.  My son who was a teacher and -- at a Greek college in Butare, I did not see him again.  These are the close relatives, or those in French you referred to as family, but distant relatives, a lot more.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer.  Witness, what is your occupation at this time?  I have noted that you are a researcher.  But do you accord sufficient time to your research activities, currently? 
A.	Since I'm on retirement, I have a lot of time to accord to my research activities.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for Counsel, please. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you have lost close relatives, and now you have an activity that occupies you.  How do you explain the fact that you are able to take a distance, and you are able to overlook this pain occasioned by the loss of relatives, to come here and testify for persons who are supposed to be the perpetrators of the acts that occasioned your pain? 
A.	I have just explained that the quest for the truth to assist justice is for me an important concern, instead of crying sentimentally over the dead.  That is my answer.  
Q.	Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President and Your Honours, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution? 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, Renzaho is not a friend of yours, was he? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, Renzaho is not within the network of my friends.  Before he became a préfet, I did not even know him.  
Q.	And he wasn't a colleague of yours at the ministry of higher education, was he? 
A.	Never, never.  
Q.	He wasn't someone you met occasionally through work as a researcher for that ministry, was he? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution -- I'd like to clarify one thing.  When I was engaged in research activities, do not confuse matters, I carried out research for the ministry, I carried out research for myself, personally.  In my own research activities and research activities commissioned by the ministry, Renzaho was not part of those research activities.  He's a person that one may get interested in for historical purposes and cultural purposes.  
Q.	So the answer, Witness, was no, wasn't it? 
A.	No.  I prefer to clarify so as to not -- so as not to leave room for ambiguity.  
Q.	You only knew Renzaho as the préfet of Kigali town, didn't you? 
A.	That indeed is the case, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	And you didn't see him after the 6th of April 1994 and before the 17th of July 1994, did you? 
A.	Never.  
Q.	And you never spoke to him after his appointment as préfet and up to the 17th of July '94, did you? 
A.	I never had that opportunity.  And I do not even see why I would have gone to shake hands with Renzaho.  I was no longer a civil servant.  
Q.	And from the 6th of April until the 4th of July, you basically stayed at home, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	In fact, at the most you might have gone out three times to the pharmacy, mightn't you? 
A.	Even once or twice to the market.  The pharmacy was just next door, yes.  
Q.	Perhaps you left your house once in April, once in May, and once in June, that might be right, mightn't it, Witness? 
A.	That is correct, that is correct.  
Q.	Yet you feel able to come and inform this Court about the events in Kigali, do you? 
A.	I'm telling the Judges of the Chamber about the events that occurred in Kigali.  I understand you're saying that, "Witness, you did not go out".  But the issue is not to go out and get information.  I had people who used to visit and who kept me informed all the time about all situations.  The bullets that fell on my roof and that fell at the hospital, these were seen by everybody.  Those who were passing in front of my house, having looted television sets and refrigerators, I saw them without having to leave my house.  
Q.	Okay, Witness, but you agree, don't you, that there was no television in your house or elsewhere after the 6th of April, was there? 
A.	Yes, a television was not operational.  
Q.	And there weren't any newspapers, were there? 
A.	No newspapers, no television.  
Q.	And your telephone at home wasn't operating, was it, after the 10th of April? 
A.	The 10th, no.  The 8th April my telephone stopped operating.  
Q.	And isn't it right, Witness, that after the problems you talked about with Radio Rwanda, the batteries weren't in your radio and you weren't able to listen to it anymore, in any event? 
A.	My batteries?  I never talked about the batteries of my radio set.  I always bought batteries.  
Q.	Well, Witness, that's not what you told the Court in September of last year when you testified on behalf of Casimir Bizimungu, is it?  Do you not recall telling the Court then that your batteries ran out and you could no longer listen to the radio? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I don't believe I ever said I was -- I run out of battery.  I followed -- I listened to all the programmes until the total cessation of transmission of radio programmes -- of 
Radio Rwanda and RTLM, as well.  What I could not listen to was the shortwave -- was the shortwave.  Please follow my answer, Counsel for the Prosecutor -- for the Prosecution.  I had two radio sets; one to tune into the shortwave, and another one to tune in to the FM modulated frequency which did not require a lot of batteries.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let me just remind you of something that you said to this Tribunal on the 25th of September of 2006 in the case of Bizimungu and others.  And you said at page 34 in the English, 
line 37, "I listened to the national radio station which broadcast on FM.  From time to time I would listen to radio RTLM up to -- with regard to the national radio, up to when there was no longer electricity supply.  And then, I simply listened to radio RTLM because the FM frequency was off the air.  So, I could listen with great difficulty to the shortwaves, because the sound was not clear, but I could listen to the RTLM.  And it came a time when the -- the batteries on my radio set ran out and I no longer listened to any radio." 

Which is correct, Witness, what you said in September or what you are saying today? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel for the Prosecution, did I mention the month when the battery run out?  That was in June.  But the crucial moment, April, May, I was listening.  Those were the crucial moments.  
Q.	In those crucial moments you say, Witness, and yet you told us not very long ago that you only heard the Préfet Renzaho once on the radio, on the 12th of April. 
A.	Very well, I did say that.  That was the only announcement made by the préfet, Renzaho that I -- I heard clearly.  The only one.  
Q.	You told us a moment ago that you were able to inform the Court about events in Kigali because people came and told you things between April and July.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I say yes, but I'll go further to add something which I did not say earlier on.  There were other sources of information, apart from the newspapers which were no longer in print.  People would say what they saw.  And you know, I'll tell you a story, Counsel for the Prosecutor:  In Rwanda there is another source of information, it is very funny, it is called, "Street Radio".  Street Radio. 
Q.	But, Witness, didn't you tell this Tribunal in the case of Zigiranyirazo in March of this year that what you learnt about the events from April to July you learnt a few months afterwards?  Do you not recall saying that in March of this year? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I think that is a generalisation.  I was referring to some facts which were brought to my knowledge later, but I did not say that generally I didn't learn of -- I got to know everything subsequently.  Maybe you should be reading the question and answer.  But to read between the lines or take a little extract will not satisfy the Chamber.  
Q.	Well, that's for them to decide, isn't it, Witness?  But let me just remind you of what you said on Tuesday, 13th of March 2007, in the Zigiranyirazo case.  I'm reading from page 9 of the English, page -- line 19.  And this is in answer to a question from Judge Khan who suggested that you conducted your research on whatever you learned from the media.  And you answered, "It is true that I conducted research from what I heard because I could not imagine or invent things, and at that specific point in time I could not even get out of my house.  It was forbidden for people to go out doors.  All the information I gathered was a few months afterwards." 

Do you remember saying that, Witness? 
A.	You are reading the transcripts in English.  Well, I don't want to tire you out, but this answer does not cover the totality of my knowledge.  That is what I saw, that is what I heard.  Well, it is the only means -- yes? 
Q.	All right, Witness, let me remind you also of something you said, and I'll do this in French if you prefer, in the case of Semanza on the 11th of February 2002, reading from the French page 59, line 14:  "All I managed to hear was only late or after -- after, but it would have been extraordinary if I had left my house even by two metres". 

Do you remember saying that in 2002? 
A.	It is still extraordinary.  There were times when I could not even take two steps, it is true.  In the other trials, as you read, I managed to get out.  This is not a question I'm putting to you, because you are the ones asking the questions.  Do you think, Counsel for the Prosecution, that it's just enough to see -- to see and hear? Are two senses that feed our brain -- hear, to hear and to see? Even if I were blind, I would've heard because I could hear.  And I believe that the Chamber admits that the witness testifies to what he saw with his own eyes and what he heard.  If testimony were limited to what one had seen, no one would have believed Jesus Christ because we didn't see him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is anxious to finish this testimony so that we do not create any problems to the witness.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You've given general evidence, Witness, about roadblocks, the people who manned them and what happened at them, but it's right again, isn't it, that you only saw one roadblock between April and July 4th, 1994, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, indeed the roadblock that was located 50 metres from my house was not the exception, and it is representative of all the other roadblocks and I requested the Chamber a while ago not to focus on the Chamber's -- on the roadblocks -- but that the offences were perpetrated in the houses when they were searching.  Because these roadblocks once they were erected, people didn't even go through them.  What for?  Yes. 
Q.	The answer is:  Yes, you only saw one roadblock during that three-month period? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You left Rwanda on the 8th of October of 1994 and you sought asylum in Belgium, didn't you? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Yet you're a Tutsi from the royal family.  What is the conflict that you have with the present 
regime -- or the regime, at least in October 1994, that made you feel you should seek political asylum in Belgium? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe that this Tribunal has records of my interview.  All the reasons that I advanced in Belgium were accepted pursuant to the Geneva Convention, so I obtained political asylum and then Belgian nationality.  

I just want to request permission of the Chamber and from you, from you, if you see the flow of Tutsis into Belgium in their hundreds, you'd be surprised, and then you'll understand that the regime is not as good as you think for all persons, including Tutsis, beginning with those who supported the RPF, like Mr. Valens, who has sought asylum in the United States, and so on and so forth.
Q.	Witness, it is because of your close acquaintance with members of the former -- one might say genocidal regime, people like Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Not at all.  Family relation, no, friends -- a friend yes, but that wouldn't be any reason for me to apply for political asylum.  This regime, which is a problem for me and a problem for everyone, everyone will advance the reasons that led him to apply for political asylum, if they are admissible, and if they meet the Geneva Conventions, yes.  There were some that were not accepted because their reasons did not stand the test, yes.  
Q.	You recall writing to him and referring to this Tribunal in that letter as that "damned Tribunal" that was seeking him? 
A.	Yes, yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I see that is a piece of paper that goes from Chamber to Chamber, a letter to Mathieu Ngirumpatse talking about the "damn Tribunal".  Yes, I see what you're talking about.  And if you want -- and if you want me to explain, I'll do so, or you cut and paste the same answer. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MS. MELLUISH:
I have no further questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Any re-examination? 
MR. NEKUIE:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you for having come to Arusha to testify and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
I would also like to thank the Chamber for welcoming me and for the general atmosphere, which is friendly, quite honestly.  Thank you very much.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then continue in the afternoon with Witness BIT - P -
MR. MATEMANGA:
PPO.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, just to enable the section to put the witness in contact with the Accused, can you issue orders to that effect? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If there is such a wish from any of them, that would certainly be organised by the WVSS in conformity with normal practice.  

Witness PPO's cross-examination, how long will that be? 
MS. MELLUISH:
I don't think more than an hour, certainly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that's the case, and this is the last witness for this week, we can have a lunch break to 3 o'clock.  

The Court is adjourned till 3 o'clock. 
(Court recessed from 1306H to 1503H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, welcome back, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now hear your cross-examination.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, although not every question will require a closed session, given the position of this witness, I think it might be preferable if we conduct the whole of the cross-examination in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see we have a few visitors in the gallery.  Could you start with just a few questions.  
MS. MELLUISH:
I'll try, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
WITNESS PPO (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, you confirmed the details on a personal information sheet earlier.  You didn't, however, include on that your ethnicity.  It's right, isn't it, that you're a Hutu? 
A.	Yes, I am a Hutu by birth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And as you would have noted, the Bench is sitting under 15 bis this afternoon because 
Judge Arrey had to leave for an urgent matter.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, you said that you went home on the evening of the 6th of April and you remained there until the following morning.  And it's right, isn't it, Witness, that apart from a telephone call from a driver, you didn't have any contact with Renzaho or the préfectoral office until -- from that time until the end of April, did you? 
A.	My apologies, could you please repeat your question?  I did not understand it well.  
Q.	After the telephone call you said you received from your driver on the evening of the 6th of April, you didn't have any contact with either the defendant or PVK until the end of April, did you? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Up until I returned to PVK.  
Q.	So, it's right, isn't it, that if indeed, as you said, the préfet's car had been in the garage on the 6th of April, you wouldn't know, would you, whether it was repaired and fully working by the morning of the 7th? 
A.	Yes, I wouldn't be able to make such a statement because the vehicle was in the garage throughout the day of the 6th, and after the 6th I did not go back to the office, so I do not know whether the vehicle was repaired or not.  
Q.	Now, when you were examined in chief, you said that you spent three to four days at a primary school and then about two weeks at a place called Remera groupement.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that from the 7th of April 1994 I spent a few days, three or four, at the Remera primary school.  Then I changed places, I went to a place called Remera groupement where I spent around two weeks; that is correct.  
Q.	So if that is correct, you couldn't possibly have got back to PVK by the 18th, could you? 
A.	I did not say that I returned to PVK on the 18th of April, I said that I went back to PVK around the 28th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the English version was first that you arrived at PVK late April, and then we heard in English the 18th April.  Are you saying that is not what you said in French? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, it is perhaps a misinterpretation:  I said that I went back to PVK towards the end of April.  I was asked to be more specific, and I said between the 28th and the 30th of April.  
MS. MELLUISH:
Thank you, Witness.  

Now I'm afraid, Your Honour, we do have to close.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will have to close this session in order to protect the identity of the witness.  So, if those in the public gallery could leave us.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 46 to 54] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
