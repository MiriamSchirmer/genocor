P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

I will come back with a couple of questions in relation to what happened yesterday a bit later, but now you have the floor, Mr. Moses.  

Good morning, Mr. Renzaho. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
THARCISSE RENZAHO,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, yesterday we were ending -- we were talking about roadblocks.  We'll try and finish that topic quite quickly.  Do you recall -- there was a speaker on Radio Rwanda on the 19th of April? 
MR. MOSES:
It's in P. 52, I won't show it to the Accused.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	He was referring to the listeners the fact that you had had a meeting with pharmacists.  Do you remember?  Did you have such a meeting with pharmacists?  I don't need to know the details about the meeting, but do you agree that you had such a meeting?  
A.	Yes, it was at the time we were trying to reorganise our various technical services to help them -- the citizenry.  
Q.	Now, the speaker had said that Préfet Renzaho asked the pharmacists not to be discouraged, but to continue importing essential drugs as usual.  And that "Concerning the war our country is experiencing now, Préfet Renzaho called, once again, on the residents of Kigali town to step up their efforts in order to ensure their security, manning roadblocks, and conducting night patrols to prevent the enemy infiltrations".  

I just need to know whether you agree that you made such a call for the people to do those things. 
A.	Counsel, not once, several times I said that, because the situation was ambivalent.  There was the war and there was people's safety -- 
Q.	I'm sorry, I am going to start interrupting you a bit now, because all I needed to know was that you had said such a thing -- and thank you for answering that.  

Mr. Renzaho, can you assist the Trial Chamber in what instructions you gave the people as to do with infiltrators if they found them? 
A.	The instructions -- the orders were clear.  I think, in one of the messages I delivered, you can find those instructions.  I asked that people who were suspect, after being checked, be handed over to the authorities for appropriate legal proceedings -- judicial proceedings.  I think you'll find it one of the messages I delivered.  
Q.	I'm sure your counsel will refer us all to it if it so exists.  But the reason I'm interested in that, Mr. Renzaho, is why you'd be making such a comment if, as according to you, those structures didn't exist. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know which structures you're referring to.
Q.	The legal ones that you say you were going to have the persons go through.
A.	Counsel, I think you're referring to the message of the 19th of April 1994, if I'm not mistaken.  Allow me to inform you that it was right after the outbreak of hostilities the judicial apparatus, more or less, disappeared, but the préfecture tried to help them to resume their activities.  By the 19th of April, what is certain is that those structures were not yet operational.  
Q.	So, you're asking the population to arrest infiltrators, but, according to you, there are no such structures in place to deal with arrests? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the situation was such that the people were committed and facing up to RPF-troops incursion -- by their side.  There was the defence apparatus of the army -- and the people who could be arrested should be taken to the army's military defence structure.  The army could take care of those people and then transfer them to places where the war had not reached.  But, I don't see the connection between the fact that people were being attacked and what you are, in contrast, saying that the judicial apparatus didn't exist.  So, what were we to do? 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, I'm suggesting to you that what happened is that all persons who were "infiltrators", namely, the Tutsi civilians, were killed.  They weren't arrested at all.  And that nowhere have you, in fact, in the transcripts said that infiltrators are to be arrested.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, that is your opinion.  You can't propose people or names to me among those who were killed.  The infiltrators are a fact.  From April to July, I can show you a whole series of UNAMIR reports referring to infiltrators.  They had observers -- military officers observing, and you knew what was happening.  
Q.	All right, now, in respect of the requirement for laissez-passers and identity cards at the roadblocks, 
I believe you accepted yesterday that you had, as is recorded in various transcripts, given speeches on the radio to confirm that those documents were required.  
A.	And as far as that is concerned, I don't see where the crime is.  The documents were official, established by law.  The law hadn't been changed; that was the practice current not only in Kigali, but throughout the country. 
Q.	Well, I'll take that as a "yes".  
MR. MOSES:
And I'm just wondering if, very briefly, Madam Registrar can show to you P. 63, and in the French, it's the top two paragraphs of page 3.  In the English, it's on page 2, the fourth paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is in which volume?  
MR. MOSES:
It's in volume 2, Your Honours. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which tab? 
MR. MOSES:
Seventeen. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thanks.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, have you got the top of page 3? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I am on page 3.  
Q.	And if you read the first two paragraphs to yourself, do you confirm that that is one of the times that you spoke about the requirements for laissez-passers and identity cards? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I confirm what I just said:  These documents were current practice in Rwanda; it wasn't specific to the period April to July, 1994 -- 
Q.	I'm sorry to interrupt you again.  All I wanted to know is that what is recorded there is what you said.  
It's all I need to know.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, can I ask you for a small dispensation?  A favour?  I'm here to defend myself.  It's been years now I've been waiting for the opportunity to defend myself.  Now I'm here -- it's four years I've been here.  Now that I have the opportunity to defend myself, you don't want me to do so?  
I don't understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, the Chamber is in total control here, and we are ensuring that you are given ample opportunity to defend yourself.  But, at the same time we must also be certain that we get what we need in an efficient way, and that we avoid repetition or explanations that will not necessarily lead to a result.  

Now, Mr. Moses, P. 63.  
MR. MOSES:
P. 63. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, that's good.  

What is your next question?

MR. MOSES:
All I wanted was a confirmation from the witness that that's what he said on that occasion.  It's as far as I want to take it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, did you say what is written in the transcripts here?  Is that a correct reflection of what you said on that occasion?  That is the question now. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I can't absolutely be certain that it's a faithful transcription.  But what is sure is that we always talked about those travel documents, which were usual in Rwanda.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, forgive me.  

Mr. Renzaho, do you have this document before you?  Is it the document in question -- the paragraphs in question, are they, indeed, before you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he spoke of number 3 -- page 3.  I think that the pages K036832 -- 732, K0368732.
MR. CANTIER:
And perhaps the Prosecution could specify the date of the document?  It might not -- it might be of use.  
MR. MOSES:
It's already on the record, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you repeat the date for the benefit of Maître Cantier, so that we are all absolutely certain about that?  
MR. MOSES:
18th of June 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this reference to laissez-passers, do you recall having made such a reference, Mr. Renzaho? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, yes, and I issued such at the préfecture. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you.  And just also finally, briefly, in this same document, can I refer you to the end of that -- or, towards the end of that same speech, and it is on page 10 of that document in the French, K0368739, the third and fourth paragraphs in the French.  And in the English, it is on page 7, the fourth and 
fifth paragraphs.  

Do you have the paragraphs there, Mr. Renzaho?  The first paragraphs commences with the words, 
"Il faut que ces jeunes".
MR. PRESIDENT:
"Those youths must follow".  

And the answer? 
THE WITNESS:
The third paragraph, "Il faut que ces jeunes suivent bon conseil."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Those young people must follow the good advice".
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you.  Can you just read those two following paragraphs, and the only question I need you to answer is whether you agree that that is what you said on that occasion? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, it's quite possible.  I don't -- my mind -- my memory is not like that of a computer that recalls exactly what I said, but it would not be foreign to what I would say.  
Q.	All right, thank you for that.  

Now, Mr. Renzaho, bearing in mind that you have told us that you did make it a requirement for persons to obtain travel documents from the préfectoral office, and bearing in mind that was at a time -- and at times when you were aware that Tutsi were being targeted at roadblocks, it would have been very apparent to you that the only people who could safely get to the préfectoral office were those with Hutu identity cards.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you were not in Kigali -- and if you'll allow me to tell you what was happening, I will tell you, but if you want me to bow to your reasoning, I cannot do so.  

What you're saying takes no account of the situation, because in view -- it was because of the lack of security that led the people since the end of -- the end of 1993, the feeling of insecurity was permanent.  We had centres for refugees -- sheltering refugees.  People who felt threatened, in danger, felt obliged to flee, to seek refuge somewhere, and that's what I tried to explain here.  I think that arbitrarily to analyse the situation without taking into due account of the context, as you are doing, 
Mr. Prosecutor -- well, I'm very sorry, but the result is to transform the reality that we experienced.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, this is a good example, Mr. Renzaho.  Now, you were allowed to develop your reasoning in connection with that question, but it didn't really answer the question.

The only people who could safely get to the préfectoral office were those with Hutu identity cards.  
Is that correct or is it not correct?  Now, what is your view in relation to that question, please? 

THE WITNESS:
My point of view is not to -- I wouldn't state it categorically as such.  What I just said is to show that most Tutsi were afraid to go very far; they sought safe places to take shelter.  But, I'm not saying that at the préfecture I did not receive Tutsi to whom I did not issue documents and who went away again.  
So, the situation isn't as cut and dried as the -- as he was trying to put it.  
JUDGE ARREY:
But you do agree, Mr. Renzaho, that given the situation at the time it was difficult for the Tutsis to come to the préfecture to get the travel documents? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I agree -- I agree fully, but what I'm speaking of there reflects -- was to seek shelter somewhere.  So the general trend was not to wander around the town.  Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And by reason of these roadblocks that were established, those Tutsis who remained in their houses became sitting ducks and were easy targets to be killed, weren't they? 
A.	I've told you we made efforts to defend the sites we had identified.  Now, did all the people who seek -- who sought refuge go to those sites or did they seek shelter with third parties?  Certainly, there are some who went to seek shelter with third parties.  But, I can't tell you that I gave an order to him or her to go here or there.  

You have to take account of what happened -- what was happening at the time in the context of that war -- unless, you want to accuse me of having triggered the events.  But I experienced them while deploring them with all the citizenry of Kigali préfecture.  I wasn't responsible for it.  If lightning struck us, would I be the one who ordered it?  What would be our relative responsibility -- all of us here, in such a case?  I couldn't have foreseen it, and that was the situation at the time.  It's very regrettable; it was a tragedy.  Thank you. 
Q.	Well, the context in Kigali, Mr. Renzaho, is that in April, May and June, it was unsafe for Tutsis to remain in their houses because they were being targeted by reason of their ethnicity.  Do you agree with that general proposition -- nothing to do with you at this stage, but just that general proposition? 
A.	In general terms, that was the situation, but you heard the testimony of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover); that wasn't just talk.  So, the situation was complex, but, in general terms, that was the situation.  
Q.	Right -- and do you agree with what Dr. Des Forges said, that as opposed to the rest of the country, in Kigali it was slightly safer for Tutsis to go to centres because Kigali was the capital, and there was some international focus on some of those centres? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I'm very embarrassed to answer that.  It's very embarrassing and, once more, I will beg you to allow me to answer -- to give me a few moments to answer correctly that assertion - if you would allow me to do so.  If you don't, then I would say merely that the assertion, as Madam Des Forges made it, would be pertinent had it come from someone who'd lived through the events with us in Kigali.  Books -- we've read; we know what they say.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a reference to a name at 09:18:54. 
MR. MOSES:
I believe he gave evidence without a pseudonym. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is Prosecution witness -- no, this is Defence witness 15, isn't it?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, but my recollection was that he waived his witness protection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, can you confirm that he waived his witness protection? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I would need to check that in the instance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My impression, according to the registry note, Mr. Matemanga, is that he did not.  

I think we have to place that under separate cover.  And, let me also say that the spelling of that name was different from what we heard, and I will provide the right spelling to those concerned, and it will then be placed under seal.  

Thank you very much, Defence.  

May I ask you, while you are still on your feet I want now to come back to that floating issue from yesterday, which I indicated at the beginning of the session.  

Maître Cantier, you referred to a particular bourgmestre in your examination-in-chief on Thursday, the 30th of August.  And the sentence reads:  "Do you know or did you know the bourgmestre of..." 
And then we have phonetically "Buturimbi".  Can you help us with the exact term there, what was really your reference there? 
MR. CANTIER:
It was Bicumbi -- Bicumbi, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's number 33 on the Defence list, thank you.  

Then a question to you, Mr. Renzaho, you were asked about the massacres committed by the RPF on the Hutu population, and there was then a sequence where you referred to the arrival at the préfecture of the bourgmestre of...and then we have the "Muhazi" commune.  Is that what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I spoke of Muhazi commune.  M-U-H-A -- shall I spell it?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could it be number 302 on the Defence spelling list, Maître Cantier?  

M-U-H-A-Z-I, is that the right pronunciation or spelling, Mr. Renzaho? 
THE WITNESS:
Quite, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then followed a new sentence, you said:  "He had passed through all the..." and we have "Musubichumbu" communes.  Can you just say what you said there, please, help us with the spellings? 
THE WITNESS:
I spoke of "Bicumbi" commune. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is number 33, and that's that, thank you very much.

Now, we can continue.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You told KZ -- Witness KZ in early May to send the refugees at Saint Paul's back home, didn't you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, no -- that I never said to anyone.  
Q.	You'll agree that if, in fact, you had said such a thing, it would -- as some witnesses have described -- amounted to a death sentence for such persons? 
A.	Yes, and I was quite convinced of that, and I could not do so because at the same time, on various occasions, I was helping people to leave where they were for safer gathering points.  
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting to you that when witness KZ said he could not do so such a thing, you said to him in French, the expression, "Je m'en fous", "I don't care", and you hung up the telephone on him.  

You find it funny, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	Non. 
Q.	Good.
A.	No, I don't find it amusing.  It's a very serious thing -- that it's all the more serious that such a lie could be asserted by a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  I will tell you I never saw that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) before I saw him here in this court -- that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  Please understand that.  And he never called me on the telephone.  That's it. 
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps, Your Honours, to be safe the last part of that answer should be placed under seal.  In the context that the question was asked; it could lead to an identification.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The profession, yes, even if there are many persons holding that profession, the context calls for caution, so all references in that answer to the profession of the person will be placed under seal.  

Video booth, please do not transmit this. 

Mr. Moses.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I want to move on to another topic now, and that's the issue of civil defence.  You said in your evidence-in-chief that there was no civil defence programme implemented in Kigali during 
April, May and June.  That's correct, isn't it?  That was your evidence? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  
Q.	And you had referred to you, but were not shown, correspondence between General Nsabimana and yourself from the -- dated the 30th and 31st of March respectively?  
A.	That is correct.  
MR. MOSES:
I'm wondering if Madam Registrar could please show to the witness, Prosecution Exhibit 24.  It's in the first bundle of documents at tab 19.  
(Pages 1 to 9 by Jean Baigent)












0930H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page?  
MR. MOSES: 
I'll be going through both page 1 and 2.  It's just a two-page document.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you're -- you're familiar with that document, aren't you, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, this is a report that was written by the general chief of staff of the Rwandan army.  Yes, I know this document.  
Q.	Concerning a meeting held on the 29th of March 1994 with persons including yourself, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And concerning a civil defence programme? 
A.	That is correct.  But the civil defence programme was not implemented.  
Q.	And the document's headed "très secret", "very secret", correct?  
A.	I have worked in the army, and such documents are always classified top secret; that is customary.  Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And that's because it was an illegal programme, wasn't it?  
A.	I don't know what you mean by "illegal".  The report is for the minister of national defence and the members of the government.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, the Arusha Accords didn't allow for such training of persons and arming of civilians, did it?  
A.	The Arusha Accords, since you are referring to them -- may I, in light of the specific question you have put to me, elaborate on the issue and try to tell you what I'm aware of regarding this matter?  
Q.	Witness, all I want to know from you at this stage is whether you agree or disagree that the Arusha Accords allowed for such a programme.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can't answer yes to a question whether you agree or disagree.  You must choose.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, he put a specific question to me, were -- "Did the Arusha Accords prohibit military training?"  And my answer was yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When the question is summarised that way, the answer is clear.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And the meeting and programme agreed on was hidden from the prime minister, also, wasn't it?  The prime minister wasn't copied into that correspondence.  
A.	I don't know about that.  The person concerned was the general chief of staff who sent the report to his minister.  Now, on this matter, if you're not aware of it, let me tell you that during the said period there was a restricted security council with a number of ministers, and this council was headed by the prime minister.  I thank you.  
Q.	At paragraph 4 in that letter, "The operational cells were to be assigned to search for and neutralise infiltrators."  "Neutralise" means kill them, doesn't it?  
A.	No.  I never heard that the definition of neutralise in the dictionary was to kill.  One can neutralise somebody or something using different means.  I thank you.  
Q.	If it meant arrest, you would -- it would have said "arrest", wouldn't it?  
A.	Arrest is one stage in a series of measures that might be undertaken.  For example, someone is arrested -- or, one can arrest somebody if one has information on that person.  So one has to get the information, one has to locate that person, and then decide to arrest that person.  So I believe there are a number of concurrent measures, and the idea here was to prevent the infiltrators from reaching the objective they had, that is to say, to kill and to sabotage.  

And for the period under consideration -- we are referring to the 31st.  On the 31st, precisely, Gatumba was murdered in the Bilyogo secteur by the RPF agents, and this created problems.  There was a riot within the population.  Subsequently three people were killed, and many Tutsis had to flee the secteur in order to seek refuge at Nyamirambo.  I thank you.  
Q.	Well, I'll put to one side at the moment that it's reporting on a meeting of the 29th, not a meeting of the 31st.  But I would now ask you to look at paragraph 7 where it states that "MINADEF and MININTER will be contacted so as to make weapons available for distribution to selected civilian personnel."  MININTER was the department that you were seconded to, wasn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And we've heard a good deal of evidence that weapons were provided after the 6th of April, both from the préfecture office and MINADEF, haven't we?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, we have heard -- I have heard, just as you have, and other parties here in the Trial Chamber, people saying such things.  But in order to corroborate this charge, you brought AFB before me.  And I was able to prove the validity of such an allegation.  Who knows whether there's any basis to these allegations?  That is what I have tried to demonstrate.  I thank you.  
Q.	And at paragraph 10 of that document, it's suggested that the pop -- "The bourgmestres instruct the population in traditional weapons:  Swords, spears, machetes, bows and arrows."  These were the weapons of choice, weren't they, Mr. Renzaho, for civilians killing innocent Tutsis in Kigali from April to July 1994?  
A.	First of all, we are referring to a document which is describing a project, Counsel for the Prosecution, a project which was never implemented.  So let us not mix up matters here. 
Q.	You'll agree with me, won't you, Mr. Renzaho, that use of a machete could have no legitimate use against -- to defend the civilian population against the RPF, who were well armed with guns, and well trained, from what some Defence witnesses have said.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I see that you are going to the heart of the matter:  The war.  And some things need to be taken into account.  First of all, the tools you are referring to, the machetes, et cetera, are tools that were customarily used by any Rwandan family.  And people were used -- people would use them for their domestic work and for other purposes.  Now, whether we are dealing with other objectives here, that is secondary.  The Rwandan population is a population of farmers.  They would work in the fields, they would look for firewood, so these were tools that were customarily used by Rwandan families.  

And with regard to the war you are referring to, this is proof that these people did not have anything else to defend themselves.  If there had been such a distribution of weapons and large-scale training of youths, and if the youths had been provided with weapons, why would people have resorted to the use of machetes and clubs in order to defend themselves?  So that is the situation that is in contradiction with the allegations which, to my mind, have been set up after the events.  It is a vision, with hindsight, of the events that took place in Rwanda.  So, of course, one can imagine any -- anything that was not possible at the time when the events broke out in the country.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that it's quite clear that the use of such traditional tools for work would only be of use if your work was the killing of innocent civilians, unarmed civilians.  
A.	Absolutely not.  You're not going to bring back the Rwandan tragedy to only the events between -- in April of 1994, a time during which populations tried to protect their hill, their village.  It started from the 1990s -- 1991 up to 1994.  So people erected roadblocks, people organised patrols using the implements they had at home.  I do not know whether, in 1991 or in 1992, there were deaths.  But I do know that in the Kayonza commune, and in the Kigarama commune, which is my commune of origin, RPF fighters were arrested by the populations, you see.  So I believe that people will use the tools that are available to them in order to protect themselves if they don't have anything else.  Thank you.  
Q.	And -- 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Mr. Renzaho, I would still like to have your comments on this paragraph, because I have listened to the explanations you have given.  It is true that those are the traditional tools that are used in Rwanda, like most parts of Africa.  But in this context, it goes on to say, "Because of the insufficiency of arms, the population should be encouraged to use these other tools as weapons."  So what do you have to say about that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, what I'm saying is that the interpretation you're making is correct, because this is a matter for the whole country, and people would do their best in order to ensure the monitoring of the area in which they were.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, the procedure that would be adopted by yourself, if you wanted weapons, would be to contact MINADEF to obtain weapons.  You'll agree that that is the procedure that would be undergone prior to April 1994? 
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution.  The procedure I should have adopted in order to request for weapons -- and I did so for the police -- would have been to write to the minister of the interior requesting for him to intervene at the level of the government and his defence counterpart in order to request such -- to ask for such weapons.  

Regarding the weapons for the police -- and there is existing correspondence on the subject -- we mentioned the problems we had to provide weapons to all of the policemen in the préfecture.  Because out of 250 policemen, as I stated here, only 100 or so had firearms.  And our wish was to provide firearms to all of them.  There has been an exchange of correspondence with the ministry of the interior which was not able to provide all the weapons we needed to us.  So this is the procedure.  
Q.	If you look at Prosecution Exhibit -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are moving on to a new exhibit now.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we leave this exhibit, Mr. Renzaho, you had a general remark in relation to one of the questions where you have to help me.  You said that, first of all, you have to bear in mind that this is a project which was never implemented.  Please explain what you mean by that.  Because if you look at the first paragraph here, this is a letter which seems to convey conclusions following a meeting by a group chaired by Major General Nsabimana, and where the prefect of Kigali and the operational commander of Kigali were all present.  And the purpose of the meeting was to refine the plan of self-defence; that follows from the first and second paragraph.  

And then you will note wordings as, in the third paragraph, "The meeting decided as follows".  So this seems to be decisions to be followed.  In view of that wording, what did you mean by saying that this was not implemented?  Could you explain that, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  What I mean, quite simply, is that the conclusions that are being conveyed to the ministry of defence by the general chief of staff was to (unintelligible) a number of decisions being taken by the government.  And only those decisions could provide an implementation framework for this civil defence system.  There was the need for a law, or at least a presidential act or decree, to establish the framework.  The resources also had to be earmarked.  It was -- would have been necessary to call the reservists to duty.  

And, in the example I gave, there should have been, for example, the definition of defence sectors in the vicinity of the Kigali préfecture because of the military camps or groupings that were here and there in the vicinity of Kigali.  So it was a programme which was not implemented as of the 6th of April of 1994.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
I'm wondering if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 17.  It's under tab 11 of the first bundle of Prosecution exhibits.  It's a letter from the Accused to the minister of defence dated 4th March 1992.  

Well, perhaps if I can ask questions.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you recall writing to the minister of defence asking for arms, and authorisation to carry arms, for a number of your conseillers and bourgmestres?  
A.	Yes, indeed, I do remember it.  I did send that letter, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	So at least on that occasion, you'll agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that you requested arms from the ministry of defence.  
A.	Yes, I did, and I did after consulting with the minister of the interior in view of the insecurity in which these administrative officials were living.  And they had expressed the wish to be protected.  And it is the normal way of going about it when one is to -- asking for a weapon to be lent, one must first be authorised to have such a weapon.  And that authorisation was given by the ministry of national defence.  There was a specific department to that effect.  And the same department lent the -- the conseillers and the bourgmestres -- I believe there were 20 or so, 20 or 21 people -- lent them these weapons for a specific period, and they were to give the weapons back once the situation would have improved.  So that was the situation.  
Q.	That's not what the letter says, is it?  
A.	In the letter, unless my memory fails me -- I don't have the letter here in front of me -- but I believe that that letter was seeking authorisation for these persons to have weapons, and was also requesting that weapons be lent to them for the period we are referring to.  And I received the support of the minister of the interior, because we had discussed the matter together beforehand.  And he was the one who asked his counterpart to settle this matter.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The letter is now being placed in front of you, Mr. Renzaho.  Any particular part of it you want to refer to?  
THE WITNESS: 
What I wish to say is that, in this letter, there is the confirmation of what I stated.  We asked, for people who were within the population and were exposed to insecurity, that they be authorised to have a weapon, and that the ministry of defence lend them a firearm.  And the minister of the interior supported this request because we had discussed it beforehand.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Can you please point out to the Trial Chamber where it refers to "lend"?  

And secondly -- well, in the same answer could you perhaps indicate, bearing in mind you'd requested -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could the Prosecution kindly repeat his question, for the benefit of the booth?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are now asking, Mr. Moses, where the word "lend" is found.  Isn't that in the first sentence, last line?  "That your department lend a firearm to these people."  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Was that letter copied to the minister of interior?  
A.	My apologies.  We had talked about the principle -- earlier on we had talked about the general situation in our presentation.  It was on the basis of that discussion that the minister gave me the authorisation to send me this letter, because he had already discussed the matter with his counterpart from the national defence.  So this is how things happened.  Thank you.  
Q.	All right.  And you'll have also seen letters from the prime minister and the minister of the interior, which were dated the 25th of May 1994, that was sent to all préfets regarding civil defence.  Do you accept that you received such documents, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	I saw the said documents after I left the country.  This to show you how difficult it was for me to make contact with governmental services, yes, I did indeed, afterwards, see the directive of the prime minister on defence, and the implementation letter of the ministry of the interior regarding the same directives.  But I saw them after I left.  
Q.	And when you saw the letter from the minister of the interior dated 25 May, do you recall having read that he had written to all préfets on the 25th of May saying that the préfets should establish lists of people who have received or should receive firearms, including their names, et cetera.  Do you recall that that was in the letter?  
A.	Yes, I did see this mentioned in the letter, that is true, but the letter reached me belatedly.  
Q.	And it's fair to say that that is indicative of the fact that the government had already arranged for the distribution of firearms to some people prior to that date.  Do you agree with that?  
A.	I can only talk about Kigali town where I was throughout the events.  I am not aware of what was happening elsewhere.  As far as I'm concerned, if you put questions -- specific questions to me on the second phase -- and perhaps this should indeed be a question that should be put to me, because I believe it would enable the Trial Chamber to better understand the defence situation.  But I can testify to what I was a witness to in Kigali, thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- 
MR. MOSES: 
I'm wondering if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 54.  It's tab -- under tab 8 of the second bundle of exhibits.  It's from the 22nd of April.  And I'm, in the English, looking at page 14, and in the French it's page 20, the third paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you place on record what this is while we are finding the document.  
MR. MOSES: 
It's a Radio Rwanda broadcast from the 22nd of April, where the Accused introduces an officer who's an -- he says has been appointed to work with him, to help coordinate the efforts of the population and operations by the military.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, do you recall introducing on the radio, on the 22nd of April 1994, an R -- FAR officer by the name of Esdras Mushimiyimana, M-U-S-H-I-M-I-Y-I-M-A-N-A? 
A.	I do not recall having done so, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Well, you've got the transcript there, Mr. Renzaho.  Don't you recall taking the opportunity to introduce the officer who had been appointed -- and I'm reading from paragraph 2 of the French -- of the English -- "to work with me.  He is going to help you and me to coordinate the efforts of the population and the operations by the military."  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I can see this transcript, but is the date correct?  And, besides, I do not know that person.  That is quite clear.  I need to be given clarifications on that person, and Major Bivamvagara that I received at the préfecture -- wouldn't that be Bivamvagara?  Because Bivamvagara's name was Patrice.  So somewhere I believe there is some confusion, and I don't understand.  
Q.	Well, can you help the Trial Chamber understand also, Mr. Renzaho, because this same exhibit, and a passage from it, was put to you by the Defence in the evidence-in-chief, and you conceded that it was you on the radio at that point in time.  
A.	Well, I am entitled to wonder whether it is indeed the date of the 22nd, because on the 22nd I had no reserve officer who had been called to duty at the préfecture.  There are official documents.  There is the telegram which was calling the reservists to duty, and which was dated 1st of May.  And that is what I stated before the Trial Chamber.  
Q.	You see, in the paragraph where, after you have introduced the officer, he introduces himself, and he says, "We will be working together to see how we can improve on the civil defence system in the course of the meetings that I will soon be having with you."  Do you see that, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, I see it, but that's not the question, that's not the problem.  The problem is, first of all I didn't see this person, nor do I see that particular role at that time.  But if you'll allow me just an instant, I will give you a small explanation.  Am I allowed to do so?  

Right.  On the 22nd of May -- 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, before you go further, you have talked about the 22nd of May.  So that there is no mistake, this document is from the 22nd of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And staff -- 
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Hold on.  This earthquake meeting.  I saw that persons are requested to be seated there around 10:15.  So we should now not get into a very long sequence.  

But let -- there is time to clarify one issue, and that's the date of this document.  You have mentioned the 22nd.  But if you look at page 5 of the English version, and it's the same in French with another page numeration, of course, reference is made to something being read out and apparently dated the 24th of April.  So Mr. Renzaho seems to be right in the sense that this transmission must be after the 22nd.  Do we have any other indications as to the exact time of this transmission?  Maybe that could be looked into.  
MR. MOSES: 
Can I point to, Your Honour, on page 15 of the English.  It starts "Your Excellencies, 15 days ago, to be precise, RPF resumed hostilities here in the city of Kigali."  So Your Honour is -- may be correct in terms of the transmission; I can't comment on that.  But in terms of that being a passage from the Accused, it's referring to "Fifteen days ago, to be precise, RPF resumed hostilities."  We know they started fighting again on the 7th.  That's where -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We now have, in the transcripts, exactly what we were about to start with, and we will do that on Monday morning at 8:45.  

Are there any practical issues that need to be sorted out before we end for today?  That doesn't seem to be the case.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1011H)
