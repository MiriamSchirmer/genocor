P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we start your testimony, we will enter the exhibits mentioned by the Defence yesterday.  

You did refer to, Defence, a statement to investigators dated the 25th of December 2000.  That is the first statement of Witness DBN.  But did you actually use it?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, since my colleague is not here, I must say that I am not able to answer that question.  I don't know if counsel for the Prosecution can assist me.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I don't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, those of us who have read the transcripts know the answer to my question.  But why don't we postpone this, then, to the return of Maître Cantier, who was actually involved in that exercise, and then we will start immediately with the witness.

Please remember the pause, madam.  It's very important to have a pause between question and answer, and answer and question, because there is a need for translation and transcription.  

Prosecution. 
CORINNE DUFKA,
having duly been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Ms. Dufka, could you tell the Court, please, what your profession was in 1994? 
A.	In 1994, I was a journalist with the Reuters news agency. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And speed.  And that goes to both of you.  

You must slow down, Ms. Melluish.  Please.  It's easy.  
And now the same goes for you.  All has to be interpreted and written down.  So just slow down.  We have this Tuesday.  Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	As at April 1994, for how long had you been doing this kind of work?  
A.	For about six years. 
Q.	And as a photo journalist, did you have any particular specialism?  
A.	Yes, I began photo journalism in El Salvador and covered Central America, and from there specialised in doing -- in covering armed conflicts. 
Q.	And as at April 1994, how many armed conflicts had you covered as a photo journalist?  
A.	I believe six or seven as of that date. 
Q.	Can you recall where you were at the beginning of May 1994? 
A.	Yes, at the beginning of May I was covering the elections in South Africa.  I had been covering the elections in South Africa from about the third week of April, and as of approximately May 1st or May 2nd -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's too fast.  We are losing parts of the French.  Please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Sorry.  

Should I begin the question (sic) again?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
From mid-April, I had been covering the elections in South Africa.  And on May 1st or 2nd, I flew from South Africa to Nairobi to begin covering the conflict in Rwanda. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And where in Rwanda did you cover the conflict?  
A.	In the -- from approximately May 1st to May 8th I flew to Tanzania to cover the exodus of some 250,000 Rwandan refugees into Tanzania, and briefly went into Rwanda at that time.  From May 10th I went into Rwanda through Burundi, up to Kigali, a trip I did on a subsequent time.  And after that I flew into Kigali from Nairobi, as of May 22nd.  And I stayed in Kigali from May 22nd to approximately the 3rd of July.  
Q.	So between May and the end of July you visited Kigali three times.  On the first occasion, how did you travel to Kigali?  
A.	On the first occasion I went overland from Burundi into Kigali. 
Q.	Did you travel alone, or with anyone else? 
A.	I travelled with a colleague at Reuters named Peter Smerdon; one other journalist, a British journalist; and then a Burundian driver whom we had contracted to take us into Rwanda from Bujumbura.  
Q.	And by what means did you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wait.  Reuter is R-E-U-T-E-R, and then the journalist whose first name was Peter, can you spell his last name, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  S-M-E-R-D, like David, O-N, like Nancy.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And if you can recall, in what kind of vehicle did you travel to Kigali? 
A.	Well, I went in two vehicles.  The first one was a small sedan that we contracted in Bujumbura, which took us through Butare, where we spent the first night, then Gitarama, where we spent the second night.  From there it was too dangerous to go with a private driver, so we had arranged -- we had received permission to travel into Kigali in Gitarama, and we went in the vehicle of a gendarme -- lieutenant, I believe.  
Q.	And how easy or difficult was it to travel from Butare to Kigali? 
A.	It was very, very tense because of numerous checkpoints which were manned by individuals in civilian dress, armed with various different types of weapons, who were often inebriated, very threatening, so it was extremely tense.  And the closer we got to Kigali, the more checkpoints we encountered. 
Q.	And, generally, what happened at these checkpoints when you got to them?  
A.	Well, generally the individuals manning the checkpoint would brandish whatever arms they had, which included firearms, AK47s, Uzi submachine guns, clubs that were studded with nails, knives, machetes, iron bars, pistols.  And they would ask who we were, they would sometimes point their guns directly at us.  And they often asked -- the first question that they often asked was whether we were Belgian.  They would go through our belongings, look over our passports.  So they were -- it was very frightening for us and they were -- I would consider them to be very intimidating and unprofessional for -- in the manner that they manned these checkpoints.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you now described your first trip.  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, my second trip was very similar.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But on this first occasion, we are then around the 10th of May?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's right.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And that first occasion lasted from the 10th of May until?  
THE WITNESS: 
The 14th or 15th of May.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And on that occasion, travelling to Kigali, did you ever feel personally threatened at a roadblock?  
A.	Well, I think all of the occupants of -- of the vehicle felt threatened, including the gendarme.  He was visibly shaken whilst passing through the checkpoints.  
Q.	Are you able to estimate how many roadblocks you passed through on the way to Kigali? 
A.	From the border in Burundi?  I would estimate approximately 50. 
Q.	And within Kigali?  
A.	The closer we got to Kigali from Gitarama, the more checkpoints there were.  But I can't -- I can't say how many in Kigali.  It's -- it's hard to estimate how many in Kigali there were because they were concentrated, actually, at the entrance -- or, in the kilometres coming up to Kigali.  
Q.	When you got to Kigali, were there any incidents that occurred at roadblocks that particularly stick in your mind? 
A.	That would have been on the second trip that I came in, where I travelled by myself.  I was the -- I didn't travel by myself, I was the only foreigner, the only Caucasian journalist travelling in a car.  I was travelling with a few local Rwandan journalists.  And I remember very distinctly coming to the first major checkpoint in Kigali where, upon arrival, an individual pulled out a very large pistol and put it to my head and said -- asked me if I was Belgian.  That was the first question that he asked.  And at which point other individuals surrounded the car, including -- I remember very clearly the image of a militiaman in a white doctor's coat that was visibly splattered with blood, and others who had clubs studded with nails, which I observed had some kind of flesh and hair on them.  So that was very frightening for me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was in the beginning of the second trip, which lasted from when to when?  
THE WITNESS: 
The second trip lasted from the -- the 18th of May to the 20th or 21st of May.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, just to go back to your first trip, where did you stay in Kigali, if you stayed there? 
A.	We were taken by the gendarme directly to the UNAMIR headquarters where we spent one or two nights, I can't recall exactly, at which point I flew out to be able to transmit my pictures in Nairobi.  
Q.	And can you recall briefly what you took pictures of on that occasion? 
A.	Yes.  I had taken pictures in a place called Kabgayi, which is near Gitarama, of a -- a place in which there were several thousand mostly Tutsis being -- who had taken refuge in this place.  And then later in Kigali I took a few pictures around the UNAMIR headquarters and of a few other things in the immediate vicinity of the UNAMIR headquarters.  I did not feel safe to go out on my own, or with a driver, and take pictures in general around Kigali.  
Q.	What about on the second occasion when you went to Kigali, between the 10th and 14th?  On that occasion did you also drive from Burundi, or did you come from another route? 
A.	The second occasion was from the 18th to approximately the 21st.  And on that occasion I drove as well from Bujumbura up to Kigali.  I spent the first night in Kabgayi, and then went to Gitarama, at which point I met a few local journalists with whom I then went into Kigali.  And it was a difficult decision whether or not to travel, given my first experience.  But I took the risk in part because I recall on May 19th, there had been the shelling of the Kigali hospital, allegedly by the RPF, which had resulted in numerous deaths of the injured and other -- others in the hospital.  So I thought that, as I passed through the checkpoints manned by the militia, that I would tell them I wanted to cover the shelling of the hospital, which I indeed did, because this was also a violation.  And I had anticipated that that would have led to some understanding, common ground, which would facilitate -- which would have facilitated my entry.  And that worked.  
Q.	On this second occasion, where in Kigali did you stay, if at all? 
A.	I stayed at UNAMIR headquarters again.  
Q.	And can you recall for how many nights you stayed there? 
A.	It was for -- for one or two nights.  
Q.	And did you go into Kigali to the hospital, as you said you wanted to? 
A.	Yes, I went first to the hospital and took photographs of the wounded and the destruction at the hospital.  And then I had heard about Tutsi refugees being inside the Sainte Famille church.  So I then asked the driver to take me to the Sainte Famille church to take pictures of the refugees inside of it.  
Q.	Before we get to your photographs, how -- you had a driver, you've mentioned.  Did you have anyone else in the vehicle with you?  
A.	From Gitarama to Kigali, I had a local journalist.  I cannot recall whether he went with me to -- to Sainte Famille church.  
Q.	When you were at Sainte Famille, did you take any photographs? 
A.	Yes, I did.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Could the registry please provide the book of photographs to the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you recognise these photographs? 
A.	Yes, these are all photographs that I took in Rwanda.  
Q.	Now, do you recall that -- there are, amongst these photographs, obviously some different scenes.  Are you able to recall when you took any of these particular photographs? 
A.	Yes.  The photographs of Sainte Famille reflect three different trips that I made to Sainte Famille church.  And I can recognise which ones I took on which trip. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
And all these visits took place during the second trip?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, they took place on three different trips.  The first trip to Sainte Famille took place approximately the 18th or 19th or 20th of May. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Lack of communication. 
THE WITNESS: 
Sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have described that you were in Rwanda on three occasions, in three periods.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mmm-hm.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the question now is simply, when you say that you visited Sainte Famille on three occasions, it would be useful to know whether these three occasions took place during that second round, or the second period, or whether the photographs relate to the three trips.  
THE WITNESS: 
They relate to two trips.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which ones?  
THE WITNESS: 
The first trip from May 18th to 20th, and the second -- excuse me.  The second trip, from May 18th to 20th, and the third trip, from May 22nd to approximately July 3rd.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So, Ms. Dufka, looking at these photographs, are you able to identify which ones were taken during your second trip, from the 18th to the 20th? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court, please?  
A.	Yes.  Shall I identify them by number at the bottom?  
Q.	That would be helpful, yes.  
A.	To clarify, it is this number, not the two-digit number, correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why don't you simply use the white number instead of the K number.  It's easier.  
THE WITNESS: 
They're both white, sorry. 

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Bottom right-hand corner.  
A.	Oh, right, sorry.  I heard white, I'm sorry.  Okay, so 17, 18, 19, 20.  That would be it.  
Q.	Looking at those photographs, do you recall now that particular trip to Sainte Famille?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
I'm sorry. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm sorry, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Mr. President, we of the Defence cannot follow because in our album the numbers do not correspond to those being mentioned.  I wonder if the Prosecution can assist us.  We only have the K numbers.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We all agree that we now have this small bundle in front of us.  Is that the one we are using, not the big one?  But it is the same, the small one.  Now, having looked at the small one, you will then start with K number K0376703.  Do you not have, then, a number 17 on the right-hand side?  That's what you are explaining.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, ours start with K0376701.  We do not have 703.  I don't know if my album is incomplete.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
701 is the first photograph, you are quite right.  But since the witness is now referring to photograph 17, you have to go to the 17th photograph, and the K number is marked 703.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last three digits.  And you will see it's a nice photograph of a child, if you look here, please.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I don't know if it's this one.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, it may be that -- 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I believe we are now with you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  

Now, you have now seen that photograph with the child with the white jacket.  Do we agree now that the next photograph is of a child resting at her mother's knees?  Is that the next one?  And then the next one is a man lying on a bench.  And this is followed by a person reading a book.  And we have now identified 17, 18, 19, and 20, and these were the four referred to by the witness.  All right?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, they follow as you have just indicated.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the last K number ends with the digit 705.  Have you seen that?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

All right, let's continue.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Ms. Dufka, looking at those photographs, do you recall the day that you visited Sainte Famille?  
A.	Yes, very well.  
Q.	Can you tell us, when you got to the Sainte Famille complex, was it easy just to go in to the church? 
A.	No.  In order to enter the church compound, which is quite large, we, again, had to pass through a checkpoint manned by perhaps eight to ten men in civilian dress who, again, asked many of the same questions:  Who we were, what we were doing.  And I particularly recall that one, that checkpoint, because it struck me as very curious that the checkpoint had set up a very large approximately metre-long model of the Concorde.  And it just struck me as rather curious, so I do remember that particular checkpoint.  

So, after some minutes talking with them, we were able to go into the Sainte Famille compound.
MS. MELLUISH:
I don't know if the exhibit, P. 6, is in court at the moment.  I wonder if it could be obtained.  Photographs P. 6.  Which bundle?  The second bundle.  Book 2, Sainte Famille.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Ms. Dufka, I wonder if you could look at the photograph numbered 07 -- they should be in numerical order.  Do you recognise that place?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it possible, on this photograph, to indicate where the roadblock or checkpoint that you referred to is, or does the photograph not show the correct area?  
A.	I am able to recognise approximately where the checkpoint was.  
Q.	Could you hold the photograph up so that everyone could see it.  I know it's quite small.  And please indicate? 
A.	Yes.  It was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could the Court video system now kindly zoom in on the witness, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
It was approximately right here. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Can you zoom in closer to the witness, please.  That's good.  
THE WITNESS: 
Okay.  At the entrance to the church compound.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the witness is pointing at the right-hand side of the church as we see it on the photograph.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	On this photograph, we see a large sort of dust area, I could perhaps describe it as a yard or a courtyard in front of the church, or the photograph.  What, if anything, was happening there when you arrived at Sainte Famille? 
A.	I recall there being very little activity in the courtyard, very few individuals there. 
Q.	And what atmosphere, if any, did you sense in that area? 
A.	Well, upon entering the church, people appeared to be quite tense, very depressed, or a very dampened mood.  And I would say that people appeared to be concentrated in the courtyard behind the church.  That's where I saw the vast majority of refugees in that compound.  
Q.	How easy or difficult was it to get inside the church? 
A.	Well, I don't recall having to wait outside the church for very long.  We had -- rather, I had heard the name of the father, Father Wenceslas, whom I asked for upon arrival at the church.  
Q.	Did you find Father Wenceslas, or was he not there?  
A.	He was there, and he -- we -- or, I asked him permission to take photographs inside the church, which he granted.  
Q.	Apart from the church, you mentioned a back -- backyard, I think, where you said there were refugees.  Did you go -- did you visit that area on this occasion? 
A.	I can't remember.  Can I add?  I can't -- I don't recall taking pictures in the backyard, even though that's where the majority of people were, because I recall the pictures were more compelling inside the church. 
Q.	Are you able to recall -- or, estimate how many refugees you saw at Sainte Famille that day? 
A.	I would say there were upwards of 8- or 900. 
Q.	Did you speak to any of the refugees? 
A.	Very briefly.  People seemed subdued or frightened of talking, and I didn't want to make them feel uncomfortable so I didn't pursue conversation with them after initially greeting them. 
Q.	And were you free to wander around as you pleased, or did the father escort you?  What -- can you describe that situation?  
A.	I was free to wander around. 
Q.	After you had visited the church and taken these photographs, what did you do? 
A.	Well, after taking the photographs, I recall chatting with Father Wenceslas, and I recall asking him if I could take pictures of the checkpoint outside of the church, because as a photo journalist, we try to tell various aspects of the story.  The human aspect of the refugees who have taken -- who have sought refuge in the church is one aspect; the other aspect I sought to cover was the military component.  So Father Wenceslas was very open, accommodating, and he said, "If you want pictures of a checkpoint, come with me and I will take you to a checkpoint in Kigali where you shall be able to take pictures of them."  
Q.	Did he say anything else about what you might expect to find at that roadblock?  
A.	He said that he would try to find a militia leader who could describe the objectives and work of the militias.  I don't recall if he called them militias or civil defence.  
Q.	So, he made this offer to you.  What did you then do?  
A.	Okay.  I evaluated in my mind whether this would be safe or not.  And I recognised that Father Wenceslas was someone who had standing within the community, and assumed he would not have made such a suggestion if it would have been risky for me.  So I went.  
Q.	And how did he take you?  Did you go on foot or in a vehicle?  
A.	We went in a vehicle.  Himself, dressed in a white flak jacket, and with a -- I recall seeing a pistol that was tucked inside his -- his belt.  And a driver, and we went in a small white pickup.  
Q.	Was that the same or a different vehicle from the one that you had travelled to Sainte Famille in? 
A.	A different vehicle. 
Q.	And do you recall -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You must remember the pause, Ms. Melluish.  Please.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Sorry.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you recall where you went with Father Munyeshyaka? 
A.	I recall the approximate area within Kigali where we went.  It was some 10 to 15 minutes' drive from Sainte Famille. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The pistol was within the belt of -- or, inside the belt of Father Wenceslas?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's right. 

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Ms. Dufka, we have a map of Kigali.  I wonder if you could come and have a look at this map.  Come out of the box.  
A.	Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Keep your headset on, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Oh, fine.  Sorry.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Just to warn you, the camera is going to focus on the map, so if you try to stand slightly to the side.  Are you able, looking at that map, to identify the area you went to?  
A.	Approximately -- thank you.  I do recall that it was on a high ground within Kigali and I recall it being approximately -- can people hear me -- in this area.  I recall that it was towards the side of Kigali that leads to -- or, near the road, excuse me, that leads towards Butare.  
Q.	Thank you, you can take your seat again, please.  

On -- on your way to that place, did you pass any other roadblocks?  
A.	Yes, we passed through a few roadblocks, but I do not recall how many.  
Q.	Was it easy or difficult to get through those roadblocks?  
A.	It was quite a bit easier on account of the presence of Father Wenceslas, who facilitated our passage from one checkpoint through the other.  
Q.	And how, as far as you are aware, was he able to do that?  
A.	He was speaking in Kinyarwanda to those who were manning the checkpoint, so I can't say what it is that he told them.  
Q.	And when you got to your destination, what did you find? 
A.	He took me to a rather large checkpoint that was manned by approximately 30 individuals, most of whom were in mixed styles of camouflage, others of whom were dressed in civilian clothing, and who were armed with various different types of weapons, including small arms, knives, hand grenades, steel bars, and a few other types of weapons.  
Q.	Did you take any photographs at that roadblock? 
A.	Yes, I took approximately a roll or two of pictures, a roll having 36 pictures in each.  
Q.	Do any of the photographs appear in the bundle you have before you?  
A.	Yes, photographs 1 through 14. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And these photographs were taken on the same day as your visit in Sainte Famille, only later in the day? 

THE WITNESS: 
That's right.  That was May 20th. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did you ask the militiamen to pose for the photographs, or did they do this naturally, by themselves?  
A.	Upon arrival at the checkpoint, Father Wenceslas spoke to those in charge of the checkpoint, and also at some point called an individual who Father Wenceslas said was the chief of the militia, named Robert Kajuga.  So he said -- and I can't recall if I started taking pictures before I did a brief interview with Mr. Kajuga, or afterwards.  The individuals did not -- or, I'll start the sentence again.  I did not ask the individuals in the militia to pose, but they started posing themselves in front of me.  So, as you can see by the photos, some of them are group pictures when they pulled themselves together for a photograph, and others are of them working, stopping vehicles and so forth.  
Q.	And how did these militiamen seem to you?  
A.	Well, I recall smelling alcohol on their breath.  They were jumping around the checkpoint shouting excitedly.  They weren't threatening to me in particular, but I must say I felt particularly anxious because one of them kept playing with the pin of a hand grenade.  And given the fact that some of them were evidently inebriated, and their behaviour was rather undisciplined, I feared that there could be a grenade explosion.  
Q.	Do any of the pictures you've taken show the individual who played with the hand grenade?  
A.	Yes, number 8, the second individual to the left within the photograph.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And, Defence, that is then the 8th photograph when we count from number 1, and the K number ends with 699.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I have the photograph, Mr. President.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You mentioned speaking to a man who was described to you as Robert Kajuga.  Can you briefly describe that person to the Court?  
A.	I recall him being approximately six foot, of sturdy build, and in -- and partly dressed in fatigues.  I cannot remember entirely what his dress was.  
Q.	Did he appear to know Father Wenceslas?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What about the other militia, did they appear to know Father Wenceslas, or not? 
A.	I can't recall. 
Q.	Can you recall any conversation you had with the man described as Robert Kajuga? 
A.	Yes, I recall asking if I could do a brief interview with him.  And as a journalist, especially in a situation which is potentially dangerous, one has to frame questions very carefully.  So I asked him about the current -- sorry.  I asked him about the role that these armed individuals were playing in the armed conflict in Kigali, and he described the ongoing battle for Kigali.  He described how the RPF were trying to come into the city, and that the armed individuals were trying to defend Kigali from the RPF.  
Q.	Do you recall how long you spent at this roadblock?  
A.	Approximately 30 to 40 minutes. 
Q.	And afterwards, where did you go?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you recall the name of this roadblock?  
THE WITNESS: 
I do not.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does the Prosecution have a suggestion as to which roadblock this may have been?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Well, Your Honour, other witnesses have testified to it being at Gitega.  But, no, beyond that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Which institution were you representing?  Were you a freelancer?  
THE WITNESS: 
I was working with the Reuters news agency.  But at that time I was not a staff photographer, although I had a -- an ongoing relationship with them.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And your interview, was it later published somewhere?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was published.  I recall reading it at some later point.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So, after spending time at this roadblock, where did you go? 
A.	I then got back in the white pickup with Father Wenceslas and returned to Sainte Famille.  
Q.	And after that?  
A.	From there I went to the UNAMIR headquarters, and either that day or the next day, flew out of Kigali to Nairobi to be able to transmit my pictures.  
Q.	Looking back at the photographs of Sainte Famille that appear in the bundle, can you identify those which you took on the second visit that you made to that place?  
A.	Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let us agree on when this second visit took place.  Shall we do that?  The second visit to Sainte Famille, which date?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was either May 29th or May 30th.  

Photographs 15 and 16.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And can you recall what was taking place that is shown in these photographs?  
A.	Yes, when the reporter, Peter Smerdon, and I arrived at Sainte Famille, there was a meeting of all the refugees in Sainte Famille being organised.  So these pictures reflect that meeting in progress.  
Q.	What about photograph 21? 
A.	Yes.  Excuse me, all the photographs that show people together sitting on benches were taken on May 29th or 30th.  Excuse me.  So then to correct myself, the ones taken on May 29th or 30th would be photographs 15, 16, 21, 22, 23.  Up to 23.  
Q.	And just to clarify this, what about photograph number 24?  Do you recall when that was taken? 
A.	I do not recall when that was taken. 
Q.	And 25?  
A.	I don't recall when that was taken. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So now we have been through all photographs until K number 720, and the last two questions related to 725 and 741.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
741 or 711. 
THE WITNESS: 
One of them does not appear to have a K number. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's where the holes are. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
It must be 741 because -- 711, sorry, because the following picture ends in 741.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At least the last one we have been referring to is the one with someone eating; an adult and a crying child.  Yes.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Besides taking those photographs of the meeting, do you recall anything else about your visit to Sainte Famille on the 28th or 29th of May? 
A.	Again, the feeling within the church was one of tension, anxiety among the refugees.  That day I also observed a few gendarmes milling about the church, which is reflected in two of the pictures.  
Q.	So, were those people that you hadn't seen before at Sainte Famille, on your previous visit? 
A.	I believe they were the same people, they were just all brought together in one place.  
Q.	Sorry, I meant the gendarmes.  
A.	Oh, I am sorry. 
Q.	Had you seen them before? 
A.	That was the first time I recall seeing the gendarmes. 
Q.	And do you recall how many gendarmes you saw at Sainte Famille on that occasion? 
A.	Approximately three or four.  They were not plentiful in number.  
Q.	Have a look, please, at photograph number 26.  That's the photograph K number ending 741.  Can you recall when you took this photograph? 
A.	That photograph, number 26, as well as others which follow it, were taken sometime in June.  But I don't recall the date. 
Q.	Do you mean all the other photos following it up to 32, or were there any that weren't taken in June? 
A.	Yes, photographs 26 through 33 were taken in June.  All taken at a particular side alcove of the main church which appeared to be serving as a makeshift hospital ward.  
Q.	And can you recall if -- or, did you ever know how these people came to be sick or injured?  
A.	No, I do not.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Thank you, I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, let's look at pictures 15 and 16.  Shall we do that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last three digits there are 721 and 722 respectively.  There are persons in uniform on these two photographs.  Do you know who they were?  
THE WITNESS: 
I believe they were gendarmes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And do you base that on any particular element of information, or were you told?  
THE WITNESS: 
I recall that's how gendarmes dressed, in the red beret and then with the red piece of fabric on their shoulders. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you.  

Defence?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to start with the following question:  The reports which you made during your trips to Rwanda in 1994, were they published in your agency?  
A.	Yes, they were published through the Reuters news agency, and they were then picked up by various newspapers throughout the world.  I have received a few clips from various different newspapers in Britain and other places of some of these photographs, but not all.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we move on, did you want to tender any exhibit in connection with this testimony, Prosecution?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
The book, perhaps, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any objection, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No objection, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 77. 
(Exhibit No. P. 77 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Please proceed.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you keep the references of those publications, and do you have some copies with you? 
A.	No, I don't have any copies with me.  
Q.	But do you remember the dates and references of those publications, and if so, can you give them to me, please?  
A.	I don't recall the dates.  Perhaps I can explain, if I may, how transmission and publication happens within a wire service.  The photographer transmits images.  Those images are then transmitted around the world to subscribers, who then choose to use them or not use them.  So not every photograph that I sent was "picked up", as we say.  However, many of them were, particularly because there were very few, if any, photographs in Rwanda at that date -- at those dates that I was there -- at least in May.  So I recall pictures being published in British newspapers, and my editors in London told me that the pictures had been used very widely.  But usually the photographer who's in the field does not get copies of the actual newspapers where the picture was published.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for these explanations, but I want you to shed some light on some issues for the Defence, because these are very important.  First of all, do you still work for the Reuters agency?  
A.	No, I do not.  
Q.	Now, at the time, did the agency keep an archive of the transmissions that you sent to them, and is it possible to access this archive, from what you know?  
A.	I believe they do keep an archive of the pictures that I transmit, but I did not transmit every single one of these pictures.  On a given assignment, for example, the militia checkpoint, I took approximately two rolls of photographs, a roll being 36 images, and would have transmitted perhaps four or five.  So those that they would have in their archive would be the ones that I transmitted.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Tell me, Witness, during your interview with members of the Office of the Prosecutor, were you able to give them any evidence of the fact that at the time you were a correspondent of the Reuters agency? 
A.	Sorry, the question is if I was able to provide proof that I was a correspondent of Reuters?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is this disputed in the case, that this witness was a journalist in 1994, working for Reuters?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I just want to be sure.  For now there's nothing that indicates to me that this is indeed the correspondent.  It is in the interests of the Defence to be sure.  So I wanted the witness to tell me if she was able to prove that in one way or the other to the Office of the Prosecutor.  I'm not challenging it, I just want some clarification.  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, I suppose that they have my passport, and I was a very well-recognised and well-known photo journalist at that time and for a period of about 12 years.  So I think it's well established that I am who I am.  So, I suppose that was proof enough for them.  

Also, I was in possession of the negatives.  So that would also add weight to the fact that these negatives are mine and that I took these images.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Don't take -- don't hold it against me that I am asking you some of these questions.  Some of these questions might be disturbing, but it's just to clarify things for the Defence.  I don't want to dwell on this thing for fear of hurting your sensitivities.  

You had to undertake a total of three trips to Rwanda; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, during that time, that is correct.  
Q.	And if I understood you correctly, Madam Witness, there were two trips in May, and one in June; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 

Sorry -- I'm sorry.  There were three trips; all of them commenced in May.  The final trip, during which I stayed for six weeks, began approximately the 23rd of May.  Excuse me.  
Q.	Thank you for this clarification, Witness.  Now, during your first visit to the Sainte Famille parish, did you have the opportunity of looking all around you, and were you able to see the nature of all the buildings? 
A.	Yes, I walked around the compound.  I couldn't say if it was all of the buildings because I didn't know until which point the compound extended. 
Q.	And when you were inside the church building itself, since you took photographs, did you think that the roofing looked normal? 
A.	I don't actually recall the roofing.  It was cool inside the main building, but I don't recall whether it would be characterised or normal or not.  It seemed like a normal roof.  
Q.	It did not appear to you that this roofing may have been blown off by shelling? 
A.	No, I don't recall that.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  And while you were with Father Wenceslas, were you discussing normally with him? 
A.	Yes, we chatted, we discussed, he was very pleasant and accommodating to us.  
Q.	Did he have the opportunity to tell you a bit about the conditions under which the refugees were living?  Did you have any discussions on this?  
A.	Briefly.  That was especially the case for the visit that I did on May 29th or 30th, and I was aware that the journalist with whom I was reporting spoke with him at that time.  
Q.	Now, Witness, do you still recall the name of this journalist who was with you, and do you know what happened to him? 
A.	Yes, it was Peter Smerdon.  He was, at that point, a correspondent for Reuters based in Nairobi.  
Q.	Yes, I also want to talk about this local journalist who was in your company.  Do you recall his name?  
A.	I do not.  I had met this local journalist in Gitarama.  He had come to Gitarama to cover a press conference, I believe, that had been called by some of the government who, at that time, were operating from Gitarama.  
Q.	Now, during those trips you made to the Sainte Famille family (sic) in May and June, you did not see any traces, any signs of shelling of the Sainte Famille parish? 
A.	I do not recall seeing signs of the shelling, but I do recall the incident, and recall that it happened sometime in June, and that there were a number of wounded, and I believe two killed.  But I do not recall seeing the evidence of the shelling inside the church.  
(Pages 1 to 18 by Kirstin McLean)



1015H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this issue of shelling of crucial importance in this case?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, this is an issue that falls within the defence theory, but I am not going to dwell on this.  I just wanted to know from the witness, since she was at the site, to get some information from her, but if she cannot assist me in that regard, I will move on to something else. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you told the Chamber that in the course of your first visit to Sainte Famille, the guard post that you saw was the roadblock manned by a certain number of people.  Was that the only guard post controlling entry and exit into the Sainte Famille parish? 
A.	This is the only one.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And when you went back to that place to photograph people meeting within the church building, you found gendarmes, which are on the photograph.  Do they appear to be threatening the refugees who were there?  
A.	No.  I recall that they walked around, primarily, the front part of the church and in and out of the entrance, but they did not appear -- appear to be threatening the refugees. 
Q.	Were there militiamen, that is, the kind of militiamen you found at the place during your first visit? 
A.	To clarify, is the question, "Were the militiamen inside the church?"  Is that the question?  Okay.  No, I do not recall seeing militiamen enter inside the church.  They were outside of the actual church building. 
Q.	Thank you for this clarification, Madam Witness.  

Now, Madam Witness, I want us to focus on the roadblock where you took photographs of people in a state of inebriation as you stated.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't get the end of counsel's question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat your question, please?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	My question was whether that was the only roadblock that she had to photograph, that is, from photograph number 14 to -- number 7 to 14 - number 1 to 14.  Sorry.  

Was that the only roadblock you had to photograph during your trip to Kigali? 
A.	Yes, that was the only roadblock I photographed throughout Rwanda.  It was very, very tense and I felt threatened at roadblocks, and it was only because of the introduction to the militia heads or leader by Father Wenceslas that I felt that I could photograph there. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And you did say that this was a roadblock which was close to the road leading to Butare, is that correct? 
A.	I didn't say, "close," it was on the side of Kigali closer to the road that led down to Butare.  I cannot recall exactly where it was, but as I mentioned it was a high ground on that ridge overlooking the hills and the road that goes down to the road to Butare.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Did you observe while you were there that there was a big junction with traffic lights in that neighbourhood? 
A.	I don't recall that. 
Q.	And, Witness, as far as you can recall, this roadblock, was it a large one or a middle one, based on your observations made at the other roadblocks? 
A.	It was quite a large one.  And I am estimating from the various roadblocks that I observed after having crossed into Rwanda from Burundi.  Many of those roadblocks had approximately five, six individuals, but this one was one of the larger ones that I had observed. 
Q.	Witness, even though you and I do not perfectly know Rwanda, I am able to suggest to you that this place that you are referring to is within the Nyabugogo neighbourhood because that is the neighbourhood that is closest to the road leading to Butare.  If I were to put that to you, would you accept it? 
A.	No, because I simply cannot remember the exact location of the roadblock, nor the name.  Indeed I didn't know that roadblocks had names.  I assume it corresponded to the neighbourhood within which they were located, but I did not have that level of familiarity with Kigali then to be able to identify that it was where you just mentioned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we just heard is that the Defence has a view as to which roadblock this may be.  Now, we have heard the Prosecution and two-three witnesses say that this is the Gitega roadblock.  Is that also the view of the Defence, so that it is undisputed which roadblock this is?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, that specifically is the point that I want to clarify for the Chamber.  If it is a roadblock which is not far from the road leading to Butare, it could not have been a roadblock in Gitega, because these are two neighbourhoods which are far from each other.  So that is the clarification that I am seeking to make through this witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Can I clarify -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But the witness doesn't know -- 

Did you want to add anything?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, if I could just clarify.  According to this map, where I recall that roadblock, was on the western side of town, if this map corresponds to west and east, like it does, but that it was close to the road going down to Butare, I don't -- I didn't say that nor do I mean that.  I simply can identify the side of town that the roadblock was -- where the roadblock was.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But leaving aside the testimony of this witness, since you were now suggesting an area where this roadblock could be, it was my impression that the Defence may have a view as to which roadblock photographs 1 to 14 are referring to.  What is the position?  
MR. NEKUIE:
From the description that the witness gave us this morning based on -- relying on the map, we were able to locate that photograph -- that roadblock in the Nyabugogo area.  And, Mr. President, we believe that the Defence could also use this map to get the witness to locate the Gitega neighbourhood so that the Chamber may see that these are two completely different neighbourhoods.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So you are disputing that it is the Gitega roadblock.  That's noted.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Exactly, Mr. President.  So, by the leave of the Court, I don't know if the witness can go back to the map to indicate to the Court the Gitega neighbourhood, because this is indicated on the map.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  And can you please repeat for me the name of the neighbourhood that begins with an N so I can look for  that as well?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
It's Nyabugogo, Nyabugogo.  
THE WITNESS:
And where is Nyabugogo?  Sorry, I am not finding it on the map.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, do you want me to come over and assist you?  
A.	Fine.  
Q.	Witness, you may use the legend which gives you the names of the neighbourhoods and the clear situation on the map.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why should we use an American witness to read a Rwandan map?  She doesn't know the details of the town.  Maps usually speak for themselves.  What's the purpose?  
THE WITNESS:
Anyway, I found it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Congratulations.  

THE WITNESS:
Like I said, since I was not familiar with Kigali, I just can't say with precision where this checkpoint was.  I do recall that it was a high ground, like I have said, some place in this area.  But unfortunately I can't be any more specific.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I am sorry for taking this Chamber through this exercise, but this witness, who is an American citizen, was in Rwanda and it is in the interests of the Defence to get her to locate where she took the photograph.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, let me ask you another question in relation to that.  The area, the neighbourhood, that you have just located, will that be the Nyabugogo neighbourhood that you also identified on the map?  Were you able to see Nyabugogo, and are you able to say if that area you are referring to is within the Nyabugogo neighbourhood?  
A.	Can't say. 
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  This question brings me to the end of my exercise with you.
MR. NEKUIE:
And I thank the Chamber for its patience.  The Defence has come to the end of its cross-examination.  
A.	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
One question, Your Honour, if I may.  
RE-EXAMINATIOIN
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mrs. Dufka, are you able to say that the roadblock you took these photographs at was in Kigali town? 
A.	Yes, absolutely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The checkpoint outside Sainte Famille church was manned by who?  
THE WITNESS:
By men, young men in civilian dress.  I referred to them as militias.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Civilian attire?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Sorry, Your Honour.  Can I clarify?  Sometimes at the militia checkpoints, the military element dressed in mixed camouflage and civilian.  So they might have a civilian top and camouflage trousers.  So I cannot say with certainty that there was not -- one stitch of camouflage on those militiamen, but they were primarily dressed in civilian dress.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The purpose of the question is just to find out whether you saw any soldiers there, and you did not.  
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Now, Witness, a small question.  Yes, coming back to this roadblock where you took your picture.  Do you recall how long did it take you to travel from the Sainte Famille church to this particular place?  
THE WITNESS:
It was approximately 10 to 15 minutes. But, recall, that we had to pass through a few checkpoints and negotiate our way past the individuals manning those checkpoints, which took a bit of time.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
So if it were in a normal situation, it would take less than 10 or 15 minutes, even?  
THE WITNESS:
A bit.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Madam Witness. 

Thank you very much for having come to the Tribunal and contributed to the proceedings.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The next witness is?  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour:   Next witness is Witness ACS.

If I can ask the assistance of registry to distribute to Your Honours and others around the court the personal information sheet for that witness, along with -- there is a very brief list of some additional names which may come up during the course of his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this a long witness?  
MR. MOSES: 
I would estimate one to one and a half hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So there may be a need, depending on cross-examination to have a new witness in this -- 
MR. MOSES: 
We already have someone here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Thank you.  

ACS is in which bundle?  
MR. MOSES: 
I am sorry, I can't assist, Your Honour.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Volume 3, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness ACS in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness ACS in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That's correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga.  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 78.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 78 admitted, under seal) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Open or closed?  
MR. MOSES: 
Start in open.  We will have to go into closed for a very brief period and then the majority of his testimony will be able to be led in open court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Please proceed. 
WITNESS ACS,
first having  been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Morning, Witness.  
A.	Morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Before we commence, can I please just remind you that what you are saying has to be translated and recorded.  So if you can we are to speak slowly, and not in too long passages, I think it will assist us all. 
A.	Okay.  
Q.	As at beginning of 1994, do you know who the préfet of Kigali was? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	And who was that person? 
A.	It was Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho, and I think he had been in that position since 1990.  He remained a préfet until 1994.  
Q.	Do you recall the approximate or the date that he became préfet? 
A.	I don't recall the exact date, but he was appointed in October of the year 1990. 
Q.	Is there any particular reason why you recall his appointment? 
A.	I think the Inkotanyi invaded Rwanda on October 1st, 1990.  From that date on there was a reorganisation of the administrative set-up in Kigali city.  A military préfet was appointed to be at the helm of that préfecture, certainly, in order to be able to mobilise the inhabitants of Kibuye with regard to the combat, the fighting that was likely to take place in Kigali city.  I think that is the reason why he was appointed. 
Q.	Did anything happen to you soon after his appointment?
A.	Yes, something happened to me.  But before then, the préfet had officiated at a meeting in my secteur.  It was a meeting bringing together all the members of the population, and members of the cellule committees from in attendance.  
Q.	I will just stop you there, Witness.  Can you please just listen to the question that I asked.  Did anything happen to you that you recall after the appointment of Renzaho as préfet? 
A.	Yes.  I was one of the people arrested because we were considered as accomplices of the Inyenzi. 
Q.	And how long were you detained for?  
A.	Between five and ten days.  I no longer remember the exact period.  But when we were rounded up, we were placed at the Nyamirambo regional stadium and subsequently detained at the Kigali prison.  It's at that prison that I was released.  
Q.	And were you ever charged with any offence? 
A.	I was not charged.  Actually, there was a list of important personalities, but my name was not on that list.  So it was decided that people whose names were not on that list had to be released.  Those people were immediately released who were not charged. 
Q.	Thank you for that.  Now, can I ask you briefly to focus on the period from 1990 to April 19 -- sorry, from the date of Renzaho's appointment in 1990 to April, the beginning of April 1994, were there any difficulties for you in moving around or outside Kigali?  
A.	I don't quite understand your question, sir.  Are you referring to the pre-1994 period or are you referring to 1994? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, from October 1990 to April 1994, did you have freedom of movement?  Could you move around in Kigali, in and out of Kigali?  
THE WITNESS:
Now, I have understood that question.  It was not possible because from my arrest and subsequent release, I could not leave Kigali city, for instance, to go Kacyiru without a pass.  I think that document had been designed to prevent the Tutsi in Kigali city to flee.  So personally, I could not move about in Kigali city without that pass.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And once again, very briefly, did -- to obtain that travel pass, where would you have to go to obtain it? 
A.	At that time, in order to be issued with a pass you had to go to the commune office.  So I had to go to the Nyarugenge commune office.  As a matter of fact, the pass was a document required throughout Kigali-ville préfecture at the helm of which was Tharcisse Renzaho.  The instructions instituting that pass had come from the office of the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I would like you to focus on the period of April 1994.  Without giving the specific location, where -- where were you when you heard about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I was at home. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, at this stage I think it might be safe just to go for about five minutes into a closed session.  There is a little bit of evidence I want to lead regarding his location and that of other people which could potentially lead to his identification.  So to be safe, perhaps if we could have five minutes in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will close for five minutes.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 32] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).

MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is sitting under Rule 15 bis because Judge Egorov had to be excused until lunch.  Please proceed.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, shortly before the break you told the Trial Chamber that you had left your home and had sought refuge at a place called CELA.  Do you recall giving that testimony? 
A.	I recall that. 
Q.	Approximately how long after the death of President Habyarimana was it that you sought refuge at CELA?  
A.	One week following the death of the president.  
Q.	And how long did you remain at CELA? 
A.	I believe I left the CELA centre at a date that I cannot forget.  It is a date which is very important.  We left the CELA centre on the 22nd of April at the time that there were killings at that place, killings led by the préfet, Tharcisse Renzaho.  
Q.	We will come to that.  You have said that you left on the 22nd of April.  Were there many people like yourself who had taken refuge at CELA during the period that you were staying there? 
A.	There were a lot of people at that place.  Some got there before me and others got there after me.  There were so many people, and I can say we were more than 80 persons.  We were many.  
Q.	Now, if I can ask you to focus on the 22nd of April.  What is the first thing that you remember happening on the 22nd of April which was unusual? 
A.	The specific incident that I recall on that day of 22nd April is that a large number of people from my secteur came to weed the area in which we are taking refuge at the CELA centre.  Officially, they had come there to weed the bush so as to find the Inyenzi.  It was on that day that the people at CELA were killed.  But before the massacre there is what is referred to as communal work. 
Q.	All right.  Well, after these people from your neighbourhood came for the communal work, did you see anyone arrive at CELA? 
A.	I do not clearly recollect who came to the CELA centre, but I recall the attack against the centre.  I don't know if I should talk about this attack in detail.  On the 22nd, while a large number of the population was weeding the bush around the CELA centre, I saw an armoured vehicle.  This is a type of vehicle that cannot be pierced by bullets.  Renzaho was not on board that vehicle.  I believe he was on board his own vehicle, together with Angeline Mukandituye, who was a primary school inspector in the Nyarugenge area.  He was with Odette Nyirabagenzi, who is conseiller of my secteur.  He was also with Jean Bizimana, bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune, gendarmes and soldiers that I could not identify.  Those -- I was able to identify those who were not soldiers, because I used to see them quite often. 
Q.	All right.  Can I just stop you there?  You said that you recognised some people who were not soldiers.  Who did you recognise of the people who were not soldiers? 
A.	There was Angeline Mukandituye, school inspector in the Nyarugenge commune.  Odette Nyirabagenzi, who was conseiller.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have all the names on record here.  I don't think we need the spelling.  
MR. MOSES: 
No, Your Honours, that wasn't -- I'll redo my question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Apart from the officials that you have described, were there any other people with Renzaho that you recognised?  
A.	There were several Interahamwes, and I remember the names of some of these Interahamwes.  I don't know if you want me to give you those names. 
Q.	I do, if you can give us two or three names of Interahamwe who you recall being with those officials at that time.  
A.	There were several Interahamwe, but I remember one Nkeshimana, son of Gikongoro.  There was Fidele Habimana, alias Castar.  There was one Rwagatara, Faustin, alias Las Vegas.  There was very many, but these are the ones I remember.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, Nkeshimana is 183, Fidele is 49; Castar, 39; and the last name is on the additional list at number 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And was the father's name Gikongoro?  

What was the name of father, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. It's Nkeshimana whose father was Gikongoro. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just want to make sure that the father's name is spelt in the same way as the location.  Do you spell -- 
THE WITNESS:
It is the same spelling, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, when you first arrived at CELA about a week after leaving -- after the death of the president, were there any priests present at that centre at that time?
A.	When I got to the CELA centre, all the priests living at that centre had left.  I met people who had the same problems as myself, who had sought refuge there, otherwise the priests had left well before.  
Q.	And what about on the 22nd of April, were there any priests present there? 
A.	On the 22nd April, I will talk about the priest, Wenceslas Rucyaka (sic) who came with Renzaho Tharcisse, Angeline, Odette, the soldiers, and the gendarmes.  These priests accompanied them, together with the attackers on that day.  
Q.	Now, you have said that the préfet arrived, are you able to give an approximate time of day that this -- that you saw these people arrive? 
A.	From my recollection, people came before 10 a.m. but the attack continued well into the afternoon.  At the beginning, there was this communal work, and then Renzaho came with the Interahamwe attackers, gendarmes and soldiers, and other persons.  It is an attack that lasted for some time.  
Q.	And when you say Renzaho -- without giving the circumstances, had you ever seen Renzaho prior to that date? 
A.	I saw him earlier in 1990 when he convened a meeting in my secteur.  This was a public meeting to -- with the general public and the responsables de cellule were invited. That was my first time seeing him. 
Q.	And, apart from that meeting in 1990, had you seen him in person again between 1990 and the 22nd of April '94? 
A.	I saw him on several occasions between 1990 and 1994.  As the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture, I saw him during several -- the several meetings that he convened.  But on the 22nd of April 1994, I saw him again face to face.  But even before that occasion, I used to see him on -- during several meetings.  
Q.	All right.  We'll come back now to the events of the morning of the 22nd of April.  After the arrival of Renzaho and others, what happened? 
A.	Before their arrival, I recall that there was the communal work that was carried out by the members of the population. 
Q.	And -- my question was to focus on what happened after his arrival.  What happened?  
A.	Yeah, now I understand you.  After the arrival of the préfet at the CELA centre, he asked that all those in the CELA centre hall should get out.  But when we saw him we thought it was a way of being saved.  We said, "The préfet is now here and we'll be saved."  So he asked us to get out and we assembled in the courtyard.  They lined us up.  I don't know if I should continue explaining what happened. 
Q.	Just stop there, and I will take you through bit by bit.  I think it will be easier for us all if we do a little bit at a time.  Now, when you say "He lined us all", was this men, women, children all together?  
A.	Yes, everybody was asked to line up.  Women separate from the children, and also separate from the men.  
Q.	Just so we can clarify, were you one of the men who were lined up? 
A.	Yes, I was one of the men who were lined up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, was this exercise, clearing bushes, carried out from 10 o'clock or did the organisation of the massacres start at 10 o'clock?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Even though the community work was carried out, I would like to say it was just a pretext for massacres to be committed.  As far as I remember, there were many people who came to clear the bushes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Now, please listen to the question, Mr. Witness.  You have mentioned that a lot of people came around 10 o'clock.  Was that in order to do the community work or was it in order to start lining up people?  I just want the time estimate.  Can you help us?  
THE WITNESS:
To be candid, it was not community work.  We were the ones being sought by those people.  That is what I can say.  We knew what the meaning of the community work was, under normal circumstances.  It was simply something aimed at preparing our massacre.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's understood.  Now, what interests us now is, when did Mr. Renzaho arrive?  Let's me put it that way. What was the time?  
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the exact time.  In any case, he arrived there before noon, before the end of the community work.  It was still before noon.  But I can't remember the exact time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When did the community work start -- or this work with the bushes?  Can you remember that, approximately?  
THE WITNESS:
Approximately, I would say the community work started a bit earlier, around 10 o'clock or shortly before 10 o'clock.  I cannot remember the specific time.  In any case, it was before noon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Mr. Renzaho arrived not in the armoured vehicle but in his own car.  Was that the testimony, yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
He came in another vehicle.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what -- 
THE WITNESS:
 -- the armoured vehicle had only soldiers in it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there was only one armoured vehicle there.  Is that your testimony?  
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember quite well, but there were more than one armoured vehicles.  I saw it.  You see, when you are scared, it is difficult for you to notice everything.  But, in any case, there were more than one armoured vehicles.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, once you were lined up, were -- did anyone give any instructions or what happened?  
A.	After lining us up, Préfet Renzaho personally gave instructions.  And I think he remembered that very well.  He was the one directing that attack.  He had a piece of paper in his hand, which piece of paper he handed to Angeline Mukandituye, who was a schools inspector for Nyarugenge commune.  That list was read out and Renzaho said, "Take whoever you want."

Should I continue to tell you how it all unfolded after he made that statement?  
Q.	I'll ask you some more questions now, too, so we can all find out bit by bit, rather than giving too much information at one time.  

So, after you say that Renzaho had asked -- or told Angeline that she could take whoever she wanted, were there any names called out? 
A.	Yes, names were read out.  
Q.	Do you recall what the -- what was the first name that you recall being read out? 
A.	The first name was that of one Charles Rwanga. 
Q.	Was Charles Rwanga -- 
MR. MOSES:
That's number 241 on the list, Your Honour. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	-- was he among the men who were lined up outside?  
A.	Rwanga, Charles, was not in another queue.  He had been in hiding somewhere, because he knew that since 1990 he was a wanted man.  And since he was not in that line, Angeline Mukandituye, while speaking to Wilson and Déglote Rwanga, who were Charles Rwanga's children, she said, "If you want your lives to be spared, then go and look for your father".  The children burst out in tears and told their mother, "Mummy, go and ask daddy, because we do not want to be killed".  That is how the Interahamwe looked for Charles Rwanga everywhere around.  They found him and lined him up, just like everyone else.  
Q.	All right.  
MR. MOSES:
Now, Your Honours, it's -- 244 and 242 are the names of the Rwanga sons.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I'm just wondering, when you are answering, if you could just keep your eye, if you can, on me, and I will hold my hand up if I think you are going too fast or giving us too much information.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you using the most updated spelling list now, or the previous one?  I think we should probably agree that the spelling list dated 22nd of January 2007, which was the last one, there Charles is number 242, Déglote 243, and Wilson 245.  
MR. MOSES: 
You are quite right, Your Honour. I must have a slightly earlier version.  I apologise for that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who read out these names, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
When Préfet Renzaho handed the list to Angeline Mukandituye, she was the one who read out the names, because most of those people at that centre were residents of her secteur.  She was our neighbour; she knew all those people.  The préfet did not know all of them.  He simply gave her the list and told, "Take whoever you want".  So Angeline started reading out the names while we were lined up.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, is this something you heard with your own ears or something someone told you?  These instructions you heard from the préfet and Angeline?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  I was lined up and awaiting my death.  I listened to it with my own ears.  It was done while I was being lined up.  We were in the courtyard, all of us together. 
Q.	All right.  And apart from the Rwanga children and their father, do you remember the names of anyone else who was called out on that list? 
A.	I remember many names.  For instance, Emmanuel Gihana, who was with me.  If you want, I can give you all the names that I remember.  
MR. MOSES: 
Emmanuel Gihana is number 65 on the list.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Perhaps if you remember two or three other names, if you could give us those names.  
A.	There was one Albert, who worked at Radio Rwanda.  Christophe Safari, who I believe was a student in the faculty of management in the university.  There was also Charles Gahima, and one Rugingwa (sic).  I remember those names very well.  
MR. MOSES: 
Christophe Safari is on the additional list, Your Honour.  The last -- I think Gahima is reasonably well known.  And perhaps if I can ask the witness to spell Rubingwa (sic).  

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Could you please just spell that name?
A.	Rwigamba is spelt R-W-I-G-A-M-B-A.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Witness.

1215H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Earlier in your testimony, you had referred to the fact that you had seen a person, a Vincent Mugiraneza when you were at CELA.  Did you see him that day?  That is, on the 22nd?  
A.	It was not only on the 22nd I saw him, I saw him ever since I arrived at the CELA centre.  We were at CELA centre together.  Now, do you want me to explain what happened?  Because there was something peculiar that happened there.  Do you want me to move on?  

While we were told to queue up, Mugiraneza, who had been a Rwandan ambassador to China, said, "I am lucky, I have just seen Renzaho.  We both hail from the same préfecture".  So he moved closer to Renzaho to say hello to him.  Renzaho exclaimed -- I remember very well.  I remember it vividly, it's not something I can forget.  So he said, "Hey, Mugiraneza, so you, too, are here"?  So he said, "Go to my vehicle.  I will take care of you later".  

Should I continue?  
Q.	Just stop you there very briefly.  First of all, do you know what ethnicity -- I don't know if we covered this earlier -- what ethnicity Vincent was?  
A.	For me, he was a Tutsi, because his family had been exterminated.  I mean, his wife and children, as I told you when I started my evidence.  That is even the reason why he had taken shelter at the CELA centre.  All of us at CELA centre were of the same ethnicity.  
Q.	All right.  Now, when he said that he was from the same préfecture as the préfet, do you know what préfecture that was? 
A.	Kibungo préfecture.  Mugiraneza hailed from Kibungo.  And from what I knew, I think he hailed from Kigarama commune.  He was my neighbourhood, so I had to know where he had come from in Kibungo.
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that.  Now, did Vincent leave CELA that day, yes or no? 
A.	Are you referring to the 22nd of April when we had just been lined up, when Renzaho told him, "Go to my vehicle, I will take care of you later"?  When they started by taking out the people who were wanted, such as Rwanga, there were about 40 in number.  On that date, the women were not touched in any way.  I don't believe I had mentioned this before.  So the women and the men who had remained there, just as me, were told to go.  We were told to return home.  In fact, it was Renzaho who told us, "Go back to your homes, and we are going to take care of you in your respective homes".  It was Renzaho who took Mugiraneza away.  Until this day we had never seen him.  Perhaps you need to find out from Renzaho what happened to Mugiraneza. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we appreciate your courtesy, and that you are looking at the Bench.  But do you think you could look at Prosecution counsel instead of looking at us?  You see, that will facilitate the communication between you and him.  And he will, then, be able to stop you, because you are quite eager.  If you could take this step by step, please.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Well, I think in your last answer -- in fact, you've covered a few different aspects which may save us some time now.  You have -- if I can just clarify.  Vincent Mugiraneza did leave CELA that day, on the 22nd of April?  Yes or no.  
A.	He left CELA on that date. 
Q.	You've, I think, told us that you haven't seen him since, is that correct? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And also in that answer I think you said approximately 40 people were taken away from CELA.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	What I gave was an estimate.  It was more than 40 people.  I cannot remember exactly how many people.  But let's just take 40 as a reference point. 
Q.	Okay.  Of those 40 people who you saw taken away, do you know if any of them are still alive? 
A.	Of that group of more than 40 people, there is one Bitega who reportedly jumped out of the vehicle which was carrying the people being taken to be killed.  That person survived.  I saw him after the events.  He was one person who survived from that group of people taken away to be killed. 
MR. MOSES: 
That's number 20. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  The remaining people, do you know -- do you know what happened to them?  
A.	Is your question in reference to those who remained at the time we left the CELA centre? 
Q.	It was my -- my question wasn't very clear, and I apologise for that.  Of the approximately 40 people who were taken away, you've told us of one person who survived.  The remaining people, do you know what happened to them? 
A.	They were all slaughtered.  We did not see them again.  They were killed along the road going down towards our secteur.  Some bodies were dumped in the graves located at the place called CND.  It was the home of one Mr. Iyaremye, who had dug very deep graves for bodies to be dumped into.  That is where some of those bodies were placed, whereas other persons were killed along the road.  
Q.	And very briefly, how do you know that they were dumped at Mr. Iyaremye's house?  
MR. MOSES:
And that's number 85.
THE WITNESS:
After the genocide, we tried to locate the bodies of our family members who had been killed.  So the bodies buried in that grave were exhumed for subsequent burial.  That is where we saw the body of Albert, who was working at Radio Rwanda.  And at that time we could recognise them because of the clothing of those people.  That is how we were able to recognise Albert, as well as Emmanuel Gihana.  Because of what they were putting on. 
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	And just to very briefly clarify, were you present at the exhumation of those bodies there? 
A.	Yes, I was there.  I was present during the exhumation.  I was also present when those bodies were given a decent burial. 
Q.	All right.  Just a couple of quick questions regarding the incident that you've referred to on the 22nd of April.  From what you were able to observe, who appeared to be in charge of the operation at CELA, if anyone? 
A.	That operation was conducted under the leadership of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho.  Any junior official could not have directed the operation in the presence of Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho.  He was the one who gave the orders, no one else spoke on that occasion.  So it was Renzaho who directed that operation in his capacity as préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  Even though there were certain other personalities like the conseillers, the bourgmestres from Nyarugenge commune, as well as Angeline Mukandituye, I confirm that it was Renzaho who directed the operation.  In fact, he was the one who had the list of people being wanted.  I did not know where he had come with that list from, but he had it in his hands. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did this process of bringing the refugees out, separating them, and then choosing people, did it -- and then taking them away, are you able to give any indication how long that process took? 
A.	I believe your question has already been answered by me.  It took a long time.  That operation started in the morning, and went on until early afternoon.  I cannot give you an exact time, but the operation lasted several hours.  I can't be more specific than that.  But the operation lasted a long time.  I am referring to the process of taking us out of the classrooms, lining us up, and reading out the names of the people being sought.  It all took several hours. 
Q.	And after that incident that you've described on the 22nd of April, what did you do? 
A.	When Renzaho personally ordered us to leave the centre so that our security could be taken care of in our neighbourhoods, I understood that I did not have any other place to go and seek refuge at.  I had left my home to go to the centre, but I couldn't go to the Sainte Famille church because that site was under the management of Munyeshyaka, who himself had participated in the attack against CELA.  So that spurred my decision to return home.  I should even tell you that those who survived at the CELA centre were subsequently killed. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you have indicated to the Trial Chamber that you had seen Renzaho at meetings on several occasions prior to April 1994, and you say that you saw him again on the 22nd of April 1994.  Do you believe if you saw him today you would recognise him? 
A.	I knew him.  I used to see him.  If you want, I am ready to identify him for you. 
Q.	All right.  Well, if you could briefly stand up where you are from where you're sitting.  Stand up.  

And are you able to have a look around the courtroom and see if you're able to see the person who you -- in the courtroom?  
A.	Do you want me to point him out?  It is that person who is seated over there wearing spectacles. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you see, I think there are -- the direction you're pointing there are three rows of benches.  Which row?  Is it in the front bench, the middle bench or the rear bench?  
A.	It is the person who is seated to that extreme.  I believe that is the first row.  He has a fair complexion, wearing spectacles.  The person sitting next to him is not wearing spectacles.  And to the other extreme, there is a white person.  In any event, I cannot forget Renzaho for my whole life.  Even during the event I knew him very well because I lived in Kigali town.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In spite of a slight ambiguity with spectacles, we consider identification to have taken place. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I've got no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence, will you perform any of your cross-examination in closed session?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think I will have to begin in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If that is the case, I think this is a good moment to decide your request for your investigator to be present in the courtroom during closed session proceedings.  

You filed this motion on the 18th of January.  The Prosecution informed us that they had no comments or objections.  That was made in the courtroom.  We have looked into the matter.  We have studied the reasons for the request.  This particular request relates to Investigator Jean Marie Hakizamungu, H-A-K-I-Z-A-M-U-N-G-U.  We are granting that request.  

Do you want to start in closed session immediately, or do you start in open, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I think it is better to go immediately into closed session, but I won't be long. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And can you give an estimate so that those following us in the public gallery has an idea?  Do you think you will need all the time until lunch in closed, that's 25 minutes.  Or less?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I think I'll take about ten minutes, not more than that, except if the witness extends too much during his answers. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Well see how this develops.  But now we have to go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 45 to 53] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 40 to 44 by Vicki Eastvold)




































MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us go back for a while on -- let us go back to the incident that occurred at the house of Mr. Vincent Mugiraneza which you witnessed.  On that day, did you see Angeline Mukandituye arrive, and could you tell the Trial Chamber whether she was only with Interahamwe, or with soldiers, either from the army or the gendarmerie? 
A.	There is one aspect that comes back to my mind, but let me start with what I saw regarding Mugiraneza's death, as well as the death of the members of his family.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we are in open session now.  So we really do not want to know exactly where you are staying or information about your neighbourhood.  

So at 14:55:58 there is a sentence starting with "I told you that --" and that sentence will be placed under seal, all of it.  

Will you please watch out, Mr. Witness?  Please do not transmit that, video booth.  

And now the next question -- or a continuation of what you may wish to hear from this witness, Defence Counsel.  Can you ask a precise question so that the witness is assisted to respond to exactly what you want to know, instead of repeating this evidence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I simply wanted the witness to answer the question I put.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Among those who were accompanying Angeline, were there only Interahamwe, or were there also soldiers?  Witness, could you answer this question?  
A.	I was about to answer the question.  There were Interahamwe, and there were also members of the Presidential Guard.  
Q.	Witness, according to you, did Angeline Mukandituye seem to have any authority whatsoever on the members of the Presidential Guard? 
A.	I cannot state that she gave orders to the members of the Presidential Guard.  She gave orders to the Interahamwe, and the members of the Presidential Guard were present.  But it was as if they were approving the orders given by Angeline that members of the Presidential Guard, as well as the other people I already mentioned, did not go in to Mugiraneza's house.  So she did not give any orders to the members of the Presidential Guard, but rather to the Interahamwe who, besides, were living at her house.  Let me say, in passing, that the headquarters of the Interahamwe was in her house for the secteur in which I lived.  
Q.	Witness, do you know how many members of the Presidential Guard you saw on that day?  
A.	There were two presidential guards, and I recognised them because of the uniform they were wearing.  I do not know whether there were others wearing civilian clothes, but I heard them say that the person whose name I've already given, and I do not wish to repeat in open session -- so it was that person who confirmed subsequently that the two people in uniform I had just seen were members of the Presidential Guard.  
Q.	And, Witness, what was that uniform? 
A.	I wonder whether you are familiar with the uniform of Habyarimana's army.  It was a camouflage uniform.  That was the uniform worn by those two troops. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which two troops, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I'd already said there were troops of the Presidential Guard, as well as the Interahamwe accompanying Angeline, in addition to the other people I already mentioned.  I already referred to those two Presidential Guard troops.  I wonder if you want further explanation regarding those two Presidential Guard soldiers?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The point is this, Mr. Witness.  How do you distinguish the Presidential Guard from the normal Rwandan army?  How were you able to do that?  Can you help us with that?  
THE WITNESS:
Presidential Guard soldiers did not wear the same uniforms as the other soldiers.  Their uniforms and berets were different from those of the other army units.  As a matter of fact, each unit has its own uniform.  For someone living in Rwanda, especially in Kigali, I knew that the gendarmes had red berets, soldiers had blue berets, and there were some soldiers with camouflage berets.  And I identified those soldiers as Presidential Guard troops because they were in Presidential Guard uniforms. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:  
Q.	Witness, it is your evidence that Presidential Guard soldiers had camouflage berets, is that what you said? 
A.	I don't think we should have a fixation on this issue of colour of the beret.  Even if I was mistaken, the person who was my neighbour confirmed to me that they were troops of the presidential guards, and I also had noticed that there were soldiers of the Presidential Guard.  So I don't think their uniform should be at issue here.  Rather, we should focus on what happened at my neighbour's place.  What was the source of the problem was not their uniform.  
Q.	Witness, did you see the berets worn by those soldiers of the Presidential Guard on that day?  Yes or no? 
A.	I saw them.  They were wearing camouflage berets.  
Q.	Did you know that at that time Presidential Guard soldiers were, rather, wearing black berets?  
A.	Counsel, let me tell you something.  I was not a soldier, I was a civilian.  And I've told you that we should not engage in such arguments regarding the berets.  But from what I observed, and from what I was told, I've retained what I've told you.  So I don't think we should belabour these points regarding the berets or the uniforms.  Rather, let us focus on the massacres committed.  
Q.	In this connection, Witness, I am putting it to you that if you are unable to describe the uniforms worn by those soldiers you state you saw, then it means that you did not see anything on that day.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	When I started giving evidence, I did not say that I was testifying against Presidential Guard soldiers.  I testified against Angeline Mukandituye and those accompanying her, that is, the Interahamwe.  When the trial of the Presidential Guard soldiers will start, then I will be ready to come and testify.  But I don't think that it should be an issue today, because I don't know where you're driving at.  
Q.	I also put it to you that you did not see Angeline Mukandituye that same day.  What do you have to say, sir? 
A.	Do you mean that I didn't see Angeline?  Where?  Where do you say I did not see Angeline Mukandituye?  
Q.	At Vincent Mugiraneza's place, Witness.  
A.	I am under the impression that you keep on backtracking.  I have already told you who the person directing that attack was, and I told you it was Angeline Mukandituye.  What else do you want?  I've already told you she was the one who directed that attack.  What do you want as an answer from me, Counsel?  
Q.	Witness, exactly when did you leave your place to go to CELA?  
A.	That I've already explained that, Counsel.  I said I left my place one week after the attack against Habyarimana's plane.  And I explained that I no longer remember the exact date.  But, approximately, it was one week following the date when the president's plane was attacked.  
Q.	So if I were to put it to you that it must have been between the 13th and the 15th of April 1994, would you agree with me? 
A.	That is the way you construe it, sir.  But personally, I know that in my statement I was hesitant regarding the date, but I remember it was one week after the attack against the presidential plane.  But if you have those two specific dates, I am unable to confirm them on account of the time which has elapsed since those events and today.  And in this connection, I would like to crave the indulgence of the Trial Chamber with regard to dates. 
Q.	Witness, rest assured, even the Defence will not take offence if there's any problem regarding the dates.  All we want is to give an objective review of the events.  May I ask you, Witness, how many days you had been at CELA before the incident of the 22nd of April 1994? 
A.	I would say about one week, or slightly more than one week.  Because if we count one week after the 6th of April -- I cannot remember the exact date.  Because, you see, I don't want that to be an issue.  Approximately, I would say I'd spent about one week at that centre. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, do you know how many rooms the refugees were occupying while you were at the CELA centre? 
A.	I told you that we were harboured in rooms, and I did not count the rooms harbouring refugees.  I'm unable to give you the number.  I am simply familiar with the circumstances under which we fled our homes, and the place we went to take shelter.  Don't put questions to me regarding the number of rooms which we occupied.  I know there were many rooms, and there were many of us.  All those things happened a long time ago.  And I didn't try to count the number of rooms accommodating refugees.  All what I know is that we fled our homes to go and take shelter in that centre. 
Q.	Would you remember how many of you were there in the room which you occupied?  
A.	There were many of us, but I cannot remember the exact number.  But there were quite a few of us in that room.  Don't ask me to give you a specific figure.  When I say we were many, it means we were more than ten in the room where I was.  Besides, I just told you that I did not conduct a census.  I didn't count those people.  I didn't have the time to do that.  
Q.	If you were more than ten, Witness, then you should be able to remember the number of women and children who were in your own room.  Can you remember that? 
A.	I am unable to remember that.  I cannot know the number of women, children, or men in that room.  You cannot be in a state of fright, and you start counting people.  We were not in a census exercise.  Perhaps those who conducted a census could give you a figure.  We all had the same problem; we were hiding so as to escape the massacres, and we were a waiting our impending death.  I was not able to conduct such a census.

	1515H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	While you were there, did you have the time to go and see Mr. Mugiraneza? 
A.	We were all together in those rooms; we were all faced with the same problem.  Everyone was speaking to everyone else; we trusted one another.  So I was able to speak with Mugiraneza 
and the -- the other people in that centre.  
Q.	So, Witness, if I understand you properly, you could move from one room to the other while you were at that centre; was that the situation? 
A.	Yes, that was possible, the rooms were not locked.  I told you that the priests had locked their offices, but the rooms were open, and they had left without giving us anything.  They took their belongings and left.  By the time I arrived there, the refugees had nothing.  Those who had preceded me there had nothing, so people could meet without any problems and discuss about their common difficulties; it was quite normal. 
Q.	But though you were able to move about, you are unable to remember the approximate number of rooms where you met other refugees? 
A.	I have told you that I did not make a census.  I am sorry, Counsel, but please don't put questions to me regarding the number of rooms.  Rather, put questions to me regarding the circumstances under which people died.  I cannot give you the number of rooms, nor can I give you the number of people who were in those rooms.  All what I can say is how people were killed.  But, right now, when you see people who were with you and who survived, that is when you can make an assessment of how many people were killed.  But you need to carry a census to get all those figures.  

However, concerning the number of rooms, I have told you I did not count them.  Perhaps there's someone who conducted a census -- maybe with the intention of killing those people.  Perhaps that person may be able to give you the number of rooms and the number of occupants in those rooms.  
Q.	Witness, how many rooms were there between the place where you yourself were and the place where Mr. Mugiraneza was? 
A.	What I remember is that in that room where I was -- even though I did not count the number of rooms, what I can tell you is that I think I was in the same room with Mugiraneza.  I believe that was the case.  Those were large rooms, which had perhaps been meeting rooms before, and there were many people in those rooms.  I did not go back to the place to count the rooms.  I believe that since the 
22nd of April 1994, I have never set foot at that place again.  
Q.	And what about that person, whose name I'm not going to mention, but whom you said was able to escape from the incident at CELA?  Was that person in the same room with you or was he in another room? 
A.	I cannot give you an answer, Counsel, without knowing who you are referring to.  You are telling me that the person who survived was the person at the CELA centre or outside.  Give me the information regarding the circumstances under which that person survived, then I'll be able to answer you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned 40 persons and said that only one of them survived.  That's the one he is referring to.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness just mentioned the name of that person and the interpreter is wondering whether to do the same thing in open court, that is.
THE WITNESS:
Now you put a question to me which compels me to mention that person's name and we are in open court.  I don't know how to answer that question of yours, Counsel.  I don't see the relevance of that question when we are in open court -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any problem in mentioning that name, I cannot see that?  
MR. MOSES:
No, as long as counsel only refers to the name and no other information -- yes, I see no problem.  I led it in open court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  
THE WITNESS:
Now, Counsel, you can repeat your question and I'm going to oblige you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, my question was as follows:  Were you in the same room with Mr. Bitega or not? 
A.	It is difficult for me to remember the exact location of people.  I knew him, but no longer recollect whether we were in the same room or whether he was in another room.  I have kept on telling you that I didn't pay attention to such issues.  Rather, you should put questions to me about what happened to him.  I knew most of the people who were there.  And, besides, it was a long time ago; I no longer remember all the people who were with me.  I'm afraid I cannot answer that question.  Put questions to me regarding the crimes committed and put specific questions regarding what happened to each and every one of those people.  I know those people very well.  For instance, ask me how I got to know him; but, don't ask me in which room he was.  It is when I try to reminisce about what happened at CELA that I am able to remember certain people who were with me there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, the Bench understands what you are saying.  We do not need to hear the same explanations over and over again.  Could you kindly, when these brief questions are asked, answer them with very few sentences?  Often a yes and a no will be sufficient, and then other questions will follow.  Can you help us with that, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I will try to be terse.  But, you see, Defence counsel is putting questions to me which are similar to earlier questions he had put to me and which questions I'd already explained, and I don't like repeating myself.  But, as you have said, I will try and be brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And it's very good that you do not like to repeat yourself.  Just continue with that.  

Now, here comes the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I think this is the best way of putting the question to you.  Should I take it that you also don't remember the rooms where Charles Rwanga and the others -- that is, Charles, his children and his wife, including Albert, whom you mentioned in your testimony, where they were located? 
A.	I have told you that most of those people were with me.  But I stated further that you did not have to ask me where each and every one of those people was located -- in which specific room.  But those people whom you just mentioned were in the same room with me, except Mr. Ruhanga, who was in hiding in a separate location.  But most of those people were with me.  So I don't want to repeat this -- I've already mentioned it. 
Q.	So should I conclude, Witness, that most of the refugees were in a single room and that just a few other refugees were located in another room?  
A.	Here comes my answer:  We were in several rooms; there was not only one room.  So I think that addresses your problem, because I don't really think that that is what is indeed important in my testimony. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to know how many refugees were there in all, at that time, including you, of course? 
A.	That is a question I've answered already.  I have told you we were many, but I can't remember the exact number of refugees.  I told you I did not conduct a census.  I told you I did not try to remember who had died and who had survived to be able to give you a specific figure.  And as the President himself has said, I don't want to repeat myself; that is a question I've answered already. 
Q.	Witness, the Defence needs specific information about this.  Were you more than 100, more than 200 or more than 300?  I believe you can make a difference between those three figures.  
A.	I told you that on that occasion, more than 40 people died and many people survived that day.  I cannot give you a specific figure.  I simply told you we were many.  I gave you the number of people who were killed and I told you many of us remained at that place.  In any case, we were more than 100; we were quite many.  
Q.	So, when more than 40 people were taken away, do you have an idea about how many men remained there? 
A.	Yes, there were quite many of us there, but I can give you some names of certain men there.  
Q.	Spare me the names, Witness, just give me an approximate figure, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, no names now, Mr. Witness, only figures.  
THE WITNESS:
I would say about 20 men remained at CELA and they survived.  Now, if the Court wants the names of those people, I can give the names in writing.  I won't do that now -- you see, we are in open session.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, Witness, one can reasonably conclude that as of the 22nd of April, you were about 60 men at CELA? 
A.	Those are the people I remember very well and whose names I know.  But there were other people there whose names I didn't know.  I'm talking to you about the people I knew very well -- neighbours who were in the same secteur as I was.  But there were people who had come from elsewhere -- for instance, from Rugunga, or from other neighbourhoods in Kiyovu or even Gikondo.  This should be very clear.  I did not know all those people.  Some of them had even come from Kacyiru, so you'd understand that I didn't know them.  
Q.	Witness, all those people -- all those men who had come from elsewhere, approximately how many of them remained after about 40 men had been taken away from CELA? 
A.	I have told you that I did not conduct a census.  I did not make an inventory.  I did not try to know how many men survived at that centre.  I was at that place to seek refuge.  My mind was not thinking about counting those people -- making a headcount.  Perhaps Préfet Renzaho, who was the chief administrator at the PVK, could give you such figures.  He can tell you how many people were at Rugenge secteur, because there were figures.  We had data -- data provided to him by the conseillers and the responsables of the cellule, so he can give you those figures.  
Q.	Witness, could you briefly describe to the Trial Chamber, CELA at the time, and also by locating the area where people were carrying out community work, as well as the room in which you had sought refuge?  Could you give a brief description of the location, if that is possible? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, it's absolutely impossible to answer such a long and compound question briefly.  So if you really want this information, you must split it up.  We will never end with that answer.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Very well, Mr. President, I shall do so. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, from the entrance of CELA, can you tell the Trial Chamber where, exactly, was the room in which you had sought refuge? 
A.	I do not know whether you have already visited the CELA centre so that I can tell you in which room I was.  I do not know whether you have a plan of CELA or a sketch, and then I could tell you in which room I was.  For you to be able to understand where the room was located, you should either have a plan of the area or you should have visited CELA. 
Q.	Witness, from the main entrance of CELA, there is a building which is along the corridor, am I correct? 
A.	That is correct, but there is a -- some distance between the main entrance and this building you are talking about, because immediately after the main entrance, there's a courtyard, and the first building is the one where there is a room, and it is exactly there that I was. 
Q.	So, as you see, it was easier to answer my question in that way, Witness.  

Witness, the day before the incident of the 22nd of April 1994, was there any incident whatsoever at CELA? 
A.	That was a long time ago and I do not recall whether there was any incident prior to the event I referred to.  Are you talking about the day before the incident or any incidents which would have come before the major event we talked about? 
Q.	Generally speaking, Witness, during your stay and until the 22nd of April, was there any other incident? 
A.	I told you that I had arrived there towards the end of the week when the president died, and I do not believe there was any specific incident in CELA until that date of the 22nd of April.  Oh, I have just remembered one detail because, as you know, this was a long time ago.  I do not recall the exact date, but while I was at CELA, I remember that Interahamwe came to seek refuge where we were.  I remember one Aluwa, Joseph, who came and who told us that he was trying to seek refuge there.  He spent the day in CELA -- and, if my memory serves me well, there was some fighting at the time against the Inkotanyi in Kacyiru, and people came running to CELA, among which the gentleman I just referred to.  And when Aluwa arrived at CELA, I believe it was before noon, he remained there until the evening and then, in the evening, he went back to his home.  And we believe that this same Aluwa was the one who had put -- had written the list of those who were at CELA, and which was used subsequently.  

So this occurred before the 22nd of April.  I did not mention this incident in my written statement, but I just remembered it -- thanks to the question put to me by Defence counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please spell the last name of Joseph? 
THE WITNESS:
Aluwa is spelt A-L-U-W-A.  I do not know whether I can proceed to explain to you where this name comes from, it is not a Kinyarwanda name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine, Mr. Witness, here comes the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let us now turn to this incident of the 22nd of April 1994.  When the members of the population arrived, were there gendarmes at the gates of CELA? 
A.	No, there were no gendarmes -- except for those who arrived in the company of Renzaho.  There never were any gendarmes at CELA, and the gendarmes were never in charge of that security of that centre ever since I had arrived there.  
Q.	And when the population got there, could you tell the Trial Chamber whether Mr. Renzaho and the other Interahamwe arrived at the same time or whether it was a bit later and how -- what time elapsed between this arrival and the arrival of the second group? 
A.	What I do remember is that Préfet Renzaho, as I already stated, arrived with two armoured vehicles on board of which were soldiers and gendarmes, and he was also accompanied by 
Bourgmestre Bizimana.  But I note that Defence counsel is asking me to repeat the names once again.  I do not know whether this might not take too much time, but the préfet was accompanied by the bourgmestre, the conseiller and the inspector.  They all came in the same group -- well, it's the Defence counsel who is forcing me to come back to -- to revisit the matter, even if that was not necessary, 
Mr. President. 
Q.	Witness, when you are saying that they all came in the same group, you referred to the members of the population who were carrying out community work.  Is it with those members of the population that Mr. Renzaho arrived? 
A.	If you followed me closely, I told you that the members of the population were cutting the bushes around the CELA centre, and they were saying that they were looking for the Inyenzi -- from what I was told subsequently.  You will understand that the préfet and the other officials I mentioned could not have gone into the bushes.  They sent members of the population for them to do this clearing work.  I believe you should put the question to your client because he was the one who was in charge of organising the community work, also known as umuganda. 
Q.	Witness, did you see the population arrive in order to carry out the community work -- and this from your vantage point on that day? 
A.	What I saw was that the bushes behind the centre were being cleared; we could all see that.  But when we left the centre in order to seek refuge elsewhere, we were able to see that; it was not very far.  The bushes were outside of the courtyard and all those who were in the centre could see such bushes, and this was not done without any noise.  There was a lot of noise.  The members of the population were shouting, "Where are the Inyenzi?"  If you had been in Rwanda at the time, I could have told you how the genocide took place.  Everything took place in broad daylight; there was no secrecy whatsoever.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are falling back to a bad habit.  Your answers are too long.  You see, what counsel wants to know now is very simple.  He wants to know the persons who started to clear the bushes, did they come before Mr. Renzaho or did he arrive together with them and send them in to clear the bushes?  Can you help us with that little bit in one sentence, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  If Defence counsel had worded his question in the way you did, I would have been able to answer it.  
The members of the population arrived there first and subsequently, Renzaho and his group arrived.  But, when Renzaho arrived, the members of the population were still busy clearing the bushes; they had not yet finished their work.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, which part of CELA were the members of the population clearing before Mr. Renzaho arrived? 
A.	Earlier on I told you that it would be easier if you had a plan of the buildings, but it was in the part that was down the road, because up -- in -- in the upper area, there was the tarmac road.  So it was in the direction of the Saint Paul centre.  If you have the sketch with the centre, you will be able to locate that area.  
Q.	When you are saying, "in the lower part", that is, after that room where you were, or was it in the upper part -- and this compared to your vantage point? 
A.	It was lower -- as if one wanted to go around the centre, and we could see the people who were clearing that area, and there was a lot of noise.  
Q.	Witness, we all know where the entrance of CELA is -- is that area on the left-hand side of the entrance, or the right-hand side of the entrance?  Where was it that the community work was taking place? 
A.	It is on the right-hand side of anyone who would be entering the centre.  
Q.	Witness, let me remind you that when one enters the centre, it is the building that we find -- it is the first building that one finds.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber which bushes were being cleared by the members of the population on that day? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That question was not clear.  

Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
I was just -- sorry, Your Honours, I was just trying to make the point, it's going to only get an unclear response.  In my opinion, this line of questioning, in the absence of any document or sketch or whatever, it's going to leave everyone, I think, somewhat confused. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What do want to achieve, Defence counsel?  I assume that you are disputing that the witness was there.  That can be the only aim of this line.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Then my objective is being reached, Mr. President, because I do not believe the witness should require a plan to tell me exactly what was taking place on that day.  And once I get the answer to the last question I just put to him, I'm going to prove that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you must be clear.  At least the English version was not very easy to understand and I also see the French version and am not convinced that you will ensure efficient communication.  So try again, please.  Kindly reformulate.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I shall do so, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I was telling you that when one is at the main entrance of CELA, as you described it, what one has on one's right is the building which is along the corridor and there are no bushes there.  I wish for you to tell the Chamber, on the basis of the description I have just provided, where were the bushes you are referring to that were cleared on the 22nd of April by the members of the population? 
A.	I don't know when it was that you visited the CELA centre, but if you were to visit it today, you would not see any bushes, because new buildings were built.  So I do not know when it was that you visited CELA for me to be able to explain to you.  There were even Eucalyptus plants, which are no longer there today, because at the location where such plants were, there are buildings today.  So please tell me when it was that you visited the centre and then I can provide explanations to you -- in 1994, or in 1995?  Because today, there are buildings there and you cannot imagine that where such new buildings are, there used to be trees and bushes.  So, please tell me when it was that you visited the CELA centre for me to be able to provide you with an answer that will take into account the knowledge you have of the centre.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, it's clear, Mr. Witness, that Defence counsel visited CELA after '94, that's obvious.  Now please do not repeat your answers over and over again.  Let' see whether we can now do this in an efficient way.  

We have P. 3, map of CELA; P. 4, map of CELA; P. 6, photo book of CELA.  So you have three documents, Defence counsel, that you can use in the communication with the witness.  If you really want to pursue this, in what way do you want to ensure that we achieve something? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I shall put the suggestion to the witness in order to conclude with this line of questioning, and I will not require the exhibit for that purpose -- even though I wish to thank the Chamber for having made such a proposal to me.  

And with your leave, Mr. President, I shall put one final question to the witness on this issue.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that from the entrance of CELA, the only bushes there were, were on the left side of the CELA entrance, that is to say, facing further up -- facing the building that is on the right and this is contrary to the description you provided whereby there were bushes further down.  There were no bushes there in 1994 and there are none today.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I would not go as far as saying that you are lying, but I did not make any mistake in my statement and I do not believe I am the only witness who has been called to testify on the incidents that occurred in CELA.  But regarding the bushes, the bushes were further down on the side of the facilities of JOC.  There's the entrance of CELA and today there are new buildings that were erected by brothers.  On the left-hand side, further up, it's the tarmac road, and further, we have the Kinyamateka buildings.  What bushes would there have been there?  Such bushes would not even have required that the members of the population be present to clear them.  

My feeling is that you're trying to delay the proceedings, and I am absolutely certain that there will be other witnesses who will explain this to you.  There were bushes that went all the way to the Saint Paul centre, and passing further up, as you stated, one could not reach the Saint Paul centre because one would have to first cross the buildings of the Kinyamateka newspaper. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we move on? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I did not follow the -- the answer (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you not hear the witness's last answer or my remark? 
MR. NEKUIE:
It is your observation which I did not hear, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My suggestion is that it is probably wise if you could move on to the next line now.  That was also your intention, I understood.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Indeed, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what was the time that elapsed between the time the work started and Mr. Renzaho arrived? 
A.	It did not take very long.  I told you that the community work had started in the morning, and Renzaho also arrived during the morning.  And I told you that the operation continued until early afternoon.  I cannot give you any exact time at which Renzaho arrived, but I can confirm that the community work was still ongoing when Renzaho arrived on the site.  
Q.	In what vehicle did Mr. Renzaho arrive, if you recall?  Do you remember the make of the vehicle? 
A.	No, I can not remember on board which vehicle Mr. Renzaho arrived.  I simply said that he arrived on board his vehicle.  So, there was his vehicle, the pickup truck, which took the people away, as well as the armoured vehicles.  I did not -- I was not in a position to check and thus be aware of the make of the vehicle.  
Q.	Did all the vehicles come into the courtyard of CELA, Witness? 
A.	I remember that it was only Renzaho's vehicle that came into the compound and that the others remained outside, behind the gate.  But Renzaho's vehicle entered the compound.  
Q.	And who was with Mr. Renzaho -- in the vehicle? 
A.	Counsel, you are making my life difficult when you're asking me who was with Renzaho in the vehicle.  I only saw the person who went on board the vehicle when the vehicle left.  I already gave you the list of those who were with him, but I did not pay attention to the other people who were in the vehicle.  
Q.	Witness, how did those who were accompanying Mr. Renzaho arrive, do you recall? 
A.	I told you that we saw them when they entered the compound of CELA.  So I do not know how they got there.  I merely saw them once we were asked to come out.  I do not know how they arrived at the centre.  I only saw them enter the compound.  
Q.	What about the escort you mentioned, Witness?  Was it around Mr. Renzaho when he arrived? 
A.	What escort did I refer to, Counsel?  I was talk -- I -- I referred to the people who came with him.  When you're talking about escort, I have a feeling you're talking about those who were in charge of his personal security.  I made no such reference to bodyguards.  

Furthermore, he himself was well aware of the incident.  Unless he is disputing that there were incidents in CELA and is disputing that he was present.  

Mr. President, could you please ask the Accused whether he is disputing the fact that he was present at CELA on that occasion, so that this will put an end to the questions put to me by counsel, who is repeatedly dealing with the same issues?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not the time to ask that question, Mr. Witness.  But we are now well into your cross-examination and I do not think there is so much left, so please be patient.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to read a small portion, a very small portion of your statement of 2004 to you.  It's actually the last page of your statement, page 4 of the French version, the beginning of the fourth paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please start.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now this is what you said: 

"On the 22nd of April 1994, we were visited by Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho, escorted by a group of soldiers and about 20 Interahamwes -- some of whom I knew."  

That is the only passage I'm going to read out to you to refresh your recollection to the fact that indeed you mentioned him being escorted.  So I am pleading with you to describe to the Chamber how that escort was accompanying Mr. Renzaho when you saw them arrive.  
A.	Thank you for that question.  In fact, I think I've already explained that.  You just said that in my statement I mentioned Renzaho's visit.  Actually, we thought the préfet was visiting us; that is why we immediately came outside, because we thought it was for our protection.  So you yourself have read that we were rather delighted at the visit.  

About his escort, the soldiers accompanying him carried firearms.  I don't remember saying that they were providing his protection.  I even said that there were gendarmes and other personalities there.  That is what I said in my statement.  I don't know what you want me to explain to you in that statement.  
Q.	When Mr. Renzaho ordered that men be picked out, as you said, how far were you from him? 
A.	But, Counsel, I have the impression that you always want to take us back.  Don't ask me how far I was from him.  It is impossible for me to tell you how far we were.  But even in this courtroom, we can hear one another.  We were in a queue, but don't ask me the exact distance separating me from 
Mr. Renzaho.  I just gave you the example of this courtroom where anyone sitting in this courtroom -- at any corner of this courtroom can hear anybody else in this courtroom who is speaking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and let's use this courtroom now, Mr. Witness.  You are sitting where you are, would you say that the distance is, for instance, between you and Defence counsel, or between you and me, or between you and one of the booths on the two sides of the courtroom?  What would be your estimate? 
THE WITNESS:
We had been lined up -- we had been asked to line up, but the women were not part of our group.  So, we had lined up so as to hear him.  We thought he had good tidings for us.  So the men queued up on one side and women queued up on the other side.  So, from the place we were, we could hear and see what was being said and done.  So after he asked us to line up, that was the time when names on the list were read out, the names of the most wanted people.  So everyone could hear what was being said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the question is very simple:  What was the distance between you and Mr. Renzaho, and we realise that it's very difficult after 12 years to estimate metres, but since you yourself referred to this courtroom, can you compare the distance with something inside this courtroom?  Would you say it's from that one to that wall, or is it from you to the Bench, or is it from you to Defence counsel? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the same distance -- like the one between me and Préfet Renzaho at this instant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, according to the courtroom measurements, the distance between the witness to the middle of the first row of the Defence is 7 metres and 40 centimetres, so about 8 metres then.  We realise that this is only an estimate.  

Next question? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you said during your evidence-in-chief that Mr. Renzaho gave a list to Mrs. Mukandituye and told her that she could take whoever she wanted.  Is that what was done in the final analysis -- or, were those picked out only those whose names were on the list? 
A.	I said that after Renzaho gave the list to Angeline Mukandituye -- telling her to take whoever she wanted -- the names on the list were read out, and those were the people who went away -- those whose names were on the list.  After that, he told the others to return to their homes -- that that is where their security would be ensured.  
Q.	You gave the names of some of the people who were on that list.  Obviously, should I consider that your name was not on that list? 
A.	My name was not on that list -- otherwise I would've went with the others.  Besides, there were other men who stayed back and who were my neighbours; that is why I'm telling you that those who left were the people whose names were on the list.  Let me, however, point out that subsequently some of those people who stayed back on that occasion were killed.  
Q.	According to you, Witness, were those picked out people -- who had a common denominator, which made it possible for them to be picked out. 
A.	What common denominator are you referring to, Counsel? 
Q.	From what you could observe on that day, was there something common to all those people which warranted them being picked out on that day? 
A.	Sir, kindly give me an example of one of those criterion so that I'll be able to answer you.  I don't quite understand your question.  
Q.	Since you all knew one another, were those wanted senior Tutsi officials, or were they Inkotanyi -- that is, people who had infiltrated -- that is, young people?  Or was it simply that you did not know what the criteria were? 
A.	Who told you those people were the Inkotanyi?  The Inkotanyi were not in Kigali; they were in Byumba.  They were not Inkotanyi; they were Tutsi who had gone into hiding just as we had.  And if they had been the Inkotanyi, they would have defended themselves.  They were Tutsi civilians who, just like me, had sought refuge.  
Q.	But, Witness, you said other Tutsi civilians stayed back, but not all of them were picked out.  Why? 
A.	I explained to you that the names on the list were read out, and the people whose names were read, were taken away on the orders of Renzaho.  Then, Renzaho told us to leave that location and to return to our homes where we would be protected.  But, that was not true.  I don't want to dwell on this because it is something I have visited comprehensively.  I said that I realised I could not go and seek refuge elsewhere -- but, for instance, I could not go to the Sainte Famille site, given that Munyeshyaka was responsible for that site was -- was participating in the attack.  I even explained that most of the CELA survivors who went to the Sainte Famille site were subsequently killed.  I will end there, 
Mr. President, so as not to waste time.  But, once again, let me ask Defence counsel to refrain from constantly taking us back.  
Q.	Witness, kindly do your duty to shed light on issues and questions being put to you and to refrain from making such comments to Defence counsel, who is doing only his job.  Can we agree on that? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that doesn't call for any comment.  

What is the next question?  I understand this witness's testimony as being, that his perception of the relevant criterion for selecting people was that their names were read out.  That is what he knows.  I think that is the situation.  Where do we go from now? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you said when those people were picked out -- they were taken away in that pickup truck, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Did the pickup truck enter the compound so as to carry those people -- or, were they led outside the compound before they got into the pickup? 
A.	Now, let us take the example of the door behind you.  The door was there.  The pickup remained behind the door and it was at this level where I am that the people were taken away in that vehicle.  I don't know how you want me to be more graphic.  The Interahamwe were armed -- and when someone is being taken to be killed, it all happens and unfolds very fast.  It was just like sacks of beans were being loaded into the vehicle.  I won't say it was outside or inside the compound; it was actually at the gate. 
Q.	And at the time that they were entering the pickup, do you know exactly where the pickup was heading to? 
A.	I didn't know immediately, but I learnt subsequently.  As I told you, I had a good neighbour, and when I left the CELA centre to return to my home, it was that neighbour who told me all what had happened.  He was the one who described to me how those people had been taken away from the CELA centre, the destination they had taken and the circumstances under which they were executed.  We subsequently conducted investigations to confirm and ascertain that -- even when you are in hiding, you do all what is in your power to know how your relatives were killed.  
Q.	So, did -- did that person, did he tell you the direction the pickup truck took? 
A.	I've already explained that, Counsel, but let me repeat myself.  The pickup truck went down towards the place where our secteur office was located.  I'd rather not mention the name of that place because we're in open session.  And along the road, they were killing the people who were in the vehicle up to the point where were located those mass graves; the place nicknamed CND.  And it was in that mass grave that they dumped the bodies, and I told you that during the exhumation, we were able to identify certain bodies by their clothes that the victims were wearing at the time they met their death and subsequently dumped in the graves.  
Q.	Regarding the pickup, Witness, can you remind the Court of how big the pickup was?  When you talk about the pickup truck, is it like a Toyota pickup, or is it like a tipper lorry? 
A.	It was a pickup.  A pickup is smaller than a lorry -- or, a tipper.  I did not pay attention to know whether it was a Toyota or a Daihatsu pickup.  All that I know is that it was not a tipper lorry, because a tipper lorry would be bigger. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is this word "kipper" or "tipper" lorry?  Can you help, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
It's spelt T-I-P-P-E-R, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A tipper lorry, thank you very much -- thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And all those 40 people, who had been selected, were carried at the rear of that pickup truck? 
A.	Yes, they were all carried in that pickup.  You can imagine for yourself the circumstances under which someone is taken to the abattoir; they are not really normal circumstances.  Such pickup trucks can even load as much as 100 people -- since they're being taken to be killed.  
Q.	When those people climbed into the pickup trucks, had they been tied? 
A.	No, they had not been tied, but what I know is that they were being manhandled when they were climbing -- some of them were even kicked around, and they climbed one on top of the other, none of them was even standing.  When you put such questions to me, I believe you're being deliberate.  How do you think someone being taken to the gallows is transported, Counsel? 
Q.	Did the Interahamwe also climb into the vehicle as well as the soldiers accompanying Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	I don't know what you want.  Are you asking whether they were in the same vehicle as Mr. Renzaho?  I didn't quite understand your question.  All that I know is that some of those Interahamwe were hanging on to the frames of the cabin and were even standing on the bodies of the people who were to be killed.  Renzaho did not accompany them; he simply gave the order that they be taken away.  He did not go with that vehicle accompanying the victims.  
Q.	Do you have an idea of the number of Interahamwes who were hanging on to the frames of the pickup truck, Witness? 
A.	I believe that in my statement I had already given the figure.  I talked about the number of people who had come with Renzaho, but there were also other people who were part of the population that was clearing the bushes.  I mentioned Nkeshimana, Castar and Bwanakweri -- they were also in their numbers and they were armed.  

I told you I did not conduct a census to know the number of Interahamwes who were present there -- the number of Interahamwes who left with the people who had been taken away from the CELA centre, but I'd given specifics in my previous statements. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we move on, we have, of course, Castar as 39 and Nkeshimana as 183, but what was that third name, do we have that? 
THE WITNESS:
I think it is Bwanakweri and that is not mentioned in my statement, but I can also remember other names as time goes on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, do we have it?  

Can you spell it, Mr. Witness, Bwanakweri?
THE WITNESS:
That name is spelt B-W-A-N-A-K-W-E-R-I.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we do not want you to add any other names, but have we now been through the three names that you mentioned.  You didn't mention more names, did you? 
THE WITNESS:
Actually, I mentioned four. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what is the fourth name, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I mentioned Nkeshimana, Bwanakweri, Fidèle, Castar and Faustin Rwagatara.  
MR. MOSES:
That's on the additional list at number 4, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Next question, please? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, concerning that pickup, which was carrying the 40 people who had been selected, I would like you to give me an approximate number of Interahamwe who were also on board, and who had been hanging on to the frames of the pickup to lead the people to be killed.  
A.	That is a question I just answered, Counsel.  I really don't understand why you are asking me the same question again.  I told you I did not make a census.  I gave those names in answer to that question, Counsel.  I said there were a number of Interahamwe who left with those victims. 
Q.	So there were many of them, but you cannot give an estimated number? 
A.	When I say there were many Interahamwe, actually, I mean there were more than 10 people.  Don't say I just said there were 10 of them, but what I mean is that there were more than 10.  
Q.	Witness, do you think that it is realistic for more than 10 people to be on board a pickup truck which is already carrying more than 40 people?  Do you think that is reasonable? 
A.	I told you that when people are sitting comfortably, that is not (sic) impossible.  But those were people being taken to their killing ground.  They had just been piled one on top of the other; it could have even been more than 100.  There were many people.  I think even some of them had to be killed on the way because there were so many of them.  I believe I have explained this already.  Let's not talk about the figures, let's talk about what happened.  Let's talk about how those people met their death.  But, the fact that the truck was full of people is not a problem to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a difference between the English and French version of what was said in Kinyarwanda.  I think the French version is correct.  I will read it: 

"I told you that when people are transported comfortably, that's impossible.  But those were people taken to be killed."

So now we have removed that discrepancy.  

Next question, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, among the people who were picked out, you told the Trial Chamber that many of them were people you knew quite well; am I correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	So these are people whose death remains in your memory, am I correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
(Pages 58 to 73 by Jean Baigent)












1630H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, do you remember having gone to give a statement dated 27th of April 1998 on those events at the level of the Rwandan judicial authorities?  
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	Do you recall also having gone, on the 20th of March 2000, to file a complaint against the people who were responsible for such incidents?  
A.	I do recall having made statements, but tell me about the crimes I mentioned, so that I can answer.  What specific statement are you referring to, Counsel, and who are those people I filed complaints against during such statements, for me to be able to better answer your question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You just referred to a document dated the 20th of March 2000, according to what we have in the transcripts.  Is that what you said, or did you say the 20th of March 2003?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, we have received a statement of the 20th of March 2000, but it is written the 20th of March 2003, and there is a written correction that has been put on the copy we have with us -- a handwritten correction.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right, thank you.  

And the question now?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let me refer to your statement dated 27th of April 1998, and I will only mention the reference you made to CELA in such a statement, because it would be tedious to read out all this statement.  It is document K03091 (sic), and I am on page K0163092. 

Witness, let me read out the very first question put to you on the second page.  And here is the question:  "All those 18 people, did they commit the same acts?"  And your answer is:  "Yes, they committed the same acts.  They were in the crisis committee.  His objective was to defend itself, get rid of accomplices by exterminating them."  

Let me read out the whole paragraph.  

"According to them, the accomplices were the Tutsi.  Regarding the acts they perpetrated, I personally know that they killed people in many places, namely CELA, Sainte Famille, and Saint Paul."  I shall stop here, and I would like to tell you that you referred to CELA.  Does this refresh your memory?  
A.	Yes, I do remember, Counsel.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  

Witness, could you, therefore, explain to me why, on the 27th of April 1998, you did not mention the name of Préfet Renzaho as being amongst the perpetrators or co-perpetrators of the CELA incident?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The Trial Chamber should make a distinction between the two documents.  In that statement I made in 1998 at the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, this statement is different from the statement on the CELA attack in which I mentioned Préfet Renzaho.  

Mr. President, I -- this might take some time, but I need to provide all the necessary explanations.  

When I made the statement at the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, I was not referring to the crimes that were perpetrated at the Saint Paul or Sainte Famille centres, because for me Renzaho was not concerned by such events.  And even for what happened in our neighbourhood, I did not refer to Renzaho.  But Renzaho participated in the events at the CELA centre, along with other people.  There are meetings I referred to, and for which I did -- I made no reference to Renzaho.  I only talked about Renzaho on the occasion of the meeting that was held in 1990.  

So you should not mix up the two documents.  The statement of 1990 deals with the people who lived in my secteur.  It is true that some of them were with Renzaho at CELA, so I did not need to refer specifically to Renzaho in that statement because he did not participate in all the crimes that were perpetrated by the -- these people who were living in my secteur.  So a distinction should be made between the two statements.  
Q.	Witness, in your complaint dated 20th of March 2000, you wished to be heard on Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye.  Before I read out a short excerpt of this statement, I would like us to agree on one point.  You have mentioned these two persons as being -- as both being authors of the incidents in CELA perpetrated, along with Mr. Renzaho, on the 22nd of April 1994; am I correct?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  Let me seize the opportunity to tell you that the people I talked about in the framework of the crisis committee, I would like to say that I have filed complaints against them and I can provide explanations.  I could not mention Renzaho when talking about the crisis committee or the Saint Paul centre.  When I went to testify before the public prosecutor's office, I did not refer to Renzaho because he was not involved in those specific cases.  I started with those who were my neighbours.  But even to this day, we are still filing complaints against other people.  I wish for this to be clear.  
Q.	Witness, let me read out a short excerpt of this record of hearing.  
MR. NEKUIE:
This is page PG001516, Your Honours.  And I would like to read out the second question put to the witness, as well as his answer, and then the third question put to him.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So here's the question put to you, Witness.  And I quote:  "Do you know Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye?"  And your answer is:  "I know them."  Question:  "What was their behaviour during the genocide?"  And your answer is quite lengthy, so that I will not read it out.  Do you recall having made such a statement in 2000?  
A.	I already provided explanations regarding that event.  I told you that I remembered having made the statement before the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda.  
Q.	In your lengthy answer regarding the behaviour of these two persons during the genocide, you did not refer at any point to any acts perpetrated by them, along with Mr. Renzaho.  Why is that? 
A.	Well, I do not know whether I'm being understood, Counsel.  I told you that I talked about Odette Nyirabagenzi and Angeline Mukandituye before the public prosecutor's office in Rwanda, within the framework of the crisis committee.  I talked about the meetings that were taking place; I talked about the crimes they had committed at the Saint Paul centre, as well as in my neighbourhood.  I explained to you that I could not talk about Renzaho and involve him in acts that had to do with the crisis committee when I had not noted his presence.  

I talked about Renzaho with regard to what happened in CELA.  You have to understand that they did not commit crimes only at CELA.  So I could not accuse Renzaho of what had occurred at the Saint Paul centre, or of anything that had to do with the crisis committee meetings when I was not aware that he was involved in such events.  I talked about these people, taking into account what had happened in CELA, but I also talked about them, describing other events in other sites where Renzaho was not involved.  
Q.	Witness, Mr. Renzaho had people who were dear to you killed, and on two occasions you go to the Rwandan judicial authorities, you talk about his accomplices and co-perpetrators regarding such events without ever referring to Mr. Renzaho?  Do you believe that such a thing is normal?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we do not need a repetition of the witness's answer now.  He has responded.  Opinions may be divided whether this is convincing or not, but the Bench has understood.  

Are there any other questions left?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I shall abide by the decision of the Trial Chamber requesting me to move on to another subject.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you were never at CELA on the 22nd of April 1994, and that you never saw Renzaho -- Mr. Renzaho there.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Are you saying that I did not see Renzaho on the 22nd of April?  But, Counsel, he is sitting right beside you.  Put the question to him and ask him whether he was not at CELA on that date, and then we can proceed.  Did you put the question to him, and did he tell you that he was not at CELA on that date?  Ask him whether he was not at CELA.  

Mr. President, the allegations made by Defence counsel are untruthful.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness maintains his version.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether I should interrupt the witness while he is speaking.  I was waiting for him to finish, and then I would continue.  Because a number of observations are made to me by the Trial Chamber, and if my cross-examination seems to be exasperating a number of people, I'm willing to stop at that point -- at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The situation is only that we want to avoid repetition.  And you did now simply put to the witness that what he said about CELA was not correct.  Then he gave a long answer.  In order to do this in an efficient way, we are summarising that he maintains his version.  That is the gist of all the questions that he is putting to you again.  

What is the next question?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what were the clothes that were on Charles Rwanga's dead body as you discovered it -- at Iyaremye's house? 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I don't believe he mentioned that particular person.  I think he referred to Albert from ORINFOR and one other person, but it was not the name that has been mentioned as one of the two bodies that he said he discovered.  I may be incorrect, but that's my strong recollection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Answer this question with a yes or no, Mr. Witness.  Did you see Charles Rwanga's dead body?  Yes or no?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, Charles Rwanga's body was never found.  And I made no reference in my testimony of the fact that he would have been found anywhere.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, on this matter, let me refresh your memory on the basis of your statement made on the 24th of November 2004.  Page 4 of the said statement, French version.  And let me read out the beginning of the fourth paragraph.  And this is what you state, Witness:  

"Angelina (sic) had a list of several people whom the Interahamwe called out and put aside.  Among them were Charles Lwanga (sic)" -- I assume it's Rwanga -- "a bricklayer, and his two sons, Wilson and Déglote, Emmanuel Gihana, and Albert.  The Interahamwe took them out of the CELA centre in order to kill them on the orders of Renzaho, who said, 'Take these people away.'  We found their remains in mass graves after the genocide.  We identified their bodies by the design on their clothes."  

Was that indeed your statement, Witness?  Yes or no?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Could you now answer the question I put to you previously, that is to say, what type of clothes were they wearing when you found their remains?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now the question is more general.  You want to know the clothes of the victims in plural.  

But the point here now, Mr. Witness, is that according to this -- this statement, Charles Rwanga seemed to be included amongst the bodies found.  Now, what is your comment on that?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is not correct.  I mentioned those that we were able to identify thanks to their clothes.  I talked about Albert and I talked about Gihana.  And even if you read out my statement again, Charles Rwanga is not mentioned amongst those who were identified thanks to their clothes.  I gave the names of those bodies we were able to identify by their clothes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that's the witness's answer.  Do you now want to pursue this in relation to the clothes of the other persons?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of my cross-examination, and the only thing that remains is for me to ask the Trial Chamber to kindly have admitted into evidence the documents I used throughout my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will do that in a moment.  

Now, any re-examination?  That's not the case.  

Are you ready to indicate the documents you want to tender, Mr. Nekuie?  Which one do you want to start with?  Do you want to start with the one on 27th April 1998?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 20.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the handwritten Kinyarwandan version, B for the French, C for the English.  
(Exhibit No. D. 20A, D. 20B, and D. 20C admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you then want to move on to the 20th of March 2000?  It follows from the original handwritten Kinyarwandan version that this is indeed from the year 2000, not 2003, which is in the English version.  So it's 2000, just as marked in the French version.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 21. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the handwritten Kinyarwandan version, B for the French, C for the English.  
(Exhibit No. D. 21A, D. 21B, and D. 21C admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you also read from the document 24th November 2004.  There we have only two versions typed.  The signed version is the French one.  A for the French, B for the English.  

And the number, Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 22. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And all these three will then be placed under separate cover -- under seal.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 22A and D. 22B admitted, under seal) 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm obliged, Mr. President. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, just one question, please.  Did I understand you to say that after October 1990, when Renzaho became prefect of Kigali, he instituted a procedure whereby everybody -- where people needed passes to travel within Kigali préfecture?  Is that what was -- was that your evidence?  

THE WITNESS: 
I believe I had not insisted on that point, but perhaps I can do so now. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
No, I just wanted to ask, was that your evidence?  Then I can ask the next question.  
THE WITNESS: 
I believe I have made such a statement, but I don't know whether I referred to passes.  But such passes were established in order to try and restrain movements of people so as to make the killings easier.  When the passes were instituted, it was an initiative from the Kigali town préfecture, and more specifically, an initiative by Préfet Tharcisse Renzaho in order to keep people in Kigali town, for them to be killed easily.  But before he was appointed préfet, there were no passes.  And even if you were to put the question to him, I do not think he would deny that.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I don't know whether I have answered your question. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, you have, but there is a second arm to the question.  Did this apply to everybody living in Kigali préfecture, or were there only certain persons who needed these passes?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  The laissez-passer was not required for all the inhabitants of Kigali.  The Tutsi alone were to get such a pass, and it was in fact a strategy to prevent the Tutsi from leaving the town of Kigali to join the Inkotanyi, or to go to other countries.  But the Tutsi would never be able to get the pass.  And in order to get the pass, one would have to give very convincing reasons.  

Let me give you my own example:  I was never able to get such a pass issued to me, and I'm not the only one.  If you conduct an investigation, you will hear about the situation that prevailed in Kigali town at the time.  It was not possible to leave one commune of the Kigali town préfecture to go to another because there was distrust vis-à-vis the Tutsi, and they were said to be Inyenzis who were infiltrating Kigali town.  The passes were issued only for the Kigali town préfecture, that is to say, in the three communes which made up this préfecture, that is to say Nyarugenge, Kacyiru and Gikondo -- Kicukiro, sorry.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  Thank you for having come the long way to Kigali -- to Arusha to testify in these proceedings, and we wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Thank you for having kindly listened to my testimony, and I would like you to indeed make use of this testimony during your deliberations.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a witness in the waiting room.  We will just be able to swear in that person.  I suppose he or she has been waiting for some time, and we should ensure that that has not been in vain.  
(Witness excused)
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, whilst we have the original signed by the witness, I don't know that we have ten copies to distribute.  I'm sorry for that.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will be referred to as Witness GLE in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness GLE in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's your signature at the bottom of the document you have in front of you, madam; isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's right, Mr. President.  The signature is mine.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information contained in that document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, it is.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 79.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal.  And we will have it distributed tomorrow morning to everyone in the courtroom.  
(Exhibit No. P. 79 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam Witness, we will commence your testimony tomorrow morning in this courtroom at 8:45.  

Anything of an administrative nature?  
MR. MOSES: 
Just to indicate that I do believe, bearing in mind the nature -- the place where the evidence that this witness is to testify about and its relation -- its proximity to her own residence, we're going to have to at least commence and lead most of the evidence which relates to that place in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is no objection, we will do that, and we will start in closed tomorrow morning.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1707H)
