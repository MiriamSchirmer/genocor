MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your cross-examination continues, and I understand that we are in open session.  Yes.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  

Actually, Mr. President, it was my understanding that yesterday, by the time we adjourned at the end of the afternoon session, we were in a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was also my understanding, and that's why I'm raising the issue now while we are in open session.  Do we agree that we need to continue in closed now?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I don't think so, Mr. President.  

Indeed, I'm sorry, I would like us to move to closed session because I have some issues of identity which I would like to put to the witness.  So my preference would be that we complete the cross-examination in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, let us do that.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness SAF in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness SAF in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document there, Mr. Witness, with your signature, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That is so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
It is.

MR. TREDICI: 
Good morning, Your Honour.  For the record, I am counsel for the Prosecution, and my name is Ignacio Tredici. I will be leading this witness.  The Prosecution would like to apply to go to closed session for two minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness SAF, we are now in open session and we will hear your examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you hear of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	When President Habyarimana died, let's say on the 7th of April or thereabouts.  
Q.	Did you hear about his death in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening or in the night of the 7th April 1994? 
A.	I had spent the night at home, and the members of the population said the father of the nation is dead.  So I went to ************* as usual.  I did not know that people would kill one another.  
Q.	So, Witness, I invite you again not to make any reference to places or situations that could disclose your identity.  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	So, what did you do after you heard of the death of Habyarimana?  Without mentioning the place where you went, if you went somewhere.  
A.	On the morning, I went to my place of work.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Who did you find at your working place that morning? 
A.	I found some of my colleagues. 
Q.	What happened when you got to your working place? 
A.	At some point in time we were told that no one had to move, that we had to remain where we were. 
Q.	Did you go back home that morning or after that morning? 
A.	At some point when it was said that no one was to move about, roadblocks were set up and everybody remained where they were. 
Q.	Could you describe the security situation in that area at that point in time? 
A.	The situation became very dangerous. 
Q.	Could you kindly describe what was the situation? 
A.	The situation changed immediately.  When roadblocks were set up, they started killing people.  And it was during the night when the father of the nation was murdered that they started assassinating ministers.  
Q.	Could you explain to the Chamber who were the target of these killings? 
A.	Those marked were the Tutsi, because at that time it was as if their fate had been sealed.  
Q.	And, then, what did you do after the killings had started? 
A.	I couldn't do anything.  You see, I, too, was afraid. 
Q.	And Mr. Witness, did you go somewhere, did you stay where you were?  What did you do after the killings had started? 
A.	I did not do anything.  I tried to hide, so as to survive.  
Q.	And where did you hide, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I hid in a bush not far from my home.  We hid ourselves there because at night one could not move about, given that roadblocks had been set up. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you just mentioned that you hid in a bush not far from your home.  Could you specify where did you hide? 
A.	I hid in that place because there was some shrubbery there, and we tried to hide in the shrubbery.  No one could move about.  We would lie on the ground and cover ourselves with grass, as if it was some sort of a blanket or a sheet. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you please mention the name of the place where you were hiding? 
A.	It was within the premises of the former (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, were you married in April 1994? 
A.	I was married with two kids.  
Q.	And where was your family at the time of these events? 
A.	I never saw them again.  We all tried to save our lives - or, rather, I did not see them at the time, but I saw them again at the end of the war.  
Q.	You said you were hiding at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  Did you go back home to check if your family was there? 
A.	No, it was not possible to move about, and it was for that reason that I almost abandoned my family because I thought that my family members had been killed.  But it was only after the war that I was able to see members of my family again and that I was able to go back to the area where my family resided. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many people -- if there were more people than you -- stayed at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) at the time of these events? 
A.	When the situation became difficult, some of the staff left and did not come back.  I believe there were around six of us who were not able to leave (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) because at a given point in time there were some of our colleagues who left and who never came back to (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).
MR. TREDICI:
Your Honours, there is a risk that the last answer of the witness could disclose his identity.  So the Prosecution -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will delete the two references to the workplace and place them under separate cover.  

Just refer to the place you worked as your workplace, Mr. Witness.  Will you please remember?  
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	You mentioned that there were six people at one point staying at your working place with you.  Do you know the ethnic origin of the people living there with you? 
A.	Some of them were Hutu, others were Tutsi.  At a given point in time, some Hutus decided to leave the workplace and we remained there in small numbers with people who could not move around because of the situation -- because of the prevailing situation.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the names of the Tutsis that were hiding at your working place with you? 
A.	No, I do not remember their names because that was a long time ago, and besides, some of them are deceased.  However, I do believe I remember one person's name.  
Q.	Could you please tell the Judges what's the name of this person? 
A.	There was one Posiani Tuganishuri, who resided at a rural area.  I have not seen him for quite a while.  Perhaps the other colleagues are still alive, but they live far away in the rural areas.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honours, I am afraid that this name is not in the amended list of common names.  
BY MR.TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you please spell the name of Mr. Posiani Tuganishuri?
A.	Did you say that you did not have that name, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
He said that we need your assistance to spell the name, please.  Can you do that?  
THE WITNESS:
Do you wish me to spell out the name, the Kinyarwanda name?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, both the first name and the last name.  
MR. TREDICI: 
If I may assist -- 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know how the name is spelt out.  I do not think I am in a better position to spell out names here compared to those present.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Tredici, please help us.  
MR. TREDICI: 
I will try to help the Chamber, Your Honour.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Posiani is spelt P-O-S-I-N -- excuse me, I-A-N-I.  Tuganishuri is spelt T-U-G-A-N-I-S-H-U-R-I. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the names of the Hutus that were living with you at your working place?  
A.	Listen, that was a long time ago.  I do wish that you would not ask me to give you their names. 
Q.	It's not a problem if you don't remember, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much.  At least, do you know if these people are still alive? 
A.	Those who worked in Kigali went back to their communes.  And if I have not seen them, it is difficult for me to know where they are right now and what their whereabouts are.  In addition, I am not going to carry out any inquiries to find them, because nobody has made such a request to me.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Do you know who the préfet of Kigali-ville was during that period of time?  
A.	Do you wish for me to give you those names?  
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Could the Prosecutor please repeat his question?  This is a request made by the French booth.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	If the witness could tell the Chamber who the préfet of Kigali-ville was at the time of the events.  
A.	It was Tharcisse Renzaho.  He was the préfet of the Kigali town préfecture. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, did you ever see him during the time you stayed at your working place? 
A.	I saw him during that period. 
Q.	Could you please tell the Chamber when did you see him? 
A.	Well, I saw him where I was, as I stated previously.  May I proceed?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	When I saw him at my place of work, it was when a meeting was taking place.  And, in the meantime, before his arrival, the conseiller had come to announce that a meeting would be held there.  And I saw Tharcisse Renzaho during the course of that meeting because he was introduced to us as an official.  
Q.	Do you remember when this meeting took place? 
A.	This meeting took place in mid-June.  The war was about to end because the Inyenzi were fighting in Gikondo and Mburabuturo, and was about to seize the town of Kigali.
MR. TREDICI:
Your Honour, for the record, Gikondo is number 66 on the list of amended common names.  I am afraid I cannot help you with the second name the witness mentioned.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mburabuturo.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is spelt, booth, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-B-U-R-A-B-U-T-U-R-O.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, will you please tell the Chamber where in particular at your working place did this meeting take place?  
A.	The meeting took place in front of the location I referred to, where there was a hotel. 
Q.	Could you please be more specific?  Was it in front of the working place, in the same compound of the working place, by the side of that compound? 
A.	It was not the side of that compound, but in front of the entrance of the building.  Since there was fighting going on in Gikondo, people were trying to avoid the bullets that might come from Gikondo. 
Q.	I would invite you to be more specific, please, and tell us if "In front" means in front of the entrance or in front of the compound.  Was it in the same compound, but in front of the entrance, or it was in front of the compound? 
A.	It was in front of the building, but within the compound in a location where people were sure that nothing could come from behind them, but it was still within the compound of my place of work. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know how Renzaho arrived at your working place that day? 
A.	Do you wish to know what he had come there to do?  I believe I misunderstood your question.  Do you want me to explain to you what he had gone there for?  
Q.	I would like you to explain to the Judges how he arrived.  Did Renzaho arrive by car, by bus, by walking?  How did Renzaho arrive at your working place that day?  
A.	On that day he arrived on board a military camouflage vehicle, and he came along with other individuals. 
(Pages 29 to 33 by Judith Baverstock)













1215H 
BY MR. TREDICI: 
Q.	Could you describe more the type of car you just mentioned?  And if there was one or two or three or more cars?  
A.	There were two four-by-four vehicles that were painted in camouflage pattern, and there were other vehicles with Interahamwe on board.  And he arrived with a number of other people who were accompanying him.  
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber who were the other people that arrived at your working place that day with Renzaho?  
A.	It was Renzaho himself, as well as one Setako.  There was also Bagosora, as well as Nsengiyumva. 
MR. TREDICI:
And for the record, Your Honours, Setako is number 260 in the amended list of common names, Bagosora is number 7, and Nsengiyumva -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
These are well-known names to our dear court reporters and everyone in the courtroom.  Thank you.  
MR. TREDICI: 
I apologise.  Your Honour -- excuse me. 
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember what Renzaho was wearing that day? 
A.	He was wearing a military uniform.  
Q.	And now kindly tell the Trial Chamber what time did this meeting take place? 
A.	The meeting did not last very long, and it was held between noon and 1 p.m.  And he made sure that the meeting would not last long because there was this problem of the gunshots coming from Gikondo, and one did not want the participants of the meeting to be reached by any stray bullets coming from the direction of Gikondo.  
Q.	How did you get to know about this meeting? 
A.	Before the meeting took place, Mr. Mbyariyehe, who was the conseiller for the town, informed us that a meeting would take place at that location, and that an official would talk to the population.  And that is why the population came to attend the meeting, because it was a pacification meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know where Mr. Mbyariyehe was conseiller of? 
A.	At the time, he was the conseiller of the secteur in which that area was.  And he was the one who introduced Renzaho, and then he gave him the floor after having told us that Renzaho would be the one to chair the meeting and would address the population.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do we have the spelling of this conseiller?  
MR. TREDICI: 
Yes, Your Honour.  He's number 136 in the list of common names.  I'm in the list of common names. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that he was the conseiller of the secteur where the meeting took place.  What was that secteur? 
A.	At the time, there was one secteur which covered the whole city, because we were in the middle of the city.  So he came to inform us of this meeting in his capacity as conseiller of that secteur. 
Q.	Could you please give the Trial Chamber the name of this secteur? 
A.	I do not recall the name of that secteur.  That was a long time ago.  Was it called Rugenge?  It might be Rugenge, because from the St. Michel cathedral and going down toward the Kiyovu neighbourhood, it was the town, and the person I referred to was the conseiller for the town. 
MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honours, I seek clarification from the interpreters.  I couldn't hear well if they mentioned Rugenge or Nyarugenge as being the name of this secteur.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What was the secteur you mentioned, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I do know that the person who came to us was the conseiller of the secteur for that locality, and he was the one who introduced that person who would come and address the population.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Name of the secteur, Mr. Witness.  Was it Rugenge or Nyarugenge?  
THE WITNESS:
I stated that the gentleman was the conseiller for the town secteur, and he was the conseiller of the secteur in which we were.  And even if you would go to the field to question people, they would tell you that he was the conseiller, whereas the Rugenge secteur you are talking about was further down the road.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Your Honours.  
THE WITNESS:
Nyarugenge covered the whole town, and at the time he was the conseiller for the town.  So I was not referring to Rugenge, because Rugenge started -- the Rugenge secteur started at the end of the road, and it was that neighbourhood that one called "the Kiyovu for the poor", whereas the location where we were was the other Kiyovu, which was called "the Kiyovu for the wealthy".  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  I don't think we want more information on this regard.  

Mr. Witness, did you attend this meeting? 
A.	Yes, I did.  I was present. 
Q.	In view of your ethnicity, did you have any problems attending this meeting?  
A.	If I was able to participate -- or to attend this meeting until the end, it is not because I had any specific strength, or I looked like anyone in particular, but merely because I had -- I was wearing clothes that did not make me obvious. 
Q.	Could you please describe in which way you were wearing clothes that didn't make your ethnicity obvious? 
A.	I had taken a pullover -- the arm of a pullover.  I had put two holes -- the sleeves, sorry, of a pullover.  I had put two holes in them, and I had put them over my head with only the two holes for my eyes, and no one could see what I looked like because I had hidden my face.  
Q.	Were there any Tutsis at this meeting? 
A.	Yes.  There were Tutsis there.  Because it was a pacification meeting, we were told that no one could harm anybody else. 
Q.	Who told you that no one could harm anybody else? 
A.	Those words were uttered by Renzaho, who was the préfet for Kigali-ville.  He said he had come to organise a pacification meeting, and that all those in hiding were to leave their hiding places because no one could harm others.  That peace would henceforth reign. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you please tell the Chamber who spoke first at this meeting?  
A.	I've already explained that.  What I said was that the first speaker was the conseiller, then Préfet Renzaho spoke to the people in attendance.  
Q.	And what did the conseiller say? 
A.	The conseiller spoke first, announcing that it was a pacification meeting, even though it was a way of misleading members of the public to take them out of their hiding places.  Then he introduced Préfet Renzaho to us and requested him to stand up.  We all gave Renzaho an acclamation.  
Q.	And who spoke after the conseiller? 
A.	Renzaho, the préfet. 
Q.	And what did he say? 
A.	Renzaho stood up, we gave him an acclamation because the conseiller had just asked us to bid that distinguished guest welcome.  So the préfet said we had been attacked, and that the enemy was staying steadfast.  Do you want me to continue?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	He said the enemy was staying steadfast, and he said the enemy was the Inyenzi and the Tutsi.  He said the enemy had attacked Rwandans, so we had to defend ourselves.  He said that to all those who were present, even those who had been hiding.  And most acknowledged that those who had been hiding had gotten out of their hiding places, because they had been told it was a pacification meeting.  So after we had welcomed the guests, the préfet told us that it was the Tutsi enemy who had attacked the country.  Now, the Interahamwe, who was supposed to be providing security, surrounded everybody because they said they wanted to prevent the Inyenzi from causing problems and infiltrating that place.  The Tutsi had even been told that they could return to their workplaces, even to the PVK, but those who went to the PVK were killed and the authority was not able to protect them, whereas some of the Tutsi were even killed right there on the spot.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, who spoke after Renzaho, if anyone spoke after Renzaho? 
A.	After Renzaho's address, Bagosora spoke, followed by Setako.  In fact, even Nsengiyumva was introduced to us.  We were told he was a guest who had come from Gisenyi. 
Q.	Now, could you describe the audience at this meeting?  How many people were in attendance of this meeting? 
A.	There were not many people in that residential area.  I would say there were about 30 people, not including the Interahamwe who were there and who were supposed to be ensuring security.  Of course, I'm giving you an estimate because I did not count those who attended the meeting.  
Q.	And where were you standing or sitting during the meeting?  Was it at the front, in the middle, or at the back of the audience? 
A.	During that meeting, I was in the rear.  I could not go close to those who were presiding over the meeting.  I was near other people.  You see, at the time you could not just start a chat with just anybody, because some people had become very wicked, and it was even impossible to speak to them.  
Q.	Could you estimate the distance between you and the speakers? 
A.	The distance between me and the speakers was short.  But as I'd already told you, my dressing made me inconspicuous and there was no reason for me to be afraid.  That is why I was able to follow that meeting up until the end.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you standing or sitting? 
A.	Those in the first rows were sitting, but those of us in the rear were standing so as to be able to listen to the speeches. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why do you say that you looked inconspicuous, Mr. Witness, when you had a pullover with two holes in and over your head?  You must have looked rather strange. 
THE WITNESS:
But that was the dressing of everybody, including the Interahamwe.  Those who were indulging in the killings had the same form of dressing.  They always covered their faces, even the soldiers were wearing helmets which covered their faces.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, coming back to the speakers, were they standing or sitting? 
A.	As I explained to you, whenever someone was speaking, he would stand.  When he was introduced, we would give him an acclamation or a round of applause.  So whenever a speaker stood up, we would give him a round of applause, then he would start his speech.  
Q.	You mentioned Setako and Bagosora were there.  Do you remember what Setako said, if he said anything, on that opportunity? 
A.	What he said was in no way different from what was said by the other people who were massacring people.  He said the enemy had attacked the country, and it was absolutely necessary to be vigilant, and we had to work together to fight the enemy.  Also, we needed to hunt down and eliminate the enemy.  
Q.	Who do you mean by the other people who were massacring people?  Because your answer was "Setako said -- what Setako said was in no way different from what was said by the other people who were massacring people".  Who were these other people you refer to?  
A.	Do you want to know who was massacring people?  Come on, Counsel.  When you have an animal at your home, and you give the animal to someone to slaughter it, is it the animal which commits suicide, so to speak, or is it the person who handed the animal over which should be considered as a killer?  It was Renzaho who handed people over, because he considered them as enemies who had attacked the country.  Then he did not want to ensure their security.  So he was the one who handed them over because he was an authority.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did anything out of the normal happen during this meeting besides the speeches? 
A.	Yes, because people were killed.  Do you think there is something more serious than killing people?  
Q.	Where were these people killed during the meeting? 
A.	There was no great distance between the place where those people were killed and the place where the meeting was taking place.  I don't know whether it was next to the prosecution department, but at the time there were flowers there.  When those people were killed, they did not intervene, whereas they ought to have insisted that those people be spared because they were human beings.  But instead of intervening in favour of the people being massacred, they were, rather, laughing. 
Q.	Who were laughing, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I am referring to the authorities.  Renzaho, the other authorities, and the Interahamwe.  When the victims were being slaughtered, the Interahamwe were bursting out in laughter, they were whistling. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, but you mentioned the authorities.  And my question is, who were the authorities, in plural, that were laughing when these people were being killed? 
A.	Let me start with Renzaho, then Setako was there, Nsengiyumva was there, and also the conseiller.  Actually, I started by mentioning the most important personalities because, you see, the conseiller was an authority, but of lower rank. 
Q.	And do you know the ethnicity of the people that were killed during that meeting? 
A.	They were Tutsi.  Who else would have been killed, according to you?  Because those who were handed over were the Tutsi.  Only the Tutsi were killed, because the killers could not have attacked people of their own ethnic group.  So those handed over were the Tutsi, by Renzaho. 
Q.	Did you know any of these people that were killed during the meeting?  
A.	The names, or the faces?  
Q.	The names, or the faces, if you knew any of these people from before.  
A.	The people whom I saw who had come to that meeting, dubbed pacification meeting -- you see, the people who were in hiding had been requested to start moving about.  So it was when those people had left their hiding places to come to the pacification meeting, that they were slaughtered. 
Now, about knowing whether I knew their faces, I recognised them because I had seen them.  
Q.	Have you seen them before the day of the meeting?  Or before, during, the meeting?  
A.	Before that meeting, those being wanted were hiding, and they got out of their hiding places when they were told there was a pacification meeting.  Otherwise, even before the pacification meeting was announced, people had remained in their hiding places.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many Tutsis were killed during the meeting? 
A.	Firstly, there were four gentlemen dragged across the tarmac road separating us where we were from the prosecution building.  Those four gentlemen were killed on the spot, and that happened in front of the eyes of those people who didn't want to intervene to save them.  
Q.	Could you please name these people that you say didn't want to intervene to save them? 
A.	Do you mean those who did not want to intervene to save people?  Let me start with Renzaho, then I will mention Bagosora, Setako, and also Nsengiyumva, who were very influential people, even more influential than the conseillers of secteurs.  Because the conseillers only obeyed instructions given by those senior authorities. 
Q.	Could you describe how were these Tutsis killed? 
A.	The préfet had given orders to the effect that each member of the population had to be armed either with a machete, or with a nail-studded club.  So those people killed on that occasion were killed with those weapons.  
Q.	How far from where Renzaho and the rest of the authorities were sitting, were these Tutsis killed? 
A.	But it was very close to the place where those authorities were sitting.  The only thing separating those two points was the road.  When they saw the Interahamwe shouting and hitting the victims, what did they think?  What did they think they were witnessing?  
Q.	Were there any visual obstacles between Renzaho, the authorities, and the location where the Tutsis were killed, according to your recollection? 
A.	No.  There was no obstacle.  They witnessed the entire scene.  And instead of intervening to put an end to that macabre and gory scene, they were, rather, laughing.  That is why those people died.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And how far were you away from the killing yourself?
THE WITNESS:
But I was very close by.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you give us an estimate?  You gave us an estimate about the distance between the meeting and the killing place.  But now I want the distance between your position and where people were killed.  Can you help us, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I told you that those two places were very close to one another.  Why could those authorities not have been able to -- not to see what was happening?  You see, it was out in the open in broad daylight, and those authorities could see what was going on because I, myself, could witness the scene.  The only difference between me and those authorities was that while I was scared, they weren't scared of anything.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The distance, Mr. Witness.  Can you give us an estimate?  20 metres, 40 metres, 5 metres, between you and where the killing took place?  
MR. TREDICI: 
If I may be of assistance, Your Honour, maybe the witness could point -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I've heard what the witness said.  I appreciate your attempt to assist, but let's see whether he can help us. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I did not measure the distance, but I would say that it was, at most, 20 metres, because it was just a question of crossing the tarmac road to the other side at the place where flowers were being displayed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you ever seen Renzaho before that day? 
A.	I had seen him when he was in the office, which was the commune office located near the Saint Michel cathedral, and I must state that on that occasion he was in civilian clothing.  
Q.	How far were you on that day from where Mr. Renzaho was sitting or standing? 
A.	I was close to him, because he was standing in front of the veranda of the commune office building.  
Q.	So how many times in total have you seen Renzaho? 
A.	I saw him on that occasion in the commune office building.  Then I used to see his picture in newspapers.  And I must state that I used to see his picture regularly in newspapers, when I saw him again in military attire in the location I already mentioned.  
Q.	How did you get to know that the person that spoke on that meeting was Renzaho?  The meeting at your working place.  
A.	I've already explained that all the authorities were introduced, so he was introduced as an authority who was coming to direct that meeting, and we applauded him on that occasion.  So you can understand that we could not have given an applause to someone without having first known whose identity it was.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you describe Tharcisse Renzaho as you saw him that day during the meeting?  
A.	That was a very long time ago.  He was a huge gentleman, and he was dressed in military attire.  But when I saw him in the commune office, he was wearing a suit, he was sporting eyeglasses, and he was also balding.  I don't know whether his physical features has changed from the last time when I saw him and today.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you think that you could recognise Renzaho if you saw him today? 
A.	If I were to see him today, I may be able to recognise him if he's still bald.  Because if, in the meantime, he has grown hairs, I won't be able to recognise him.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Could you please stand up, look very carefully around you, and tell us -- around the court, please, look very carefully around the court -- and tell us if Mr. Renzaho is present today.  Look very carefully around the court.  
A.	I last saw him a long time ago, but he looks like the person I'm seeing there at the end.  
Q.	Could you please tell the Judges where is this person you're referring to, where is he sitting and what is he wearing today? 
A.	He's the one sitting at that end, but it is possible that I am mistaken because it happened a long time ago.  But I think he's the one. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You're now pointing to the left-hand side of you, Mr. Witness.  On which row in that direction is this person sitting?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm talking about the person sitting at that end, Mr. President.  I don't know if I am mistaken.  But even though it has been a long time, I think that person I'm seeing there looks like Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, is it -- can you see there are different rows or benches in the courtroom on that side?  There are some sitting behind there, and some are sitting in the front.  Where is this person sitting, the one you are interested in?
THE WITNESS:
The first row, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Now, then, you said at the end.  The end of the first row.  On the right-hand side of that row, or on the left-hand side of the row?  Is it towards the public gallery or towards the window?  That's what you have to help us with now.  
THE WITNESS:
Firstly, there are two whites, then there is a black gentleman, and then there is the fourth person and that is the one I am indicating, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  That was the end?  
MR. TREDICI: 
That was almost the end, Your Honour.  So the Prosecution applies for the record to reflect that the person that was identified by the accused -- by the witness, was the Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  That was the purpose of these questions.  I thought that was clear. 
MR. TREDICI: 
But that is not my last question.  My last question is to the witness --  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you ever testified about the events of 1994? 
A.	You want to know whether I have testified against him?  I didn't quite understand you, so kindly repeat your question. 
MR. TREDICI: 
I withdraw the question, Your Honour.  That was the end of my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We will, then, start again at 2:40.  The Court is adjourned.  The next witness, what is the estimated cross-examination time for this witness?  
MR. CANTIER: 
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
With other words, we need the next witness in the courtroom in the afternoon.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1310H to 1445H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I requested that the document I'm going to rely on for my cross-examination be distributed to you.  These are the transcripts of the hearing of 4-5, 6, 7th -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could the interpreter speak louder, please?  The one speaking English?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's much more forceful.  Thank you.  Could you repeat what you said please, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was saying that I have requested the documents that I'm going to rely on partly for my cross-examination, be distributed to you.  These are the transcripts of the hearings of the 5th, 6th and 7th November 2003 in Military I trial.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm going to be in my cross-examination, and I will be referring to facts that point to the witness's identity.  And it would be more prudent for us to go into closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you are making this request that we do that immediately, to be on the safe side?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Since I'm going to be dealing with issues relating to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We will have to do that.  So we will now move into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 44 to 71] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
