MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  Good morning.  

The Court is in session.  I trust that everyone had a pleasant and peaceful recess and if not, at least, an efficient one.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
(French spoken) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness MAI in these proceedings.  You will have to tell the truth.  And the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness MAI in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have a personal information sheet for this witness?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
No.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I would like to invite the registrar to come and collect it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We now have the declaration of -- and we have the declaration of Witness MAI, but what you wanted to distribute was the MAI, wasn't it, that is the one we are focusing on now?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President.  I thought it was the same information data sheet, and several copies, but the other one must have slipped in.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have your identification sheet in front of you bearing your pseudonym, MAI?  
THE WITNESS:
I see my name on the sheet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, make sure that everyone gets a copy.  

The information contained in that document is correct, isn't it, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is correct.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then admit that as the first exhibit, which is -- 
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 76. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 76 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Defence.  

Prosecution has a remark.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, it seems as though we're getting French, a very fine language, but I am not getting the English channel one.  That's the first remark, if I could ask the technical people to -- 

I have a very brief issue regarding the scope of this witness' testimony that I would like to raise before we commence.  I will only take one minute, and I mean one minute.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we do that, I have a practical thing to raise with Mr. Matemanga.  

Then to the second issue mentioned by Mr. Moses, I hope the technical booth is looking into this issue about the translation.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Forgive me, Mr. President, I don't know if the technical booth can hear us.  The Kinyarwanda booth is working into French.  Can you hear that technicians?  They are working into French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us see how this develops.  

Then your second point, Mr. Moses.  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, thank you, sir.  I am just wondering, rather than having the witness leave the courtroom, whether he could just remove his headset while I give my brief comments. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear that, Mr. Witness?  If you could do that.  Thank you very much.  

Please, go ahead.

MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, it is simply to do with the second matter raised in a will-say letter that was filed on the 17th of August.  The -- it raises two issues, additional matters that this witness is to testify about.  It is only in respect of the second that I wish to comment, and that is that the Defence is wishing to lead evidence on threats to the witness in Rwanda and the reasons he left Rwanda.  

Now, it seems, from my submission, Your Honour, that that is clearly a witness protection matter.  I have got no difficulty with my friends raising it with WVSS for an inquiry to take place, but it seems -- and the Prosecution's submission is that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matters which Your Honours have to determine in the course of this Trial and, on that basis, I would object to it being led.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted for the time being.  

Defence, you have heard this remark and, at some stage, you will reach the part of the testimony where this may come up and then you can maybe comment upon it.  Shall we start?  

Could you put on your headset again, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much.  

Let us proceed.  Mr. Witness, you will now be asked questions by the Defence.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, before starting, I should like to pray that we go into closed session in view of the testimony of this witness, in view of the point already at issue between us.  And as much as the question I wish to begin with might lead to revealing his identity, could we please go into closed session to begin with. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can -- the estimated duration of the closed session would be, in your view, just so that those in the public gallery will know?  
MR. NEKUIE:
I did not hear the answer, but I think I understood that you are asking me the expected duration of the closed session.  I thought I had said that it would be for the entire examination in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said it in French, I can see.  

Any comments, Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour.  I will leave it in Your Honours' hands.  

Your Honour, if I can assist. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. MOSES:
This witness is with -- not putting a too finer point on it, related to the Accused's family.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But many people may have information and the reason for such information may not be a family link.  

So I'm asking you, Mr. Nekuie, do you really think that you need to close the entire session?  We will start in closed session, but having looked through this summary, it would arguably be possible to solve this in a practical way.  Why don't you reflect on it and we will then start with a closed session.  
MR. NEKUIE:
(French spoken)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, it is, perhaps, towards the end of the examination in-chief that you might consider going into open session -- the end of the examination in-chief, but most of what I have prepared necessarily exposes the witness, through his answers, necessarily to revealing his identity which is why I have requested closed session for the entirety.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but now you have responded that it might be a possibility with an open part towards the end and that seems advisable.  Remains my question:  If we adopt that model, for how long will you then require a closed session, it being understood that most of the testimony will be in closed session?  Can you give an estimate now? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Perhaps a rough estimate, one and a half to two hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then that is known to everyone.  

And we are moving into closed session.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness MAI, we are now in open session to start your cross-examination. 
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, can I just summarise the contact that you told the Trial Chamber that you had with the Accused during the period of April the 6th 1994 until July 1994?  Do I understand your evidence that you saw the Accused for perhaps two to three minutes, a little bit longer, on the morning of 7 April? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	And, then, the next time you saw him was on the 9th of April at his office? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber approximately how long you saw the Accused for on that date? 
A.	We arrived at his office and we remained there for less than 30 minutes. 
Q.	Right.  Did you see the Accused again from the time that -- before you left Kigali to go to Gitarama? 
A.	No, I did not see him again. 
Q.	Did you see the Accused at all from the date of the 9th of April until July -- mid-July 1994? 
A.	No, I did not see him again. 
Q.	So your entire contact with the Accused during the period of April 7 to mid-July was two meetings, one of a few minutes and the other less than half an hour, or around half an hour.  Is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  
Q.	Now, you have talked about the place where you were working.  Can you please tell us how many days a week did you work? 
A.	I would work every day of the week, and on Sundays I would rest for a while, but I would still work on Sundays. 
Q.	And what hours would the business that you were working at be open? 
A.	I would open the shop between 6:30 and 7:00 in the morning. 
Q.	What time would it close? 
A.	I would sometimes close at 9 or 10 p.m.  There was no fixed time for closing.  It depended on customers. 
Q.	So it was perhaps 14-15 hours a day, seven days a week? 
A.	Yes, you are correct. 
Q.	Now, looking at your personal information sheet, we note that you are married, and certainly at the moment have a large number of children.  How many children did you have in April 1994 -- perhaps 1990 to 1994? 
A.	I had eight children. 
Q.	And am I correct that your wife and those eight children were living in a different town? 
A.	Yes, they lived in the rural areas. 
Q.	How often would you go and visit your wife and eight children? 
A.	I would go and visit them every month and I would remain there for one week. 
Q.	And was that the situation throughout 1993 and up to the date of the 6th of April? 
A.	Yes.  I do not believe I understood your question.  Could you please repeat your question, Counsel for the Prosecution?
Q.	Would you spend one week every month with your wife and family, and did that process, did that continue throughout 1993 into 1994 up until April 1994? 
A.	No, subsequently, I would not be able to remain in my residence for a long stretch of time because I was busier.  Sometimes I would stay for two or three days, and I would go back because I was busier than I used to be.  But I would still go and visit my wife and my children. 
Q.	Did your employer work at the shop as well? 
A.	No, my employer did not work in the shop.  Sometimes my employer would pass by the shop, I would say on a daily basis, but my employer did not work there.  
Q.	And do you know what your employer was doing during the day? 
A.	My employer would stay at home.  My employer would only go out to do some shopping in town, otherwise he did not have any other occupation. 
Q.	How many people were employed at the -- where you were working? 
A.	I was alone, but there was also someone who would clean up the shop. 
Q.	Thank you.  And -- 
A.	Thank you to you.  
Q.	And was it a particularly profitable business, or was it just a small-scale one? 
A.	Any business is profitable.  We had profits.  They were not that high, but we still had profits. 
Q.	Now, on the morning of the 7th of April, am I correct in understanding that you were present with other people when there were some killings going on in your neighbourhood? 
A.	Yes, we were hiding and we could hear gunshots, and it is true that some people died.  
Q.	Did the shooting continue for, sporadically, most of that morning? 
A.	Yes, the shooting continued during part of the morning, and when they came to fetch me to take me back home, we could still hear the gunshots. 
Q.	Can you assist us in advising approximately what time, if you remember, the shooting commenced, and the time that it finished, if it did finish? 
A.	The shooting started between ten and eleven.  The shooting did not subside because there was more intense shooting on the side of Ntera, and at a given point in time we even heard shelling.  So the gunshots did not cease, because the war continued.  
Q.	Would you agree with me that that morning it was soldiers from the paracommando battalion at Kanombe who were out in your neighbourhood who were killing people? 
A.	Yes, indeed; the soldiers were those who were killing the people. 
Q.	And, in fact, they were out in the neighbourhood targeting those who were -- or they perceived as being Tutsi?  That is correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  They were killing the Tutsis, and the Tutsis were the ones who were dying. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Witness, what makes you think that those soldiers belonged to paracommando battalion?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not refer to the paracommando battalion.  I simply noted that they were soldiers.  I did not know where they came from, but I was able to note that they were indeed soldiers.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Am I correct in believing that the soldiers came from the Kanombe camp?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not recognise any of the soldiers.  I merely noted that they were soldiers.  I do not know which camp they were coming from.  I noted that they were soldiers, but I did not know from which camp they came.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
The soldiers that you saw, did they carry any arms?  
THE WITNESS:
The soldiers I saw were armed, they had firearms.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
How many soldiers did you see?  
THE WITNESS:
I would be hard pressed to give you a precise number.  There were soldiers everywhere in the streets, and they were heading towards different directions.  I cannot tell you with certainty how many soldiers were in the neighbourhood.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Following up from the last question and answer that you gave, without giving us a precise number, would you agree that there were a large number of soldiers that you saw on the streets?  
A.	No.  From where I was standing I was able to see on the road between ten and 12 soldiers who were passing by.  They were not all together.  Sometimes you would have two or three soldiers walking together, but I would say that there were ten or so soldiers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the record, Mr. Witness, there are two points:  The first is that the Prosecution asked you whether you agreed that there were paracommando soldiers, and you said yes to that.  Now this word "paracommando" was mentioned, both in the English and the French version of the question.  

THE WITNESS:
I did not hear that part about the paracommando in the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  That's noted.  

Then the second point of clarification.  You now said that there were ten to 12 soldiers.  But in a previous answer you said "there were soldiers everywhere", which would seem to imply a larger number.  Do you have any comment on that?  
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to the soldiers I could see on the road, but there were soldiers on the road and there were others who were in people's houses.  So I am referring to those I could see on the road, but there were other soldiers throughout the neighbourhood in the houses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how do you know that?  
THE WITNESS:
I know that because people were killed in their houses.  For example, the family members of the people I was hiding with, their family members were killed in their houses and not on the street, and that is why I am saying that there were also soldiers in the houses.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	When the Accused left where he had seen you on the morning of the 7th of April, do you know where he went? 
A.	He went on foot to the camp. 
Q.	And when you say the "camp", are we talking about Camp Kanombe, the military camp?  
A.	Yes, I am referring to the Kanombe military camp.  
Q.	Thank you.  And it may be that you have indirectly, at least, answered this question, but do you agree with me when I -- with a proposition, namely, that between April the 6th and July, Tutsis were targeted by reason of their ethnicity and killed? 
A.	Yes, that is the truth.  They were killed because of their ethnicity. 
Q.	So you, you personally accept that there was a genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda from April to July 1994?  Is that your personal belief? 
A.	I have not understood what precise period you are referring to, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Between April the 6th and the middle of July 1994, do you agree with me that there was a genocide of the Tutsi ethnic group in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes.  Throughout that period the Tutsis were killed, but there were also Hutus who died. 
Q.	All right.  When you travelled from Kanombe into Kigali on the 9th of April, what route did you take?  
A.	We passed in front of the airport through Rebero, and once we reached Remera we passed through Kicukiro, Gikondo, next to Sainte Famille, and that is how we reached the PVK.  
Q.	I think all the names are known to us.  

And how long did it take you to travel that distance?
A.	It took us around 30 minutes to cover that distance.  We did not stop; we left and went straight to the PVK.  
Q.	Did you come across or see any roadblocks during the course of that journey? 
A.	Yes, we saw a roadblock in Remera.  There were -- there was wood on the road, but there were no soldiers manning that roadblock.  This is to tell you that nobody stopped us on our way.  We continued until we reached our final destination.  
Q.	Did you see any bodies on the road?  
A.	No, I did not see any body -- any dead body on the road.  
Q.	All right.  Now, you have told us that you eventually made your way to Hotel Kiyovu, and I believe you said that you left that place on the 12th and that you remember it well.  That's what you said in the course of your evidence in-chief, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, indeed, I recall making such a statement. 
Q.	When you gave a statement to the Defence in April of this year, did you tell them that you had stayed there for a week? 
A.	I do not know when I gave that statement.  I was fleeing; I was not at peace, so I could have been mistaken.  What I am telling you today is that we remained there for three days.  As for the written statement, it was given at a time when I was fleeing and I had no peace of mind at all.  
Q.	So you agree with me that you did tell the Defence that you'd -- "were taken to Kiyovu hotel where we stayed for a week", but that that was not correct because you were of a state of mind which made it difficult to remember the exact date? 
A.	Yes, it was because of the stage of mind I was in that I was not able to remember exactly how many days we remained there.  So I am stating that we remained there for three days.  I do not believe we remained there for a whole week.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not wish to raise an objection, but if counsel for the Prosecution could refresh our memories by reading out the part of the statement where it is said that the witness stayed in the Kiyovu hotel, for one.  This would be greatly appreciated.  
MR. MOSES: 
I have no difficulty, Your Honours.  It's in the sixth paragraph in the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
"Where we remained for one week." 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I am much obliged, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And no one has assisted you to refresh your memory on the date that you left the hotel since making this statement? 
A.	No, nobody refreshed my memory. 
(Pages 23 to 28 by Judith Baverstock)

































1200H
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, Witness, you also told us that on the trip from Kigali to Gitarama, that you were stopped at a roadblock, and you said that one of the persons at the roadblock had said to you that Renzaho was an accomplice of -- or an accomplice.  That's what you --
A.	That is correct.  That was my testimony.  And that was, indeed, what occurred.  
Q.	It's just, Witness, that -- you'll agree with me that's not something you ever mentioned to the Defence at all prior to today, is it?  
A.	It is true that I had not referred to that previously.  I gave my statement to the Defence team while I was fleeing.  I was not in a good state of mind when I was making that statement.  
Q.	And would it surprise you, Witness, that we have heard from three Defence witnesses about this incident, and none of them have referred to any of those persons at that roadblock calling Renzaho an accomplice? 
A.	That would come as a surprise.  I do recall having heard such a statement.  That person said that we were carrying Tutsis, and said that Renzaho was an accomplice, and that his car was transporting Tutsis.  That is what I heard.  I do not know whether the others did not hear it, but that person did make that statement.  That person was saying that the vehicle was carrying Tutsis in order to help them flee.  I did hear that statement.  
Q.	Well, Witness, I'm suggesting to you that's just an example of something you are, in fact, making up today in order to assist -- try and assist the Accused, isn't that the situation?  
A.	That is not true.  What I'm referring to did, indeed, take place.  That person said that Renzaho's car was driving Tutsis, and that as a consequence Renzaho was an accomplice; and that besides, his wife was a Tutsi.  And that was the time when they drank the beer we were carrying, and that they smashed the bottles.  We left with crates that were virtually empty.  So this is an incident that, indeed, occurred.  I'm not inventing anything. 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I'm probably now at the point, and I'm getting towards the very end of my cross-examination, where I have a number of questions that I believe would need to be put to him in closed session as the answers could lead to his identification.  So I'm asking for a brief closed session.  Perhaps ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ten minutes.  So then we will ask those in the public gallery to leave us for ten minutes, and then you are welcome back again.  We will move into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 30 to 35] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 29 by Vicki Eastvold)


MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we will now end your examination, and we will hear the questions to Witness MAI by the Judges.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, during your evidence-in-chief, you told the Chambers that there were two pickup vehicles parked in Renzaho's residence loaded with crates of -- empty crates, and that the refugees were standing behind them.  Do you confirm this, that there were two pickup vehicles parked in Renzaho's residence?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do confirm that there were two pickups with empty crates in them, and I also wish to state that the backyard of the house was quite large, and that the refugees could, indeed, stay there.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
The next question:  Is it true that your sister spent a lot of time in the shop even if she wasn't selling?  Isn't it true that she spent more time in the shop than at her residence?  
THE WITNESS:
My sister would come to the shop to see me, and she would stay for a while, but I was the one in charge of the business.  She did not spend the whole day in the shop.  She would pass by the shop, we would talk about the business, and then she would go home.  We would not spend the whole day together.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) ... that your sister spent more time in the shop, and spent only two hours in the residence?  Would you be surprised by that statement?  
THE WITNESS:
Valens has his own interpretation of what occurred.  What I can tell you is that she would come on a daily basis, but would only remain there for a while.  She would not stay in the shop as if she were in charge of the shop.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
The last question:  Since you went to your store at 6:30 a.m. and only came back at 9 p.m., will I be right to say that you didn't know what happened in the residence during the day since you were absent?  You were not in a position to say who came in the house and who didn't, or what happened there?  
THE WITNESS:
That is not correct.  I stated that I would go back home for lunch, sometimes around noon or at one.  So that was where I would go during the lunch break, and the house help were there.  Whenever anything happened, they would tell me about it, and so would the children.  Even my sister would tell me who could have come at the residence.  So I did know what happened in Mr. Renzaho's residence.  I would go there at lunch time, and go back there at night, so I was in a position to know what would occur there during the day.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, also, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At 12:34:04, there is a question and we will delete the words from "So you" until "that" -- it's only the introductory part of the question -- and place that under seal.  

Mr. Witness, generally you are not to inform anyone that you, or anyone else, have witnessed before this Chamber; that is protected information.  Is that clear?  
THE WITNESS:
I am well aware of that, Mr. President.  I, also, have some concerns, lest people be informed I testified before this Trial Chamber, so I will keep this information for myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  We agree on the necessity to be careful. 

Now follow other questions.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Did I understand you correctly, Mr. Witness, that on the 7th of April 1994, in the morning, the Accused came to your place of work and used the telephone which was there?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that was what happened, and that was indeed my testimony. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Was there a telephone in the Accused's house?  
THE WITNESS:
There was a telephone in the Accused's residence, but it was not operating.  I do not know for what reason, but it was not working.  But it is true that there was a telephone there.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
And was your telephone operating?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Should I take it that the Accused managed to get in touch with a person, or persons, he wanted to get in touch with?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you overhear that conversation, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  I gave him the telephone, and I went out.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know with whom Mr. Renzaho spoke during that conversation?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I do not know. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said that you had to restrict the period of your visits to your family to two to three days monthly because you became more busy.  Do you recall having said that?  Yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
I do know that I made such a statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you tell us from when you started visiting two to three days, approximately?  
THE WITNESS:
It was from 1992 onwards. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
From when in 1992?  
THE WITNESS:
In early 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So this rhythm of one week's visits with your family a month, which would imply approximately three weeks in your place of work, that was a rhythm which preceded early 1992?  You did not leave for a week monthly from early 1992 until the 6th of April 1994.  Is that what you are testifying?  
THE WITNESS:
It is true that from that time onwards, I did not spend a whole week in my residence in the rural areas.  I would only stay there for two, three days. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This incident on the way to Gitarama, were there any Tutsis in the car?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were Tutsis in the vehicle.  There was one Rukerikibaye, his wife and his two children, and they were the Tutsis who were with us.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you spell that name, please, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
R-U-K-E-R-I-K-I-B-A-Y-E.  Rukerikibaye. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At the roadblocks, did they find out that these persons were Tutsi?  Did they check their ID cards?  
THE WITNESS:
No, they did not check their identity cards at the roadblock.  They simply looked at them, looked at their faces.  Quite often when you have an identity card bearing another mentioned, but on the face of it they thought you looked like a Tutsi, they would stop you at the roadblocks. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But according to your testimony, the soldiers were right when they said that there were Tutsi in the car.  That's true, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
That was true.  There were Tutsis in the vehicle. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were the soldiers right when they said that Mrs. Renzaho was Tutsi?  
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will place that answer under seal. 

But do we agree, Mr. Witness, that what matters in Rwanda is the ethnicity of the father when it comes to establishing the ethnicity of a child?  And don't get into personal circumstances now, but simply a general description of the situation.  That was behind the question, the previous one. 
THE WITNESS:
That is true, that the ethnicity of a child is determined by that of his father.  But when a Hutu married a Tutsi, or when a Hutu woman was married to a Tutsi man, sometimes the children would look like Tutsis even if officially they were Hutus.  I'm referring to the features of these children, and not referring to their official ethnicity.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The soldier that escorted the car, did you know his name, had you seen him before?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall his name, but I do know that he was a soldier. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know from which military branch or company he came?
THE WITNESS:
I do not know to which unit or to which military camp he belonged. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
The police officers -- officer, had you seen him before?  Did you know his name?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not know the name of the policeman. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you know which police force he belonged to?  
THE WITNESS:
I have just remembered the name of the soldier.  Can I give you this piece of information, Mr. President?  Am I allowed to do so?  I have just remembered the name of the soldier.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please do. 
THE WITNESS:
It was Corporal Gaspard. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why would Mr. Renzaho seek the assistance of a soldier, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
It was because it was difficult to use this road in Muhima, there were many roadblocks.  Every 15 metres there was a roadblock, so one needed the assistance of the soldier in order to be able to pass through the roadblocks.  And I explained to you that there were Tutsis on board the vehicle.  We could not have passed the roadblocks in Muhima with the Tutsis.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But he was a civil authority, and the soldier would normally fall under military command.  
THE WITNESS:
Do you mean that that soldier should not have accompanied us, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just wondered whether you had any comment on that particular element which I have now drawn your attention to. 
THE WITNESS:
Renzaho was also a soldier.  Even though he was a civilian authority, he was also a member of the army.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, could you tell us in which way the soldier who accompanied you helped you in the difficult situation, say, at the roadblock?  
THE WITNESS:
When people would stop us at the roadblocks, he would explain that it was Renzaho's family that was going to Gitarama to seek refuge.  Even if those who were manning the roadblock were not entirely convinced, they would beg -- he would beg them, and they would let us go through.  So that is how he was of assistance. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
You consider the role of the soldier as a very important one?  
THE WITNESS:
It is true that he escorted us.  And if it had not been the case, we would not have been able to pass through the roadblocks. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Should you wish to meet with the Accused, the witness protection unit will arrange that at a convenient moment.  

Thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It seems that it takes some time before this witness is coming in.  While we are waiting for that witness, there is, of course, a pending Defence motion for variation of the witness list in the sense that it is suggested by the Defence that one witness should be added and heard at the end of this session.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are several questions there.  Two questions to the Defence to start with.  Question one, you have not filed any reply to the Prosecution response.  And question two, it seems that the Prosecution is saying that they do not have all the particulars available of that witness in order to carry out its investigations. 

Meanwhile, I see the witness has come in, but simply, do you have any brief reaction to those two questions before we start with the witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, I think that our reply is nearly ready, and should probably be served on the Prosecution today.  And the Prosecution, therefore, will be satisfied on this day -- today -- before close of business today.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the information missing, has that been conveyed to the Prosecution, leaving aside whether the time is sufficient, which is a different matter under the rules, but now only the practical approach, has now the Prosecution received what they say they need to carry out investigations?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Regarding this witness, apparently, we are facing difficulties, Mr. President, since we ourselves do not have all of the requisite information on that person.  We discovered him in special circumstances.  But as soon as we do get the particulars, we will no doubt serve them on the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you do not know his current occupation, his address in the country concerned, or the information concerning his wife, is that so?  Or do you have something to give away?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We only know, from what you indicated, where that potential witness is currently.  He is in another country, the name of which I cannot provide since we are sitting in open session.  We know in what 
city -- which city he is.  And apart from that piece of information, we don't know anything else.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will stop with this for now.  But please convey all you have in your possession to the Prosecution during the lunch break.  

And then we will not continue with this for the time being, but simply say, good morning, Mr. Witness.  Please put your headset on.  

You are a protected witness, and will be referred to as Witness PAT in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness PAT in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you with your signature, isn't that so, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information contained in that document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
The information given here is correct, but I should like to make a slight correction regarding the occupation.  The line "occupation" is followed by the word ************** What I think we should -- I should like to suggest that that be struck out, because it is repeated on the next line.  So where it appears opposite the word "occupation".  

And the second correction is I should like to add as regards the family status, I haven't put the number of children.  I have three children.  
And that is all, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  That's noted.  The first is the question of repetition, the second is a useful addition.  We thank you. 

Mr. Witness, you will be examined after the lunch break. 

Defence, do you want to start in open or closed?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I think I will begin in closed session, and then to avoid inconveniencing the public I will then suggest that we go into open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And Mr. Matemanga, this document will then be -- 
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 77. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D.77 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we will meet again, Mr. Witness, at 2:30 in order to hear your testimony.  The Court is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1203H to 1430H)
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 44 to 49] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 36 to 43 by Vicki Eastvold)














MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness PAT, we are now in open session, and your examination-in-chief continues.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you know Mr. Renzaho in April 1994? 
A.	I knew Mr. Renzaho in April 1994, first as an officer of the Rwandan army, and since 1992 -- as from 1992 as the préfet of the city of Kigali. 
Q.	So in that capacity as an officer of the Rwandan army, did you know whether Mr. Renzaho had any powers -- wielded any powers in the hierarchical structure of the army, of the Rwandan army? 
A.	No.  The préfet, Mr. Renzaho, had no powers within the army headquarters.  On the basis of the fact that he was the préfet of the city, he was neither in G1, G2, G3 or G4 in the army military command.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your question, Mr. Nekuie, was the following, wasn't it:  Whether Mr. Renzaho had any powers in the army headquarters.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So now that's on record in the English version, also.  Because that's an important distinction.  

Please, now, the next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what should we, then, understand from your answer?  Mr. Renzaho, in his capacity as an army officer, had no duties, no powers, in your opinion?  No special duties?  
A.	No, Mr. Renzaho had no special military duties, neither within the army headquarters, neither within the Kigali city command secteur.  So he was a préfet accountable to the ministry of the interior; and by the same token, he was not within the -- the -- he was not subject to the army headquarters or the army commands that were under it.  
Q.	In that capacity as a military officer and préfet of the city of Kigali, did he also have duties within the gendarmerie, staff of the FAR? 
A.	My previous answer equally applies to the gendarmerie, because the gendarmerie and the army within the FAR are like two brothers, and Colonel Renzaho was out of these two staff commands. 
(Page 50 by Vicki Eastvold)







1500H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I would like to request the registry to give you a document included in the list of Defence documents volume 2, document number 4.  I will ask you to peruse that document, to look at one of its provisions, then I would ask you questions on it.  So it is folder volume number 2 of the list of Defence documents, and it is document number 4.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is presidential order of 3rd January 1977; is that so? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, establishing the status of officers in the Rwandan armed forces.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you want to go to page -- or paragraph number -- 
MR. NEKUIE:
I wish for the witness to refer to the third page of this document and more specifically to article 10 of this presidential decree.  Article 10 on the third page, at the very beginning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got that, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I don't know whether it is necessary for me to read out article 10 or whether I should simply put the question to the witness while he is taking cognisance of this paragraph. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you simply ask the question? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you have before you the provisions of article 10 of this text establishing the status of officers in the Rwandan armed forces.  And I wish to put the following question to you:  From what you can read, is Mr. Renzaho -- does Mr. Renzaho fall under the provisions of this text, under the article of 1994? 
A.	Mr. Renzaho's case does fall under this article 10, in that he had been seconded to the 
	ministry of the interior, which is a governmental department.  So, apart from the general provisions, the last line does apply to Colonel Renzaho, who was put at the disposal of the ministry of the interior by the president of the republic. 
Q.	Thank you for your answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The record is getting unclear.  Now, this paragraph 10 starts with the words "The officer may be transferred".  That is the article we are talking about, isn't it? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, and the witness seems to be alluding to the last paragraph of the said article. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you see we have both in English and French, you saying the following.  From what you can read, is 
Mr. Renzaho -- does he fall under the provisions of this text under the article of 1994?  That's not comprehensible.  Did you say that, and what did you mean?  

So, I think you have to lead us a bit more specifically through this text and maybe explain what you meant by that question. 
MR. NEKUIE:
No, Mr. President, I believe there might have been a problem in the translation.  I asked whether in his capacity as an officer in 1994, Mr. Renzaho fell under the provisions of article 10.  That was the question I put to the witness, and that was what the witness was answering. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when you mean that or when you ask that question, what do you mean, because article 10 covers the situation of transfer from the armed forces to another branch of the state?  And your question is then whether Mr. Renzaho fell under -- into that situation.  Is that so, Mr. Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, that was my question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, your answer, Mr. Witness.  You said -- so apart from general provisions, the last line does apply to Colonel Renzaho, what did you mean by that?  Please help us now more specifically by referring to the text. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, article 10 has four subparagraphs, and it is precisely the reverse of what I said or what was heard in that subparagraph 4 that does concern Mr. Renzaho.  Mr. Renzaho was put at the disposal.  He was not transferred, he was not seconded, he was not given any responsibilities.  He was put at the disposal of the administration, which is the ministry of the interior. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So, this was not the matter of (French spoken) ... the officer may be transferred, but it was an issue of (French spoken) ... with other words being placed by the president at the disposal of some other entity.  Is that the point? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that was exactly the situation of Mr. Renzaho. 

JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, so, as I understand it, that Mr. Renzaho was at the same time a military person and a civilian? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Your Honour.  Mr. Renzaho remained a soldier with the rank of colonel.  But as regards the duties he had within the ministry of the interior, he was accountable to the ministry of the interior, but it would only depend on the general staff regarding promotion matters and administrative matters.  His file remained at the general staff headquarters, but he was a soldier who was put at the disposal of the ministry of the interior for a specific task.  So he was not a civilian.  He still had his file at the general staff of the army; received his salary from the ministry of the army and could be called upon to either join a military unit or a governmental body following any decision from the president of the republic.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Okay.  Thank you. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, so in order to clarify this point, when an officer is thus put at the disposal of the administration, is one to consider that that officer is still operational within the army? 
A.	I fail to understand the nuance regarding the operational status of the soldier, but he is active, he is not retired or has not been dismissed, he remains in the army.  He is -- receives his salary from the army and can also be promoted within the army, and the proposals for advancement, which are the rights of every soldier, still remains as far as he is concerned and as a consequence, such a person would advance, would be given a higher rank as is customary within the army. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In order for you to better understand my question what I wish to know, Witness, is whether such an officer could still be considered as being a commander of a military unit?  
A.	The officer is commander of a military unit, if there is such a unit.  And in the case of Mr. Renzaho, and as regards the provision we are dealing with, there was no such military unit that was commanded by him.  It is -- he was an officer if we look at the statutes, but officially was fulfilling other tasks than those of a soldier. 
Q.	Thank you for your clarifications, Witness.  And still as regards the status of Mr. Renzaho in 
	April of 1994, could one deem that he had power over members of the Rwandan army and the gendarmerie? 
A.	No, he -- rather, disciplinary powers are linked to the functions one has.  And according to the rules of the Rwandan army, one had to be in the hierarchy of command and be the commander of a unit in order to be able to sanction soldiers.  So, since Mr. Renzaho was not at the head of any unit, and to provide further clarifications, a unit includes at least one company which is integrated in a battalion, a brigade, even though there were no brigades in Rwanda or the commander of a sector.  By sanction, the president of the republic could sanction soldiers as well as the general chief of staff or the 
	minister of defence.  So apart from that hierarchy, an officer could report on any soldier that would be transferred to a commander of a unit in order for adequate sanctions to be taken, but Mr. Renzaho could not, for example, tell a specific soldier that he would sanction him for one reason or another. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, you are speaking too fast.  May I ask you to slow down? 

Next question, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	But, Witness, I wish for this matter of disciplinary powers to be clear and for that reason, I will ask registry to provide to you Exhibit P. 11 from the Prosecution binder and to make your task easier.
MR. NEKUIE:
Registry, I have a copy of this document which you can come and get and provide to the witness as to be able to make progress. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any question you can ask while this is being found, Mr. Nekuie, some kind of introductory -- 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I do not know whether this will make my examination-in-chief clearer, but if you so wish, I can perhaps read out the part which is of interest to me to the witness and then, subsequently, put a question to him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, P. 11 is a compilation of legislative provisions in Rwanda.  Which page are you on, Mr.  Nekuie?  What is the K number? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I, unfortunately, do not have any K number on my document, Mr. President, but it is the document entitled "Discipline", dated 13th of December 1978, and it is a presidential decree, once again, establishing the discipline within the Rwandan armed forces.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we have that, which paragraph? 
MR. NEKUIE:
	I wish to refer to page 747 of the said document and more specifically to article 60 of the said text under chapter "Disciplinary Powers".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have that, Mr. Witness, article 60?  Have you found it? 
THE WITNESS:
It was indicated to me right now, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, let me rapidly read out the first paragraph of this text and then put a question to you.  It states -- paragraph one of article 60 states as follows:  "Any soldier has a right and the duty to take note of the mistakes made by his subordinates or the soldiers placed under him in the hierarchy and to request that he be sanctioned.  Only some echelons or some ranks in the command can rule on such requests and can sanction the soldiers accordingly.  This power is linked to the occupation and not to the rank.  The ranks are as follows:  President of the republic, the minister in charge of the armed forces, the general chief of staff, operational commanders and unit commanders." 

As regards this subparagraph of the article -- and my question, Witness, is as follows.  Don't you believe that there is some ambiguity which is brought about by this text regarding the explanation you provided under disciplinary powers of Mr. Renzaho in his capacity as a member of the 
Rwandan armed forces in 1994? 
A.	Well, I don't see any ambiguity, Counsel.
Q.	And why not, after having heard what I just read out to you? 
A.	Well, I do not wish to repeat my previous answer, but I did say that it was linked to the position.  And since Mr. Renzaho is not amongst those positions that were mentioned, and I mentioned also the commanders of companies, a company being a unit in the Rwandan army because there were other independent companies and even the companies that were supervised could report on unruly soldiers.  

The other component is the duty of any soldier to report on an unruly soldier and this is what corresponds to the first line stating that any soldier has the right and the duty to take note of errors made and to report on such errors to the hierarchy.  So Colonel Renzaho, in his capacity as an officer, could report on all the soldiers who were under him, but did not have any power to sanction them.  He was to report either to the general chief of staff or to the commander of the battalion concerned because they were the ones who had such powers to sanction. 
Q.	Thank you for the clarifications you have provided, Witness.  Witness, I wish now to refer to the 
	7th of April of 1994 specifically and put the following question to you.  Do you recall the decisions that were made during the meeting held at the military -- senior military school on the 7th of April of 1994? 
A.	Yes, I do recall that the most important of those decisions was the setting up of a committee that was called crisis committee and which was aimed at assisting the politicians in the setting up of the transition structure.  There was a vacancy and power since the president of the republic had just been assassinated and the politicians had to rapidly make sure that there was no constitutional vacuum.  So I believe this was the most significant decision that was made during the course of that meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, while exercising caution when you will respond to this question, who were those who participated in this meeting of the 7th of April of 1994? 
A.	Those who were asked to attend the meeting were the officers of the ministry of defence, the heads of departments at the ministry of defence, those heading departments at the general chief of staff in the army and the gendarmerie, the commanders of operational sectors, the commanders of units that did not come under the different operational sectors, as well as the commanders of the gendarmerie units. 
Q.	Are we to understand that this was a meeting exclusively attending the officers of the Rwandan army that you just mentioned? 
A.	Yes, and I would add that there were also officers of the gendarmerie, the ones I mentioned, as well as those from the ministry of defence.  General Dallaire also participated in the meeting, and forgive me for this omission, there was also the commander of the military higher -- of the military academy, which is an institution which does not fall under neither the general staff of the army nor of the gendarmerie. 
Q.	You have just referred to General Dallaire, who was he, and what was his position at the time?
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's clear to everyone in the courtroom.  Let's hear the next question. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what was the relationship between General Dallaire and the Rwandan army? 
A.	General Dallaire had good relations with the Rwandan army. 
Q.	What was the result of this relationship on the 6th of April of 1994 in Kigali? 
A.	Excuse me, when you mention General Dallaire, should I take that you mentioned the person of the general or the institution he represented? 
Q.	I am talking about the person and the institution.
MR. NEKUIE:
And that is why, Mr. President, I wanted to clarify the question, that is, to know the relationship between Dallaire and the witness for the rest of the examination. 
THE WITNESS:
So with the leave of the President, I will come back to the previous question, that is, UNAMIR as an institution.  So, I mentioned laconically that relations between the two were sound and I could go further and explain that.  That he was specifically with respect to the army general staff and the UNAMIR command, and not to mention Dallaire -- the relationship in that respect was good and it was good, especially for Kigali.  I mean here that that context had to do with the creation of an atmosphere of security in Kigali at the time when there was talk of the setting up of the transition institutions and for the security of the city of Kigali.  

The important paragraph had to do with the weapons safety area.  He met with the army general staff often and so relations on that core were relatively good.  And since the Rwandan army had transferred almost all the documents that UNAMIR wanted, and since it had also defined control mechanisms for the weapons control programme -- I will come back on this point presently. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	So, Witness, on 6th April 1994 and slightly before, who are those who were concerned?  Who are those who were concerned with this weapons safety arrangement? 
A.	First, there was the UN, which was the designer and prime mover of the project, then the 
	Rwandan armed forces on the one hand and the Rwandan Patriotic Front on the other. 
Q.	How many armies were established in Kigali on 6th April 1994? 
A.	Well, if you are talking in terms of armies, there were three armies, if you like; the 
	Rwandan armed forces, the Rwandan Patriotic Front and UNAMIR.  I don't know whether that is what you meant when you asked the question.  
Q.	Perfectly, Witness, that is the answer I expected.
MR. NEKUIE:
And for the next questions, I would like to request the registry to kindly hand over to the witness this miniature map that I believe had been disclosed to the Prosecution.  And I would call on him to rapidly illustrate the questions that are put to him on that map.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, this map, is that an exhibit in this case? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Actually, it is the big map of Kigali, which is also in the Defence folder, but it would be difficult to work on the bigger version of the map that we tendered.  So we thought it would be proper to miniaturise the map and then tender it later as an annex document of the Defence also.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you want the witness to mark anything on this map in connection with his testimony? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, if that is the case, you may wish to ask him to move to the monitor maybe, so that we can see what he is doing. 
MR. NEKUIE:
If that would be more practical to everybody, then fine, let him move to the projector. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But your problem is that you have minimised this and it may be difficult for the video camera to zoom in, isn't that the problem as well?  Why don't you start?  Let's see how it develops.  Where do you want the witness to focus now? 
You have this in front of you, Mr. Witness.  

Where is the first question?  It's coming now, isn't it?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, since he mentioned the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, I would like him to quickly point out to the Chamber where that army had set up quarters in the city of Kigali on 
6th April 1994, that is, before the events that began on 6th April 1994?  That is just what I wanted him to point out on the map.  But, at the same time, Mr. President, given that I will have to question the witness extensively on this map, I would like to suggest for the three questions that I am going to ask about this map, that I will put the questions to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's try to avoid too much ado.  So the first question now is, please mark the RPF positions; isn't that so? 
MR. NEKUIE:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you doing that, Mr. Witness?  Do you have a pen? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am doing so, Mr. President.  I am doing it, but I am doing it on my own copy of the map, I don't know how you are going to see it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will sort that out.  Please, do your task first and then we will accomplish our task afterwards.  

Have you done it? 
THE WITNESS:
I am through, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, now we need to see this, Mr. Nekuie.  Let me hear what is your next question.  Is that also concerned with the marking on the map?  
MR. NEKUIE:
That is right, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please ask the question. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, could you also indicate on the map the FAR units that were found in the city of Kigali and the position of the army headquarters of the Rwandan army on 6th April 1994? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I will do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And it is important that the markings are now made in a way so that we can distinguish them afterwards, so that we do not mix these two different questions up.  I am sure you are doing that. 
THE WITNESS:
I have understood.  I am marking it in a different colour, Mr. President. 
MR. NEKUIE:
If possible, Mr. President, maybe to gain time, the next question has to do with the position of UNAMIR.  So I don't know if he can do that with a different colour.  The witness can point out on the positions of UNAMIR in the city of Kigali.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And as mentioned previously, such exercises can well be done in connection with the preparation of the witness.  I am sure no one would object to that.  Isn't that so, Mr. Moses?  Please note it, because then we don't need to use courtroom time for this. 

It is done?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, actually, I had done that exercise since you spoke to me about preparing the questions he had to ask.  So on this map I had prepared maps before, but I could not tell you before since he was asking me precise questions, but if you like, I could stand up and present the maps that I have already prepared depending on the questions he will ask me.  I am sorry for saying this belatedly, but it would be better for me to do it that way.  I could not tell him straight away because he was asking me precise questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those maps you just referred to have the same size as the one you just annotated, is that so, or is it bigger? 
THE WITNESS:
They have the same size and the same scale and they are identical to the one you have before you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that doesn't make a difference in relation to the practical arrangements.

Mr. Nekuie, you are in charge here.  Just make sure that we get through this in a practical way.  The witness has, I understand, finished the three markings.  Do you want now to have this shown to all of us in the courtroom so that we see what he has done, because the dimension is too small for the 
	téléscripteur? Would you have any other questions when it comes to markings on the map? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I believe the witness has given an answer to a precise question, and I simply refrain from asking him to present the maps on which we work.  But if the Chamber has no problem with that, I would rather propose that he present the map on which he has made markings, and on that basis, I will ask him the questions I have prepared.  If he has them in the room behind, so maybe we could bring his little bag here and then he would remove the maps and we work on them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us now see what we have done and let us now proceed.  Can we see this document now? 

So, Mr. Matemanga, you will please show it to the Prosecution first and then the Bench and then the Defence. 
Mr. Witness, you have kindly tried to convey the positions of the three armies in 1994.  We understand that RPF written with red ink means the RPF forces, that is where you had the cross and the square; isn't that so, the little box?  It is clear, it seems.  Is that so, and that's the only place, one location?  Can you confirm that?  
THE WITNESS:
As far as the RPF is concerned, I do confirm it.  It was the RPF battalion that was in the building. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then blue ink here probably means the Rwandan army at Jali, J-A-L-I, Muhima, Kacyiru, the staff at Nyarugenge, et cetera.  That is the Rwandan army in blue, have we understood your map correctly? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  For the Rwandan army, you had little squares or rectangles.  And for the national gendarmerie, you have little circles.  But I would really have wanted to give you what I had prepared because that could raise a bit of confusion, Mr. President, because I need to add the gendarmerie posts that were there, just in case he asks me the question.  I have prepared a very nice map for the Court -- for the Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  But let us now first look at what you did.  And then there is something in pink, is that the 
UN deployment, UNAMIR?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President, at Amahoro national stadium near Remera.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	R-E-M-E-R-A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.

Now, Defence, here is the map, and if you would wish to follow up with the previously made map, that is fine with us, but now, at least, we have sorted this out.  It is clear both on the map and for the record. 

Yes, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, amongst the Rwandan armed forces, I am sure I forgot the Huye battalion which was not 
Mt. Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted and you may wish to add it on the map when you get it back.  
All right.  Now, we have achieved this.  Do you want any supplementary information from the witness based on a previous map?  Mr. Nekuie, was that what you indicated?  

MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, I will ask him my questions, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Chamber the mission of UNAMIR units established in the city of Kigali on 6th of April 1994, their mission in the city of Kigali? 
A.	Well, concerning the mission of UNAMIR in the city of Kigali, what I can say is that there was a command known as KIBAT essentially made up of the Belgian contingent, whose mission was to ensure security within the framework of the Kigali weapons security area, and also the general mission of UNAMIR as far as peace keeping was concerned to ensure that the accords were on course and generally to ensure that the accords were being applied. 
Q.	Witness, did you also know as at 6th April 1994, the state of arms or armaments that the Rwandan Patriotic Front had in the city of Kigali? 
A.	I cannot know the arms that they had.  What they had was stated in the accords.  They had about 
	600 men, a battalion at the CND.  As concerns their weapons or the organic weapons of that battalion, nothing was made public.  But according to information that we received concerning the organic weapons that a battalion should have was agreed upon.  Over the three months period that they spent in Kigali or more, it was certainly more than organic weapons because their staff command sent in weapons from their Mulindi headquarters. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	M-U-L-I-N-D-I, into the CND.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nekuie, the Bench and the parties do have quite a bit of general information about the situation in Kigali, thanks to several years of work here.  What is it you want to place on record which is of direct relevance to the present case and which you need for your closing arguments?  Can you help us with that, please?  We just want to assist you so that you get, as soon as possible, to the points that are essential to the Defence case. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, well, general information is available admittedly, but the Defence would like to put forward elements for comparison within the context of this trial with regard to the specific charges that have been brought against Mr. Renzaho.  And Mr. Renzaho has to answer the charge relating to arms among other charges and the Bench will realise from my question that I was moving towards that chapter of the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And the next question is? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as at 6th April 1994, did you know the state of armament of the Rwandan Armed Forces? 
A.	Yes, I know.  So, maybe we should come back to Kigali because that is what we are talking about.  There were units in Kigali with some mentioned on the map.  There were two organic battalions, that is, Huye and Cyangugu.  I will spell that one:  C-Y-A-N-G-U-G-U.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Such terms are very well-known.  Just proceed.

Yes.
THE WITNESS:
I do apologise, Mr. President.  So concerning the state of armament, each unit in Kigali -- each army unit in Kigali had its organic -- depending on the organic structure, its armament, support armament and what was really important here is the ammunition.  So, there was a scarcity of ammunition.  Since there were no supplies following the peace accords of July 1992, that was the main characteristic, or with respect to the arms and ammunition. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, on 6th April 1994 were there weapons stocks of the Rwandan army at the ministry of defence? 
A.	No, Counsel, there were no weapon stocks of the Rwandan army in the ministry of defence.  Since the Rwandan army had only one major unit at the logistic base, which is the sole major unit of the 
	Rwandan army.  Apart from that level of logistics, there were no other notably known at the ministry of defence. 
Q.	Did you know, Witness, whether on 7th -- after 7th April 1994 the major weapon stocks were moved from the ministry of defence in Kigali?  
A.	That logistic unit known as the AR base remained over the -- under the oversight ministry of the army headquarters until June 1994. 
Q.	Following the marks that you made on the map, could the army headquarters set up such a structure within the premises of the ministry of defence? 
A.	No, the army headquarters is not found within the ministry of defence and neither is the logistics base. 
Q.	Would you know, Witness, if after 6th April 1994, weapon stocks also existed at the Kigali préfecture? 
A.	No, just as I responded for the ministry of defence, the army headquarters never had any reserves, weapons or ammunition elsewhere other than the logistic base. 
Q.	On 7th of April of 1994, do you know whether weapons were distributed to civilians from the ministry of defence? 
A.	No, I am not aware of that, but it would be absurd.  I don't see how the ministry of defence would have acquired such weapons since it took sometime to get weapons from the logistics base to the ministry of defence.  And as I just stated that there were no weapons stocked, unless there was any other way of supplying such weapons, the AR logistics base would first have a document signed before any potential client is supplied with weapons.  Such a client could be, of course, the ministry of defence.

1600H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Amongst the missions entrusted to UNAMIR in Kigali town, you referred to security that was ensured by the KIBAT Belgian battalion.  Was that the mission that was carried out by the -- by UNAMIR during the day of the 7th of April of 1994 in Kigali?  
A.	On the 7th of April of 1994, there was so much confusion in Kigali that I cannot specifically refer to UNAMIR for that day.  But the fact remains that there was a lot of gunfire throughout the day, and that at the end of the day the RPF went out of its barracks.  So I cannot state that UNAMIR did do what it was supposed to do in terms of security in Kigali town.  But, as I stated, confusion was reigning on the 7th of April, and UNAMIR certainly was not able to fulfil its duty since there were weapons that circulated, and there was a lot of gunfire in the town of Kigali on that day.  
Q.	Witness, could you be more explicit when you said that there was a lot of gunfire in Kigali on that day, and when you're stating that the soldiers came out of the barracks?  Could you be more specific as to when all these events took place, Witness?  
A.	During the morning of the 7th of April, anybody who was in Kigali in any neighbourhood could hear gunfire and also grenades blowing up, which is quite exceptional compared to any normal day in Kigali.  As for the exit of the RPF from the CND, it happened around 3 p.m. where the RPF went out of the CND to attack the Kimihurura camp, as well as the neighbouring locations, that is to say, the Kacyiru neighbourhood on the side of the Méridien hotel and the King Faisal hospital.  
Q.	Witness, according to you, what was the reason for the RPF coming out of its barracks on the 7th of April of 1994?  
A.	Well, I cannot read the minds of the RPF command.  What is clear is that after the president was assassinated, one had to go to a different stage.  Two hours subsequently we heard that there were RPF soldiers that were coming from the northern border towards Kabuye, and who were coming to join the soldiers at the CND.  So, as for the reasons, well, I'm not aware of such reasons, but what I was able to note was that there was indeed an attack at 3 p.m., and that at the same time there were troops that had already covered more than 50 kilometres since the morning, which means that the attack was well prepared in order for it to have taken place on that day.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie, when I asked you exactly the purpose of some of this general information, you kindly responded that it was necessary under the indictment.  I now have the indictment in front of me.  Now, which paragraphs are there that need this information?  And I'm sure a lot could be stipulated among the parties as to the general situation in Kigali, maybe even in writing.  What is the gist?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I unfortunately do not have a copy of the indictment before me in order to be able to check the information you are requesting from me.  But I believe we are all well aware that Mr. Renzaho, in the indictment, as in the testimonies by Prosecution witnesses, as well as in the Prosecution brief, has been charged with distribution of arms, or at least there were allegations whereby he had weapons distributed from the ministry of defence, and as early as the 7th of April of 1994 in Kigali.  And I deemed it fit for me to refer to these events -- purported events with the witness without them being leading questions put to him.  I believe I put questions to the witness, on which he provided clarifications, as to the possibility for the ministry of defence of having arms -- or, weapons in stock and distributing them.  Of course, the Trial Chamber, in its discretion, will rule on the matter.  But that was the objective I was aiming at.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel, the Chamber has a duty to help and lead the two counsels, the two sides.  I think what is in the indictment is -- what you are trying to contradict here is that your client distributed arms.  This witness has been useful in the sense that he's already stated that there was no arms in the préfecture under your client, and that he had nothing to do with the ministry of defence, and that the minister of defence had no arms in his possession.  So all of this other evidence that you are leading now is not necessary.  It is not helping your case in any way.  You have already established what you wanted to establish.  If you think it's necessary, you can go on.  But I think the Chamber thinks that it is unnecessary evidence and it is a waste of the Court's time.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Since my objective is to enlighten the Chamber, and if this is the position of the Trial Chamber, I shall change my line of questioning and consider that the Trial Chamber is now well aware of the fact that my client could not have had arms in his possession during the events.  If that is taken for granted, I can of course move to another line of questioning.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
No, it is not taken for granted.  All the Chamber is saying, this is what the witness has already said through your questions.  He answered that he had no arms in the préfecture, there were no arms in the ministry of defence.  So that's all we are trying to tell you; that is what he has stated, and it's on record.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Your Honour, I shall do my best for the Trial Chamber not to believe that we are wasting its precious time, and I will perhaps move on to matters -- or questions which I hope will be useful in enlightening you.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Yes.  Mr. Witness, may I ask you a question?  

Did you have the opportunity, after the 6th of April, to visit -- to make visits to the ministry of defence, the premises of this ministry?  If yes, how many times did you visit this building?  
THE WITNESS: 
I never had such an opportunity, Your Honour.  

JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, what was the impact of the gunshots that could be heard in Kigali and the exit of the RPF elements from the CND?  What was the impact of these actions on the population within the city from that date in April of 1994?  
A.	With regard to the explosions we heard in the morning from 9 or 10 onwards, and which continued in the afternoon, such explosions took place in the neighbourhoods which means that there were probably victims unless those shots were simply fired in the air.  But I don't think that was the case.  It means that in the different neighbourhoods there were people who were dying and who were being killed.  As for the fact that the RPF came out of its barracks, even though first of all the attack was aimed at the Kimihurura camp, subsequently the RPF attacked the Remera neighbourhood, as well as Kacyiru on the side of the King Faisal hospital.  And in the late afternoon and throughout the night, the inhabitants who were in the area occupied by the RPF were killed.  Apparently there were lists that had been drawn up and military or administrative authorities were targeted.  

But during the day, also, people who went out found themselves facing soldiers of the RPF and, on the basis of my experience and my knowledge, what was noted subsequently was that such people were either killed on the spot or grouped together in the stadium, that is to say in the camp of the United Nations mission, and were eliminated one by one, or subjected to very difficult conditions.  So as regards the population, whether we're talking about the gunshots or the exit from the barracks or the beginning of the conflict in Kigali, the impact was disastrous for the population, and during the three subsequent months, and on the basis of results that were found subsequently. 
Q.	Were you able to know who was attacking the population in Kigali outside of the area that was under RPF control at the time?  
A.	First of all, that is to say on the 7th of April, in the morning, one could not believe that the activities were due to armed bandits as usual.  One could feel that people were being killed by others.  But the phone calls we were receiving at the general staff mentioned "armed groups" that would attack residences without specifying who were the armed bandits.  So in the first day, one could not say who was killing whom.  But subsequently it became clear that in some neighbourhoods there were armed groups that were Hutu and who were attacking the Tutsis, and in other neighbourhoods such as Gikondo, Gishushu on the side of CND, and also Nyamirambo, it was the reverse.  There were people who were Tutsis and who were attacking Hutu residences.  

But, on the first day, one could hear gunshots.  One could not talk about acts of -- perpetrated by bandits, and one could not know who was killing who.  But subsequently it was clear that the Hutus were attacking the Tutsis, and that in some neighbourhoods there were also Tutsis who were attacking the Hutus.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, saying Tutsi attacking Hutu, you mean RPF soldiers?  
THE WITNESS: 
In a neighbourhood such as Gishushu -- I don't know whether you have it on the map.  The word is there.  It is right next to the mention of the RPF battalion.  That -- for that location it was obviously soldiers from the RPF.  But in other neighbourhoods such as the ones I mentioned, that is to say Gikondo and Nyamirambo, we learned subsequently that they were RPF soldiers but they were not wearing their military uniforms.  So in the confusion that was reigning during that first day, it was indeed Tutsis attacking Hutus.  But in Remera or Gishushu, the RPF soldiers were wearing their uniforms.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, did you say -- just say now that in the first day it was Tutsis attacking Hutus?  Is that the answer you gave to my learned brother?  That is on the 7th of April.  Are you telling the Chamber that it was Hutus attacking Tutsis (sic)?  Because that's what I heard.  Isn't it the other way round, that it was the Hutus -- it was the Hutu soldiers killing the Tutsis in the early hours of April 7th, 1994?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, Your Honour.  Perhaps I should repeat my answer in order to enlighten you, because you mentioned the Hutus and the Tutsis twice, and perhaps I should repeat my answer.  

I stated that on the 7th of April, the gunshots that could be heard from 10 in the morning, and in the phone calls we received at the general staff, reference was made to "armed groups" attacking residences.  We learned subsequently that some people or some of the groups were setting up roadblocks and were sorting out the people who were fleeing.  Now, regarding who was attacking whom, as I stated, we could not have known at the time when we were receiving such phone calls, since reference was made to "armed groups".  

But subsequently we learned that the calls coming from Gishushu, next to the CND -- or, the attacks, were indeed by military -- soldiers of the RPF who were attacking the Hutu populations, whereas in other neighbourhoods, such as Muhima, we came to learn that the Hutus were attacking the Tutsis.  In order to refer to the neighbourhoods where the Tutsis, identified as such, were attacking Hutus, I referred to Gishushu, I talked of Kivugiza in Nyamirambo; the word is written behind -- under "Nyamirambo" on the map.  And in a neighbourhood such as Nyamirambo, there were cases of Hutus -- of Tutsis attacking the Hutus.  

So to come back to the question put to me by Your Honour, in Gishushu they were wearing the military uniform, they were Tutsis from the RPF; whereas in Kivugiza they were not wearing military uniforms.  And this is why I'm not referring to soldiers, but rather to people who were Tutsis and who were attacking Hutus.  Now, you referred to soldiers of the armed forces.  I did not refer to any soldiers who might have been mentioned in the neighbourhoods I listed.  I did not talk about any soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces or of the gendarmerie in my first answer.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, so could you now answer the question?  Did soldiers kill Tutsi civilians in the morning of the 7th of April 1994, or not, in Kigali?  
THE WITNESS: 
On the morning of the 7th of April I was not told that any soldiers had killed Tutsis in those neighbourhoods.  But what I can say is that subsequently there were soldiers who were indeed involved in such killings, but for that day I would like to confirm that I did not get any information of that type, either at the level of the general staff or personally.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And later did you receive information to that effect, or you do not know that it happened?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, subsequently we came to learn, and I personally came to learn, that there were indeed soldiers who would leave the barracks or leave the front line in order to go and perpetrate killings along with the groups I called "armed groups".  I came to hear of it subsequently.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the answer to Judge Arrey's question is yes, but you simply learned of it later.  That's the core, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, this testimony is of a general nature in the sense that it provides useful background information about the situation in Kigali which may be of relevance at a later stage.  This witness has written a declaration consisting of seven pages, and that declaration contains very few references to Mr. Renzaho.  It's all about arms, weapons, et cetera.  Now, there have been no initiatives in relation to Rule 92 bis from any party here, but leaving that formal question aside, would it be possible that at least part of this statement given to the Defence could form part of the record as an exhibit?  And then there will be less need to get this as oral testimony, and the Prosecution would be able to cross-examine on the basis of this written statement, the Defence would be in the position to choose particular portions of this statement that it wants to pursue.  But to repeat what this witness has already said in this statement would seem not to be necessary.  
Now, is this a procedure the parties would wish to consider?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, my position, as always, I'm happy for any procedure which is going to speed up the process which doesn't compromise the rights of either party.  And I hear what Your Honour is saying.  And I was just checking Rule 92 bis to ensure that, by agreeing to such a statement going in, it isn't any concession by the Prosecution that -- as to the truth of all the contents of it.  And I don't believe that is the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
My suggestion was not really to place this under the umbrella of 92 bis.  The procedure envisaged could be that I would simply ask the witness whether what he has stated in his declaration to the Defence, his summary, is truthful, and then I will ask the Defence whether that is the kind of information the Defence wants to solicit from this witness.  And if the answer to both questions are "yes", then we could simply say that this is what is on record in this case.  
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  Your Honour, my -- I'm just having a quick look through -- we only got this disclosed last week, and it hasn't been translated.  So I'm going on my reading of the -- of the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will see that there are references to Mr. Renzaho -- 
MR. MOSES: 
In paragraph 10. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 -- in paragraph 5; and then in paragraph 9, at the end there; and in paragraph 10.  
MR. MOSES: 
I mean, I'm happy for it to be -- to proceed in the manner Your Honour's suggested, as long as I'm entitled to cross-examine on it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will.  

Now, Mr. Nekuie, would that be suitable, also in relation to your interests, that we simply tender this declaration as an exhibit, if we receive the witness's confirmation that this is indeed his evidence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
But, Mr. President, if the Trial Chamber so wishes, I don't see any problem with that.  I do not want to put questions to the witness on the statements he made if the -- this is not convenient to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We want the substance, Mr. Nekuie.  It's not a matter of convenience.  It's a matter of whether you can achieve the same with a more precise method, formulated in writing by the witness himself.  It's to ensure efficient communication and get it down in a precise way.  And you will certainly be able to pose additional questions if you so wish, based on that declaration.  That's the suggestion.  Would this be helpful?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, I would satisfy myself with questions that would clarify the Chamber, because the Chamber's (sic) role is to clarify the Chamber.  We would not want a situation where the Chamber will mislead the -- where the Defence will mislead the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you have very kindly prepared a statement, the 29th of July 2007, in order to assist the Defence to convey to the Prosecution and the Chamber the contents of your testimony.  This declaration, do you confirm that that is indeed -- that this is indeed a truthful account, according to you, and this is your view, what you have written down here?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I don't have anything before me now.  I know I signed a document dated 29 July, and I would like to know what document you have there.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's coming.  

All right, what about this declaration, Mr. Witness?  Is it okay?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, the document is for me, as far as the seven pages I have here are concerned.  And I declare that it is truthful, as far as the content is concerned.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Having heard that, do you then, if I understood you correctly, agree, Mr. Nekuie, that you can tender this as an exhibit and then continue your examination-in-chief based on this document?  Would that be suitable to you?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I accept, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you to both parties.  

Mr. Matemanga, that Defence exhibit will then be?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 78.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will have a look, I think it may well have to be under seal if there is anything about the witness's occupation.
Please proceed, Defence counsel.  
MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  Perhaps we could also request for an official translation into English, just for the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And the French version will be A, and the English version, once it is available, will be B, of this exhibit number.  And because of the introduction in this document which identifies the witness, we will have to place it under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 78A admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please proceed.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, on the basis of information you received, did you know if those armed gangs that were perpetrating the acts you described in the city of Kigali, that is the killings, had any relation or link with the préfecture of Kigali city?  
A.	My answer is no -- rather, I don't know.  I don't know if these armed gangs were -- had any links with the préfecture of Kigali.  What is certain is that when the movement -- the movement started in the morning and involved persons who came from all the neighbourhoods in the city of Kigali.  So it involved all the neighbourhoods. 
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber whether the Rwandan army took measures to punish these persons, or not, at that time?  
A.	Well first, that is on 7 and even 8 July (sic), the army's command limited itself to sending out the calls -- the distress calls that they received to the gendarmerie post that were well established in the neighbourhoods of Kigali.  Later on, with the opening of hostilities in the afternoon of 7 April, all meetings of the general staff observed that massacres were going on and were actually intensifying, but each time members of the general staff meeting realised that they did not have enough means to check the situation.  So when I mentioned the intervention of the gendarmerie the following day, all the calls were sent to the gendarmerie, which was supposed to take care of that problem, since hostilities had opened at the army headquarters at the sector command units.  

Unfortunately later on the fighting, or the war, became generalised and there was talk of insecurity at the political level -- and in the government that was set up later -- and the government also came to the same conclusion -- the head -- army headquarters also came to the same conclusion.  But, as far as I know, no army units went out in the field to fight these armed gangs of killers.  
Q.	What about the soldiers for whom it was established that they joined armed gangs to commit such acts?  Were any measures taken against these persons?  
A.	Well, as far as disciplinary or criminal measures against the soldiers were concerned, the army headquarters as such did not take any measures for the simple reason that he has no troops for that.  Only the various units were concerned.  So they may have had deserting soldiers or persons who left units or combat battalions to go and swell the ranks of the cohort of killers.  So, at the level of the army headquarters, no disciplinary procedure was conducted.  

So now at the level of units, certainly some started such procedures, but they did not carry them to their conclusion -- I'm talking about Kigali.  And following the war situation that prevailed and the administrative situation, that you can well imagine.  
(Pages 63 to 71 by Kirstin McLean)





























1640H
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, could you be more specific when you mention administrative instability, because I find it hard to imagine what you mean, so could you be more specific on what you meant? 
A.	Well, at the general staff meetings that I mentioned the secteur and unit commanders were ordered to punish and check the criminals, especially those from the army, and to check civilians who were outlaws and who were actually carrying out the massacres and killing civilians.  But the instability I mentioned, I actually spoke of Kigali because very quickly all the commands, that is the operational commands and the gendarmerie were overwhelmed, because in a few days it spread to the entire camp and with respect to military discipline, there is the military police which was cut off from the rest of the town and which was forced to wall itself in and protect itself.  It is situated to the north of the map.  

So, administrative instability here would mean that if you start a disciplinary measure and you had to look for a soldier who has killed somebody and then prosecute him, bring him before -- you need a commander, and then compile a file, it would not have been possible in Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would it be possible to ask questions which makes it possible for the witness to answer briefly?  

Could you make an effort, Mr. Witness?  

Now, the next question. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Still concerning possible measures that could have been taken to punish these armed gangs, Witness, could you tell us whether any form of collaboration was envisaged or undertaken with the Kigali préfectoral authorities for that purpose, that is trying to check the killings that were going on in the town? 
A.	Well, let's say it was a reciprocal approach; that is, the préfet of the city at the first meeting of the army headquarters called for help.  Well, he was informing the army headquarters that there were massacres, but the army headquarters, as far as I know, had never given him any response in terms of meeting his demands or satisfying his demands.  There was also the gendarmerie, but as I said I believe the préfet referred to the gendarmerie also, which was under the army general staff.  But as far as punishment and disciplinary measures were concerned, there were no tangible results and one of the courses conducted of things was that administratively within the military and within the state prosecutor's office, no effective procedure could actually be concluded or carried out. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, we will move quickly to the second part of the events from 
	April to July 1994, and specifically May 1994.  Were there cases of desertion registered within the 
	Huye battalion that was stationed in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, of course, there were.  There was a lot of desertion, and I believe the same thing happened in other battalions. 
Q.	Do you know if those deserting soldiers from the other battalions and the Huye battalion placed themselves on the authority of the préfet of Kigali city? 
A.	No, that would be frankly absurd, because to desert a unit to go and place oneself under the préfet or the préfecture would be absurd because I know that those people who took up clubs to kill civilians were civilian gangs and these people were not answerable to any authority. 
Q.	Witness, do you know if during the campaign conducted by the Huye battalion from May until about July, would you know if there were any civilian targets that were effected in the city of Kigali? 
A.	Well, talking about civilian targets, that's where I started by mentioning kidnapping or torture of civilians on the part of the RPF.  As was noticed and reported by persons who were fleeing, there were -- shots were firing that targeted war-displaced persons, for instance, on the 1st May I was at my first post and I actually saw the damage that was done.  But there were also shots that targeted the market, the Kigali market, where a number of people were gathered.  But one could suppose that the RPF site was doing it on purpose because they had well-targeted cannons.  

And so later on there was a raid on the Eglise Sainte Famille on 16 June and which targeted rescue operations for people who were on the government side around the Sainte Famille parish and around Saint Paul.  So the RPF operation sought to save people, but they would use the occasion to kill other persons.  

So I may have cited Nyacyonga incident, but it is not within the period of your question. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for that information.  And I would like to dwell a bit on the raid you mentioned, the raid of 16th June 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You just referred to a location.  You said:  So I may have cited that particular incident, but it is not within the period or within your question.  Could you just repeat the location you referred to?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it is Nyacyonga.  N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A, Nyacyonga. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, we are in open session, so when you are giving your answers don't get too much into details.  Now talking about that raid of 16 June 1994, I would like to know whether physically you were in a position to be fully informed of the occurrence of that event.  You can answer a yes or no simply.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, when that raid was carried out on 16 June 1994, did you know if it was followed by any reaction on the part of soldiers of the Rwandan army? 
A.	The raid was not followed by any reprisal or any pursuit of the elements who carried out the raid on that day. 
Q.	Again Witness, do you know if on the day after the raid the Rwandan army carried out a reprisal campaign following the raid? 
A.	The Rwandan army did not carry out any reprisal following the raid that was carried out on that date against the Sainte Famille and Saint Paul churches. 
Q.	Do you know if officers of the Rwandan army went to the site of the raid on the day after the operation? 
A.	Yes, I know that the secteur commander, whose name I'm going to cite, Colonel Ndahimana.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
N-D-A-H-I-M-A-N-A.  
THE WITNESS:
Lieutenant Mutabaruka.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-U-T-A-B-A-R-U-K-A.
THE WITNESS:  
Respectively secteur commander and commander of the unit in the area where the raid took place, visited the area in the morning. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, were you also able to know whether on the morning of 17 June 1994 Préfet Renzaho visited the area? 
A.	No, I have no knowledge of that. 
Q.	Witness, at this time I would like us to talk about the issue of civil defence, and I'd like to ask you the following question:  During all these events from April to July 1994, did the Rwandan army have the opportunity to set up a civil defence mechanism within the city of Kigali? 
A.	No, the Rwandan army could not set up such a mechanism according to -- following guidelines that I may have known. 
Q.	Did you know at that time an officer of the Rwandan army known as Bivamvagara? 
A.	Yes, I know him.  He had retired as commander in the years that preceded the war, I believe, before 1990. 
Q.	Witness, do you know if that officer was in the city of Kigali during the events and what his missions were? 
A.	Commander Bivamvagara was in the city of Kigali around the end of May, within the context of the training of recruits who were supposed to enforce combat troops.  So his mission in Kigali was decentralised training, as opposed to what we used to know -- that is, combined training of army recruits.  So at the time the ministerial directives spoke of decentralised training.  So that was why Commander Bivamvagara was in Kigali. 
Q.	So Bivamvagara's tasks, as you describe it, were they not technically more related to the notion of civilian self-defence? 
A.	No, his mission had nothing to do with the civil service defence mechanism.  But as I said, that these followed guidelines.  But this time around there was no civilian self-defence, but recruitment that was conducted in much of the haste at decentralised levels, so there were structures for that.  Each préfecture had to provide young recruits to combat units and these recruits had to undergo crash training to reinforce the combat troops.  So the civil self-defence could have no place in this kind of training.  These were troops that received crash training, but they were soldiers, fighters who were trained for the army. 
Q.	Witness, do you know if Mr. Bivamvagara had any relation with the préfet of the city of Kigali at the time? 
A.	Well, the fact that he was in Kigali and was doing training, and that Préfet Renzaho was an administrative official in Kigali meant that they were in contact.  But Commander Bivamvagara was answerable to the secteur commander of the city of Kigali, just like anybody who was in Gisenyi would be answerable to the commander of Gisenyi.  So, if there was any kind of relationship, it would be more of collaboration, or rather marginal collaboration, inasmuch as Préfet Renzaho knew that Bivamvagara was there.  And the recruits or candidates for combat came from the city of Kigali. 
Q.	Within the framework of this marginal collaboration, Witness, and given the fact that Colonel Renzaho was a colonel in the Rwandan army, could Mr. Bivamvagara be deemed to be his subordinate? 
A.	No.  The link between them could have been of co-ordination of the activities that were being carried out, but not of subordination.  Commander Bivamvagara was answerable to the secteur and that was where he reported on the results of the training.  And once the training was finalised he did not introduce the new fighters to the préfet but rather to the commander of the secteur.  That was the procedure. 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I see it is 5 p.m.  I am almost at the end of my examination-in-chief, but I am in the 
Trial Chamber's hands if it deems that we are to stop at this stage. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What does "almost" mean?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Well, I don't think I will have more than 20 minutes with the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  If that is the significance of "almost", we will continue tomorrow morning.  Do you want to tender this exhibit, this map, so that we have this in the transcript of today in order to avoid any kind of confusion with the witness's annotations?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 79.
(Exhibit No. D. 79 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  The court is adjourned until tomorrow morning.  At 8:45 we will then continue with your testimony, Mr. Witness.  Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1704H)
