MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand that you are testifying under pseudonym; is that so, or your own name? 
THE WITNESS: 
I may use my own name.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  You have to tell the truth, Mr. Kagame, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Faustin Kagame in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you there with your signature; isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information in this document is correct.  
THE WITNESS: 
They are correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:

MR. TREDICI: 
Good morning.
  
FAUSTIN KAGAME,
first having duly been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Good morning.  
A.	Good morning, sir.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are Rwandese? 
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	You are 60 years old? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	And you are living in Switzerland? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	How long have you been living in Switzerland? 
A.	Since 1974. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And your first question, Mr. Tredici, was whether he was Rwandan; isn't that so?  
MR. TREDICI: 
That was my first question, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Please watch the screen.  Yes, next question.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what was your occupation during 1994? 
A.	In 1994 I was a journalist.  
Q.	Were you employed or you were a freelance journalist?  
A.	I was self-employed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, as a freelance journalist, which media houses were you associated with?  
A.	I worked with a weekly whose name was -- and still is L'Hebdo, as well as the Info-Sud agency.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honour, I don't know if we need assistance with the names of the media houses the witness has just mentioned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We do need assistance.  

So you mentioned two names now, Mr. Witness, of two agencies.  Can you help us with the spelling of those two?  One by one, slowly, please.  

THE WITNESS: 
Info-Sud is spelled I-N-F-O, hyphen, S-U-D.  And L'Hebdo is L, apostrophe, H-E-B-D-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, where were you between the 2nd and the 23rd of April 1994?  
A.	I was at the CND. 
Q.	What were you referred (sic) to when you mentioned CND? 
A.	It was a building at the time where a battalion of the Rwandan patriotic front was accommodated.  The battalion was stationed there by virtue of the Arusha Accords.  But well before that, I believe that building was the parliament of the former single party.  
Q.	And where is this building located?  
A.	This building is located in Kimihurura, Kimihurura. 
Q.	Please mention the name of the locality where this building is located.  
A.	You mean the town?  In Kigali, of course.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  What did you go to do in Rwanda in April 1994? 
A.	I had gone to Rwanda for a news report. 
Q.	And could you please explain to the Chamber what were your goals or objectives when you went to Rwanda in April 1994?  
A.	I was an independent journalist who'd already worked with the Info-Sud agency on other subjects.  I had convinced the agency, as well as the weekly L'Hebdo to go to Rwanda because what was happening there was very interesting for the Swiss public.  So I had proposed to them the subject, they were the Arusha Accords, and I thought I would go and report on reconciliation and the Arusha Accords, and I had even made contact with WWF in order to deal with a subject which might have been of interest to Europe, which was the fate of the gorillas during the war.  So I was going there with the objective of talking about peace and reconciliation.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, could you slow down, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
I shall try to do so, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you referred to WWF, which means World Wildlife Fund. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, indeed.  

BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned before that your primary objective, if I may say, was to conduct interviews and to cover the peace agreements in the course of your stay in Rwanda.  My question is:  Were you able to accomplish these objectives of your mission? 
A.	The objectives of the news report were met beyond my expectations, but, of course, what occurred was not what I expected.  
Q.	I think the Trial Chamber would like to know, who were you planning to interview?  You mentioned you were planning to conduct interviews.  Can you please elaborate on this?  
A.	Well, apart from the two agencies that had sent me there, and for which I was accredited, I had already -- I had also created, with a friend of mine who died during the genocide, a newspaper.  And that was a newspaper that we created when the Arusha Accords was signed.  Our slogan was "newspaper born with the Arusha agreement", so we had decided to cover the country.  He would cover the south, I would cover the north, the part under the RPF, and we had decided to meet in Kigali, which we did.  We indeed met.  

I arrived in Kigali on the 2nd -- I arrived in Kigali on the 2nd of April.  I met with him, and we had decided to set up a programme of interviews.  And I remember there were a number of people we had appointments with, notably Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Joyce Leader, who was, I believe, an American who represented the United States, and Lando, Landouald Ndasingwa, among other people.  But you know that when one goes on report, one -- it is not always easy to know who we will meet in advance.  But those were the ones we had decided to see, and we had fixed appointments with them.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, do you have this laminated document in front of you?  Can you look at me, please?  Now, these are guidelines for efficient communication in the courtroom.  Do you see number 2 there?  
THE WITNESS: 
D'accord. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you will note when you speak slowly, you will particularly do so when you mention a lot of names.  Can you please help us?  Now we have to backtrack again, because you were too fast.  We got Twagiramungu, we got Uwilingiyimana, but now you also referred to an American name.  Please spell that name.  
THE WITNESS: 
Joyce Leader is spelt J-O-Y-C-E, L-E-A-D-E-R.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Leader, like a leader in English. 

THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I do believe that is so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the word, please?  Oh, no.  Yes, it is L-E-A-D-E-R, according to the additional spelling list you have provided, number 1 on the list.
MR. TREDICI:
That's correct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Landouald was number 2.  We have all the four names on the spelling list.  Thank you.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, my question now is:  In the light of the circumstances that prevailed in Kigali when you were there, were you able to undertake other journalistic endeavours while at CND?  
A.	Well, of course.  When one goes on a report, one has one's ears and eyes open, and one's equipment ready.  So very early in the morning, since one has to keep informed, I would listen to radio stations, and more specifically, those that were operating in Rwanda, Radio Rwanda, and also radio and television RFI, the BBC, and possibly other radio stations.  I had my small recorder.  I was always ready to take interviews.  And then I would have to find a way to send news releases to the agencies that had sent me there.  
Q.	Were you able to conduct any interviews at all while you stayed at CND?  
A.	Well, yes, I was able to interview a number of people indeed.  When the war started, I remember, I interviewed General Dallaire.  I was able to put a few question -- a few questions to him in passing.  That would be a more apt description of what occurred.  When the war broke out, I was able to talk with the first RPF soldier who was injured.  And every occasion I had to ask questions, I would use such an occasion.  I also recall having seen General Gatsinzi also.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You mentioned that you had with you a tape recorder; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Did you use this tape recorder?  
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	Could you please explain to the Chamber what kind of recordings you made there?  I am referring to your stay at the CND.  
A.	So, at CND I was able to record -- I just referred to the soldier who was injured, et cetera.  I was also able to record the RTLM radio, and that was the radio station I was the most interested in.  It was a radio that was different from the others.  So that was information.  I was also able to record conversations of people who were talking amongst one another, using a walkie-talkie belonging to an RPF soldier.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, why did you choose in particular to make recordings of RTLM broadcasts?  
A.	I believe I gave the reason.  It was because I had been greatly impressed when I arrived in Kigali.  I was quite surprised that such a radio station be able to continue to broadcast, and that people had become used to such programmes.  So this was, of course, something I wished to report on when I would return to Switzerland.  
Q.	Could you please specify, what were you using to record this broadcast?  
A.	I had a small radio I had brought with me, and also a small Sony tape recorder which was a bit more sophisticated than a dictaphone, since there was also an equaliser on this device.  So this is what I used to make my recordings, but I would not do it continuously.  It was when there was something striking -- which, of course, I never knew what orientation the speeches would take.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, many persons think fast.  But that doesn't mean that you have to talk fast.  Now, please help us.  This is the third time.  Speak slowly.  Will you do that?  You see, every word you say has to be interpreted.  It has to be transcribed.  And if you do not follow that rule, we have to play the tape of your testimony afterwards.  Okay?  Whenever Mr. Tredici does like that to you, it means you have fallen into your bad habits.  

Here comes the next question.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Obliged, Your Honour.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that you also recorded a telephone conversation or telephone conversations between what you believed were officials.  What kind of recordings were these?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I do not believe I heard the witness make such a statement.  I do not know whether this is a suggestion that counsel for the Prosecution is putting to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you are referring to the reference to telephone.  I think we only have heard about walkie-talkie so far.  So you are right, Defence.  

Please reformulate, Mr. Tredici.  
MR. TREDICI: 
I apologise.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	So, my question would be:  You referred to conversations that you recorded.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	And you made a reference to a walkie-talkie.  Could you please elaborate on this issue?  What kind of recordings were these?  
A.	Those were telephone conversations, mostly. 
Q.	Could you please explain to the Chamber how you made these recordings? 
A.	Well, I got near to a soldier who had his walkie-talkie.  He was with another soldier.  I saw them laugh.  I went next to them, and they told me that they were listening to conversations -- they were listening to telephone conversations.  So I was quite surprised, and I asked them whether I could make recordings, and they accepted.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
They were listening to telephone conversations how?  
THE WITNESS: 
Using the walkie-talkies. 
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you recall the date in which you recorded these telephone conversations? 
A.	Well, I believe it was between the 14th or maybe the 15th and the 18th. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of which month?  
THE WITNESS: 
Of April.  April 1994.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be able to identify the recording you made of these telephone conversations? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Have you recently listened to the recording you made of these telephone conversations? 
A.	Yes, in part.  In part.  
Q.	Where did you listen to this recording? 
A.	First of all, I made copies recently, before coming here, because I wanted to have some backup copies.  So I had the opportunity to listen to them at that point.  But not the totality of them.  I was just carrying out some checks. 
Q.	Most recently, have you listened to this recording after you made these copies you just mentioned?  
A.	Well, yes, I did because I met with the investigators and they made me listen to the tapes.  Yes.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...made you listen to?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you say something, Mr. Tredici?  
MR. TREDICI: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What did you say?  The mikes were overlapping.  Can you repeat what you said?  
MR. TREDICI: 
My question was:  What is it that they made you listen to?  

THE WITNESS: 
Well, in fact the investigators were the ones who made me listen to the tapes so that I would confirm that it was indeed the recordings I had made.  What I was made to listen were excerpts of my recordings.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Were you able to compare the audio recording, you listened with the transcript of that same audio recording? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When -- when did this conversation with the investigators take place, Mr. Witness?  When did you listen to the transcripts together with them -- or, with the -- to the tapes?  
THE WITNESS: 
On the first occasion it was in Brussels on the 2nd or the 3rd of February, I believe.  It was on a Sunday, in any case.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which year?  
THE WITNESS: 
Of this year, 2007.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And was there a second occasion?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, it was yesterday, I believe, or day before yesterday.  That is when I came here, just to check and be sure.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, with the authorisation of the Trial Chamber, you will be shown a transcript of a recording.  And I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber if you recognise this transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you got this in front of you, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Non.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The English version runs until page 74, according to the pagination on the bottom right-hand side.  Which page?  
MR. TREDICI: 
I have given the witness the three versions; Kinyarwanda, French, and English versions.  But I think it would be better to refer to the Kinyarwandan version.  I am in your hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you speak Kinyarwanda, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Perfectly.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which page?  
THE WITNESS: 
I have page K0167889.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the equivalent page in English is?  Are you able to help us?  Either you or the Prosecution.  You could start with the French equivalent, if that is easier, please.  
MR. TREDICI: 
K0167745, if I am not wrong.  I just gave my copy to the witness.  The French equivalent will be K0167820.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have now given us two K numbers.  They are different.  The first one was the English; the second was the French.  
MR. TREDICI: 
That's correct, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I would like you to look through the transcript you have in front of you, the Kinyarwanda version.  
A.	Are you asking me to read it?  
Q.	Look through.  
A.	Très bien. 
Q.	I think that you have already seen this transcript you have just mentioned.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The page numbers we have now are simply the page number of the first page of the three versions.  But you want to go to some particular page.  What is the question now?  
MR. TREDICI: 
I was inviting the witness to go through the Kinyarwanda transcript to see if he could recognise the transcript. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, from all indication it is the right one.  It is.  

BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Do you recognise this transcript as being the one reproducing the telephone conversations you recorded; is that what you mean?  
A.	That is correct. 
MR. TREDICI: 
The Kinyarwandan version, Your Honour, being the original transcript.  I think it's enough -- if you want, we can check with the French and the English version also.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you gone through this Kinyarwandan version and compared it to what you recorded, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that is so.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You did not translate the French and the English, but have you read those versions?  
THE WITNESS: 
No.  No.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honour, the translations are official translations.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I asked that question because you wanted the guidance of the Bench as to how to proceed.  It is clear there is no follow-up in relation to those two versions in respect of this witness.  That is why that question was asked.  
MR. TREDICI: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you make copies of these recordings? 
A.	Yes, I made copies.  
Q.	What did you do with these copies? 
A.	I gave them to those who asked me for them, or more specifically, those who needed them.  I mean, the investigators.  
Q.	What investigators are you referring to, Mr. Witness?  
A.	On the first occasion I gave a copy of that recording -- I believe there were three, I gave one to Mr. Alain Sigg in Geneva. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Mr. Witness, where are the originals of these audio tapes?  
A.	I have them with me at home.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I would like to move to my last question.  And before I move to my last question -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This person in Geneva, is he on the spelling list?  
MR. TREDICI: 
He is not, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you help us, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have the press the button so there is a red light.  You have to switch on your microphone.  
THE WITNESS: 
Alain Sigg -- Alain is A-L-A-I-N, Sigg is S-I-G-G.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
S-I-G-G?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.  
MR. TREDICI: 
I would kindly ask the assistance of the registry to distribute the -- a CD-ROM with the recordings.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Defence has this already?  
MR. TREDICI: 
Yes, they have this already, but I have a complimentary copy here for them.  
BY MR. TREDICI: 
Q.	Witness, please tell the Chamber if the audio recordings you were referring to -- you mentioned that you listened to this audio recording yesterday or the day before yesterday -- was identified with a reference number?  
A.	Yes, that indeed is what you have given to me, with the reference numbers.  
Q.	Could you please produce it?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You want the witness to read "KTOO-1084"?  
MR. TREDICI: 
We want to introduce as an exhibit this audio recording, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ah, so you are doing this.  I see.  Yes.  You want to tender this as an exhibit.  All right.  Any other questions to this witness?  
MR. TREDICI: 
Then my last question would be -- with the assistance, again, of the registrar.  I already distributed copies of a book called Broadcasting Genocide.  I have the original with me here, Your Honour.  I can circulate it.  I borrowed it from the ICTR library.  
So, with your leave, I will invite the witness to read the first sentence of the second paragraph of the acknowledgments of this book.  That's the last page of the sets of copies that were distributed.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the question now, Mr. Witness, you have the last page in front of you, and we would ask you kindly to read, in English, because this is written in English, into the record, the first sentence of the second paragraph, starting with your name.  Can you do that for us, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well.  "Faustin Kagame, an article -- an article 19 consultant" -- that is enough -- "contributed and published transcripts of RTLM from April '94, which he recorded while in hiding during the first few weeks of the genocide". 
BY MR. TREDICI:
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have noted your request to tender this document.  We will first hear the cross-examination of this witness before deciding that issue.  

Defence?  
MR. TREDICI: 
Your Honour, if I may have one -- of course, the Prosecution intends to tender the CD-ROM that contains the audio recordings, and the transcripts.  The Kinyarwandan transcripts that were identified as a -- as a legitimate transcript of the content of the audio recording, and the official translations.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that's understood, and that was what was meant.  So now we would wish to hear the Defence before ruling on any of these matters.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, before I go into the possible cross-examination of this witness, Defence would like to submit to your Bench an oral motion on the testimony.  So, by your leave, I would like to go into that request.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence motion seeks to have excluded immediately the testimony of Mr. Faustin Kagame for two reasons:  One, that this testimony is on evidence which amount to new -- new facts which do not appear in the investment -- in the indictment, and cannot be entered through -- can only be entered through adequate notice, as established in the -- within the jurisprudence of this Court.  

For these two reasons, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence would like to state that the recording of the telephone conversation, which the Prosecutor would like to enter into evidence through this witness, Faustin Kagame, is clearly a new material fact which is not challenged by the Prosecutor.  Besides, let me say, Mr. President, that the Prosecutor himself stated, in the course of whenever he addressed your Court, and whenever it was the case for the Defence to listen to these recordings.  

In order to refresh your memory, Mr. President, Your Honours, on the allegations of the Defence in relation to the nature of this new evidence, I am going to indicate to you that similar facts on the recordings or interceptions of recordings were clearly mentioned by the Prosecutor in his indictment in paragraph 14, because he was -- he was aware of the fact that these were material facts which ought to be necessarily brought to the notice of the Defence through the indictment.  And in that paragraph 14, it is said -- he states as follows:  "On 8 April" -- that is page 6 of the indictment, amended on 16th February 2006.  Paragraph 14 is not very long, Mr. President, Your Honours, so I would like to read it.  

It states as follows:  "On the 8th of April 1994, or around that date, Tharcisse Renzaho planned, ordered, incited to commit, or aided to commit the murder of the director of the Rwandan development bank.  He confirmed this fact by radio telephone on the same date or around that date to Colonel Bagosora, who was participating in the common criminal enterprise referred to in paragraph 6 supra".  

It is therefore clear, Mr. President, that in the light of this reference made by the Prosecutor, the statement that we are making that it is a material fact cannot be challenged.  

Given the fact that this statement cannot be challenged, the Prosecutor later on notified on the 23rd October 2005, notified the Defence, and on that occasion was careful to mention the evidence that he wanted to have -- the evidence that he wanted to bring through the witness before you.  And on that occasion, this is what he said -- and I would like to read it because it is also not too long.  That is on page 20 and page 21 of the pre-trial brief of the Prosecutor.  And these deal with the development that needs to be brought to the intention -- or the attention of the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have now referred to page numbers of the pre-trial brief, but they differ in English and French.  What is the paragraph numbers, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, it's page (sic) 89 of the French version, and the pages I gave were also the pages of the French version of the pre-trial brief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And what you did say in French now was that it was paragraph 89; isn't that so?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Eighty-nine, Mr. President.  That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have it.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I just want to read a portion of that paragraph on the intention of the -- or, the intent of the Accused, where the Prosecutor alleges that, nonetheless, the Tribunal may infer this intention in addition to the facts already mentioned to a number of facts and circumstances.  For example, the general framework within which the -- the fact which is normally referred to as genocide, which occurred in Rwanda between the 6th (sic) and 17 July 1994 occurred.  I did not read the full paragraph, but let me just limit it to that, because that is the essence of what I want to bring to the attention of Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have the guidelines in front of you?  With other words -- 
MR. NEKUIE: 
I'm paying attention to that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So you are now about to slow down when reading, aren't you, according to guideline 2.  Please do.  Yes.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Very well.  Very well, Mr. President.  

For the stenographers, for the sake of the stenographers, maybe I should read what I have just read more slowly.  I was saying, Mr. President, the Prosecutor charges in that paragraph as follows:  "However, the Tribunal may also infer that intent, in addition to the elements already mentioned, to a number of facts and circumstances, such as the general framework within which the material facts took place, that is, generally referred to as genocide in Rwanda, between the 6th of April and 17th July 1994, which refers to the large-scale massacres and subjecting Tutsis to conditions and other evidence which the Prosecutor will adduce.  A -- subparagraph A", the Prosecutor says, "the Accused referred -- talked about extermination in a telephone conversation with Mr. Rugambarara, the Bicumbi -- the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, who was arrested -- which was intercepted".  Sorry.  

It is therefore clear that in making reference to this in a pre-trial brief, and in making such assertions, the Prosecutor does not challenge the nature of the evidence which constitutes material facts intended exclusively, according to the Prosecutor, to demonstrate the mens rea of the Accused; that it is also established by statements of the same Prosecutor in reference to these charges, during the hearing of -- proceeding of 22nd January 2005, when the Accused clearly challenged the admission of this -- the interception of these telephone conversations into evidence.  
Mr. President, Your Honours, this assertion is on the basis of the nature of the evidence which is at issue.  The issue that your Chamber is being requested to decide on through our motion is whether this evidence, which constitutes material fact, and which does not appear in the indictment, may be admitted in view of the information -- or, the evidence that the Prosecutor has adduced thus far.  And the answer, Mr. President, has already been given by your Bench through the main principles on the admission of such evidence in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Théoneste Bagosora and others in your decision dated 29th June 2006, on the motion submitted by the Accused, Ntabakuze, requesting for the exclusion of evidence which is in the same vein as this.  

Now, to answer -- in answering that motion, Your Honours, you set forth the following principles, in paragraph 10 of your decision.  And here I only have the English version -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We remember our case law.  Do you have a copy for the Bench available?  Yes, please.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, what you are doing is to draw our attention to paragraph 10 in our decision of 29th June 2006, which includes one of the applicable principles to be adhered to in this area.  All right, that's noted.  

So which sentence is it you want us to look at?  The second sentence is:  "Where the material fact cannot be reasonably related to the indictment, then it shall be excluded".  And then, third sentence:  "Where the material fact is relevant, then the Chamber will -- relevant only to a vague or general allegation in the indictment, then the Chamber will consider whether notice of the material fact was given in the pre-trial brief, or the opening statement, so as to cure the vagueness of the indictment".  

Are these two sentences the key sentences in that paragraph?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Exactly, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, those are the two main principles that your Chamber set forth regarding the analysis on the admissibility of this type of evidence.  And the Defence submits that in the light of these rules, the evidence that the Prosecutor has brought before your Court cannot be accepted by your Court.  The first reason for this Defence claim is that it is not challenged whatsoever, that this evidence does not appear in the indictment.  It cannot be challenged.  That this evidence cannot even reasonably be linked up to any charges whatsoever contained in the indictment that has just been established through the examination-in-chief of this witness who, in the entire course of his examination-in-chief, did not mention once the name of the accused person, Tharcisse Renzaho, as well as the Prosecutor, who did not even bother to mention Tharcisse Renzaho in the course of his examination-in-chief.  

In the light of the evidence of this witness, it is obvious that there is no link whatsoever between his indictment and the charges brought against the accused person by the Prosecutor in the indictment.  We have already, Mr. President, Your Honours, made other submissions during the objections that we raised, particularly in January 2007, particularly with regard to the content of the indictment.  I just want to refer your Court to these additional submissions so as to go on and raise the issue as to whether the second rule that you, yourself, set forth -- it is possible for the Chamber to consider whether this evidence is admissible, because the Prosecutor's -- the fact that the Prosecutor did not notify this earlier can be cured by the fact of sufficient notification.  The answer, Mr. President, is no.  

The Prosecutor cannot submit that this allegation -- this charge is contained in his pre-trial brief, because the requirement of not -- notice, which you raise and which is in this decision of 29th January 2006, is such that notice shall be clear, coherent and done within a time limit that would enable the Defence to prepare to respond to the charges of the Prosecutor, and thus making it possible for your Court to have a fair trial.  So there are three cumulative conditions for notice, for notice to be valid.  

In the case at bar, I have read the references that the Prosecutor has made to these new factual allegations.  It so happens that even though that the Prosecutor pre-trial brief, it's dated 2007 -- 2005, the allegations, or the charges are vague.  They do not contain any information making it possible for the Accused to know where this telephone conversation with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi came from, and how to investigate so as to be able to bring up new information on these new charges.  

Worst of all, the Prosecutor is going to limit himself to this mention -- or, limit himself to mentioning this in his pre-trial brief.  The additional notice that the Prosecutor ought to have made would have attempted -- or, would have sought to make was on the 18th January 2006 -- December 2006, and was still very vague.  And these were manuscripts -- transcripts of this telephone conversation -- manuscript transcripts which make reference Karera and not Renzaho, another way for the Prosecutor to disorganise the Defence when it comes to carrying out further investigations in relation to these new factual allegations.  

And having done that -- having done that, Your Honours, the Prosecutor will still fail to notice us (sic) with regard to the recording -- or, did not do this until 9th January 2007.  He limited himself to this, and further limited himself to saying that only Witness ALG will have the opportunity to dis -- to identify the voice of Mr. Renzaho through -- by listening to this audio recording.  Curiously, Your Honours, it was on 17th January 2007, in the course of proceeding, that the Defence is once again notified as to the will-say of Witness GLG (sic), UB, DAW (sic) as witnesses who are going to do the same identification that was announced for Witness LG (sic).  And when the discussion came up -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Now you had all these pseudonyms, and you didn't slow down.  So the first one was which witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
The first witness is GLG, Mr. President -- GLJ, Mr. President.  And the second one is Witness UB.  And then Witness AW -- AWE.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, there's a procedure for notice that the Prosecutor followed while we are -- while they are bringing their -- their evidence before the Court.  And because Defence is reached -- challenging, firmly challenging the admissibility of this event -- of this evidence, and that the Court, expressing its reserve about admissibility of the evidence, asked relevant questions to the Prosecutor.  And that is when the Prosecutor thought it necessary to say that he was going to submit a motion to your Court to amend a list of witnesses so as to call the person -- to call the witness who was originally intended to testify to that recording.  

The Chamber, on 6 (sic) February 2007, notified its agreement and its -- and your decision, rendered two days later, got the Prosecutor to notify the witness to the Defence only on 7 February 2007.  And they know that the Defence was going to have a problem, because the Defence team is English -- French speaking, and the disclosure was in French -- was in English, sorry.  

Still in relation to this listening -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  What is coming now is not clear.  Did you just mean to refer to our decision of 16th February 2007, namely, the decision on Prosecution motion to vary witness list?  Was that your last reference?  
MR. NEKUIE:  
Yes, Mr. President, I got wrong the date of the decision.  It was indeed 16th -- 16th February 2007.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Yes, and -- very well.  Now, in that decision of the 16th of February, there is a paragraph 6 where the Chamber addressed the issue of notice, unfair surprise, et cetera.  And what is your comment in relation to that paragraph 6?  

MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, Defence position is that notice, in spite of these paragraphs from the Chamber, were not done in conditions that would enable -- or, which will ensure the proper protection of the rights of the Accused, Renzaho, as set forth in Article 20 of the statutes of the Tribunal.  Because I'm arguing before your Chamber, Mr. President, Your Honours, that the conditions of notifications as very often admitted by your Court were not respected by the Prosecutor, particularly with regard to the dates of disclosure.  

You will realise that up until 2007, we are still having disclosure of this evidence, whereas he -- this had been in his possession since 1996.  There's therefore no reason for the Prosecutor not to disclose fully, comprehensively, this new fact to us instead of sending us pieces of such evidence -- of this evidence as and when he thought fit.  

In conclusion on this issue, Mr. President, I would like to state that the last disclosure that we received from Prosecutor was dated 1st March 2007, that is, yesterday, the French version of the statement of this witness.  

Now -- and then, Your Honours, by proceeding in this manner has the Prosecutor made it possible -- has the Prosecutor made it possible for the Defence to organise itself properly to cross-examine this witness on the basis of information that we may have gathered from our own investigations?  The answer is no.  Because since 8th January 2007, we've all been here before your Court, and obliged to follow the evidence being brought by the Prosecutor, and unable to conduct any investigations whatsoever.  Besides, the Prosecutor states that we were in a position to carry out investigations on the basis of the information he brought in his pre-trial brief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nekuie, you have to slow down; and the English interpreter must speak louder, because Mr. Nekuie has a very forceful voice.  So if the booth could speak even louder into the mike, and the Defence could speak even more slowly, that would help.  

You are about to close now, I understand, Defence.  Please continue.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I'm going to attempt to slow down and to -- and not to speak very loudly.  I'm just concluding on the first point of my motion, not the motion as a whole.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to say that the conditions for disclosure were not met on account of the dates that the pieces of this disclosure of the factual elements that will allow -- have allowed us to conduct appropriate investigations.  On account of the dates on which such disclosures were made, the required conditions for disclosure were not met, that is, conditions of clarity, conditions of coherence in the disclosures, and also conditions of disclosure with regard to time limits.  That is, those are elements that your Chamber set forth, and they were not respected in the presentation of this evidence.  

Further, Your Honours, it is clear that these -- this evidence, as I said earlier on, has been in the possession of the Prosecutor since 1996.  And by the leave of your Court, the Prosecutor has amended the indictment four times, and the last amendment, dated February 2006, was not -- did not even -- or, was not able to bring out the details of these charges.  

The Prosecutor therefore knew that he was going to use this evidence, and in the disclosure that he made, he keeps to himself the essential elements which would have enabled us to organise our work properly and ensure that your Chamber is able to afford our Accused -- our client a fair trial. 
(Pages 1 to 19 by Kirstin McLean)
























	1020H
MR. NEKUIE (continuing): 
Given these conditions, Mr. President, when Defence is deprived of all possibilities of organising itself to be -- to cross-examine this witness properly, how can you admit such evidence without necessarily prejudicing the rights of Tharcisse Renzaho to have a fair trial, the principle which is clearly set forth in Articles 19 and 20 of your statute?  Your case law clearly points to the solution -- or, the decision that you have to bring to this motion.  There is no possible way of going round this evidence brought before this Court, and this was not included in the indictment.  Whereas he knew -- the Prosecutor knew that this factual element had existed since 1996, particularly so when you (sic) had the opportunity to amend his indictment on 16 February 2006.  

It is therefore clear that there is a serious risk to prejudice the rights of the accused person, Tharcisse Renzaho, in the event that this new evidence which constitutes new material facts were admitted.  It is even more so, Mr. President, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor, in the presentation of this, even went fishing.  He attempted this in the Karera case -- well, before then in the Semanza case, and realised that the Chamber refused that.  And then he is trying to play that game again before your Court.  Your Court takes its rulings on the basis of facts which are established beyond doubt.  If this game that the Prosecutor is bringing up were accepted, it would amount to supporting this kind of game.  I have spoken.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much indeed.  

Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I will try and be brief.  Firstly, I don't know what the title of the motion my friend has brought and whether it is a motion seeking certification of Your Honours' earlier decision; if it is, then of course, it is out of time.  Your Honours have ruled in respect of these issues already and there are procedures in place which allow the Defence to seek certification of decisions if they do not agree with Your Honours' decisions.  So it seems to me that this is simply a backdoor means of trying to go appeal the decision that Your Honours have already taken. 

Secondly, my friend mentions that the witness has not mentioned the Accused.  With the greatest of respect for my learned friend, that shows a complete lack of understanding of the purpose of this witness's testimony and the reasons for which he has been called, which was clearly to address the issue of the circumstances in which the tape which has been played to witnesses was taken.  It is completely open for my friend to cross-examine this witness as to whether he, in fact, would be able to recognise any of the voices.  My understanding is, if I can be so bold, is that he would not.  That's not the purpose for which we have called this witness.  

We then get on to the issue, Your Honour, which has been argued two or three times, either orally or in writing, and I don't know how many times I need to say this and to say it clearly -- and if my friends can clearly listen; we are not seeking a conviction for the Accused in respect of an allegation that this piece of evidence is -- amounts to a crime that is contained in the indictment.  The purpose for leading this piece of evidence is, as we have made clear since October 19 -- sorry, 2005, is that it is evidence supporting mens rea, which is a completely different issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And on that point, does that mean this is not a material fact?  
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely.  It is evidence; and evidence does not have to be cleared in the indictment, because the Accused is in no danger of a conviction in respect of this matter.  This is in relation to -- we have led no evidence that persons were, in fact, killed as a result of whoever gave the order to exterminate in the hills of Bikumbi.  So, there is no danger of the Accused being convicted of that fact.  It is relevant to, we say, his mens rea, if Your Honours accept the testimony of the witnesses who have identified the voice of the Accused.  And I don't want to go on and repeat this, because that is the issue, and I don't know if my friends have clearly understood that fact.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But one of the conditions for convicting someone is that there is mens rea. 
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This evidence is aimed at strengthening your case in relation to that point.  Is it your view, then, that in spite of that being the purpose, it is still not a material fact?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  Yes, it is, Your Honour.  

And I refer to the Appeals Chamber decision in Kvocka on page 12, 28 February 2005, where the Appeals Chamber said, "Whether or not a fact is considered material, depends on the nature of the Prosecution's case.  The Prosecution's characterisation of the alleged criminal conduct and the proximity of the accused to the underlying crime, are decisive factors in determining the degree of specificity with which the Prosecution must plead the material facts of its case in the indictment in order to provide the Accused with adequate notice." 

And it goes on to say:  "For example, if the Prosecution alleges that an accused personally committed the criminal acts in question, the indictment should include details which explain this allegation, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the events, and the means by which the offence was committed."  

And my friend refers to a situation which is included in the indictment, which we have not led evidence of.  Clearly if we had, so far as that conversation was concerned, that is something that he could have been convicted of.  In respect of this incident, it's simply evidence of mens rea; he is in no danger of conviction in respect of that incident.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you now referred to the Appeals Chamber decision of 28 February 2005, and shall we, just for the record, agree on the spelling of that decision.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honours.  It's K-V-O-C-K-A, and there are other accused, Radic -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's fine.   
MR. MOSES: 
Finally, Your Honours, as we have referred previously and I simply refer briefly again, to the other appeals decision of Nyiramasuhuko, which was a decision where the Appeals Court held that evidence could be led even though it was not contained in the indictment, on the basis that to make relevant to other issues before the Trial Chamber to assess, even though Nyiramasuhuko was in no danger of conviction in respect of the matters which were led, namely her involvement in the 19th April speech of President Sindikubwabo; a similar situation.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Anything to add, Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  First of all, I wish to allay the fears of counsel for the Prosecution by stating that I fully understand -- the Defence fully understood -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Speed.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Much obliged, Mr. President. 

I have fully understood the objectives aimed at by the Prosecution through this witness.  We have clearly understood that the purpose for the Prosecution is to provide evidence supporting mens rea, which, on the basis of evidence -- let me repeat, sir -- which are, in fact, factual elements.  And in the case of your Trial Chamber, which I quoted, Mr. President, there was a similar case which you were to deal with.  In your decision in paragraph 50, reference was made to the exclusion of the planning of guerrilla -- in August of 1994, to which Mr.  Ntabakuze had allegedly participated.  And in the motion for exclusion of such testimony filed by the Defence, since the Prosecutor had not understood the nature of my motion -- it is a motion for exclusion of testimony -- the Prosecutor responded by stating that the Goma events, and even though they were new elements constituting crime, they were only aimed at being provided as proof of the mens rea for the facts mentioned in the indictment which had nothing to do with the events in Goma.  

However, in order to deny or to sustain the motion of the Defence on this matter, you looked at the notification element of this evidence in conditions that would enable the Defence to organise itself in order to cross-examine the witness, and it was on that basis that it was accepted that even though those were factual elements, they could indeed be used as evidence supporting mens rea.  

We are exactly in the same situation, and in our case, Your Honours, Mr. President, it is clear that the conditions of notification were not met so as to enable the Defence to organise itself, and when the Prosecution wishes to bring confusion in the minds of the Judges by claiming that through this motion, the Defence is seeking certification -- or, rather, is appealing the decision you have already made --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can't we agree on two things?  Don't speak so loudly, and don't speak so fast.  Because it's very difficult to hear the interpreter when you are so engaged, so we get "inaudibles".  
MR. NEKUIE:
That is true, Mr. President.  I am much obliged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have a question for you.  The question is the following:  You have, as an argument, in response to the Prosecution's submission based on the Appeals Chamber case law referred again to our decision of 29th June 2006.  This time you did not refer to paragraph 10, which you read out before the Prosecution response, you referred to some other paragraph.  It is not clear which paragraph you referred to.  Can you repeat the number of that paragraph?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, I was saying that in light of the principles set forth in paragraph 10, you looked into a case of exclusion contained in paragraph 50 of your decision of the 29th of June 2006.  Paragraph 50 deals with the submissions of the parties among which is the submission of the Prosecution whereby the Goma event -- events are not provided so as to seek conviction of the Accused Ntabakuze, but rather in order to establish the mens rea or an accused's intent.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But isn't the conclusion concerning paragraph 50 to be found in paragraph 51?  And in paragraph 51, the Chamber cannot categorically exclude the relevance of this event and will defer consideration of this question until closing submissions.  Isn't that the operative paragraph in that area?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, this is indeed the contents of the paragraph, but the Chamber reached that conclusion when examining the submissions of the parties on the basis of the principles as set forth in paragraph 10, which require either the presence of these new factual allegations in the indictment, or the cure through adequate notification, which was the case regarding this piece of evidence and which led to the decision as rendered by the Chamber in paragraph 51.  The question at hand is to determine whether -- the present matter, Mr. President, Your Honours, is to determine whether, in our specific case, it was possible to cure the defect through notification so as to have admitted this evidence as evidence supporting mens rea.  I already demonstrated that that was not possible.  

May I conclude, Mr. President, Your Honours, by stating that in that same decision -- in a paragraph I am not able to locate -- and on the subject of notification in order to reject -- or, to deny the motion of the Defence on this issue, submitted that the Prosecutor had provided in due time a motion for exclusion of evidence and that the Trial Chamber had handed down a decision favourable to the Prosecutor, and the notification or disclosure of such elements to the Defence was carried out in due time so as to enable the Defence to cross-examine the witness correctly.  And your conclusion was that the adjournment of the proceedings without any request having been made by the Defence on a long period was a de facto way of enabling the Defence to organise itself.  

In the specific case in point, the last disclosure we received was dated 1st of March 2007; that is to say, yesterday, which means that we did not at any time have the opportunity to move from here so as to carry out any investigation whatsoever when the reliability of this piece of evidence is in question.  So the fairness of this trial would be endangered if your Bench were to admit this piece of evidence.  This -- these are my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comment, Prosecution, on that 1 March submission?  
MR. MOSES: 
That was a translation of something which was filed several weeks ago.  It was a -- so the English version was filed more than three weeks ago and I will just try and find out exactly what it was that was provided to the Defence yesterday, as to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
According to Rule 6, "avoid asides".  
MR. MOSES: 
I apologise, Your Honour.  There was a French translation of a statement made on the 14th of February of this year.  I believe that was a will-say and a reconfirmation of an earlier state of which the French had originally been given.  So I don't know if my friend is asking for a short delay in order for him to be able to -- having read the will-say whether they are in any doubt as to what this witness was going to say.  I don't believe that is the case, and it seems to be a red herring, to be blunt.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber has heard oral submissions in connection with the Defence oral motion to exclude the evidence of this witness.  The motion is denied.  The reasons for that follow partly from our decision of the 16th of February.  However, in view of the fact that both parties have referred to case law, and the importance of this issue, we are going to hand down a written decision in addition to this oral ruling which will explain the reasons why we reached this result.  

It's now time for cross-examination.  

We will deal with all the requests for admissions after cross-examination.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, this recording that you are attempting to recognise before this Trial Chamber today, could you tell the Trial Chamber, more specifically, when it was that this recording was made? 
A.	Well, I would be hard pressed to do so because the conditions under which such tapes were recorded did not truly enable me to put labels on them, but I am almost certain that it was between the 14th and the 18th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of which month?  
THE WITNESS:
Between the 15th and the 18th of April 1994.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And during your examination-in-chief, Witness, you stated that Mr. Alain Sigg was the first person to whom you provided a copy of this tape.  Am I correct?  
A.	Yes, it is the first person from your jurisdiction I gave the tape to.  
Q.	What do you mean?  Witness, does this mean that there was another first person to whom you gave the tape outside of this jurisdiction? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Could you be more explicit and tell us to whom you submitted such a tape and on which date?
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	I do not know what is wrong with me this morning, but I shall make sure that I do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, it's not only a matter of speed, but look at Rule 3:  "Allow time for interpretation and transcription of the previous speaker's statement before you respond."  It's the old principle of the pause.  

Please proceed.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you hear my last question? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Could you please answer that question? 
A.	When I left Rwanda after my news report and at the time I was going back to Switzerland, the leaders of the RPF who had given me the authorisation to report in the territories that were under their control, asked for a copy, which I provided.  
Q.	And when was that, Witness? 
A.	Well, it must have been around the 26th or 27th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you.  And Mr. Alain Sigg from this Tribunal to whom you provided a copy, when was it that you gave him such a copy? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, it must have been in 1995, probably in November. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, when you listened to the recordings in the walkie-talkies of the RPF soldiers, were you able to identify the people who were having a conversation? 
A.	No, apart from those who would introduce themselves in the time, because it sometimes happened.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did RPF leaders ask for a copy of the report?  
THE WITNESS:
I said that it was when I was about to leave Rwanda from Mulindi, so it must have been around the 26th or the 27th.  It would be difficult for me to give the exact date, but I would have to check in order to provide it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I remember your testimony.  Here follows the next question:  When did you provide that report to RPF leaders?  
THE WITNESS:
Let me repeat that I believe it was when I was about to leave Rwanda; that is to say, around the 26th or the 27th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sometimes, Mr. Witness, it's important to ask questions in a very neutral way. This was one example.  One thing is when the request is being made, something else is when the request may be honoured; with other words, when you gave it over.  These were two different elements.  That's why there was a need to be absolutely certain, because this is relevant.  Thank you.  

Next question.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, who were the RPF soldiers whose walkie-talkies you used in order to make this recording?  Do you remember their names? 
A.	Absolutely not.  
Q.	And who was this RPF leader you gave a copy of the recording to when you were leaving?  
A.	I believe I gave a copy to the person who was my guide during my report in the area under RPF control.  
Q.	And you do not recall the name of that person at all?  
A.	I do recall his name. 
Q.	Could you give his name to the Trial Chamber, please? 
A.	Yes, it was Mr. Tom Ndahiro. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the spelling, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Tom, T-O-M.  Ndahiro, N-D-A-H-I-R-O.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, since you were able to follow this conversation while it was taking place, and since you speak and understand Kinyarwanda, I believe you were able to understand what was being said.  Could you tell the Trial Chamber what that was? 
A.	Well, it was a recording that lasted more than one hour.  But, from what I remember, it was a conversation on the killings that were taking place, mostly.  
Q.	Was the conversation on the killings or rather on the attacks with the two armies that were in conflict? 
A.	Well, let me say that I remember two things.  There was a gentleman who was trying to get evacuated, if I remember well; and he was at the same time describing the situation.  I remember quite striking sentences such as "the Tutsi matter, we are solving it, for 100 years" such statements.  I remember being struck by them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are too fast again, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
My apologies, I shall make an effort.  Should I repeat the answer I just provided?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
I was saying that I was able very rapidly to understand that those who were talking were talking about their -- about massacres and were at the same time trying to be evacuated or were trying to get an escort, at least put themselves away from the conflict.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, was it one single telephone conversation that you recorded for more than one hour, or were you referring to something else? 
A.	Well, if I remember correctly, there were three tapes, because it was not one continuous recording. 
Q.	So for how long did you record that conversation? 
A.	Well, on the basis of the transcripts, I realised that it was more than one hour, but while I was there, I must say that I did not calculate the time which was covered by the conversation. 
Q.	And you listened to that conversation recently; am I correct? 
A.	Yes and no.  I listened to it when your investigator asked me to authenticate the recordings and to determine whether these were indeed the recordings I had made.  But I must say that this is not something very pleasant.  This is not what I listen to before going to bed, not at all.  
Q.	Regardless of what it might mean for you, Witness, the purpose for your testimony today before this Trial Chamber was to authenticate this recording as well as its contents.  
A.	Well, regarding the contents, I listened to the tape but I cannot tell you that I would be able to tell you exactly what was said, as if I were taking an exam.  But I did listen to it, especially when I made copies of the tapes recently.  
Q.	Witness, in your evidence in chief you stated that during your stay in Kigali, you had at opportunity to interview General Dallaire; is that right? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that was the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We must remember the pause.  You are both speaking French, it is too fast.  The next question, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you have the opportunity, following those unfortunate events of 1994, to read this book written by General Roméo Dallaire, "I shook hands with the devil".  
A.	Yes, I read it when it came out, when it was published. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

May I forward to you a copy of some excerpts of that book that I would like to draw your attention to? 
A.	Very well.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this something the witness may need to have a look at before the question is asked?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is the case, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any other documents that you would wish to give to this witness which the witness may need to look at before the questions are posed?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
There are some, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that is the case, would it be a convenient method if we now had our 11 o'clock break, and during that break you will make sure that the witness, and all of us, receive those documents.  He can acquaint himself with them, and then when we come back, the question and answers will run more smoothly.  What that be all right?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is the proper method, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will then have 20 minutes' break. 
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1134H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence, you wanted to start with the Dallaire document?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That is so, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, this excerpt from the book of Mr. Dallaire, do you have it in front of you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, please look at page 340 -- because the extract is 340 and 341; and please refer to the last two lines.  
A.	"To complicate things, telephones in our quarters stopped working when my officers started working on their assignment."  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand that what is written here, (no interpretation).  Could we have a translation of that, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The telephone at our quarters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Général quartiers?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, Your Honour, my interpretation of that is quarters. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Not headquarters?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I will go along with that, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	To add on to this general statement of General Dallaire in his book, Witness, I have distributed a document and it might not be necessary -- if you don't insist that a copy be given to you, I can give you the content of what I intend to refer to.  These are reports that the services of Mr. Dallaire -- reports that were being -- that were made to the headquarters of the United Nations dated 8th April 1994.  These are the documents that I have had distributed to all the parties.  The first page, at the top right-hand side, has the date "8 April 1994," and the fifth page of that document, which has the Prosecution reference of K0086890, is dated 9th April.  The date is mentioned at the top right-hand corner.  On the fourth page, Witness, we have the daily reports, as I said, in which it is said in paragraph 9, "Telephone communications are out of order since 8 -- 08-09 April -- April '94.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we agree that there is one additional word in that sentence which we didn't hear because the mike was not switched on, and that word is "rural".  So it is "rural telephone communications".  That's what you read into the mike.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	In the last-but-one page of that document, the same reference is made at the bottom; that is, in paragraph 9, exactly the same report stating that telephone communications had been out of order since 8th April '94.  These are reports from General Dallaire.  

Now, I am going to put the following question to you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you refer to now?  First, you referred to paragraph 9 dated "MICS Arab 1", and that is what we read into the record, but you are also referring to another quote.  Where do you we find that, please?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
I made reference to the last-but-one page, Mr. President -- last-but-one page of the document, as it were.  And that is -- has the K0086893 Prosecution number, and that is the last-but-one page of the bundle of documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is the one which I thought you read out in the first place, but is there another sentence in this document which you have read out to us.  We have noted that your quote relates to the page with the last three digits being 893.  Now, where is the other sentence which is relevant?  Can you help us, please?  
MR. NEKUIE:
What I read out initially was that sentence contained in the report of 8th April 1994.  The two documents are linked together.  But these are two reports referring to two different dates, and that first one was on page 4 of the document; page 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So you have, in fact -- even if that is not clear in writing, what you have done is, first, to refer to a document dated the 8th of April and then to the document dated the 9th of April.  And in both documents we find under "9", the same sentence, namely, saying that the telephone communications are out of order.  Thank you very much.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
That indeed is the case, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And these are reports emanating from General Dallaire which confirm the portion that I had you read out a while ago.  Now, I would like to ask you this question following this presentation:  Whether Bikumbi commune was in the rural area or within the urban section of Kigali?  
A.	It appears to me that Bikumbi is in the rural section of Kigali, even if at the time I was from outside Rwanda and I had not been in the country for 30 years and I did not know the commune as such, but I think it was public knowledge that Bikumbi is part of the rural section.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How do you explain, given that telephone communications had been out of order since 8 April '94, how could there have been a telephone conversation from that commune and for that conversation to have been intercepted? 
A.	I do not explain it; I just record it.  I just recorded that conversation, which appeared to come from a telephone in a -- coming from a rural area at the time I have indicated.  
Q.	You will agree with me, Witness, that if in the rural area the telephone lines were down, then that cast doubt on what you refer to as telephone conversation in your recordings.  Do you admit that? 
A.	No, I do not admit that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know whether the telephones were down from the 9th of April to the 18th of April?  
THE WITNESS:
I really do not know anything about that.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, since you were at the CND during that period, were you using a telephone from CND to call the rural area? 
A.	No. 
Q.	At the CND where you were, were you able to use a telephone with 8 as the code? 
A.	I did not have any, and I do not know. 
Q.	Since it was also public notice that that code was not being used any longer and that was the code for the rural area in Rwanda at the time, how then do you think that it can be admitted that this was a telephone conversation that you had intercepted? 
A.	I am not relying on a statement that you are saying.  I do not know anything about telephone codes existing at the time.  What I do know is that I recorded that conversation, which from all indications is a conversation -- a telephone conversation when you listen to the recording and read the transcripts.  That is all I can say. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Witness, since those events, have you had to -- have you had the opportunity to occupy any official position in Rwanda? 
A.	From 2004 to 2006, I worked as the editor in chief of an independent radio station, and I was elected by the other journalists to the council of press -- or the council of media. 
Q.	Were you elected or appointed to the council of media? 
A.	I was elected. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to pass on to you this document -- which I would like the registry to come for -- and ask you to examine that document.  And, then ask you if that is the document that states your appointment or election to the council of media?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, if the registry clerk can assist me. 
(Pages 20 to 32 by Judith Baverstock)

















1150H
MR. NEKUIE (continued):
It is also a document that I have distributed.  It is a statement of cabinet.  It's entitled, "Statement of cabinet".  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, do you recognise this document? 
A.	It is the first time I'm seeing it.  
Q.	Can you read for the Court the title on page 1, and then refer to the page with paragraph 11, which is highlighted in the document that I gave to you?  
A.	"2005, an extraordinary cabinet meeting chaired by His Excellency, the President of the Republic, Kagame, Paul, was convened at village Urugwiro."
MR. PRESIDENT:
And here we lost the first date.  With other words: "On Friday 29th July". 

Remember to wait until the mike is on.  

And the village is spelt U-R-U-G-W-I-R-O.  

Yes?  
THE WITNESS:
And as you requested me, paragraph 11 of this document is as follows: 

"Mr. Nsanzabaganwa, Straton, as member" -- oui -- "as a member of ORINFOR board of direct -- of directors, Mr. -- Mr. Kagame, Faustin, as member of the press high council."
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the first name was N-S-A-N-Z-A-B-A-G-A-N-W-A.  And then, Straton, S-T-R-A-T-O-N.  

Yes?  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, among the names that you have just read, you have your name; is this correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that is the appointment that you referred to a while ago -- or, at least -- well, your admission into the press high council? 
A.	If you allow me to present the procedure as it happened.  I was, first of all, elected as representative of the private press and, then, subsequently -- well, this was announced on radio as well.  I believe this is the document that was read on radio, but I did not see it.  But it is true that my confirmation was done in an official manner, but that was before I was elected by my colleague journalists.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In English, we didn't get the first sentence under 11, which was "cabinet approved:"  And then followed the two names that we have on record.  

Yes? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, as you -- the document as you read it is a statement appointing you? 
A.	Yes, but I think I have just explained to you what I know.  I was elected and I believe I was then approved, and I think that is the procedure for appointments to the press high council.  To be a member of the press high council, that is the procedure.  
Q.	And what are the duties of this press high council in Rwanda?  
A.	In summary -- or, briefly, it is a supervisory body for the media, what is -- to control what is written and also to defend journalists.  
Q.	Witness, do you think that the press is free in Rwanda --  ever since you were a member of that high council? 
A.	Well, press freedom does not depend in (sic) my membership of the press high council.  
Q.	Maybe you did not understand the import of my question.  What I'm saying is that since you are a member of the press high council, which supervises media activities and also ensures the protection of journalists, do you think in that capacity -- being in that capacity, do you think that the press is free in Rwanda? 
A.	First of all, let me say I'm no longer a member of that body.  
Q.	But while you were a member, was the press free?  
A.	There were problems which were reported, which were pointed out in the report of the high -- the press high council.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And how long ago did you stop being a member of the press high council -- since the election of a new team to the press high council? 
A.	A new team was formed, and I'm no member (sic) -- a member, and that's since April 1996.  
Q.	Did you say April '96? 
A.	No, I mean April 2006 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
2006.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now you are doing it again.  Can't you remember to speak one at a time and remember the first sentence in rule 3:  The pause.  You see, we mix up questions and answers and we get only portions, and we want to have the substance both of the question and the answer.  Please observe this, it's so simple.  

This document, Defence counsel, is in English?  This is, maybe, not the original document?  
MR. NEKUIE:
It is a copy that we got -- this is not the original document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, do you have the original version of this document in French or Kinyarwanda, probably with the stamp by the government -- or is it not available? 
MR. NEKUIE:
As far as the Defence is concerned, for now, this is what we have.  It is all we have.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will ask the Prosecution to check whether they may have it, and they can come back to us on that point.  

The next question, please? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, at the time you were a member of the press high council, is it too -- or, is it far-fetched to say that you were one of the main collaborators in the area of the press with the power -- the governing body -- the government at the time? 
A.	No, that is far-fetched.  
Q.	And why would it be far-fetched? 
A.	I do not even see why you are making this assertion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What shall we do with the two of you?  You are absolutely impossible today.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are sorry, says the witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
That will be over in a moment, Mr. President, because I'm drawing to the end of my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, on Monday, we are expecting more from you.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Definitely, Mr. President, because I'm taking a measure of the negative impact of this manner of proceeding.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
MR. NEKUIE:
I haven't yet concluded, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I was asking you why you were saying that the body, which starts with the supervision of this kind of activity, that members of that body will not be the main collaborators of the chief executive of the state of Rwanda.  Are you able to explain that? 
A.	I say so, because the statement is yours, and that is not my vision of things.  
Q.	Witness, did you ever hear about Father Theunis in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I did.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this person on a spelling list?  Could we have the spelling?  
MR. NEKUIE:
No, he is not and it is spelt T-H-E-U-N-I-S.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, do you know what became of this priest in Rwanda?  Could you tell the Trial Chamber about it? 
A.	I read the press -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, and what does it say? 
A.	Well, I heard about -- about Father Theunis.  It is indeed what he said, and it is true -- I am a man of the press and I am -- and I heard what had happened to him.  He was arrested when he was passing through the Kigali airport, I believe.  
Q.	And at the time he was arrested, what was he doing in Kigali? 
A.	I do not know.  
Q.	Were you aware of his official activities?  Did you know whether he was a journalist, as you are, or not? 
A.	No, not at all -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Did you hear in the media that one of the main witnesses accusing him was the -- Mr. Ndahiro -- you mentioned during your examination-in-chief? 
A.	Yes, I believe I heard that, but -- yes, yes, indeed, I believe I read that.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  And as for yourself, regarding the audiotape you provided to the Tribunal, when you returned to Switzerland, was it of your own initiative or following a request of the Swiss examining magistrate that you went to make statements on this matter? 
A.	What case are you referring to exactly? 
Q.	Among the documents disclosed by the Prosecution regarding yourself, there is an excerpt of the proceedings when you appeared before the Swiss examining magistrate.  And the question I'm putting to you is:  Whether this hearing took place following a request by the magistrate or following your own initiative? 
A.	Of course, I'm willing to answer you, but could you, perhaps, explain to the Trial Chamber which trial you are referring to exactly?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you appear before an examining magistrate on the 5th of April 1995?  
THE WITNESS:
With the date -- well, I might not have guessed, because this was a long time ago.  But if I understand you correctly, it was Judge Nicati who was in charge of the Niyonteze case, which was indeed tried in Switzerland.  So, could you please repeat your question, Counsel? 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, I will gladly do so, Witness.  I was asking you whether you went to the judge following a request made by him or by your own volition? 
A.	No, it was following a request by the examining magistrate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The date was the 5th of April 1995.  

And now the witness mentioned the name of the magistrate.  That last name seems to be spelt as follows:  N-I-C-A-T-I.  

And then you, Mr. Witness, mentioned the case against someone.  Can you give us the name of that person?  The spelling, please? 
THE WITNESS:
It is Mr. Niyonteze N-I-Y-O-N-T-E-Z-E. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, was it the same person bearing the name Musema Uwimana? 
A.	I don't know about that.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Musema Uwimana is spelt M-U-S-E-M-A (unintelligible).  Uwimana is spelt U-W-I-M-A-N-A.  
THE WITNESS:
As far as I know, the trial before which I was called to testify was the Niyonteze trial and not the trial of the person you just referred to.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And with regard to the person I mentioned, Witness? 
A.	Sorry -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says, the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
-- yes, indeed, I believe I made a mistake, it is indeed Mr. Musema and not Mr. Niyonteze.  Niyonteze was indeed tried in Switzerland, but I was not called to testify during his trial.  It was, indeed, for 
Mr. Musema and I wish to apologise to the Court.  This goes back to a long time ago.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness, and you also testified in the Niyonteze trial, am I correct? 
A.	No, not at all, I did not testify in that trial.  I did remember that I was summoned by Judge Nicati, but it was in the Musema case and not the Niyonteze case.  
Q.	And regarding the Musema case, Witness, did you have any contribution to make in your capacity as a witness? 
A.	Oh, yes, of course, I was called to testify and I answered the questions that were put to me.  
Q.	What about the facts Musema was charged with?  Were you able to tell the examining magistrate what you were aware of? 
A.	Well, in fact, I had been summoned to provide clarification.  I believe Mr. Nicati summoned me because I had published my news report in the newspaper, L'Hebdo, which is the most-known weekly in Switzerland, and I believe this kept -- struck the minds of people.  And it was following this report that I was summoned by Judge Nicati.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  The last question on this line of questioning:  Did you know at the time -- and do you know today, the newspaper called, Hirondelle? 
A.	A newspaper called Hirondelle, no?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know a press agency called Hirondelle?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do know the press agency.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you ever accuse this press agency regarding its editorial line or its activities? 
A.	Well, I believe the word accusation is not correct.  I, indeed, wrote an article on the activities of the Hirondelle foundation in the field in Bukavu, but this is journalistic work and has nothing to do with accusations of any sort.  
Q.	In this journalistic work, Witness, did you indicate that the said foundation employed genocide perpetrators? 
A.	I never wrote such a thing.  
Q.	Did the -- did not the -- did that foundation sue you in Switzerland for having made such accusations? 
A.	It, indeed, sued me for libel and slander, but not for the reasons you mentioned.  
Q.	And what were the accusations which led you to be sued by this foundation? 
A.	Well, it was the article on its actions in Bukavu, as I stated previously, which was deemed to be slanderous by the foundation, but I won the trial.  So, I was acquitted of the charges of slander and libel following a procedure that lasted close to eight years, because of all the appeals that were lodged by the foundation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the date of the final decision, which year? 
THE WITNESS:
Oh, I would have to have my notes in front of me.  This took place a while ago, but I believe it was well before I went to Rwanda to work.  So, it must have been prior to 2004, but we can find the dates without much problem.  This was a trial that was mentioned in the press, that is well known and it is no secret.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, could you for the benefit of the Trial Chamber summarise the specific allegations you made against the Hirondelle foundation and which led to this suit? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an objection?  
MR. TREDICI:
Yes, Your Honour, on the basis of relevance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Credibility. 
MR. TREDICI:
Relevance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, credibility, of course, isn't that the point, Defence? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, indeed, I am trying to impeach the credibility of the witness with my questions, and I fail to understand why the Prosecution put such a question.  
MR. TREDICI:
(Microphones overlapping)... Clearly --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can't hear you.  Please, start your sentence again.  
MR. TREDICI:
I said that the witness clearly said that he was found not guilty.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a different matter.  
THE WITNESS:
May I ask -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
May I, in turn, put a question to counsel?  You are saying that you're trying to impeach my credibility.  Can you do so with trials where I was found not guilty? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think you will achieve anything here, Defence counsel? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I was merely seeking some clarification.  I am not dealing with the trial of the witness with Hirondelle.  He referred to the activities of Hirondelle in his article on Bukavu, and all I wish for him to do is to enlighten the Trial Chamber on what he mentioned.  This is not a new trial I am carrying out with the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, perhaps you should have come with my article -- the one that was put in question.  I believe that would have been more helpful for the Trial Chamber, rather than asking me -- just like that -- to summarise a trial for which I was not found guilty. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are losing time now.  The question is a normal question.  There is no requirement for Defence counsel to show you the paper or what you previously did.  Just give us a brief summary in three lines, can you help us?  And then we'll move on.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President, I carried out an investigation on the work of the Hirondelle foundation in Bukavu, and I -- even though I never went to Bukavu, I took an interest in the work of the foundation, and I concluded that it was not morally sound to claim to have a neutral -- neutral reporting during a genocide.  In the case of genocide, there are perpetrators and victims and I believe no one can be neutral in such a situation and it is rather taking sides with the perpetrators.  

I did not state that they were on the side of the perpetrators, but I did say that from the moral standpoint such an approach was not tenable, and I was proven right by the Swiss magistrate.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Thank you for your answer, Witness, following which -- which I wish to put it to you that in your capacity as a journalist, you believe you are seeking justice for the genocide.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Well, I believe this would be a wrong interpretation.  
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that it is as -- in your capacity as someone seeking justice for the genocide that you wrote this article? 
A.	What do you mean by that, Counsel? 
Q.	I believe, Witness, that you are educated enough to know what I mean.  Can you answer my question? 
A.	Well, I'm not seeking justice, I am a witness of the genocide -- that is clear, and it is the reason for which I'm here today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to give the Chamber this written statement by the witness or article?  It's a bit difficult now to follow the discussion -- in particular, an exchange as to whether the purpose of an article we do not know was this or that.  What is your plan now, Defence? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, if this statement of the witness is in the minutes of the proceedings, this will mark the end of the cross-examination by the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document are you referring to now?  Something you want to show us? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I did not refer to any document.  I put two questions to the witness and he answered such suggestions.  I have not referred to any document to submit to the attention of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
"I put it to you, Witness, that in your capacity as someone seeking justice for genocide, it was in that capacity that you wrote this article".  That was your question.  An article is usually written.  

If you do not want to pursue that, it's fine with us.  We just simply want to understand what's going on.  

What is your next question? 
MR. NEKUIE:
But, Mr. President, that was not the suggestion I put.  I believe what I said was not exactly translated.  I said, following the answer given by the witness, that in his capacity as a journalist, he considered himself as being -- seeking justice for the genocide.  That was the first suggestion I put to him.  So in his quality as a journalist, he was seeking justice following the genocide.  He answered this first suggestion.  And my second suggestion was that his appearance here was also being carried out for the same reason.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that shows that there was a communication problem, which we have now been able to eliminate.  Thank you.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

And following the answers received, I am ending this cross-examination, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Any re-examination? 
MR. TREDICI:
No, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you left Rwanda around 1974, is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Left?  Do you mean, after the news report I made, which was in 1994?  I do not understand your question, Mr. President, my apologies.  I did not understand your question, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a mistake in the translation, I will now repeat my question.  You told us that you started working in Switzerland in 1974, was that so, or which year did you refer to? 
THE WITNESS:
I left when I was a student, so I was not working at the time, but it was, indeed in, 1974.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that mean that you lived outside Rwanda from 1974 until your return there in early April 1994?  Or did you go back to Rwanda and continue living there before '94?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I left Rwanda in 1964, following acts of persecution, and I sought refuge abroad in different countries.  And, in '74, I ended up in Switzerland. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you actually left your country in 1964?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, in 1964.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And when did you first return to Rwanda on a permanent basis then? 
THE WITNESS:
No, in fact, I went for this news report in 1994 -- that is to say, almost 30 days (sic) -- day for day after having left the country.  And I found myself at the heart of the war and the genocide.  But, subsequently, in September of 1994, I went back to Rwanda for a news report for the same newspaper, and then I return -- I would return to Switzerland.  But, I -- I went back to Rwanda on a regular basis and the longest stay I made in Rwanda was in 2003.  From 2003 to 2006, I worked as editor-in-chief for an independent radio station -- between 2004 and 2006.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you return to Rwanda in 2003 or 2004? 
THE WITNESS:
In 2003, I went back, but I started working with the independent radio in 2004.  So I came to Rwanda in 2003 for the radio station project, and we launched our activities in 2004.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And after 2006, where have you been living? 
THE WITNESS:
I went back to Switzerland.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you have an identity card before 1964? 
THE WITNESS:
In 1964, I was 16-and-a-half -- when I left Rwanda.  Did I have an identity card?  Yes, I do believe I had one.  I remember specifically that I did have an identity card, because at the time, one's ethnicity appeared on the identity card. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is exactly the point of the question:  What was the ethnicity stated on that card? 
THE WITNESS:
Tutsi.  But if I may comment on that?  Those are values which I refute completely; those are the racist manipulations which have led to the genocide.  My true identity is Rwandan.  I speak Kinyarwanda; I'm a Rwandan citizen; I have a Rwandan passport.  And, Hutu/Tutsi, there -- it's the same language.  These are manipulations, those are labels, and I do not like to be labelled.  So I am mentioning this aspect to answer your question, but this is something I vigorously reject.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understood that, Mr. Witness, that was why I asked you about the ID card in '64, because I noted that you hadn't filled in that point in your personal information sheet, assuming that this was your position.  

Now, to the recording.  The total recording took about one hour; is that so?  Concerning these telephone interceptions or whatever?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, yes, but it was not in a continuous manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, on how many occasions did you switch on and off your microphone to hear possible telephone conversations?  How many segments does this one hour recording consist of? 
THE WITNESS:
For that, I need to refer to the transcripts, because at the time, you know, we were being shelled, and each time I had the opportunity -- two or three times, I believe, I had the opportunity to get close to those soldiers who had their walkie-talkie and then I made a request.  I was even surprised that it was happening that way -- that they could listen.  But, for me, it was a scoop -- an opportunity to have access to this kind of exclusive information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And these two to three segments amounted to a total of one hour approximately? 
THE WITNESS:
It appears to me so, but I will need to refer to the transcripts and to listen to the recording to be very specific in my answer.  But, I wouldn't know -- there's one thing that we can observe, that this recording sometimes contained songs, because at one point in time I had to use a cassette recorder, which contains songs that I had recorded earlier on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was exactly the next question:  How do you explain that there is music on the tape? 
THE WITNESS:
This was my tape which contained music -- I had music of my choice, and when the blank cassettes were exhausted, because I recorded a lot of things from the RTLM radio station, and then recorded interviews.  So, finally, I had this tape with music recorded on it, so I recorded on top of the music.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the music was yours?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many telephone conversations would you say that you recorded in total during these three segments amounting to a total of one hour? 
THE WITNESS:
Please, repeat the question.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many telephone conversations would you think you recorded during that hour of tape recordings? 
THE WITNESS:
Two or three -- two or three, I think so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
These three segments amounted to a total of about one hour's tape recording.  What was the total time span used to record that hour? 
THE WITNESS:
If I understood clearly, you're referring to that one hour of recording -- well, I was recording live, so it was the same duration.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There were no stops in-between?  Was this a continuing one-hour recording or were there three different periods within the one-hour recording? 
THE WITNESS:
It appears there were three different periods, but the recording was bad -- there were interruptions and things like that, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exactly, so with other words, the total time it took you to record these three segments was more than an hour? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I must say that -- let me say it again, that I need to listen to the recording again.  What is important is that I was contacted.  These people, who had their walkie-talkie -- and I recorded whenever I could.  But, it's possible that I am not understanding your question because the duration of the recording is the same for me as the total number of hours that that represents.  But, I'm sorry if I did not understand your question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you record these telephone conversations on the same day? 
THE WITNESS:
I need to check on that.  I believe -- I remember it was between the 15th and the 18th.  It appears to me that it was on -- but, whether it was on the same day, I wouldn't know.  It may well be two different days, but I have to refer to the transcripts.  

What I do know is that I did these recordings in -- under very difficult conditions.  I did the recording whenever I could.  Now, whether it was on the same day, I really cannot recall.  It may well be that it was on a day -- and, then, the following day.  But it was during the same period in any event.  
(Pages 33 to 45 by Jean Baigent)














1240H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are then not excluding that on two different occasions you were allowed to go up to these soldiers and record what was happening?  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, if I was not asking them for permission, they were just ordinary soldiers who had their walkie-talkie, and whenever I thought it could be done, I asked them to do so.  It was not asking for permission from a commanding officer, no, it was something that was just happening like that.  That's it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The point was not asking for permission, the point is that you are not excluding then that these recordings were made over two days, not on one occasion, two occasions.  That's what you've explained.  
THE WITNESS: 
I am not excluding that -- I am not excluding that.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, did you use this material in any way after you have recorded this?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, not at all. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Yes, according to your testimony, the RPF authorities asked you to give them these materials; am I correct?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, yes, that is true, but I did not use it in any event.  I did not even know that this kind of technology existed at the time, so I did not use it. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
So how did they come to know that you were in possession of this material?  
THE WITNESS: 
Well, because we discussed it.  I was with people.  I was at CND.  I went to Mulindi.  There were people around me.  We had them listened to these recordings.  It's as simple as that, and then I also said that it is the person who was my guide is the one I gave the recordings to.  He was somebody who was living there.  He gave it to them. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
This one year recording, is this the only recording you have carried out?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, I believe I explained to you that I recorded.  I was working as a journalist so I took with me tapes to make recordings, so I recorded a lot of things.  I recorded RTLM Radio, I conducted interviews, I even recorded noise from the war.  Well, anything a journalist could do to record information. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much, but I meant the telephone conversation, the interception of the telephone conversation, not any other recordings.  Did you do any other -- did you record any other telephone conversation?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, the one I submitted is the only one I did.  The one I presented to your Court is the only one. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
And this is a technical question.  Could you explain to us:  How was it possible to listen into this telephone -- online telephone conversation through walkie-talkie?  Is it possible?  Can you do it?  
THE WITNESS: 
I really do not know anything about that.  The fact is that that is how it happened.  I would imagine 
that -- I'm sorry.  I would imagine that there was a possibility for the RPF people to be able to go on that frequency, but I cannot go into that detail.  The fact is that that is how it happened.  That's all.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you for having come the long way to Arusha to testify and we wish you a very safe journey home.  Please do not discuss your testimony with anyone.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS: 
It's for me to thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I just like to mention that I forgot to say that I would like to enter into evidence the documents that I presented to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the witness could be assisted out of the courtroom, please.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
The next witness, please. 
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, there is the issue of the admission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know.  
MR. MOSES.  
Okay, the next witness is Dr. Des Forges.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Is she available this afternoon?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, she is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes, let's then first deal with the admissions or the admission of documents.   You requested the following to be tendered, Prosecution.  Shall we start with you, one by one?  
MR. TREDICI:
Your Honours, we are seeking to have the audio tape marked KT001084, and the three versions of the transcript, Kinyarwanda, French and English admitted into evidence.  And for the record, I have just -- the transcript I used, as you could see, are the ones that Mr. Matemanga has in his hands now, and the names -- the references of the people of that (inaudible) were speaking there according to the person that worked on this transcript, were deleted to avoid any mistake.  So, you could only find there the conversation without the names of the people that someone else has assigned, and I am giving you time to -- because I also distributed copies for the Defence and for the Judges, so you can check from there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have previously received a copy of the various versions of the transcripts in our binder.  Is that still the same version?  
MR. TREDICI:
Yes, Your Honour, that's the same version, but I deleted the references to the names that were assigned to the speakers, because that could create confusion, and that's the one I used today and I distributed copies for the Judges, for the Defence, and that's the copy that the witness used and that's the copy that Mr. Matemanga has in his hands now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But doesn't that imply that a document which has for quite some time been presented with a mistake, according to the Prosecution, that this was Mr. Karera, now that mistake doesn't appear anymore?  That is the effect of your deletion; isn't it?  
MR. TREDICI:
That's it, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe that could cause confusion to delete actually, because this has been a big issue in the case.  
MR. TREDICI:
Then we leave it as it is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, in other words, you are suggesting the version we have in the binders plus the tape?  
MR. TREDICI:
That is correct, Your Honour.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that the only exhibit on behalf of the Prosecution?  
MR. TREDICI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the Defence. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President, the confusion does not relate to this redacted document alone, but also on the audio recording.  The witness was not able to tell us which portion of the recording contains the conversation that the Prosecutor is referring to for the Court was recorded.  The witness also said that there was a lot of recording done on this tape, which we did not hear.  We did not know if it refers to 
Mr. Renzaho and we do not understand how the Prosecutor can request that the totality of this recording be produced as an exhibit in the Renzaho case, whereas we are dealing strictly with the Renzaho case.  The Defence, therefore, will oppose the production of the recording as produced by 
the -- presented by the Prosecutor to your Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've heard the objection by the Defence.  Is there any comment on the objection?  
MR. TREDICI:
Just one very brief comment.  I think that the Trial Chamber and the Defence knows what we will be relying on on this audio tape recordings, and the audio tape has been recognised by the witness in its entirety. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will analyse the totality of the situation including the submissions by the parties, the cross-examination, the examination-in-chief today and we will then make a ruling on the admission of that exhibit, in other words, the audio tape and the three transcripted versions.  

Now, to the Defence exhibits.  You had the documents that you wanted to tender.  Let's take them one by one.  You started with the Dallaire document. 
MR. NEKUIE:
That is so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 32.
(Exhibit No. D. 32 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Then, I think you proceeded to the -- to two daily reports, dated the 18th -- sorry, the 8th and the 9th of April 1994. 
MR. NEKUIE:  
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have that as one exhibit number?  They seemed to be stapled together.  Mr. Matemanga. 
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 33.
(Exhibit No. D. 33 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then there was the statement of cabinet decision.  Prosecution, do you have this document by the cabinet in some more official version, or are we left with this English non-original version? 
MR. TREDICI:
We haven't checked, Your Honour, but we can do it over the weekend or today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be helpful, but there is no objection to the tendering of this document?   
MR. TREDICI:
No objection at all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Matemanga.
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 34.
(Exhibit No. D. 34 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anything else from the Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President.  I just like to point out to the Court, without going back to your decision, in that up until now, contrary to what we believe, the French version of your decision on the amendment of the list of witnesses has still not been disclosed to us, and in spite of the request that we have made, verbal though they might be, we still do not have disclosure of this.  We think that for the record, we need to make this statement so that our rights could be respected in due course.  That is all I wanted to say regarding your decision on the amendment of the list of witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In other words, this is not a matter of disclosure, it's a matter of translation of the Chamber's decision of the 16th of February, and that French version is not available to the Defence, and that is noted for the record. 
MR. NEKUIE:
That is so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand then that the Prosecution did not want the pages from that little book as an exhibit.  That is noted. 
MR. TREDICI:
Not, Your Honour. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, one final point, if I can.  I am not going to address you regarding it, but I am just going to ask that a decision of the ICTY of Brdjanin, a decision on the Defence's objection to intercept evidence, be given to Your Honours.  I've got a copy for the Defence, and I just simply ask Your Honours to take that decision into account in your deliberations because it appears to be relevant and on point.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this decision which is also now given to the Defence is spelt B-R-D-J-A-N-I-N.  And if the Defence has any comments, they can come back to us, but very soon.  But not now, because now we want to hear the next witness, please.  
MR. MOSES:
While we are waiting for the witness to be -- 
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Alison Des Forges in English)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document in front of you with your signature; is that so?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the information in that document is correct; isn't it?  
THE WITNESS: 
It is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga. 
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 93.
(Exhibit P. 93 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Is there any dispute as to the expert status of this witness?  
MR. MOSES:
I can indicate, Your Honour, that nothing has been filed under Rule 94 bis.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's noted.  So we can then simply proceed with the testimony.  
MR. CANTIER:  
That, indeed, is the case, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you very much to the Defence.  

Prosecution.  
ALISON DES FORGES
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Good afternoon, Dr. Des Forges.  Can I ask that you be shown this document?   Dr. Des Forges, is the document before you a copy of the report that you prepared for this trial titled:  "Genocide in Kigali city"? 
A.	It is. 
Q.	And I believe you got the English and the French translation of your report there? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if I can commence by asking you by looking at pages 1 to 7 of your report, is it a fair summary of the matters contained in the first seven pages that they cover the historical background of both Rwanda and its politics, and the background as it relates to the genocide of 1994? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And can you briefly -- can you tell the Trial Chamber why you consider that the historical background is important to the other matters that you subsequently raised in your report? 
A.	Every historical event, of course, has a context in which it must be understood.  An event as complex and as difficult as the Rwandan genocide, cannot begin on April the 6th.  We must understand the history of war and certainly the perception of history, which are sometimes not the same thing as the actual history, but the perception of history of relations between Hutu and Tutsi.  That, of course, is essential.  We must understand the intensively administered nature of the Rwandan state, because it was that state and its military forces which were called into play.  And we must understand also the complex and conflictual relations that existed among Hutu, because the regional partisan and economic divisions among Hutu are essential to understanding the way the genocide developed. 
Q.	Thank you.  On page five of the report, and I think it is on page 6 in French under the heading, "Provisions of the Arusha Accords, Political Arrangements", you have referred to the division of seats in government to the various political parties which were made as a result of the accords.  Are you aware, if any, of such arrangements existed in respect of the political parties as to the assignment of préfets in the préfectures? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you answer that question, you now referred to page 5.  Now, what is the K-number of that document?  You see, we have the copy of the report where we do not find that title.  What is your K-number?  
MR. MOSES:
K0378901. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. CANTIER:  
Up until now, we've only received the provisional version of the report.  We were told that the final version is similar.  This is just to say that I do not have the document with the markings that has just been referred to because that will facilitate the task.  So I wish that this document is disclosed to us so that we are able to better follow the discussions -- the proceedings.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is certainly a confusion that we will wish to avoid.  Can you assist us in view of what the Defence just said, please?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, we provided a translation -- French translation in court to my learned friend, which didn't head into that stage being put into -- being disclosed through registry, and I understand that did not have a K-number attached to it.  The very same report has been disclosed with K-numbers, and should have been served on the Defence.  It is the exact report -- it is the exact same report as the one without K-numbers that was given to them in court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
We all remember that a copy of the French version, subject to revision, was given to the Defence in the courtroom.  We were then told that there was no need for revision.  You are now referring to that version.  That version does not have K-numbers, but it is in the possession of the Defence.  It seems to us that by you referring now to page 6 of the French version; namely, that document, that should make it clear which document we are referring to, and I see that the Defence is nodding. 

MR. CANTIER:  
Yes, Mr. President, I hear that, but you see that a while ago, there was a reference to a specific page with a certain reference.  It is difficult for us to follow.  I do not want us to create a confusing situation, because we do not have that document.  So if there should be a difficulty, you will know how it happened. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted, but for the time being we are on page 6 of the French version, and the title you find 
there -- and we are all following the document.  And now the answer, please. 
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, Your Honours, I am just about to provide the Defence with another copy of the disclosure including the report. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Are you able to remember my question, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	Yes, I am.  The question was:  Was there a division among political parties of the post of préfet?  And yes, there was an arrangement among political parties distributing the post of préfet throughout the country.  This, I was aware of, beginning in 1992 through discussions with various préfets, including Préfet Kayishema, who was the préfet of Kibuye, and Préfet Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana, who was the préfet of Butare préfecture, and who both indicated to me that their appointment had to do with implementing an arrangement whereby Kibuye was designated for the PSD party, a party of 
	Mr. Kayishema, and that Butare was allocated to the liberal party.  

Subsequently, for example, in Butare préfecture, when the préfet of Butare was changed during the course of the genocide, this required some negotiations between the Liberal party and other parties so that Butare préfecture would be allocated to the socialist -- to the Socialist Democratic party, and where other arrangements will be made to assure that the Liberal party retain a préfecture. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the conversations you had with these two persons took place when; approximately, which year?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, the conversations took place with Mr. Kayishema in January -- with both of them, it was in January of 1993. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Are you aware, from any information you have received, what the situation was insofar as the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	The préfet of Kigali-ville was Colonel Renzaho, who was named when the préfecture of the city was established.  That was prior to the institution of this arrangement as such among the political parties, but his appointment was not changed at that time.  Officially, of course, as a military officer during the multiparty period, Colonel Renzaho was not permitted to be political party member, but his unofficial allegiance was thought to be, and by all indications, continued to be, with the MRND party.  So in that sense, the préfecture of Kigali would have been assigned to the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, on page 7 of your report in English, that's under the heading of, "Stepping up preparation for violence", you have it, I believe, it is on page 8 of the French, you have a sub-heading, "Militia and civilian self-defence".  Why do you have that heading, "Militia and civilian self-defence" under the heading of, "Stepping up preparation for violence"? 
A.	During the period following the signing of the Arusha Accords, the final accords, in August 1993, the war was officially ended, but yet it is clear from the historical records that preparations continued on both sides for further combat and violence.  On the side of the Hutu Power group, and I carefully make the distinction not on the side of the government as such, but on the side of the Hutu Power group, these preparations included the expansion, training and arming of militia, and the development of the civilian self-defence system.  
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, what is the problem of having a civilian self-defence force during a time of war? 
A.	To begin with, I will note that the preparations which I have just been referring to were taking place not during a time of war, but during a time of peace, during the period from August 1993 until April 1994.  But during a time of war, of course, a self-defence force can be a legitimate exercise of governmental initiative in order to protect the nation.  In this context, the force became illegitimate and, in fact, illegal because of its use against non-combatant civilians, who were unarmed, and who were defined largely on the basis of ethnicity.  It was the exercise of the civilian self-defence force against that particular target which rendered it illegitimate. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, under the -- that same heading, you referred to correspondence from the army chief of staff, General Nsabimana, who was reporting to the minister of defence, that army officers had met the day before the 30th of March to plan the defence of neighbourhoods in Kigali in the tracking down and neutralisation of infiltrators in different parts of the city.  
MR. MOSES:
I will ask, please, that the witness be given the exhibit folder number 1, and if I can also indicate to Your Honours, I am going to ask the witness to look at Prosecution Exhibit 24, it is under tab 19.  

Madam Registrar, I wonder if the whole bundle could be given to Dr. Des Forges because I will be referring to a number of those documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, because you are going to use several exhibits in that binder, so that's a good suggestion.  
MR. MOSES:
Exactly.  Not good enough.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if you look at the document, do you recognise that?  
A.  	I do.  
Q.	And is that the letter that you've referred to in your report?  
A.	That is correct.  It is one part of an exchange of correspondence.  This is the first letter in the exchange.  It was followed by a response from the préfet of Kigali, but this is the letter which was from the head of the general staff, General Nsabimana, to the minister of defence, copies to the préfet of Kigali and to various other military officers. 
Q.	Briefly, Dr. Des Forges, what is the importance -- or is there -- what importance do you place on this letter? 
A.	The letter recounted to the minister of defence a meeting which had been held to further plan the creation of the civilian self-defence system.  It's important to indicate the extent to which the organisation had been carried at that point that the committee which we now know had been formed originally in June of 1993, and had had activity again, increased activity at the end of October 1993, was at a state, by March 1994, of being prepared to organise the recruitment -- or the naming and identification of persons who would be implementing the civilian self-defence system, and helping to neutralise the people who were called infiltrators.  It is significant ,also in paragraph 10, in indicating the kinds of arms which were to be used in this effort, and the directive or the decision of the committee passed on by General Nsabimana was that the bourgmestres were to inform the 
	population -- or to instruct the population on the use of traditional arms, not simply firearms, but also traditional arms, including swords, spears, machetes, and bows and arrows, given that it was not -- it was anticipated that the firearms would be insufficient for the effort. 
Q.	Do you have any idea why the document is labelled "très secret"? 
A.	The civilian self-defence system was at this point a highly confidential operation being carried out by a relatively small group of people.  It was not at that point generally known even among some officers of the gendarmerie, for example, and the previous document from February of 1994, dealing with the organisation of this system, was notable for the exclusion of the prime minister, so that here we have -- and this is one reason why I spoke previously about the organisation of a group who can most easily be identified as the Hutu Power group, rather than the government as such, as the organisation force behind this effort, because the government included persons from political parties opposed to the MRND, including the prime minister, who was a representative of the MDR, and she was not included, for example, in the task assigned under the organisation of civilian self-defence. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, if you could be also shown Prosecution Exhibit 25, under tab 20.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Why don't we, Mrs. Ben Salimo, place the entire folder in front of the witness?  Shall we do that?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, do you see the document in front of you? 
A.	I am not sure that this is the one to which you are referring.  Is the document meant to be a continuation of the series we were looking at?  That's 34, you want 25?  It's 25.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, a suggestion.  You are now going to look with the witness at some of the documents in that folder.  Could you indicate to us already now the document numbers that you are going to refer to, in other words, Prosecution exhibit numbers.  The present one is number?  
MR. MOSES:
Number 25. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. MOSES:
The next one will be Prosecution Exhibit 50; it is one of the radio transcripts.  Then 
Prosecution Exhibit 62, then Prosecution Exhibit 57, Prosecution Exhibit, 16, 19, 21, 22, 51.  That will take us forward. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Des Forges, there is a practical suggestion to be made now.  Could you write down the following numbers please?  Mr. Moses, correct me if I got it wrong, but apparently the numbers are the following:  Prosecution Exhibit number 25, 50, 62, 57, 16, 19, 21, 22, and 51.  And these are the documents, I think, we will revert to Monday morning at 8:45.  So if you just could make sure that they are easily available on Monday morning, then we will continue at that point in time.   Is there anything else of a practical nature we should address now?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, if I can disclose, we've had three English translations of transcripts -- radio transcripts for which we only had the French earlier, to which I will be referring.  I've got copies for Your Honours, and I think for the registry and for my learned friends.  And so, that's one practical point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this means that when we are in the courtroom on Monday morning at 8:45, we will not only bring with us the present binder, but also the binder with radio transcripts plus these you just gave us. 
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely, Your Honour.  In fact, most of the documents are going to be the radio transcripts that we referred to.  And, to that end, Dr. Des Forges has -- we have provided her with her own copy of the bundle of documents with the same tab numbers and Prosecution exhibit numbers.  So, she, I believe, has that with her.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Any other documents we should make sure that we have with us on Monday?  
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  Any practical issues from the Defence side?  Anything we need to raise now before we adjourn for today?  
MR. CANTIER:  
Yes, Mr. President, the Defence doesn't want to make any claims as such, but we would have liked to know what the pace of the extra hearings would be, because nobody has told us anything.  We think that Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, that is what was indicated to us, we thought it would be a video linked witness, who was to be followed by the testimony of Mrs. Des Forges.  I believe it is important for us to be aware of the pace of hearings.  We are not coming here as tourists or observers, but as actors  in these proceedings.  This means that before we come here, the Tribunal, as you would understand, we have to be prepared.  I do not know what the pace of the hearings would be, and I would, therefore, like our colleague to make a suggestion or enlighten us on this and the Bench should tell us exactly what is going to happen. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a perfectly legitimate question and I was just about to raise now how to proceed next week.  Now, because of the time difference between Arusha and the country from which the witness will testify by video link, we can only start in the afternoon.  I understand that that country is possibly willing to start at a time according to that country which will equivalent 4 o'clock Arusha time.  Is that so?  
MR. MOSES:
That's what I have been advised, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That means that in order to organise our time efficiently, we can then hear the expert from 8:45 to 
one o'clock, then we have the lunch break from one o'clock to 2:30, then we continue with the expert from 2:30 to 3:30, then we have 30 minutes break because of the technical need for a pause before the video link, and we start with the video link at 4 o'clock.  That is the timetable which is suggested.  This division of work between the present witness in Arusha and the video link in the afternoon has been followed in previous cases, and it has shown to be a good way to proceed.  Is this all right?  
MR. CANTIER:  
Yes, Mr. President.  An additional question, but it is addressed to my colleague.  The time lapse provided for the video conference, would we begin at 4 p.m., when will it end, the video conference?  Can you give us an estimate of how long it will take please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
One issue is how long your examination-in-chief shall be, and you may answer that.  Another issue is how long the Bench thinks, in view of staff welfare, that we should sit in the evenings.  Now, let's start with the first question. 
MR. MOSES:
I will estimate, approximately, one hour to one-and-a-half hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That should mean that the examination-in-chief will go on from approximately four to 5:30 on Monday, and then we will not hear the Defence on Monday.  
MR. CANTIER:  
Yes, sir, I am enlightened, Mr. President, and I thank you for that clarification. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings us to the end, and at least of this Friday, and we wish you a good weekend.  The Court is adjourned until Monday morning.
