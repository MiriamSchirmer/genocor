MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness ATQ, we are now in open session and will start the examination-in-chief.  
WITNESS ATQ,
first having duly been sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Madam Witness, in March 1994, how old were you?  
A.	I was 19 (sic) years old.  
Q.	And at that time, did you live alone or with others?  
A.	I was living with my mother and other members of my family.  
Q.	And did you have an occupation at that time? 
A.	I was studying. 
Q.	Did you remain living with your mother and members of your family after the 7th of April 1994?  
A.	I continued living with members of my family, because when the war started again, my mother moved to our land which was outside the town in the village.  And that's where she died.  
Q.	Did you remain at home with the other members of your family after 7th of April 1994?  
A.	No, we sought refuge elsewhere, together with the other members of my family. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court where you sought refuge? 
A.	On the 7th of April 1994, around 1500 hours, we sought refuge in a centre belonging to white priests called CELA. 
Q.	Why did you go to that place in particular, are you able to say?  
A.	We went to that place because we were -- there were many of us, many of us from our neighbourhood.  And since it was a religious centre, it inspired more confidence in us.  So we sought refuge there so that they don't come and kill us in our neighbourhood.  We were all afraid.  No one knew -- no one could understand what was happening.  On that occasion when we went to that centre, we were a mix of Hutus and Tutsis, but some days later, the Hutus understood what was happening and they decided to go back home.  The rest of us remained there from the 7th of April up until the 22nd April, if I recollect rightly.  And it was on that date of the 22nd April that we left that place, following an attack that was launched against that place.  And on that day they killed between 80 and 100 young people who were there.  
Q.	Who was it that you thought, on the 7th of April, was going to come -- or, might come and kill you at home?  
A.	On the 7th of April, as I've already said, we did not know what was happening.  We could not understand the situation.  We fled because they had just killed some people in our neighbourhood, and some of the victims were killed by troops of the Presidential Guard.  There was, therefore, no one in particular that we were afraid of, and who might come and kill us.  Even the Interahamwes that we were able to identify, we were able to do so only subsequently.  
Q.	Between the 7th of April and the 22nd of April, can you estimate how many refugees came and remained at CELA?  
A.	It is very difficult for me to give you a specific figure, but I must say that we were many.  But we were not more than 500, and that is only an estimate.  The women and children were in one of the halls, I believe it's a hall that is used as a conference hall.  The others were elsewhere; we normally did not meet.  And since there was no assistance, there was no opportunity for us to be able to meet, for me to be able to give you a specific figure of the number of people in that centre. 
Q.	Now, you said when you first went to CELA, there were lots of other people who went with you, and they were a mixture of Hutu and Tutsi.  Was the situation the same as at the 21st of April 1994?  
A.	I told you that the days following our arrival at the place -- at that place, people started understanding the situation and the Hutus started moving home.  And couples which included Hutus, the Hutus went back home and would come back to the centre to visit their spouse.  Later on, they managed to take their spouses back home.  And I will say that on the 21st, it was no longer a mix of Tutsis and Hutus.  Even if there were Hutus, the few Hutus who were at the centre were opponents to the regime.  Because as at that date, the people had understood the prevailing situation.  
Q.	Now, I would like you, please, to tell the Court about the events of the 22nd of April.  Can we start, please -- you said that you were attacked.  What was the first thing that happened that day that made you aware of an attack?  
A.	The attack was prepared; it did not start spontaneously on the 22nd of April.  Before that date, RPF troops had shelled the radio, the RTLM radio station, and there was a lot of confusion in the town and a lot of people left to seek refuge in Gitarama.  And others left the neighbourhood to seek refuge in the CELA centre.  At the time, the missionaries who lived in that centre had left the country during the evacuation of foreigners.  So on that occasion, people spent the night at CELA and spent the following day at CELA and went home in the evening.  The information I'm giving you is information I got from people whose family members remained in their homes, and others who had Hutu family friends who were not able to keep them at -- with them, but was continuing to supply them with food while they were at CELA.  

So those who left CELA went to Angeline Mukandituye, and during the genocide, his (sic) residence was referred to as the defence headquarters.  And those who left the centre went to tell Angeline Mukandituye that the refugees who were at the CELA were Inyenzis and that they had weapons. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sure, Madam Witness, that you have quite a bit to tell, but we do not need it in one round.  So if you could now look at counsel, and she will break this up portions so that we can take this step by step.  
Here comes the next question.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Try to stick, please, to the 22nd of April.  That day, what was it that made you first aware that an attack was taking place?  
A.	We saw persons who were within the bush around the centre, and these people were many.  We saw them around 10 a.m., and we were frightened.  I was at the centre, and I was cleaning the veranda and we -- when we looked towards the GOC -- JOC, we saw people who were weeding in the bush.  We were all young people doing some cleaning.  We therefore went into the centre to tell the others that we had been attacked.  But we found an Interahamwe at the entrance, and that Interahamwe was speaking to those who were inside, telling them that they should get out of the place.  We therefore realised that it was an attack.  
Q.	Witness, please try to look at me while you're answering so that I can stop you if you're going too fast.  

You said -- you described seeing people weeding in the bush.  What kind of people were these?  
A.	These are people that I cannot identify specifically.  None of them was wearing a military uniform.  But they all had machetes. 
Q.	Now, when you say you found an Interahamwe at the entrance, can you describe what entrance?  Are you talking about, for example, the main entrance to the entire CELA compound, or an entrance to a particular building or house, or any other kind of entrance?  
A.	The CELA centre is fenced off with barbed wire, and there were climbing plants that had been planted along the fence.  And those who were weeding were cutting these climbing plants so one could see through the barbed wire.  So one could now see through to the other side of the fence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You referred to one Interahamwe.  Where did you see him?  Was he at an entrance?  
THE WITNESS: 
I told you that this Interahamwe was at the entrance of the house in which we spent the night.  And that inside the house, there were mothers who were making the beds. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you saw the Interahamwe at the entrance of the house, not the entrance of the CELA complex.  That's the evidence, isn't it?  This is true.  
THE WITNESS: 
I don't know if you understand me clearly.  The first people we saw were people who were cutting the bush.  And when we came back to inform the refugees that we had been attacked, we realised that already the Interahamwe had preceded us and were at the entrance of our house.  That means that there were attackers outside, but there were others who had already gotten inside the centre.  The Interahamwe that I saw was already at the entrance of the building in which we lived.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, very briefly, can you explain what it was about this person that leads you to say he was Interahamwe?  
A.	He had a grenade in his hand, and that was the first time I was seeing a grenade.  And in the other hand he wanted to open the cell.  So he had this grenade in his hand and he wanted to turn the lock of the house.  And he looked at us with a -- he looked at us wickedly.  
(Pages 60 to 63 by Kirstin McLean)































	1630H 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Did he speak to you at all? 
A.	No, we did not speak to each other.  Interahamwe allowed us through, and when we got inside, those who were inside were desperate.  I approached one of the mothers and asked her to do what the Interahamwe had asked us to do.  And the mother said that Interahamwe had asked that those inside should get out.  So the mothers folded the blankets -- the blankets that the missionaries had put at our disposal -- and then they went outside. 
Q.	And what about yourself?  What did you do?
A.	I also went out with the others. 
Q.	And where did you go to when you went out? 
A.	We went out and stood in a group outside for a while.  And since everybody was active inside the centre at that time -- people were in various places within the premises -- we saw people coming from various groups, and we realised that we had been encircled by the Interahamwe.  What I no longer recall is how we left the building in which we spent the night to move towards the workshop which the mechanics normally use. 
Q.	Now, besides the Interahamwe and the people that you saw cutting the bush, did anybody else come to CELA that day? 
A.	When the Interahamwe arrived, they were in the company of Angeline, whom I referred to.  She was referred to as the chief of staff of the Interahamwe.  There were other officials, including Odette Mukandituye (sic).  These were the people who were there.  Subsequently the préfet of Kigali-ville and bourgmestre of Nyarugenge arrived. 
Q.	You have mentioned the préfet.  Do you know what his name was?
A.	Renzaho.  The bourgmestre was called Bizimana.  
Q.	And did you see Renzaho and Bizimana arrive at the centre yourself? 
A.	I saw them because I was standing on the road leading to the main gate of CELA, which was the main entrance to that centre. 
Q.	How did they arrive at CELA, can you recall? 
A.	When they arrived at the centre, they entered the centre on foot.  When I saw them, they were not in a vehicle.  But ahead of them was a car, which had been parked, and beside -- and, further, beside was an armoured vehicle. 
Q.	Are you able to estimate how long after you'd first seen the bushes being cut it was that you saw Renzaho? 
A.	Not very long.  After seeing the people who were clearing the bushes, I went towards our building.  Immediately we were asked to go outside.  As I told you, I no longer remember the time it took us to move from our building towards the garage.  But, approximately, even though time seemed to be moving fast at that time, I would give a range of about 30 minutes, approximately. 
Q.	Now, when you saw Renzaho enter, can you tell us what he did? 
A.	You want to know when I saw him enter?  Well, I did not know Renzaho, besides I don't even know whether today I can recognise him.  I was with an elderly lady who exclaimed as follows, "Oh, we are done for because the préfet himself has arrived."  And she continued saying, "He is coming with the bourgmestre.  All those people have come to exterminate us".  There is one father, a family head, who looked at that lady and told her, "Rather, we are lucky, we are going to be saved; especially for me," said the gentleman.  "That person, Renzaho, hails from the same préfecture as me, and we studied together."  
Q.	Okay.  The person that was identified to you as being the préfet, can you tell us what he did when he came into CELA? 
A.	That person arrived at the CELA centre with the bourgmestre and some soldiers.  We were standing on the high ground and we were looking at the others below us because people were scattered here and there.  There were also some Interahamwe here and there.  Angeline and her staff were also there.  So that group of people came very close to the place we were standing, where the garage was.  That gentleman I talked to you about, do you want me to give you his name?  
Q.	I just want you to tell me, please, you have said there was a person who came to CELA who you were told by a woman was the préfet.  Please can you tell the Court what, if anything, you saw that man do at CELA? 
A.	He did not do anything.  I cannot tell you that he did anything particular when he arrived.  I was explaining to you what happened.  I cannot tell you that he picked up something from here or dropped something off there.  I did not witness any such a thing.  Rather, he just stood somewhere, not far from where we were; Angeline and the other Interahamwe went close to him. 
Q.	Now, for how long did you see him?  
A.	After his arrival, we remained at that place where we were standing for about one or two hours, and that still is an estimate.  Furthermore, I was very young then, and I was really frightened.  I could be frightened then.  I would say about two hours.  
Q.	Did you hear the man described to you as the préfet speak at all at CELA? 
A.	I heard him speaking to the gentleman I talked to you about.  
Q.	Can you recall the conversation that you heard, for the Court? 
A.	That gentleman said hello to him as follows.  "General" -- I remember that gentleman tell him, "I greet you, Your Honour", and the préfet returned his greetings.  Subsequently, after Angeline and the Interahamwe had gone close to Interahamwe -- went close to Renzaho, and amongst the Interahamwe was one Fidéle, also known as Castar, I do not know what they discussed; I am unable to tell you.  After speaking a few words to one another, Fidéle left that group and moved a few metres away towards us.  Then he said, "Renzaho has said we should not kill men and women.  We are going to kill young people and men."  I did not hear Fidéle -- I did not hear Renzaho make those utterances, it was, rather, Fidéle who said that.  Since we were in a group, we all heard Fidéle when he made those utterances.  And that gentleman, who was almost traumatised because his wife and children had been killed, became scared thinking that he would be killed.  Once again, that gentleman spoke to Renzaho as follows, "General, don't you know me?  Were we not schoolmates?"  I think those two people had been schoolmates abroad.  So Renzaho told him, "Even though we were schoolmates, you were Inyenzi."  So that gentleman went away from us.  When they started selecting people to be killed, it was Fidéle who left with that gentleman.  Those were Renzaho's utterances, which I heard.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us the name of gentleman you have been talking about, if you know it? 
A.	I don't understand.  
Q.	Are you unable to hear the translation in Kinyarwanda?  Can you hear now?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The question I asked was whether you were able to give us the name of the gentleman who spoke to Renzaho and was taken away by Fidéle? 
A.	His name was Vincent Mugiraneza. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
That's 141.  I think we have had that quite a few times.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, you have mentioned people being selected to be killed.  Did you see that yourself?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness seems to be having problems with her earphones.  
THE WITNESS:
Now I can hear you.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You mentioned people at CELA being selected to be killed.  Did you see them being selected?  
A.	I told you that from the place where I was, I could see Renzaho arrive and the brief conversation he had with the group of people.  But we were sort of separate from the other people because we were on a high ground.  But before we separated ourselves, there were some young people who had been taken out from that group and placed aside, and I was able to see that because there were various groups in various places within that compound.  When it was said that young men and men had to be killed, I was not able to witness the selection of the people who had to be killed.  
Q.	Do you know -- you say they had to be killed.  How do you know that? 
A.	When the Interahamwe saw anyone they were looking out for, they would shout, and that was something I witnessed before we went to the place I mentioned.  For instance, the Interahamwe picked up one Albert.  That was a tall gentleman who knew karate, and the Interahamwe who arrested him said, "Prove to us you are able to do good karate.  Do you think you can escape from us?"  It could be seen that the Interahamwe were just mocking at the victims.  It is obvious that the Interahamwe were taking those people to kill them.  
Q.	And do you know where the Interahamwe took -- or were taking those people? 
A.	Some of those people were killed subsequently.  Of the people taken out of CELA, I know the place where two of them were killed.  Two of them were killed not far from our home. 
Q.	And how do you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently the witness has a question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there -- 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know whether what I just said may not have a negative bearing on my identity because I just said that I knew the place where those people were killed, and you told me that we were in an open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is so general, Madam Witness, so there is no risk.  But it's good that you are cautious.  Continue to be so; it's very good.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	How is it that you know that people were killed? 
A.	That is what I was explaining to you.  Some of those people were killed not far from our home.  We heard the gunshots fired in execution of those people.  Then there is one young person who tried to escape from the killers. The killers chased that person and killed him at his parents' home.  Then there was another man who escaped from the killers, and who is still alive.  So it was a group of people killed not far from our home.  As for the others, they were killed very near, by a mass grave.  I don't know where the others were killed.  But for some people, we were able to know where they were buried when their bodies were exhumed for purposes of a decent burial.  
Q.	So after the attack on CELA, for how long did you remain at that place? 
A.	Are you referring to CELA?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	After that attack, I and my family did not stay long at the CELA centre.  When the Interahamwe finished selecting the people they wanted to kill, while they were looking for other people -- you see, people had been hiding in various places -- and before the group which had remained there gathered, we were asked to return to our respective homes because we did not risk encountering any problems any more.  Since I and my group were facing the road, we went out of that centre immediately and returned to our homes.  
Q.	Do you recall who asked you to return to your home?  
A.	It was Renzaho who said everybody had to return home, because he said our security would be ensured at our homes.  
Q.	How long did you remain at home after you returned there? 
A.	We returned home on the 22nd, and around the 16th or the 17th of May, we went to seek refuge again.  So we stayed home for about three weeks.  
Q.	And did anything in particular occur to make you seek refuge again? 
A.	Yes, an incident occurred.  Some of our neighbours who were at the CELA centre had just been killed.  There is a neighbouring family comprising 17 people who had all just been killed.  All those people were with us at the CELA centre.  So we thought that our security could no longer be ensured.  Amongst the victims were young persons who were our neighbours.  We were also threatened by some Interahamwe who were our neighbours.  So we decided to seek refuge elsewhere once more. 
Q.	And where did you go to seek refuge? 
A.	We went to the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	Did you -- for how long did you stay at the Sainte Famille church, can you remember? 
A.	We spent as much time at the Sainte Famille as it was necessary for the Inkotanyi to take over Kigali city.  So it was the Inkotanyi who evacuated us from the Sainte Famille church. 
Q.	And from the time that you went first to Sainte Famille, and the time that you were evacuated, did you ever see the préfet, or the man that had been referred to as the préfet again? 
A.	I saw him again.  I saw him the day following the evacuation of refugees from Saint Paul by the Inkotanyi.  I think it was on the 16th.  On that occasion, I saw him at the Sainte Famille.  People were killed on that day.  I saw him one other time when he was passing by to go and hold a meeting at the Saint Paul centre.  In other words, I saw him on two occasions.  
Q.	On the day when -- you thought it might be the 16th, and you said people were killed on that day, firstly, on what month are we talking?  16th of what month?  
A.	16th of June. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us where you saw the préfet on the 16th of June? 
A.	On the 16th of June, I saw the préfet standing beside Father Munyeshyaka.  They were not far from the room where Father Munyeshyaka spent the night.  We were standing at a higher ground, because we got to the Sainte Famille quite late; so we remained outside, and a tent had been erected near the church where we stayed:   All of a sudden we saw Father Munyeshyaka below standing with someone in military attire wearing glasses.  As I told you that I had not known Renzaho before, I thought he was a soldier.  But we were wondering whether he was a UNAMIR soldier or another soldier.  So we thought, well, then we are lucky, because UNAMIR has just come in time to evacuate us.  Then one young man said, "But you people are daydreaming.  That is Renzaho, whom you see over there, and we are done for."  

A short while afterwards, while we were looking at those people -- I understand that you are not familiar with the Sainte Famille ground, but from the place where we were, we could see those people, because they were below our position.  Renzaho left.  I no longer knew where Father Munyeshyaka had gone to.  But five minutes afterwards, we saw the Interahamwe jump.  We were near our tent.  One Interahamwe called Furaha jumped over the fence, opening fire.  I do not know where the other Interahamwe came from, lots of them.  Furaha leapt over the fence, opening fire.  There was one young boy, I do not know whether he was at the Sainte Famille and he started shouting and screaming, and I heard gunshots from all directions in that compound.  Since we were near the tent, we went into our tent and we sat down.  Lots of people were killed on that day. There was no selection, as it had been the case at the CELA centre.  They just shot at the crowd or shot anyone passing, at random.  I don't know what the duration of that operation was, but it actually lasted some time.  And sometime afterwards, an Interahamwe I did not know arrived at that place and ordered us to get out of our tent and to go and meet the others, not far from the fathers' room.  So we went out.  And, on our way, we saw bodies lying here and there.  We went close to the place where the other people were.  And when we got there, we found most of the people were women and children, and we sat down in that group.  When we arrived there, the gunshots did not last a long time.  

Renzaho then came to that place in the company of other soldiers and gendarme with the rank of lieutenant called Karemera, and officially he was in charge of the security at Sainte Famille.  The group stopped at the entrance, and we were sitting in the veranda.  He beckoned to one of the Interahamwe.  Two Interahamwe moved towards him.  Those Interahamwe were Sese Seko and Cimba.  Later on, the Interahamwe came back, and Cimba said, "Musée has just ordered us to stop, and that those who were still alive would be killed in due course."  I don't know what he meant by "In due course."  Sese Seko fired into the air, and he said, "Those who were not gunned down were lucky to survive," and he asked us to applaud the Interahamwe for what they had just done.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Sese Seko is 258.  Cimba, I believe, is spelt C-I-M-B-A.  And I think that was it, was it, Your Honour?  Was there another name?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we have forgotten anything we can clarify tomorrow morning.  

There is only Witness KAB left for this week?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
HAD, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
HAD.  But it's enough, together with this witness, for Thursday and Friday?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour, we will finish tomorrow morning.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to get subsequent witnesses to come earlier than on the Friday flight.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's very bad news.  All right.  

We will continue tomorrow morning, Madam Witness, at 8:45 with your testimony.  
The Court is adjourned.
