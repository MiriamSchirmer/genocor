MR. PRESIDENT: 
Witness UB, we are now in open session in order to hear the last part of your examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you to look at some -- a bundle of photographs, and it's this bundle here.  And I'd -- Witness, so if I could ask you, please, to look at photograph number 3.  There are numbers in the bottom right-hand corner of the photographs.  Do you have number 3 in front of you?  
A.	Did you say number 2 or 3?  
Q.	Number 3.  
A.	Yes, I have seen the photograph.  
Q.	Now, do you recognise any of the people in that photograph?  
A.	Yes, I see someone who lived in the Cyahafi secteur, but it will not be easy for me to recall the names.  
Q.	Perhaps you can, at least, if you can, just hold it up and point to the person who you recognise in that photograph? 
A.	In this photograph I see the second person who is in military uniform.  That is somebody I know in Kigali town in the Gitega secteur. 
Q.	Now, just hold it up again so we can be clear -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel's microphone, please.  
BY MR. MOSES: 
Q.	Can you just hold it up again so we can all be clear who it is you're referring to.  
A.	This is the person I was referring to. 
Q.	And that person is wearing a white shirt -- or, has a white shirt collar underneath a military top, camouflage top, with blue jeans; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And where had you seen that person?  
A.	I saw him at the Gitega roadblock, at the border between Cyahafi and Gitega. 
Q.	All right.  Now, can you please ask you to look at photograph number 4.  And do you recognise anyone in that photograph?  
A.	The person who is seated with a weapon in his hands is someone I know in the Nyakabanda secteur.  But, more specifically, I will say that I saw him in a meeting of the Kigali-ville préfecture during one of those meetings we hold.  I must say that it is not easy to know the names of these people because they gave themselves nicknames, which one would not know easily.  
Q.	Now, you said he's sitting in a vehicle.  Did you -- was that person a soldier or was he -- was he something else?  He's in military-style uniform.  Do you know if he was a soldier, or not?  
A.	No, that person was not a soldier -- was not a soldier.  In 1994, all the Interahamwe used to wear some form of military uniform. 
Q.	Right.  And you'll see that he's in a vehicle.  If you were to obtain -- where would you have to go if you wanted to get petrol during April to July 1994?  
A.	There were two ways one could get petrol.  Beginning 7th of April, all the petrol filling stations had been requisitioned by the Kigali préfecture, and others had been requisitioned by the Rwandan armed forces headquarters.  Those who wanted to get fuel had to go to the préfecture office to get a voucher that will entitle them to petrol at a filling station.  Or, that person would have to go to -- Camp Kigali, where they had petrol tanks and -- and then he could be served within the camp.  That is how we obtained petrol. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, if I can ask you to look at photograph number 5.  I can ask you:  Do you recognise anyone in that photograph?  
A.	In the photograph number 5, I recognise a person wearing police uniform -- uniform of communal policeman.  He was a young man who was a son of a journalist called Semusambi, a member of the MRND, who lived in the Cyahafi secteur. 
Q.	First of all, can you spell the name of the father of that -- that person? 
A.	Semusambi is S-E -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness starts all over again. 
THE WITNESS: 
S-E-M-U-S-A-M-B-I.  Semusambi. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, once again, can you just please hold the photograph of books up so we can put on to the record the person that you're -- you're pointing.  
A.	I am referring to this person who is wearing a green shirt.  I told you that he was a member of the MRND party, and the -- the Interahamwe, just as the other youth wings in 1994, they all looked alike.
MR. MOSES:
All right.  And just for the record, Your Honour, that's the person on the extreme right-hand side of the photograph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, if I can ask you, briefly, to look at photograph number 6.  
A.	I don't know anybody, or I cannot recognise anybody in this photograph number 6.  
Q.	All right.  Perhaps if you could look at number 11, photograph number 11.  And can I ask you whether you recognise the area at all from -- that's shown in the photograph?  
A.	Here we are at the border of the Kimisagara secteur, the border between Kimisagara and Cyahafi in the Kigali préfecture.  Here you can see a road leading to the hospital, and another one that leads to Kigali town centre. 
Q.	Thank you for that.  

MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I'm wondering whether -- I've just about concluded the evidence-in-chief, but perhaps if we can take the break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will do that.  

The Court is adjourned for 25 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1130H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to have played a tape recording, and I want you to listen carefully to this tape recording, and I will ask you some questions when it is finished.  So if -- we will now just play it.  If you could listen carefully, please.  
(Audio played) 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Witness, were you able to hear that tape?  
A.	Yes, I listened to the tape.  
Q.	Did you recognise any of the voices on that tape?  
A.	Yes, I recognised some voices.  
Q.	What voices did you recognise?  
A.	I recognised Renzaho's voice, the préfet of Kigali town.  
Q.	Is that the only voice you recognised?  
A.	It is easy for me to recognise his voice.  I also recognised the voice of the operator of Kigali town, whose name was Rubwejanga.  He was the one who passed the telephone call to him, but I did not recognise the voice of the individual the préfet was talking with. 
MR. MOSES: 
Now, for Your Honours' reference, Rubwejanga is spelled R-U-B-W-E-J-A-N-G-A.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What do you mean, with the operator of Kigali town, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
The préfet of Kigali town, Mr. Renzaho, had established the phone system of the Kigali town préfecture in such a way that if one wanted to talk to anybody, one had to go through the operator.  So this was done in the absence of the préfet.  In fact, that person, the switchboard operator, was in charge of immigration and emigration.  But when the préfet was not present, he would be the one to pick up his calls.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, did you hear mention of the word "Gahengeri", G-A-H-E-N-G-E-R-I?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What, who, or where is that place, or that -- that name, Gahengeri?  
A.	Gahengeri is a hill in the Bicumbi commune in the Kigali rural préfecture.  
Q.	Now, do you know François Karera? 
A.	Yes, I do know François Karera.  He was appointed préfet of the Kigali-rural préfecture during the genocide, and prior to that he was sous-préfet in the same préfecture.  At a given point in time he was the bourgmestre in the Nyarugenge commune, and that was for a number of years, so *************************.  
Q.	And do you know his voice?  
A.	I know his voice.  **************************************** when he was the bourgmestre of the urban commune of Nyarugenge.  I know his voice quite well.  I could even recognise his voice in my sleep.  
Q.	Did you recognise his voice on that tape?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Are you able to describe any differences between the voice in Renzaho and Karera?  
A.	They each have a very distinctive voice.  Karera's voice is quite different from that of Renzaho.  Karera's tone is that of the people from the north.  It's as if he was speaking Rukiga, whereas Renzaho, who hails from the region of Buganza, has a tone that is specific to him.  His Kinyarwanda is pure, is unadulterated.  It is not like the Kinyarwanda spoken by the people from the north.  It is thus quite easy to distinguish between the two voices, especially since ******************* those individuals, I know them quite well, and I know their voices, which are distinct from one another.  When the préfet answers you, when he is agreeing to a specific statement, he has a specific way of expressing himself.  So the two voices are quite different.  
Q.	Rukiga, is that spelt R-U-K-I-G-A?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Buganza, is that B-U-G-A-N-Z-A? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, when you listened to the tape, did you hear the words -- the Kinyarwanda words, "mubakindagure rwoze"? 
A.	Yes, I heard such words. 
MR. MOSES:
Just for the record and for the stenographers, it's the same way as Your Honour spelt out, I believe, yesterday.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And what do those words mean in Kinyarwanda?  
A.	When one says mubakindagure in Kinyarwanda, one means "exterminate them".  So the verb, mubakindagure, means cut the body of an individual into two parts.  So mubakindagure means that everyone should be eliminated.  And it comes from another verb, which is gukindura, which means totally eliminate.  
Q.	And whose -- were you able to recognise the voice of the person who used those words on the tape?  
A.	Renzaho was the one who said "mubakindagure".  And he said that there were eliminations in all of the secteurs and the préfet said, "Yes, eliminate them."  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The second Kinyarwanda word, could we have the spelling there, please?  
MR. MOSES: 
Rwoze?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  The witness gave a little lecture about the roots of the verb.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Gukindura, Witness, are you able to spell that on to the record, please?  
A.	G-U-K-I-N-D-U-R-A.  Gukindura.  
Q.	And soon thereafter did you hear the words "Urumba?"  "Mubakindagure, mubakinda...gure bose."  
A.	Yes, I heard mubakindagure rwose" and not "bose", which means completely, totally. 
Q.	And who -- did you recognise the voice of the person who used those words?  
A.	It was an answer given by Renzaho to the person he was talking to.  So he was giving instructions as to what was to be carried out.  That person was telling them that they were looking for those who had gone into hiding here and there, and he told him, "Exterminate them all", when answering the person who was explaining to him what was being done.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now you corrected the Prosecution's Kinyarwanda, I understand.  Was your point that the last spelling was bose with a B?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, it was rather rwose, R-W-O-S-E.  So it was an order to insist on the activity that was being carried out.  But when you say rwose, it means everywhere, which is different.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But there is no R-W-O-S-E in the sentence you were now asked questions about.  
THE WITNESS: 
In the question I heard the word rwose, and I have just been asked to explain whereas -- whether it was the word bose or rwose.  That was in the tape we just listened to.  But, Mr. President, whether we are dealing with bose or rwose, it can have the same meaning.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if you are able, Witness, and only if you are able, from what you've heard on the tape, would you be able to provide any sort of time frame, from the context of what was being spoken as to when, in your opinion, that such a conversation may have taken place?  
A.	In my opinion, I would say that such a conversation took place in late April or early May.  At that time the Inkotanyi had reached the Bicumbi commune.  Bicumbi fell to the Inkotanyi at the very beginning of the hostilities.  So, in view of the context, it was in April, because the Inkotanyi marched all the way to the Kigali-rural préfecture before the city of Kigali fell to the RPF.  So I would say that it was in late April, because at that time soldiers were those who played a more significant role, and the préfet was being congratulated for having gone to the general staff to ask for reinforcements.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, that's the end of the evidence-in-chief, if Your Honour has any questions.  Otherwise --  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Mr. Witness, you identified one of the voices as belonging to an operator; am I correct?  
THE WITNESS: 
I recognised the voice of the person who took the phone call and who would transfer phone calls which were for the préfet.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Did you know that person, personally?  
THE WITNESS: 
I knew that person.  I stated that he was the head of a -- a department at the Kigali town préfecture; he was in charge of immigration and emigration. 
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Do you know what happened to that person?  
THE WITNESS: 
I do not know what became of him.  He was working at the office of the Kigali town préfecture and, at the time when we were fleeing, he also left.  I am not aware of his whereabouts or of what occurred to him.  
JUDGE EGOROV: 
Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, there was no reference to Bicumbi commune in this excerpt; is that true?  The word Bicumbi. 
THE WITNESS: 
The Gahengeri area is in the Bicumbi commune, in the Kigali-rural préfecture.  That is what I wished to explain.  This locality is in the commune. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we agree that the word Bicumbi is not there; it is the word Gahengeri which is therefore your basis for linking this in time to a particular period.  Have I understood this correctly?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I understood that it was in that commune.  I was referring to the time when the Bicumbi commune fell.  But I knew of the Gahengeri locality, I knew it was in the Bicumbi commune.  I had a property in the vicinity.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Are you going to tender any exhibits, Defence, in connection with your cross-examination of this witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Yes, Mr. President, it is my intention, and that is the reason for which I have provided folders of such potential exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Because if that's the case, this is the time when we will sort out the issue of the exhibits from yesterday in connection with Witness GLJ.  

Now, I am sure we have all had a look at the transcripts, and I understand that during the hearings there was, first of all, a reference to the 15th of June 2005 transcripts in the Military II trial.  And that was undisputed by the Prosecution.  

Then there was also a reference to a pro justitia of 9th February 2000, page 3, with K number K0348984.  Did you want to tender that as well?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was a pro justitia dated 21st of October 1994, page 18, K0348970.  Do you want that exhibited also, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But these documents were used, it follows from the transcripts, so there can be no dispute about this.  

Any particular order you want, Defence?  What do you want to start with?  

MR. CANTIER: 
No, Mr. President, no specific order.  Perhaps the chronological order in which the documents were used.  This is the proposal.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So we will, as the first Defence exhibit, then enter the pro justitia of 21st October 1994, which will then be, Mrs. Ben Salimo?  
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
D. 5, Mr. President, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 5 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were these transcripts in closed session?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I do believe they were, Mr. President, on the basis of my recollection.  Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I can't see the stamp "closed" here, but we will look into it, and if they were in closed session.  

Let's start first with the document we just identified.  All right, that was the 21st of October.  The next one was?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Sorry, Mr. President, the one we referred to was the one dated 9th of February, the pro justitia of the 9th of February 2000. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, also under seal.  So both these pro justitias must be under seal.  That's true.  

And then thirdly the transcripts from the Military II trial.  

So what will be the number for the second one, Mrs. Ben Salimo?  
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
D. 6, Mr. President.  
(Exhibit No. D. 6 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the transcripts?  
MS. BEN SALIMO: 
D. 7.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the transcripts were in open session, weren't they?  

MS. BEN SALIMO: 
D. 7A and B.  
MR. MOSES: 
They were, Your Honour.  There was only a short part of them that was used in the -- and I'm just trying to go through, as a matter of completeness, to see whether any of the information which was given by the witness in fact might lead to his identification.  In particular, I'm just looking at page 37 where there is reference to meetings on the 28th and 30th.  I'm using my best French, but it may be that I need some assistance from Your Honour as to whether any of the information following that may be -- be some of the information which he provided which, in fact, could lead to his identification.  

Perhaps it doesn't mention of the events of the 29th and 30th, which were the events that I was concerned about, because I think that would identify him.  

Your Honour, I do believe on page 26, from line 21 to 26, there's reference to distribution of arms, particular places which might be of concern. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that decides the matter.  So on the basis of that portion, we will then place the entire document under seal.  So then all the three exhibits the Defence wanted to tender have now been admitted under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 7A and D. 7B admitted, under seal) 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there is also the 10th, the (unintelligible) of Mr. Renzaho of the 10th April.  And I believe the Prosecutor will not oppose the production of this document. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you have reconsidered your position of yesterday when you said that you probably had to get this in through another witness.  

But are there any objections?  No.  
MR. MOSES: 
I've checked.  In fact, I think there's reference to this particular order in one of our exhibits, Exhibit 49, which was a radio broadcast on the 11th of April.  So on that basis, it seems to be the same as that which was referred to in our exhibit.  So on that basis I'm not going to oppose.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it's all right to enter it as a separate Defence exhibit; is that the view?  It's not included in any other exhibit?  
MR. MOSES: 
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Or is it?  It's just referred to?  
MR. MOSES: 
I think it was read out on the radio on the 11th, according to our Exhibit 49.  I think there's reference to it being read out on the 11th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Since the witness didn't recognise this document, we find it a bit difficult to admit it in view of the general jurisprudence of the Tribunal, even if there is an agreement expressed by the Prosecution.  But it's clear that, based on the attitude just expressed, this document will come in at some stage anyhow.  So you suffer no prejudice, Defence.  It's only a matter of timing.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Absolutely, Mr. President.  There's no problem with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will now be cross-examined by the Defence.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, today you have the opportunity to see again somebody that you're familiar with in this courtroom; is that correct? 
A.	That is so. 
Q.	I'm referring to Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, this man that you see again today, and whom you see take office as préfet of Kigali-ville in 1990, are you able to tell the Court, honestly, the kind of man he was in 1990 when he took office? 
A.	I did not know Tharcisse Renzaho very well to the point of being able to speak about him.  But when the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi RPF war started, he was appointed préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  As far as I am concerned, he was a leader who had been appointed to that position to lead us, and I consider him as a superior authority.  And I don't know exactly what you want me to say about him.  
Q.	Witness, this higher authority, you recall that you ascribed a number of events to him in 1990; is that so?  Is that correct?  
A.	That was a long time ago, but I remember some of the things I said about him in 1990.  I spoke about what I observed about him in Kigali-ville préfecture.  In my first statement, I recall a number of things that I said.  I spoke about what I observed about him at the time.  
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court what you observed about him at that time?  
A.	The Kigali-ville préfecture was established, I cannot recall exactly when, it must have been between the 4th and 5th of October 1990.  He was appointed préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  He had a rank of a colonel.  In Kigali town, those who were referred to as accomplices were arrested.  Those persons were detained immediately following the appointment of Tharcisse Renzaho as préfet.  Tutsis were arrested, accused of being accomplices of the enemy, and were put in prison.  And others were killed.  When he was appointed préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture, they started immediately worrying the Tutsis, because they were deprived of their rights.  And that was done by soldiers and gendarmes.  And he was one of the higher authorities of the préfecture that he led.  That is what I said about Renzaho.  

Individually, as a person, for -- as far as we were concerned, he was a leader.  He continued leading us as a soldier would, regarding the pressures that were brought to bear on the Tutsi since 1994 -- since 1990 to 1994. 
Q.	According to you, was it Mr. Renzaho who ordered these arrests in October 1990? 
A.	I'm not able to say if it's Renzaho who ordered that, because I was not with him.  But if he was appointed, and in the night of the 4th to the 5th the Tutsis were arrested, and these Tutsis were detained on a football field, I believe he was one of those who ordered the arrests because, after he took office, the spate of arrests did not stop.  They continued arresting the Tutsis and detaining them on a football field.  Mr. Renzaho is a senior officer, and I would not say that this plan was completely unknown to him.  
Q.	Witness, these arrests, did they take place before or after Mr. Renzaho took office?  
A.	The arrests took place a little prior to his taking office in the morning of the 5th.  And in the hours that followed, he was appointed préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  I'm saying this to say that he was appointed at the time that he was appointed (sic), and when he took office they continued arresting people.  He gave instructions that the outskirts of Kigali be -- that they weed the outskirts of Kigali, and people were arrested.  And I believe this is a plan that was implemented by the soldiers, and he himself was a soldier.  
Q.	Were you personally involved in this spate of arrests, this programme of arrests?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover)... I was not selected as one of those to implement the programme.  ******************************************  I ************************************** was, therefore, not one of those carrying out the -- carrying out the arrests, but I had to respect the instructions of the préfet.  And when the préfet was appointed, he was appointed together with three bourgmestre of the three communes of Kigali-ville préfecture.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
At 12:11:14 in the English version, there is a sentence which I think we should read now in the French version, and I'm doing that now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Does Your Honour want the interpretation?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
"This is to say that he took office at the time that they were arresting people, and after he took office, people -- they continued arresting people."  

I think this will remove a discrepancy between the two versions.  Please proceed.  
MR. MOSES: 
Sorry, Your Honour, if I can also just -- there is a sentence -- there was a question, "Were you personally involved in this spate of arrests, this programme of arrests?"  The next -- the first line of his answer I'm concerned is going to -- perhaps should be put in the closed session, "as a leader of a".  Does Your Honour see -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you want to conduct this part of your examination in closed session, Defence Counsel, or do you want to remain in open as we are now?  
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. NEKUIE: 
Maybe I should answer the President, and then you can speak.  

Mr. President, Counsel for the Prosecution's point is relevant.  I raise the question which was likely to reveal the witness's identities just because I did not put him on notice that he should not -- when I ask him questions, he should not give answers that might identify him.  I am of the opinion that this portion be put under seal, and if the witness will agree to continue with me in open session, while avoiding answers that will identify him, then I prefer, for now, to continue in open session.  
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you hold on a moment, Witness?  

All right, we will place under seal, in the English version, the sentence starting with "As a".  Thank you for drawing our attention to that; that will then be placed under separate cover.  

Now, Mr. Witness, do you think you will be able to, in the period ahead of us now, answer questions in a way which will not reveal your identity?  Could you exercise caution, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
I will try, Mr. President.  I will make an effort in answering the questions that you put to me.  It is therefore not necessary to go into closed session.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much for that position.  And Defence counsel will then continue in open.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	And, Witness, thank you for your cooperation.  

Witness, we were dealing with the issue of arrests in 1990, and I asked you a question that you answered.  Now, are you able to describe how you were able to do what you described in the previous answer?  
A.	Just as all the other cities is, the soldiers would come and ask questions about the location of this or that person.  But the person to whom the question was put would indicate where the person who is being sought is located.  That is how it happened.  
Q.	Witness, do you think that this is exactly the manner of operation that you spoke about to the investigators of the OTP when you were dealing with that?  
A.	No, that is not the only role that I spoke about.  These are some of -- some examples that I have given before the Judges to explain the role that Renzaho played during the arrest of the accomplices in he -- in his capacity as a soldier.  We gave a lot of explanations regarding the role that he played, particularly during the meetings that he convened, immediately upon being appointed to the position of préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture.  
Q.	Witness, we shall deal with the role of Renzaho.  For now, let us limit ourselves to your participation.  
A.	Well, I don't know which role of mine that you want to know.  I told you the role I played, when I said that what was done was a decision from the authorities.  So the authorities therefore played a role.  So I don't know which role you want me to speak about.  You'll find the roles -- the roles that I played, personally, in my statements.  Otherwise members of the population did not play any role in the arrest of the persons who were arrested in 1990.  These were decisions that were taken at the level of the higher authorities, be it in Kigali-ville préfecture or elsewhere.  And then, subsequently, the authorities decided what to do to those who were arrested.  So members of the population were not involved in the arrest of people in 1990.  
Q.	Are you categoric with regard to this answer you are giving, or you have no recollection of what you had to do, personally, individually?  
A.	I don't know if you are talking about my role or the solution that was to be -- the solution to what I did.  Probably you needed to -- maybe you had to put -- you need to put the question differently.  You think I'm here to explain my role.  Questions will be put to me on my role elsewhere, and the person against whom I came to testify should also explain his role.  
Q.	Witness, if you are able to recall the activities of a third person, the more reason why you should be able to remember your own activities or your own role in 1990.  
A.	You should rather be asking me what I did to prevent the arrests of these people.  Ask me what I did to defend these people when I was asked to point out who the enemy was.  Don't ask me questions about my role at the time of the arrests.  I allowed some people to -- to go, and I defended other persons by saying, X or Y is innocent, and I did not play any role in the arrest of whom whatsoever. 
Q.	What, then, did you do to defend some people?  Can you briefly describe this to the Chamber?  
A.	How could I defend these people when it was my -- my supervisor who was asking -- or, who ordered the arrests?  
Q.	Witness, am I to understand that you did not do anything at all during that period?  Is that your evidence before this Chamber today?  
A.	As part of my duties, I needed to call upon my higher officers in case of crisis.  I called upon these authorities and they did not give me any assistance because these authorities were the same ones who were cooperating -- carrying out the arrests and who were issuing the orders for the arrests to be made.  I don't know what I could have done, because I did not have any other possibility but to request my chief to intervene.  
Q.	And which chief did you contact, and exactly what did you ask him?  
A.	I had always addressed myself to my chief.  I told you that we used to inform the higher authorities on what was happening, and it was for those authorities to intervene.  But since these same authorities initiated what was happening, they could not come and assist me.  
Q.	Monsieur le temoin -- 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Counsel, are we still in 1990, or have we moved?  I am a bit lost.  Are we still in 1990?  Okay.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
We are very well in 1990, but I am going to move on.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, in fact what you've told the Chamber is what you were able to do, and all you were able to do in 1990 with regard to the arrests.  Is that correct?  Is that what -- is that your evidence, what we are supposed to take as your evidence?  
A.	I did not do anything, because I am not the person who initiated arrests of the accomplices.  Those who initiated the programme were more important and higher in authority than myself.  I did not play the role.  And those persons were higher authorities who participated in the arrests.  That is why I am able to say that I did not do anything.  
Q.	Is that what you told the investigators of the OTP in relation to those events?  
A.	Regarding that issue, I told the investigators that I received instructions, and I believe I told the investigators that we received -- we received instructions at the time of the arrest of the accomplices.  I gave the name of the person who gave me the instructions and what we did regarding those instructions.  
Q.	Are you able to be more specific regarding the instructions that you received?  Are you able to tell the Court what it was all about?  
A.	My colleagues and I received instructions to the effect that, after the arrests of the accomplices, we should join the other persons reporting to the préfet, to go and see who were Hutus from among those who had been arrested, so those Hutus can be released.  We therefore went to the various prisons to identify the Hutus who had been arrested.  
Q.	Witness, the Kigali-ville préfecture, was it created -- established for these arrests?  
A.	The préfecture of Kigali-ville was not created to carry out these arrests, because there was a law to the effect that the Kigali-ville préfecture -- that a Kigali-ville préfecture, which should be autonomous, should be established.  After it was established, its administration was entrusted to a soldier, and it was this soldier who was in charge of affairs when the Inkotanyi attacked -- before the attack of the Inkotanyi there was no préfet in charge of that préfecture.  That is to say that the préfet of Kigali-ville had a mission that was entrusted to him by the person who appointed him to that position.

	1230H 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Do you recall the date on which the law establishing Kigali-ville préfecture was adopted? 
A.	No, I have no recollection of that.  I am not able to say that it was on this or that date that the law was voted, but I do know that at some point in time that law was voted.  But I also recall the date on which the person who was to lead -- to be in charge of Kigali-ville préfecture was appointed. 
Q.	If I were to suggest to you that that this law was voted in June 1990, would you agree with me? 
A.	I do not agree with you, because I do not see that law.  If you can show me where it is written, I may agree with you that the law was voted in June.  If the law was voted in June and the préfet appointed in October, then it was a well-established plan.  Besides, they appointed a soldier to the position of préfet, and I am saying everything was done in its own good time.  If it is officially noted that the law was voted in June, then I can agree with you. 
Q.	According to you, Witness, the Kigali-ville préfecture, exactly when did it start operation -- operating, if you recall? 
A.	The Kigali town préfecture started operating in October after the attack by the RPF. 
Q.	So, according to you, all the infrastructure and the staff of the Kigali town préfecture was already in place; am I correct?  
A.	Well, on the basis of the law, it provided that the infrastructures of the Nyarugenge commune would be transferred to the Kigali town préfecture.  So the buildings, the staff, they were all there before the préfet was appointed.  It is after his appointment that all that became the property of the Kigali town préfecture. 
Q.	Are you referring to the law or is this comment the result of your personal observation?  
A.	Whether my answer is based on my own observations or not, I was able to note that all the property of the Nyarugenge commune went to the Kigali town préfecture.  I have not read the law, but I believe this could not have been done without it being contained in the provisions of such a law.  
Q.	Did the Kigali town préfecture keep only one commune or several? 
A.	In the past, there was one single urban commune, that of Nyarugenge, but after the Kigali town préfecture was set up, three communes were created and they made up that préfecture. 
Q.	So if three communes were created, do you believe it would have been sound to transfer the estate of one commune to the préfecture and to not provide anything to the three préfectures that had been newly created? 
A.	That was possible.  That was possible.  When the Kigali town préfecture was created, there was no -- there were no specific buildings belonging to any one commune; all of the assets belonged to the commune, and the commune was managing the assets.  Whereas, dealing with Kacyiru, Nyarugenge or Kicukiro, none of the communes had any personal assets.  It was the préfecture who paid the salaries of employees of such communes. 
Q.	Witness, do you know what became of the people who were arrested in October of 1990? 
A.	Some of the people who were arrested were detained.  We were able to see them in the Kigali prison or in other prisons.  Some of them died, but others were released.  
Q.	Do you remember which institution released them? 
A.	There was a préfectoral security council, which was chaired by the préfet, and it was that body that released the people.  I was not aware of -- or, I did not know this body.  But we were asked to go and visit the prisons, along with other officials. 
Q.	Witness, I apologise, but I seem not to have understood your answer.  Are you saying that it was the préfectoral security council that released these people in 1990?  Was that your testimony? 
A.	I stated that there was one body that was in charge of security.  So it is the Kigali town security council who -- which could be aware of what had truly happened.  What I do know is that my superior ordered me to go and visit the prisons and see who were the people detained there; so it was my superior who knew who had been released or not.  The people who were released were then referred to the Kigali town préfecture. 
Q.	Did you ever hear about a governmental commission in charge of such matters at the time? 
A.	I was not a member of the government and I did not hear about any such commission.  What I am aware of is the instructions that were given to me by the préfet.  The government had arrested these people; it was the government, the préfet, and the military commander of the town.  So the préfet could tell you how the people were arrested; and, besides, I should state that the assets of these people were seized by the préfecture and sold by it.  And the proceeds of such sales were put into the coffers of the Kigali town préfecture. 
Q.	Am I to understand, Witness, that you did not make any distinction between the préfecture security council and the governmental commission I have referred to? 
A.	The préfectoral security council of Kigali town is different from the governmental council.  ***********************************************, but I cannot say anything regarding the governmental commissions.  I was not a minister.  I cannot tell you how that commission operated.  I would get my instructions from the préfet of the Kigali préfecture and I would follow the orders or instructions that were given to me.  So the préfet is the one who knows where his own instructions came from. 
Q.	So, according to you, it was that security council of the préfecture who made the decision to sell the property?  Is that your testimony before the Trial Chamber? 
A.	I stated that some property was sold by the Kigali town préfecture and the proceeds of such sales came back to the Kigali town préfecture.  The préfecture security council must have been aware of that.  And the sales commission was set up by the préfet.  In that commission there were conseillers and bourgmestres and the proceeds of the sales were paid to the Kigali town préfecture, and all that was managed by the Kigali town préfecture.  It was not the government council which led the operation of the sales of Tutsi property, it was, rather, the préfecture. 
Q.	Witness, let us be clear on this issue because we need to make progress. The answers you are providing and the information you are giving to the Trial Chamber on the arrests of 1990 and the conditions in which such arrests were managed, is that specific information you were able to collect or is it merely your opinion you are expressing before the Trial Chamber on the events that occurred in 1990?  
A.	It is not my opinion I am expressing.  The people who were arrested were inhabitants of the Nyarugenge commune, just as I was.  So I was a witness to such events.  These people were arrested by soldiers, but préfectoral officers, in broad daylight.  So this has nothing to do with my own feelings.  I am simply referring to events I personally witnessed.  
Q.	And you are also talking about events you played a part in; am I correct?  
A.	You are stating that I was part of the events. I played a role in the events, but I am saying that I was an eyewitness to the events.  If I were to tell you that I participated in such activities, I do not see how it would enable you to prove that the préfet did not play any part in them, since ****************************** *********** I do know that the accomplices were arrested.  I don't know if you were stating the contrary.  Are you saying that the accomplices were not arrested?  Let me reiterate that they were arrested by soldiers and by policemen of the Kigali town préfecture, who did have a leader.  
Q.	And to conclude on the matter, you never heard about the governmental commission or of a tribunal that would be responsible for these matters -- these arrests?  You never heard about such bodies? 
A.	I fail to understand what you mean.  There was never any tribunal that was created for the arrest of such people.  They were arrested and then subsequently they were released.  I am referring here to the arrest of accomplices. I do not know of any decision that was made at the level of the government council.  But what I do know is that amongst the people who carried out such arrests, there were authorities of the Kigali town préfecture.  
Q.	Witness, during your examination-in-chief you testified that after the advent of multiparty democracy, Mr. Renzaho remained -- or was still a member of the MRND party.  Do you confirm such a statement or did I misunderstand you when you were answering the questions put to you by the Prosecutor?  
A.	I stated that after the advent of multiparty democracy, Renzaho was not a member of the MRND but he continued to support the MRND, and the MRND party continued to support him as if he was still a member of the party. 
Q.	And in what way did the MRND party support him, according to you? 
A.	I explained that in 1991, after the advent of multiparty democracy, there was a sharing of power within the government and the administration of préfectures.  There were préfectures whose préfets were to be members of the MRND, and there were also ministerial posts that were reserved for the MRND.  The Kigali préfecture was for the MRND party.  The leader of this préfecture was to be a member of the MRND.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) And he was one of those préfets who were appointed to the préfectures which has been set aside for the MRND.  So he was a member of the MRND, per se, even if he had not signed the statutes of MRND. 

MR. MOSES: 
	Your Honour, I am highlighting -- I think there is a sentence in there which should be put into closed session regarding -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	The time reference?  
MR. MOSES: 
	12:58 -- it may be different.  It's in the last answer, *****************************************************
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.  So that sentence at 12:44:32 in the English version contains two elements, and we will place under seal the part before "And".  The same in French, of course.  Thank you.  

	Please be careful, Mr. Witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, just as the President just stated, please refrain from referring to what you were doing at the time and to your personal involvement.  

	So we were dealing with support that the MRND allegedly provided to Préfet Renzaho, and in your answer, Witness, you seemed to be stating that there was an agreement on the sharing of préfectures among the different political parties.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, indeed, that is what I meant.  There was a sharing of the positions amongst the different political parties, and the Kigali town préfecture was to be led by a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	Were you able to gather such information from a specific document or was it an informal decision made by the political parties? 
A.	There was a protocol agreement among the different political parties regarding the sharing of positions of préfet.  There was also an agreement regarding the ministerial posts which were to be set aside for specific political parties.  So that préfecture was one of those that had been set aside for the MRND. 
Q.	Witness, since you seem to be categorical regarding the information you are sharing with the Trial Chamber under oath, could you tell the Trial Chamber on which exact dates such protocols were adopted?  
A.	You seem to be inferring that I am lying to the Trial Chamber.  But I did tell you that I was member of the MRND.  I was aware of what was happening in the party.  I cannot provide you with any exact date as to when such protocols were adopted, but it was common knowledge that the MRND had accepted to share the power with the other political parties.  It was also common knowledge that some préfectures were to be led by members of specific political parties.  Those agreements existed, but I am not in a position to provide any date at which they were adopted.  I was not in charge of the archives of the government or of any political party, but what I do know and what I -- what I do know is that I am speaking the truth.  The préfectures I referred to were set aside for the MRND, and it is the leadership of the party that was to appoint the préfets who were be to lead the préfectures that had been set aside for the MRND. 
Q.	Witness, do you at least remember the year? 
A.	It was in 1991, after the advent of multiparty democracy, that such protocols of agreement were adopted.  In 1992 there was a transitional period where the government was shared by the different political parties.  So it was at the time when the Arusha Accords were signed with the RPF that such protocols of agreement were still being used.  There was a time when there was a sharing of power between the MRND, the MDR, the PSD, and the PL. 
Q.	And if I am to understand the logic behind the information you are sharing with us now, Witness, am I to deduce that the functions of préfet or bourgmestre were linked to ones belonging to a specific political party? 
A.	During that time when there was a sharing of power, any préfet had to be affiliated to the party for which the préfecture had been set aside.  But, regarding the bourgmestre, the matter had not been settled because most of the bourgmestre were members of the MRND.  I would say that 90 per cent of the bourgmestres were members of the MRND. 
Q.	And the Rwandan law at the time specified that a préfet had to be a member of a specific political party; is that your testimony?  
A.	This is nothing to do with constitution but rather of the law which was establishing a government that had been extended to other political parties.  So there was a sharing of power at all levels, be it at the government level or the level of préfecture.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Witness, was there a statutory provision requiring préfets to be member of the MRND?  
THE WITNESS:
	There was an agreement whereby political party leaders were to propose candidates to the position of préfet.  In a préfecture that had been set aside for the MRND, for example, the préfet had to be a member of the MRND.  Such agreements existed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	So it was a political agreement, not a legal text?  
THE WITNESS:
	It was, indeed, a political agreement among the different parties prior to the elections which were planned. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, following this agreement you have referred to, was the Rwandan government at the time led by the MRND? 
A.	Following those agreements, there was a sharing of power.  The government was represented by several parties.  The prime minister was a member of the MDR, whereas the president of the republic was a member of the MRND.  So these are the explanations I can provide.  
Q.	And you believe that the president of the republic, who was also president of the MRND, was controlling the state at that time? 
A.	But I just told you that there was a sharing of power amongst the parties.  In the past, the president of the republic had extended powers, but after multiparty democracy there was a sharing of power.  The president of the republic was a member of the MRND and in the government there were also members of the MRND, as well as préfets who were members of the MRND, as well as of other political parties.  
Q.	I would like to know, Mr. Witness, whether in this sharing of power the MRND remained as influential as it was before the advent of multiparty democracy? 
A.	You will understand that when sharing is involved, one's influence tends to diminish.  When there is a sharing of power, your share of the power is reduced.  I do know that the president of the republic was a member of the MRND party, but he did not wield as much power as he used to during the time when there was a single party. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in order to try and enlighten the Chamber on this matter of the sharing of powers among political parties, my client has just given to me a document entitled "Protocol of agreement among political parties who are to participate in the transitional government".  
MR. NEKUIE:
	And, with the Trial Chamber's leave, since the document is not included in my folder, Mr. President, Your Honours, to have this document shown to the witness, and perhaps when we resume he could tell us whether it corresponds to the document he referred to in his testimony?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Do you have a few brief questions that we can continue with?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, Mr. President.  On the basis of the answer that will be given to me by the witness, I have one or two questions to put to him and then we can adjourn.  
THE WITNESS:
	The document I have been given is written in French, and I would request that the Rwandan text be given to me, because I must say that I am not quite conversant with French.  Or, perhaps, the document could be read out to me so that I can decide on the issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Counsel, I just saw the document pass by.  Is this a document which was signed by a number of political parties in a particular town?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, indeed, Mr. President. The signatures -- the initials are at the end of every page and the signatures appear on the last page.  Perhaps we could have the names of the political party leaders who were present, read out.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And in which town was this agreement signed?  Can you assist us?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	The agreement was signed in Kigali, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And the date?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	April of 1992, and more specifically on the 7th of April 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, does this assist you, Mr. Witness?  Is this indeed the document you were referring to?  
THE WITNESS:
	This document is not helpful in any way.  I am being asked to explain the contents of the agreements.  I told you that the political parties had set up a system to share powers.  I am being shown a document on this sharing of power.  What I can say is those laws have not always been complied with or enforced.  So this document can be of no assistance regarding my statements, because it is a document which comes from Renzaho.  It is a document that was never presented to the préfecture urban committee.  There were documents that were fabricated with a view to defending oneself.  

	I do not know whether your client is denying that the Kigali préfecture was one of the seven préfectures that had been set aside for the MRND out of the 11 préfectures which the Rwandan territory comprised.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Do you want to pursue this discussion with the witness on this point, Defence counsel, or shall we simply move on?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, I wish to pursue the discussion on the matter, but I would like to cooperate, for him to understand the document.  My proposal is that the document be left with the witness and perhaps he could have someone translate to him the contents of the document, and when we resume I will then be in a position to put questions to him on the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And which passages are particularly important?  Because we can't ask the interpreters to spend their entire lunch break with the witness in order to do this?  

Do you have one or two paragraphs that you think would be helpful for the witness, so that they could maybe come back five minutes earlier to assist the witness?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, Mr. President. Just the first page from the title down, and then the last page focusing on the names and identities of the signatories of the protocol, as well as the date.  It is not my intention to delve into the contents of the document.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
	Very good.  So can I ask the Kinyarwanda interpreters, kindly, to sacrifice five minutes of their lunch break and look at the first and last page of this document with the witness.  We will then start again at 2:35 this afternoon.  

	What is your estimated time frame for cross-examination, Defence counsel?  I am just asking to find out whether we need to ask that a new witness be brought today, or not?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, Your Honours, my estimation would be two hours.  Two hours, because I am still dealing with events prior to 1994 with the witness, which means that I will require time to deal with all the events of 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	But if that is the case, we will not need a new witness today because there is a meeting starting at 4:30, so we will have to adjourn at 4:25 today.  But let's hope that we can get through with most of this by 4:30.  

	Mr. Moses.
MR. MOSES: 
	Just a matter of administration, Your Honours.  I indicated yesterday to my learned friends that the order we had proposed last week was, after this witness, was going to be Witness KZ followed by SAF.  KZ didn't arrive on the day they were intended to arrive.  But they have now arrived.  But we intend to swap the order of those two witnesses around, so that the next witness will be Witness SAF, and then that witness will be followed by Witness KZ, if that assists my learned friends and the Bench.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Then follows witness BUO, as originally mentioned?  
MR. MOSES: 
	Correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And these are the witnesses for this week.  
MR. MOSES: 
	Yes, and if we run out of those, we do have the possibility of Witness AWE who could be brought on.  But at this stage that witness is scheduled for end of next week or the beginning of the week after that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	That was helpful.  Thank you.  We will then not resume at 2:35 but 2:40 in order to allow these extra five minutes for the interpretation.

	Court is adjourned.
	(Court recessed from 1306H to 1440H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	We are still in open session.  The cross-examination continues.  Defence?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Obliged, Mr. President.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, did you get the translation of the last and first pages of the document which I handed over to you?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, Witness, according to you, is it a reflection of the protocol which you yourself talked about when we had our discussion? 
A.	I actually noticed that the protocol which was produced was signed by representatives of political parties.  But that does not exclude the fact that there was another protocol agreement signed between the parties.  So I cannot rule out the fact that there was another protocol, even though the signatories of this protocol were those representing the parties called upon to form the transition government. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, I agree that it is possible there were other protocols, but, at least, do we agree that it was a protocol between the political parties existing in Rwanda at the time? 
A.	I agree that the document you handed over to me was a protocol of understanding between the parties and it was signed by the representatives of the political parties called upon to participate in the government. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, Your Honours, since the witness recognises the document, the Defence, at this stage of the proceedings, would like to tender it, if my learned friend is not against it or not.  
MR. MOSES: 
	I am not against it.  I would like a copy of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	We would all wish a copy of it.  But the next exhibit number is?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
	D. 8.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 8 admitted) 
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, actually, I thought about it, so I had made some copies available and I will have them circulated now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Shall we continue?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, indeed, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, following the admission of this document, I would like to put to you that there was never any protocol of agreement between political parties in '91 or '92 seeking the distribution of -- or sharing of préfectures within the territory of the republic of Rwanda.  Do you agree? 
A.	I beg to disagree with you, Counsel.  As I had already explained, after the formation of the transition government there was another memorandum of understanding aimed at carrying out the sharing or distribution of administrative services and préfectures.  Following the setting up of the government, the various political parties participating in that government signed other memoranda of understanding or protocols, and it was during one of those protocols that the political parties agreed on the sharing of administrative services and préfectures which comprised the country.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	This Defence Exhibit D. 8, which we just tendered, is it possible to get a better copy?  Could you look into your files Prosecution and Defence?  I am sure this document circulates in much better shape.  At least Mr. Matemanga will try to make a better copy with his available means.  Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that the second protocol you are referring to, and which concerns the sharing of protocol, is a figment of your imagination, because the structuring of the central administration forbade the préfets of being members of any political party.  Do you agree? 
A.	Once again, Counsel, I beg to disagree with you.  The rules and regulations prohibited those people from being members of the steering organs of political party, but that did not prevent civil servants from joining any political parties of their choice.  And, I keep on asserting, knowingly that your client backed the MRND, and there is a lot of proof about that.  He was a supporter of the MRND, and he was even a member thereof.  But that does not mean that he had signed the constitution of that political party.  
Q.	Witness, since you are seemingly being steadfast in your allegations against my client and his support, on membership of the MRND, you actually said in that connection during your evidence in chief that since you were a member of the MRND you easily visited with him.  Is that correct? 
A.	I was not the only one who easily visited with him, but all members of the MRND political party felt at ease vis-à-vis the administration of Kigali-ville préfecture.  Accordingly, I felt at ease at the préfet's place because I was a member, and he, too, supported the MRND political party.  
Q.	That is what I seem to believe, Witness.  So should we understand that you were familiar with the préfet, who was a supporter of MRND party?
A.	I was a member of the MRND and he was a supporter of that party.  He was also an administrative official in the Kigali-ville préfecture.  So, in that capacity, I easily visited with him.  There are lots of proofs.  He could even dismiss someone who was impeding MRND activities and replace him with someone who was a pro-MRND.  I can even give examples.  He himself is present to confirm what I am saying.  I hope he is not going to gainsay me.  
Q.	Witness, would you know, for instance, the driver and, if possible, the bodyguards of Mr. Renzaho?  Did you know them, **********************?  
A.	You are asking me if I knew his driver.  His driver was a soldier; and his bodyguards were also soldiers.  But in relation to those people, there were police officers who were responsible for his security.  So, regarding your question particularly, he could ride in a military vehicle because he was still a member of the military establishment. 
Q.	I have no doubt about that, Witness.  I am simply asking you whether you were able to know at least his driver.  If you were not able to do so, then just answer with a no.  
A.	I just told you that his driver was a soldier.  I don't know how you would want me to know that driver, because, at that rate, you will soon ask me if I knew his manservant.  I knew the préfet because he was the administrative authority at préfecture level, and I knew him in his capacity as a member of the MRND party whom we always met when necessary, and I have told you that his driver was a soldier.  But since there were more than ten drivers in the préfecture office, he could choose from any of those drivers who were there.  But let me repeat to you that, most of the time, he was being driven by the military driver. 
Q.	Witness, during that period and up until 1994, since it was the same driver, did you know that the driver in question was a Tutsi; yes or no? 
A.	I never sought to know whether his driver was a Hutu or a Tutsi.  I could not go and ask him that question.  And in the préfecture office, it is true that there were other Tutsi drivers who were subsequently sacked. 
Q.	Did you also know that some of the police officers in his escort team were of Tutsi origin? 
A.	I don't know which period you are referring to when you say that the police officers were responsible for his protection.  Those police officers were staff of the préfecture office.  So I don't know during which period those people would have served in his protective detail.  But what I am sure of is that, in 1994, there were never any Tutsi policemen serving as his bodyguards.  
Q.	And how do you know that he did not have any Tutsi police officers serving as his bodyguard in 1994? 
A.	I told you that when he was appointed préfet, those police officers were there already.  Under normal circumstances, you were hired in a particular post by the commune council in a meeting.  That's why I say that there could be Tutsi amongst the police officers.  In 1994, those who were dismissed were Tutsi, because when they were hired, they lived in some particular secteurs, and we knew them. 
Q.	But, Witness, you told me that you could not know whether Mr. Renzaho's army soldier could be a Tutsi or not, same as for the members of his escort.  How, suddenly, were you able to know that they were of Tutsi origin and that they had been dismissed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Witness, will both you and counsel remember the pause please between question and answer?  So, now, after that little pause, now you can answer, because we need some time for interpretation.  What is your answer, please?  
THE WITNESS:
	The police officers of Kigali-ville préfecture office hailed from the secteurs of that préfecture.  They had identity cards which had been issued by those same secteur offices, and their identity cards mentioned their ethnicity: Tutsi, Hutu or Twa.  So we had to know those of the police officers who hailed from our own secteurs.  Even those who had to be issued with resident permits; about them, we were obliged to mention the ethnicity of the person to whom we would issue the resident's permit on the resident's permit. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Did you personally check the identity cards or resident's permits of the drivers or police officers of the PVK between April and July 1994? 
A.	I was not obliged to go and check those documents because I had already known them before.  The drivers hailed from secteurs of Kigali city, same as for the police officers.  They all hailed from Kigali-ville préfecture.  So I did not have to go and check their identities, because I knew those of the policemen who hailed from my secteur and I could know whether or not they were Tutsi, because everybody had to go to the secteur office in order to be issued with such identification papers.
MR. NEKUIE:
	Thank you for the reminder, Your Honour.
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
Q.	All the drivers of Kigali-ville préfecture and all the police officers of that préfecture, were they all residents in your secteur? 
A.	No, they were not all residents of my secteur.  They lived in various secteurs of Kigali-ville préfecture, and that applied to the other public officers of Kigali-ville préfecture.  Everyone was free to settle in whatever area he found appropriate for -- or suitable for his personal situation.  
Q.	You will therefore agree with me that you do not have information to be able to say today that there was never a Tutsi police officer or driver in the Kigali-ville préfecture in April and July 1994?  Do you agree with that?  
A.	No, I don't agree with you, Counsel.  I did not say that there were no Tutsi police officers, whereas I had given the example of a Tutsi driver who was dismissed and killed subsequently.  So you cannot tell me that in 1994 there was no Tutsi in the Kigali-ville préfecture office, because I have given you examples of those who were dismissed and others who were killed, and who were public officers in the Kigali-ville préfecture office.  
MR. MOSES: 
	Your Honours, if I can just --  I think there is a question and answer earlier regarding ******************, and he indicated that -- in his answer, that others of a particular occupation similar to his own - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you give us the time reference on the left-hand side? 
MR. MOSES:
We don't have the time reference, unfortunately, coming up on our computer, Your Honour.  The question was after "Thank you for the reminder, Your Honour.  Witness, **********************************************?"  And it's that -- in the answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes, in 15:01:12, I think we will delete the answer and place it under separate -- the question and place it under separate cover, and, actually, also the answer.  It's the safest thing; the whole exchange be placed under seal.  Thank you very much.  Shall we continue?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Very well, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I maintain that you have no information upon which you can rely to be able to assert that all senior -- public officers, Tutsi public officers of Kigali-ville préfecture office had been dismissed in April 1990.  Do you agree with me?
A.	I don't agree with you.  I don't know if you want me to absolutely accept your position.  I am testifying, and I am telling you about events that I witnessed.  ******************************************, and you still tell me that I have no evidence.  I don't know what else you want, because I have told you that I am even ready to give you names of people who were killed and others who were dismissed.  I don't know what other evidence you want because I told you that those who were at the préfecture were dismissed.  
Q.	Witness, at the préfecture between April and July 1994, were there refugees of Tutsi ethnicity, and were those refugees killed, from what you know? 
A.	It is true that there were refugees who went to the préfecture office.  They were not killed, but they were sacked.  They were requested to leave the préfecture office premises, but they were killed in various places where they went after they were sacked from the premises of the Kigali-ville office.  
Q.	Witness, since I am not yet dealing with the events of April 1994, if you let me stop there, and let me focus on the period before April 1994, did you hear in 1993 about a committee of assessment of public servants? 
A.	I never heard about this committee because I was not interested in assessment of public servants.  The Kigali-ville préfecture had a peculiar or a particular status, and I will have understood your question if it were in relation to Kigali-ville préfecture.  But, as far as this national committee is concerned, I never heard about it, and I am not able to give you any information on that committee. 
Q.	In 1993, did you hear that the RPF was accusing the préfet, Renzaho, before the government and -- or before a committee or a government and was requesting his dismissal? 
A.	I never followed the operations of the -- of the FP -- the RPF, because the RPF was not part of the government.  That the RPF requested Renzaho to be dismissed is not surprising, because the RPF requested the dismissal of several other officers.  But I must say that I never heard that the RPF made such a request to the government.  
Q.	And if I were to refresh your memory, Witness, would you be able to recall, because you said that you heard that the RPF requested a dismissal of other public officers? 
A.	The RPF accused several other public officers, just as other political parties could accuse public officers, but I am not aware that the RPF requested the government to dismiss Mr. Tharcisse Renzaho, because even we were not protected because the newspapers, the media houses, criticised us all over the place. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to show you a document which, unfortunately, is in French.  But once it is handed over to you, I am going to read some portions of it to you, and you tell the Court if that reflects the kind of criticisms that you said were brought against some public officers.  Do you agree on this manner of proceeding, Witness? 
A.	I do not want to say that this document should not be presented, but I must say that I am not a member of government to be able to comment on criticisms made to the state.  I prefer to make comments on ****************************************************************
MR. PRESIDENT:
	You want to show this witness a document now, isn't that your wish?  Can we then, please, place this document before the witness and move on?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, Mr. President. I just want to make sure that the foundations are properly laid so I can refer to it.  

	So, registry, I suggest that a copy of the documents that I have distributed be given to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	We have heard the witness's answer in relation to this document.  Do you have it in front of you now, Mr. Witness, yes or no?  
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I have the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, do you have a specific question in relation to any particular portion to this witness, Defence counsel? 
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, Mr. President.  I have a specific question that I want to put to the witness after I have read some portions, some short portions of the document to him.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
	What do you want to read?  Which page?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	I would like to begin with the first page, Mr. President. And then I will stop at the page concerning Mr. Renzaho, and then on to the page that draws conclusions, still on Mr. Renzaho.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Let's see whether this leads to anything.  You start with the front page, "Administration of a territorial nature" or the one with a date?  Just make sure that we can all have it in front of us.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Let me begin with the second page.  In fact, that is the page bearing a date 5th May 1993, "National commission for the assessment of public servants".  

	Witness, I am going to read to you very quickly a portion of this page, which is as follows:  "Kigali, 5th May 1993, His Excellency, the prime minister, Kigali.  Subject:  National administration", column: "Interim report, continuation and end."  Witness, are you with me?  
A.	I am with you, Counsel.  
Q.	In that letter it is said, "Your Excellency, the prime minister, I have the honour to forward to you 25 copies pursuant to the mandate entrusted to the national commission -- national committee for the assessment of public officers by the order of the prime minister, number 06/02 dated 6 July 1992 and extended by your letter, reference No 160/02.5 of 10th March 1993, the third interim report of this committee".  

	Witness, in order to not waste court time, let me move on to page 6.  And there I want to read you the following:  "1: Kigali-ville préfecture:  The RPF requests the resignation of Préfet Lieutenant Colonel Renzaho, Tharcisse, for reason of having organised the killings of people.  They further request, without giving a reason, the resignation of the bourgmestre of the Kacyiru commune, Mr. Nyilikwaya, Pierre Claver."

	Witness, let me stop at this point and let me ask you a question, if that portion I read was interpreted to you.  Do you want us to move on?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	So the name referred to here is the same name as number 203 on the spelling list, it seems?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	I believe so, Mr. President.  That is the bourgmestre of the Kacyiru commune.  It is, indeed, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	And what is the purpose now?  Why do you want the witness to be read this?  He has given a provisional answer previously about his knowledge of this.  I don't think he is disputing it; he didn't know of it.  What is the purpose?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, in fact, I want to enter this document into evidence, and I want to go through it with the witness, explore it with the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Witness, do you know this document?  Have you -- have you ever seen this before?  
THE WITNESS:
	This is the first time I am seeing this document, Mr. President, and there is nothing I can say about it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	So is this the right witness to choose for this exercise?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, I wanted to ask the witness a question which would have enabled us to enter this document, because he did say that public officers at the time were targets of some accusations, and I wanted to know whether these were the types of accusations that were made and which were brought before the committee.  That is what I wanted to do before I propose they be entered into evidence.  So I want to lay the foundation and then produce it, to be accepted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Is there more you want to read now from this page?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Yes, Mr. President.  Just the portion relating to the conclusion -- the conclusions of Mr. Renzaho.  That is the other portion that I would like to read from this document:   

	Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, I want to read to you very quickly an excerpt of the conclusions of this committee on the person of Mr. Renzaho; and that is on page 14 of this document.  And I am going to read only the first paragraph of that conclusion.  It says as follows:  "Conclusion:  In the complaints made -- in the complaints brought, none of them appear to justify a disciplinary dismissal because, since they work under the high authorities of the capital in other areas, the préfet, Renzaho, is obviously the authority -- the closest authority and the one who is most seen with regard to activities that are carried out in the city on a daily basis, but probably the least responsible for the complaints brought against him." 

	Let me stop there, Witness.  Tell the Court if that has been translated to you.  
A.	Yes, it has been translated.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Now, just one question on this document and I am not too sure if it will be admitted into evidence, but let me try nonetheless.  

	Do you think Mr. Renzaho is the kind of person whose character and behaviour you describe in your evidence in chief, and during the period prior to 1994, that this committee would have accepted or would have concluded that he should not be dismissed? 
A.	I have already told you that I do not recognised -- do not recognise this document, and therefore this document will not lead me to change my opinion on Renzaho.  You are telling me that this committee could have dismissed him or recommended his dismissal, but I don't agree with you because the ministry of the interior and the ministry of defence, who were the secteur ministries of Renzaho, were under the MRND.  You are saying that this committee should have recommended his dismissal or resignation.  But let me say that this committee did not recommend the dismissal of Nyilikwaya, the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, either.  You also tell me that he is the officer who is the least responsible of things that happened in Kigali.  But who would have been responsible, if not him?  And to summarise my thoughts, I say that I do not recognise this document.  And when *********************************, I was never informed about the establishment of this committee and its work with the authorities of the préfecture office.
MR. NEKUIE: 
	Mr. President, I shall refrain from requesting that this document be admitted into evidence, since there are certain areas that I want to explore with the witness, and those areas refer to his person.  I, therefore, request that we go into a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes, we will have to do that.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 54 to 67] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
