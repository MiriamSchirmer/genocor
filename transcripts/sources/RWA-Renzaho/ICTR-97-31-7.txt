EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, do you know who the préfet of Kigali-ville was in 1994? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	And who was it? 
A.	Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho. 
Q.	And did you know Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.  
Q.	How did you know him? 
A.	I knew him because one of his children was a classmate of mine.  And the school I attended was not far away from his residence. 
Q.	Well, I'd ask that you don't at this stage refer to the name of the school.  But can you tell us, if you will, the name of Colonel Renzaho's son that you knew?  
A.	François Regis Renzaho.  That was his name, 
MR. MOSES:  
That's number 161 on the master list, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber when you commenced attending the school at which -- that you were at in 1994? 
A.	I began to attend that school in academic year 1972-'73.  And I was in that very school in the next academic year, '73-'74.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
	'93-'94, rather.  So '92 to '93 and '93 to '94.  Correction from the interpreters.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, are you aware -- what period did François Regis attend that school?  
A.	He came to that school in the 1993-'94 academic year.  He came from another school.  
Q.	Thank you.  And just to assist us, are you aware what month of the year the '93-'94 school year would have commenced?  
A.	September 1993.  
Q.	And how would you describe your relationship with François Regis? 
A.	We were classmates, *****************************************************************.  And we belonged to the Scouts movement together, and we also played basketball together.  
Q.	Did you ever see him outside of school? 
A.	Yes.  I often saw him.  He often came to visit me at our home.  And from time to time, I would lend him my exercise books, which I would then subsequently collect from his home at Kanombe.
MR. MOSES:
	"Kanombe", Your Honours, is number 1 on the additional list.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.      What particular area of Kanombe did you visit when you visited his home?  
A.	Renzaho's house was in Kajagari neighbourhood in Kanombe.  When you leave Kanombe, you go down; and from the taxi park, there would be some 300 metres to that residence on the way to Mulindi.
MR. MOSES:
"Kajagari", Your Honours, is number 71 on the master list.  And I don't think "Mulindi" is, in fact, on either lists, Your Honours.  I understand it's spelled M-U-L-I-N-D-I.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you told us a little bit beforehand that François Regis had come from another school.  Do you know what school he'd come from to attend yours?  
A.	He came from the Kicukiro technical school.  
MR. MOSES:
	Kicukiro is number 88 on the master list, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.      And you say that he started in school with you in September 1993.  Are you able to assist the 
Trial Chamber in indicating how long it was after you had met him in September 1993 that you first ever visited his home?
A.	I believe that I went to his residence for the first time in November 1993. 
Q.	And when you first visited him at his home, are you aware of any of his family, or extended family, were staying in the home in Kanombe? 
A.	The first time I went there, his entire family was not yet settled at that residence.  François Regis lived with his cousin and a house help.  
Q.	Do you know the cousin's name? 
A.	The cousin's name is Mutesi. 
MR. MOSES:
	That's number 2, Your Honours, on the additional list.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.      Now, you say when you first visited there, that his -- not all his family were living at the home.  Did you                   
          subsequently become aware of other members of his family moving into the home in Kanombe? 
A.	In 1994, the entire family came to settle in Kanombe. 
Q.	Now, when you say "the entire family", what members of the family did you ever see there? 
A.	When I refer to the entire family, I'm talking about the mother and the children.  At that time, Renzaho's wife came to settle in Kanombe, and she worked in Kanombe.  
Q.	We'll start with the mother, if we can.  Where did she -- where did she work?  
A.	She was the manager of a drinks depot of the Bralirwa at Kajagari. 
Q.	How do you --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We need that again. 
MR. MOSES:
Yes, I think we do, 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Can you please repeat your answer, Witness?  
A.	Madam Renzaho sold drinks from Bralirwa wholesale, and she managed a depot, a drinks depot, at Kajagari.  And people came to buy drinks wholesale from her at Kajagari. 
Q.	Now, there's a name there which I'm going to have to get you to assist -- something like "Bralirwa"? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it the brewery, Mr. Witness?  "Bralirwa"?  
THE WITNESS:
I have said that she sold drinks from Bralirwa.  Bralirwa is a brewery, is a Rwandan brewery.  Bralirwa. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And that brewery is spelled B-R-A-L-I-R-W-A.  Thank you.
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, sir.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	How do you know that she managed that depot? 
A.	Regis showed it to me and told me that she was his mother.  By the way, I also had known that lady previously because we hail from the same préfecture.  And I even knew the house of her parents.  
Q.	And what préfecture is that? 
A.	Gitarama, préfecture at Shyogwe.
MR. MOSES:
"Gitarama" and "Shyogwe" is at number 194 on the master list.
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Now, do you know when it was exactly that his mother and other family members moved into the home in Kanombe?  
A.	I believe it was in 1994. 
Q.	Any particular month?  
A.	No.  I do not remember the month. 
Q.	Now, are you -- what other family members do you recall seeing at the home?  
A.	I remembered their driver, who drove a Daihatsu that was used to transport the drinks.  François Regis also had brothers and sisters whose names I do not know.  

When the entire family settled in Kanombe, I no longer visited them as often as I used to do when François Regis and his cousin were alone in the house. 
Q.	Now, did you and Francois Regis have any other friends at school? 
A.	As you would know, students often have groups of friends.  And so we had a group of friends. 
Q.	Do you remember the names of any of the friends that you and Francois Regis used to mix with?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us the names of any of those friends? 
A.	*********************************************
MR. MOSES:
Those are numbers 3 and 4 on the additional list, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you know where any or either or both of those people you've referred to live today? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	And can you tell us which country or city they're living in? 
A.	They are in Kigali in Rwanda. 
Q.	All right.  Now, on the occasions that you went to Francois Regis's home, did you ever see anything unusual taking place there?  
A.	Sometimes I would see the Interahamwe attire being dried outside, and within Renzaho's compound.  
Q.	When you say "the Interahamwe attire", can you be a little bit more descriptive?  What do you mean?  
A.	The Interahamwe had a uniform that was well known, and they would wear that uniform to their rallies.  This uniform was sewn in kitenge material, which was easily identifiable.  

Throughout Rwanda, the Interahamwe wore the same uniform.  
Q.	And approximately how many of these uniforms did you see hanging outside Renzaho's home?  
A.	Between 50 to 100 uniforms.  Some were dried on the ground while some were put on ropes, or hung on ropes. 
Q.	And apart from seeing Interahamwe uniform at the home -- I'm sorry.  If I can just go back to that.  What time period are we talking about that you saw this?  Was this before or after the family had moved in --  the rest of the family had moved in?  
A.	It was before the entire family moved into that house. 
Q.	And you've talked about the mother and brother -- brothers and sisters.  What about Mr. Renzaho,  Colonel Renzaho?  Do you know when he moved into the home? 
A.	When François Regis came to study in Kanombe, his father at that time lived in Kanombe.  But his wife and the other children were in Kiyovu.  But he was in Kanombe.  And I would see him in the morning going to work, and sometimes in the evening as he came back from work. 
Q.	All right.  Now, apart from seeing Interahamwe uniform at the home, did you ever see anything else that was somewhat out of the ordinary at the Renzaho home?  
A.	On one occasion, I had gone to collect my books, my exercise books, from Regis at his home.  And we found an Interahamwe bus parked at Renzaho's residence.  It was being said that the Interahamwe were on their way for training -- or to training at Mutara.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I didn't quite grasp exactly when Mr. Renzaho moved into the house.  Can you help us, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Renzaho moved into that residence -- well, what I said was that in September 1993, when that child came to attend our school, his father was already in Kanombe.  And the rest of the family only joined them subsequently.  

So in September 1993, Renzaho, his son, and the cousin Mutesi, as well as the house help, were already living in that home.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, do you know what -- you said it was an Interahamwe bus.  Do you know who owned the bus?  
A.	It was ONTRACOM buses that were used to transport the Interahamwe.  ONTRACOM is the national public transportation company.  It was a state corporation which still exists to this day. 
MR. MOSES: 
Number 159 on the master list, Your Honours.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, who was it that told you that the Interahamwe were going for some training?  
A.	It is Regis who explained this to me.  
Q.	Now, where was the bus in relation to the Renzaho home?  
A.	The bus was parked right in front of Renzaho's house on the road that leads to the main road going to Mulindi, just in front of Mr. Renzaho's house. 
Q.	Do you remember what time of day this was? 
A.	It was in the evening at around 5:30 p.m. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The day or month?  Can you help us with your observation of the bus, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I neither recall the date or the month, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was it before or after Christmas?  
THE WITNESS:
It was before Christmas.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So it was in '93?  
THE WITNESS:
That's right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Was it on the first occasion -- namely in September -- when you visited the house?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  It was subsequently.  I'd already started to visit in that home.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And on that occasion, did you -- were there any -- you say you were with Francois Regis.  Did you see any other members of the Renzaho family on the occasion that the Interahamwe were on the bus?  
A.	I did not see any other member of the Renzaho family that day.  
Q.	So his father wasn't present? 
A.	When Regis's father arrived at around 5:30 p.m., he was in a white Renault 21 vehicle.  When he arrived, the Interahamwe were already taking their seats in the bus.  He shook hands with -- or he waved at them with his hand and wished that they would undergo sound training.  The bus was about to set off. 
Q.	And when you first arrived, were those Interahamwe on the bus at that stage?  Or were they outside the bus?  
A.	By the time I arrived there, some of the Interahamwe were picking up their belongings to enter the bus. 
Q.	What belongings did you see them picking up?  
A.	They had sacks carrying grenades.  But some Interahamwe were also carrying guns. 
Q.	Now, in the course of visiting Renzaho's home, did you ever see any other important people who you had recognised visiting the home?  
A.	Yes.  There were important personalities of the MRND whom I often saw at his home.  
Q.	And can you remember the names of any of those people?  
A.	I remember one Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I remember Joseph Nzirorera, as well as Protais Zigiranyirazo. 
MR. MOSES: 
Those names, Your Honour, are numbers 132, 158 and 208 of the master list, respectively. 
BY MR. MOSES:  
Q.	Now, in respect to Mr. Ngirumpatse, had you ever seen him in person before the occasion that you saw him at Renzaho's home?
A.	Yes.  I'd already seen him before. 
Q.	Where had you seen him?  
A.	I'd seen him at the St. Michel cathedral where he was leading a choral group, which sang very well, in that cathedral.  I attended mass at that cathedral.  And whenever people were aware that that choral group would be singing, they would always enjoy listening to the songs of that choir in the church. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you recall about seeing Ngirumpatse at the Renzaho home on the occasion that you saw him there?  
A.	I remember that he came there once.  It was on a Sunday.  I was also at Renzaho's home.  I had gone to pick up my exercise books which I had lent to Regis.  When he arrived there, he asked Regis to go and wake up his father. 

Renzaho came, and Ngirumpatse told him the situation was not good because those wicked Inyenzi, Inkotanyi had exterminated their children.  
Q.	Now, can we try and place a time frame for this?  Was this before or after the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	It was long before Habyarimana's death.  
Q.	And was there any indication as to where the people had been killed by the Inyenzi? 
A.	He said that in Byumba, the Inyenzi, Inkotanyi had attacked and killed their children. 
MR. MOSES:
"Byumba", Your Honours, is number 29 on the master list.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Now, you've talked about Interahamwe, and you've talked about school.  Were there any members of your class at school who were involved in the Interahamwe, that you recall? 
A.	Yes.  There were some students who were schoolmates of mine who were quite influential within the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Are there any that you -- in particular that you recall?  
A.	Yes.  I remember certain names.  
Q.	Can you please tell us the names of those you recall?  
A.	For instance, there was one Lummumba.  There was another one called Emmanuel Habimana, who we nicknamed "Mwanda". 
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, those are numbers 5, 6 and 7 on the additional list.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And do you know how they became involved in the Interahamwe?  
A.	I don't know how those people joined the Interahamwe.  But more often people were hailed from Gisenyi or Ruhengeri, who were members of the MRND, and the youths who were hailed from that region were members of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	And what sort of activities would they do for the Interahamwe?  
A.	For instance, when there were MRND rallies, a bus will come to the school grounds to ferry Interahamwe students to the rally.  And in the evening after the rally, the bus will bring them back to school.  
Q.	Witness, have you ever heard of St. Juvénal's Day?
MR. MOSES:
And "St. Juvénal", Your Honour, is number 8 on the list, of the additional list.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I am aware of the St. Juvénal. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is a new element, isn't it?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, it is. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the conversation between Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Renzaho, did it take place in 1993 or 1994?  Do you remember?  
THE WITNESS:
I think it was in 1993.  This is what I remember exactly:  Renzaho's family had not set settled at Kanombe.  So there was only Renzaho, Regis's female cousin, and the domestic servant.  Otherwise, the wife and the other children had not yet moved.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, would anything special happen on St. Juvénal's Day at your school?  
A.	What I remember especially was that after the reception which was offered, Renzaho came and sensitised the students, explaining to them that Habyarimana was the father of the nation because he had organised the reception for us.  He said we were to become members of the Interahamwe.  He requested those who were already members of the Interahamwe to prepare the list for the other young persons who wanted to join the Interahamwe.  
Q.	We may be getting ahead of ourselves there.  Are you aware what day of the year St. Juvénal's Day was in 1993?  
A.	On the 3rd of May of each year.  It was not only 1993.  Every year on the 3rd of May is the St. Juvénal's Day, which is celebrated.  
Q.	And would anything special happen on that day in respect of the students at the school you were attending?  
A.	The only special happening was that the students were equally invited to attend that reception.  
Q.	And where was the reception?  
A.	The reception had taken place at Juvénal's home. 
Q.	Juvénal who?  
A.	That is the one who was the president of the Rwandan republic, Juvénal.  So the feast was at his home.  Because that was the day of his patron saint.
Q.	Now, you earlier -- and I've brought you back.  You earlier recounted details of words that you say were spoken by Renzaho.  Are you able to assist the Trial Chamber in placing a year?  What year was it that he made that request to students to make a list?  
A.	He spoke those words after the feast of the 3rd of May 1993.  So on the 3rd of May 1993, he came and sensitised our schoolmates, requesting them to join the Interahamwe, and telling them that Habyarimana was the father of the nation.  So we had to stand behind him because he was displaying his love to us.  
Q.	Do you know if any list -- pardon me -- was prepared of potential members for the Interahamwe?  
A.	On that day, the person who was our leader, Jean Lummumba, in French, the Interahamwe I talked to you about, prepared a lengthy list because many students had expressed an interest to join.  I also remember that Interahamwe Lummumba coming to us and asking us, "Are there others who want to join?"  

So Lummumba and the dean said they would forward the list to Renzaho.  I remember that many students asked that their names be placed on that list, but I cannot give you an exact number of those whose names were on the list.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, this name, Lummumba, are there three M's or two M's in that name?  
THE WITNESS:
Lummumba is with two M's.  L-U-M-M-U-M-B-A.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So that means that the spelling list is correct.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	All right.  Now, I just want you now to focus your attention, if I can, Witness, on the time period after the death of President Habyarimana.  Now, where were you when you learned of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I was in Gitarama at the time of President Habyarimana's death.  
Q.	And why were you there?  
A.	At the time of President Habyarimana's death, we were on our Easter vacation.  Personally, whenever we were on vacation, I would go to our family home in Gitarama.  
Q.	Now, did you ever -- you've talked about certain Interahamwe who were -- pardon me -- in your -- in your class.  And I think you referred to Lummumba and Emmanuel Habimana, alias Mwanda.  

Did you ever see either of those people after the death of President Habyarimana?  
A.	I saw Emmanuel Habimana, alias Mwanda, in Gitarama.  
Q.	And where did you see him?  
A.	I saw him at the Hotel Concord located along the Gitarama-Kibuye road about a kilometre from the town centre.  
Q.	And are you able to give us any approximate time period in relation to when you saw him?  How long after the death of President Habyarimana?  
A.	I can't quite remember the date, but I think it was towards the end of April.  But I'm not going to put a specific date to that meeting.  
Q.	And what did he tell you?  
A.	He told me the situation in Kigali was very dire because many Tutsi had been exterminated.  And he told me all my friends in Kanombe had been exterminated. 
Q.	Was he still a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  He was still a member of the Interahamwe.  Because even on that occasion, he was in a vehicle which he had looted, and he told me he was on his way to Kibuye. 
Q.	And did he describe to you any of his activities as an Interahamwe that had taken place in Kigali? 
A.	All what he told me was that after Habyarimana's death, Renzaho had gone to Camp Kanombe to see Ntabakuze.  He did not see him immediately.  And while he was organising the soldiers, Ntabakuze arrived and he took care of the Kanombe region, whereas Renzaho had deployed in other neighborhoods in Kigali.  

He also told me that Emmanuel, alias Mwanda, had gone to reinforce the teams killing Tutsi in Nyamirambo and Remera because he said there were many Tutsi in those neighbourhoods.  And he said were it not thanks to Ntabakuze and Renzaho, they would not have been able to exterminate all Tutsi.  

He continued by telling me that it was Renzaho and Ntabakuze who had organised the attack against the Tutsi in Kigali city.  
Q.	Did he indicate whether or not he had been armed when he took part in those attacks on the Tutsi?  
A.	Given Emmanuel Habimana, alias Mwanda, was an influential Interahamwe, he told me that on the night of the 6th to the 7th of April, Renzaho had distributed weapons to the Interahamwe chieftains in the various secteurs, but that the Interahamwe who received weapons were only the leaders in the various neighbourhoods of Kigali.  
Q.	All right.  Now, did you ever see Tharcisse -- Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho during the period of April to July 1994? 
A.	I saw him again in Gitarama town.  
Q.	Where was he?  
A.	I saw him at Gitarama, not far from a filling station in Gitarama town. 
Q.	And did you ever see his son, François Regis, during the period of April to July 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I saw him at the Gitarama market.  Because during that period, the government had set up in Gitarama.  So Regis's family had also come to settle in Gitarama.  
Q.	Now, you say you saw him in the market.  If I can just ask you to focus on the first time that you saw François Regis.  Are you able to assist the Trial Chamber in giving some sort of time frame, or time period, that it was that you first saw François Regis in the market? 
A.	You see, it is difficult to be specific as to dates after more than ten years.  But I remember that it was in the month of May.  It was in early May, but I cannot give you the specific date, I'm afraid. 
Q.	And do you recall, did you have any conversation with François Regis? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what -- do you recall anything that he told you on that occasion? 
A.	I recalled him telling me that his father had come to Gitarama to distribute weapons, that he would return to Kigali.  His father had returned to Kigali with a military truck, and had left his vehicle with him.  
Q.	When you say he left his vehicle with him, what vehicle are you talking about? 
A.	Renzaho let -- left him his Renault 21 vehicle, the white Renault 21 vehicle.  
Q.	Now, after that occasion which you placed, you thought, in early May 1994, did you see François Regis again?  
A.	I often went to the market.  And I saw him another time in the market, and on that occasion, which I would place at about two weeks after I had first met him there.  
Q.	And do you recall anything he told you on that occasion? 
A.	I recall him telling me that three days after we had met, his father had come back to Gitarama with weapons to be used in killing the Tutsi, because his father was angry that the inhabitants of Gitarama were not doing anything.  
Q.	Now, after July 1994, did you ever -- have you ever seen Tharcisse -- Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho after July 1994?  (Microphones overlapping) 
A.	I think I saw him again in the Congo. 
Q.	And have you had any contact with his son, François Regis, since July 1994?  
Q.	I did not see François Regis again after July 1994.  But I remember that he wrote to some of our friends while he was in Dar es Salaam.  And he asked them to convey his regards to me.  I once sent him a message via the Red Cross.  Those were the only contacts I had with him.  
Q.	And which friends had he written to where he had passed on comments for you?   
A.	There's one girl called Helene Umugwaneza, and another young man called Emmanuel Muhire. 
MR. MOSES: 
Number 9 on the additional list is the first name.  And the other name's already been referred to, Your Honour, number 4.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if you saw Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho today, do you think you'd be able to recognise him?  
A.	I think I will recognise him. 
Q.	All right.  What I'd like you to do now, please, is stand up where you are.  You can just stand up from where you are sitting, and look around the courtroom.  And advise the Trial Chamber if you can recognise --
A.	I can see him seated there behind -- and he's sporting glasses. 
Q.	All right.  Which -- if you can just stand up there, so we can clarify.  I think there's perhaps three rows -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How is he dressed, Mr. Witness?  What's the colour of his dress?  
THE WITNESS:
I cannot see very well.  But he is wearing glasses,  and he's bald, and he is seated next to a white lady, who is also wearing glasses.  And there is a white computer in front of him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is only one lady on that side of the courtroom with glasses, so identification has been carried out.  
MR. MOSES:  
Thank you, Witness.  Please, Witness, be seated.  
 
Your Honours, I have a few questions for closed session.  I can indicate to Your Honours, and Your Honours can pass on, I don't think I'll be more than five minutes in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Will you start in open or closed, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I have some questions of a personal nature to put to the witness.  And for this reason, maybe we should begin the cross-examination in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But that will also be relatively brief.  Is that so?  

I'm just trying to indicate to those in the public gallery when they can expect to come back.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I cannot say up front, Mr. President.  Maybe five, ten minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We will then go into closed session for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness XXY, we are now in open session, and we are continuing your cross-examination.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, you just told us that you were first interviewed at your own initiative in mid-December of the year 2000.  May I put it to you that the first time you were interviewed was the 11th and then again on the 12th and then on the 13th? 
A.	I told you that I signed the first statement on the 13th of December.  That was the date when I signed my statement.  That was not the date when I met with investigators for the first time.  Please stop laying any ambush on me.  I gave a difference between the date which I met the investigators and the date I signed my first statement.  
Q.	Can you give us the date when you first met with investigators of the international Tribunal? 
A.	It is the one you just gave.  They put questions to me on the 11th, the 12th, and on the 13th I signed the first statement.  
Q.	Tell me, sir, when you gave that first statement, did you take notes to help you jog your memories, or did you give the statement spontaneously, off the cuff, to investigators of the Tribunal? 
A.	I did not need to take any notes.  I was simply giving an account of the things I remember.  There was no need for me to take any notes.  For what purpose?  The people questioning me were investigators of the Tribunal based out of Remera.  I gave them an account of what I knew.  I did not need to take down any notes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need to break slightly earlier today, so we will move to the 11 o'clock break.  I assume that the cross-examination will continue, at any rate, until the lunch break?  Isn't that so?  
MR. CANTIER:
I think so, Mr. President, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The Court is adjourned to 11:30.  
(Court recessed from 1057H to 1137H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are a bit delayed because of the meeting I mentioned before lunch. 

Defence.  
MR. CANTIER:
Obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Witness, I was asking you whether when you gave your first statements to the investigators of the ICTR you relied solely on your memory.  
A.	Yes.  When I gave my statement, I gave the details which I remember.  
Q.	Do you have a diary? 
A.	Ever since I was very young, I have always kept a diary. 
Q.	That is even what you told investigators of the ICTR, I believe.  
A.	That's right; I told them that.  There was a date about which I was not certain, and I told them that I could check my diary.  You see, everybody has his own way of looking at things.  Everybody has particular events which he remembers, so when they put questions to me regarding the date of the incident I had mentioned, I told them that I would check my diary to get the exact date. 
Q.	Did investigators of the ICTR request from you the possibility of looking at that diary? 
A.	No, they did not make such a request to me.  They said if I could check the date on the diary and I were to give them the date.  
Q.	Do you still have that diary? 
A.	Do you need it, Counsel?  
Q.	I asked you whether you still have that diary, sir.  
A.	I don't think it is necessary for me to tell you whether or not I still have it or to tell you what I have and what I don't have.  You do not need to know what I have and what I do not have.  Is it necessary?  
Q.	Well, Witness, I asked you whether you are still in possession of that diary.  Kindly answer my question.  
A.	Whether I still have that diary or not is, I don't think, of interest and of assistance to the Chamber.  What I said was that at that time I had that diary and I was able to give the details relying on that diary.  I don't see why you would need my diary. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we are not yet there, Mr. Witness.  All we know -- want to know now is whether you still have your diary.  Is the answer yes or no, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I still have my diary at home.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Can you produce it? 
A.	Produce it for the benefit of who, Counsel?  
Q.	For the benefit of the Defence.  
A.	Is Defence counsel empowered to know my private life?  
Q.	Witness, we are talking about the events about which you have testified and which are of interest to me.  
A.	There are many aspects of detail in my diary, points of detail which I have been noting down ever since my childhood, so you, as Defence counsel, are not authorised to know all my secrets.  There are even things regarding my present life.  I think you are meddling, interfering, in my privacy.  You don't have the right.  You are not entitled and empowered to know everything about my life from my childhood till today. 
Q.	So I note that you do not want to produce that diary.  
A.	My diary is my personal property.  The content of my diary is not something which you are privy to, Counsel.  These are my personal secrets concerning my private life.  Happy and sad moments are all contained in my diary.  So if you want to read my diary, it means you want to know my private life. 
Q.	So do you confirm that the investigators did not ask for that diary from you? 
A.	I did not give them the diary.  I simply told them that I would go and cross-check that date, and I went and read in my diary and I came back and gave them the point of detail.  I did not give them my diary.  I cannot give anybody my diary because it contains details of my private life.  
Q.	Witness, what is of interest, and solely what is of interest, to us in your diary are the entries regarding the events about which you are testifying in this courtroom against Mr. Renzaho.  
A.	I think that you, as a lawyer, as an intellectual, you also have a diary.  And if you are keeping a diary you read as -- you write therein aspects of your private life.  You are not going to show that diary to just anybody.  So I don't see how I can give you my diary.  I cannot give it to anybody because it contains my personal secrets.  
Q.	Witness, here we are not just anybody.  We are the international criminal justice system.  
A.	I am aware of that. 
MR. CANTIER:
Well, Mr. President, let's move on, since the witness does not want to show his diary, which would have been essential of all the issues being discussed today in connection with his testimony.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, let me now put questions to you regarding your school attendance at (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That reference will be placed under seal, and the court video system is asked not to transmit that question. 

So the question was -- we now want to ask you questions about your school attendance.  Would you need to go into closed session to do that efficiently, or can you formulate your questions in a way which does not jeopardise the security of the witness, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER:
I'm sorry.  I do not have the reflex.  I want to look at his school attendance and his contacts with his friend, Jean François.  So, Mr. President, Your Honours, I think it would be wise and safe for us to move into a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will do that.  

It is a brief closed session.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are a protected witness, and will be referred to as Witness ALG in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth.  And the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
(Declaration made by Witness ALG in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you there, Mr. Witness, haven't you, with your personal details?  And you have signed it, isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  I have the document before me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sir, the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
The information is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And I see that your year of birth is 1957.  Could you just give us the date, please? 
 
THE WITNESS:
I neither remember the date nor the month, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fair enough.  The next exhibit number is then -- 
MR. MUSSA:
Your Honour, the next exhibit is P 67.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal.  Thank you, 
(Exhibit P. 67 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Melluish?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, rather regrettably, considering the amount of closed session that we've had today, I would ask that we go into closed session straight away.  I don't think it should take longer than an hour to deal with all those matters.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We will do that.

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us when the préfecture of Kigali-ville was created? 
A.	The legal instruments which set up Kigali-ville préfecture were enacted in June 1986 -- June 1990.  So, once we have such legal instruments in existence then the préfecture automatically exists. 
Q.	And before June 1990 had there been a préfecture in Kigali? 
A.	Before that time Kigali-ville préfecture did not exist, but that city was administered by what was known as the Nyarugenge open commune.  There was a Nyarugenge open commune which subsequently became the Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	And Nyarugenge urban -- 
A.	It was right into (unintelligible).
Q.	Nyarugenge urban commune was part of what préfecture? 
A.	The Nyarugenge urban commune was part of the Kigali préfecture and after the Kigali-ville préfecture was set up Kigali préfecture changed its name so as to make a distinction between it and Kigali-ville préfecture.  It became, then, known as the Kigali-rural préfecture.  So, before the Nyarugenge commune was part of the Kigali préfecture.  So, when the PVK was set up there were two préfectures now, PVK and the Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	And do you know why this change took place in June 1990? 
A.	Counsel, it was not in all the préfectures of the country that changes took place.  The change concerned only those two préfectures.  They wanted to set up a Kigali-ville préfecture which hitherto did not exist.  There were, initially, ten préfectures in Rwanda.  With the setting up of the PVK the number increased to eleven.  In my opinion it was because of the rapid development of that city, so, it was necessary to endow the capitol city of the country with specific administration because that capitol city had some peculiarities which made it different from other areas of the country. 
Q.	Who was the first préfet of Kigali-ville? 
A.	The first préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture was Lieutenant-Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho.  At the time he was a lieutenant-colonel. 
Q.	You may have mentioned this already today, but can you tell us, please, when he was appointed? 
A.	If I remember properly, he was appointed on the 5th of October 1990.  It was on that date that 
	Radio Rwanda announced his appointment. 
Q.	Who appointed him? 
A.	He was appointed personally by the president of the republic, Major General Juvénal Habyarimana. 
Q.	Do you know where he came from? 
A.	I think he came from Kibungo préfecture. 
Q.	Are you able to tell us what kind of a man he was, when he was appointed préfet?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Objection, Mr. President.  Mr. President I don't think we received prior notification of this line of question in the witness summary, and I'm surprised that my learned friend wants the witness to talk about Renzaho's personality and character at the time of his appointment.  So I'm praying that the Prosecutor not be allowed to go along such lines of questioning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that that would be incriminating?  It's just a description of someone's personality.  Unless you can specify further we would have to overrule that objection.
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like to draw the attention of the Bench to the fact that, firstly, in a question put to the witness, he mentioned that he clearly saw Mr. Renzaho only on two occasions.  Now, asking the witness to talk about Mr. Renzaho at the time of his appointment when we had not received prior notification about this in the witness summaries of testimony, the Defence thinks this is a new element which cannot be allowable at this time.  There is nothing incriminating about that.  If we received prior notification about that we would have allowed it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid we have to overrule that objection.  We will look at the weight afterwards and maybe this is even speculation, since the witness may not know him, but let us hear his testimony and the basis for his use.  

So, what is the answer, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  In order to better answer that question, given the interruption from Defence counsel, I would like Prosecution counsel to repeat her question so that I can answer it properly.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked you what kind of a man Renzaho is, if you can tell us, as of his appointment? 
A.	Counsel, what I can tell you is that he was a senior officer in the Rwandan army.  He was a lieutenant-colonel at that time. 
Q.	Do you know if he had any experience of running a préfecture at that time? 
A.	No, I don't think before that date he had ever been a préfet.  It was the first time I was hearing of a military préfet. 
Q.	Do you know why he was appointed préfet? 
A.	Counsel, perhaps your question would have been clearer.  I cannot know the reasons why he was appointed, but, subsequently, after the events which took place, I may have had an idea about the reasons for his appointment.  But as at the 5th of October, I did not know why he had been appointed.  Now, if you want me relying on what happened subsequently, then I can answer you. 
Q.	Do you know whether before his appointment Renzaho was a member of any political party?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence would like to reiterate its objection here, and now and the fundamental reason the Defence is proposing now, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that, firstly, the events being discussed fall out of the jurisdiction of your Tribunal.  I do not know why people are seeking to know the reasons for Mr. Renzaho's appointments in 1990 and why they want the witness to talk about those events in 1990, to state his reasons where he clearly states he could not know specifically because he did not know Mr. Renzaho at the time.  Those events fall out of the jurisdiction of your Tribunal, so the Defence submit this line of questioning cannot be allowed here and now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is simply a question of his knowledge as to whether he was a member of a political party, so that's part of the background or context.  It is not any incrimination, as such.  So the issue of the time span of the Tribunal does not really apply here.  This is a normal question which is very often asked in this Tribunal and there is no unfairness involved.  

Please answer the question, if you know, but you rightly avoided answering when you don't know, Mr. Witness, and please continue that line.  So, do you know?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I can answer that question, which is not at all difficult.  It is not difficult, because at the time, that is in 1990 in Rwanda, there was just one party, the MRND.  In the constitution of the Rwandan republic at the time, because the (unintelligible) of 1978, it was said that only one party was allowed in Rwanda, the MRND, and all Rwandans had to be members of that party, irrespective of their age.  So, Renzaho, as a Rwandan, was also a member of the MRND.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you.  And do you know whether after his appointment as préfet, Renzaho remained a member of the MRND? 
A.	Counsel, this is my answer.  Firstly, I would say that he remains a member of the MRND and he even became the MRND chairman for Kigali-ville préfecture.  At the time of the single-party system, when you were a préfet, then you were automatically the chairman of the MRND for that préfecture.  Similarly, a commune bourgmestre would ex-officio be the MRND chairman for that commune.  It was the same thing at all levels, even the minister was a party leader for his ministry.  It was said that those were the specialised services of the MRND party. 
Q.	You said that Renzaho, as préfet, was chairman of the MRND at préfecture level.  Was there a time when that situation changed? 
A.	Counsel, it is true that there were changes which occurred subsequently with the advent of the multiparty system in Rwanda.  It was in June 1991 that the new constitution was adopted, that was on the 18th of June 1991, and it was from that moment on that there was a separation between the state and political parties.  Political parties had their own representatives and that was different from what was happening under the single-party era. 
Q.	And in respect of Renzaho's position as the head -- the MRND chairman? 
A.	You certainly understand that even though the MRND had been a single-party, it also changed.  There were two eras, the era when the MRND was a single-party and then a new era.  Even the MRND changed its name, even though the abbreviation remained the same, the meaning was no longer the same.  Before the MRND means National Revolutionary Movement For Development but at the time of the multiparty system the MRND meant the National Republican Movement For Development and Renzaho was no longer the MRND chairman for the préfecture.  Someone else was appointed. 
Q.	Thank you.
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, I wonder if this would be an appropriate moment to break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I assume that Witness ALG will take the day tomorrow?  
MS. MELLUISH:
I think so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then is there any other witness for this week?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Unfortunately, the other witness that we had hoped to bring this week was reported to be unwell to travel last Friday, so no.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember the remark about extra witnesses in the beginning of the trial?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, indeed, that witness was considered to be the extra witness.  Things have gone a little faster.  We didn't think cross-examination would be as quick as it was this week.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is -- that is why you must prepare for this possibility.  So let us avoid this in the future.  

The estimated time for the cross-examination, do you know, Defence?  You will start tomorrow sometime, it is supposed to be lengthy?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Certainly, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So maybe it doesn't matter that there is a last witness for this week and everything went well at the end.  So, shall we then close for today, unless there are any administrative matters?  We will then start again tomorrow morning at 8:45.  The Court is adjourned 
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
