P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your examination-in-chief continues.  

Maître Cantier.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Just one remark, a preliminary remark:  We intend to have the Court listen to the recording that was presented by the Prosecution in -- in the earlier part of these proceedings.  In this courtroom, according to what I have heard, we do not have the technical means, appropriate technical means to listen to that recording.  Therefore, we will make do with whatever means are available; in other words, we would use our computer and the microphone.  I do not know what the outcome will be, but that is the only means available to us to have these recordings listened to. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's true that there is no video recording in this courtroom.  As to audio, I do not know the exact intricacies of the system, but as long as you have a procedure to propose, we can come back to it once the situation arises.  Thank you for informing us in advance of the fact that this will happen during this examination. 

And now the first question.
JEAN BAPTISTE BUTERA
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	So I will continue cross -- or, rather, examining you in-chief.  Yesterday, we were dealing with the duties you were performing in the post you occupied.  I believe you told us that did your specialisation studies in psychiatry in Moscow.  Could you tell the Court why you did your studies in Moscow? 
A.	First of all I studies medicine in Moscow, then I did specialisation, still in Moscow and Brussels, at the Catholic University of Louvain, but I went to Moscow in 1973. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are speaking too fast.  Every word has to be interpreted and transcribed.  So let us slow down all of us now.  Will you do that, please?  

Thank you. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  

So I will continue.  When I went to study in Moscow it was especially thanks to the results which I obtained in the course of my studies, but it was also due to the intervention of my godfather who, unfortunately, was murdered.  He was murdered together with almost the entire -- his entire family was murdered by Belgians.  Furthermore, it was thanks to him that I completed my primary studies and the first year of secondary school.  He was my instructor.  He was a Tutsi and he was like my second father.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's Wednesday today, Mr. Witness, and it's an early morning.  You are aware, aren't you?  
THE WITNESS: 
I will try, Mr. President, but this seldom happens to me.  

So I found myself in Moscow where I did my specialisation studies, then I returned to my home country to work there.  There are only a few survivors of my family, unfortunately.  But talking about this once more, that reminds me of the murder of my -- two of my brothers, one by militiamen, and the other one by RPF soldiers.  So is once more something that affects me this morning.  I apologise for that.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, where were you in October 1990? 
A.	In October 1990, I was in Remera in my house.  I was working at the psychiatric hospital, moreover, the only psychiatric hospital in Rwanda.  I was working there as a doctor, a medical doctor. 
Q.	Did you hear of the appointment of Mr. Renzaho as préfet of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Yes, I heard of it.  Moreover, I remember very well that on 1st October, we had a congress in Kibungo.  That is to say, that a few days thereafter he was appointed.  So I cannot but remember that. 
Q.	Witness, from a personal point of view, what did you ascribe Mr. Renzaho's appointment as préfet of the capital city? 
A.	First of all, it was a surprise, all the more so, as I'd told you, Renzaho was somebody who was devoted, competent, but very low profiled, very discreet.  He was very discreet because, as I underscored yesterday, in our committee of 24 people, there was also a soldier more senior than him, and sometimes he kept a low profile, at least in relation to that senior official.  I believe he was somebody very competent and we talked a great deal to him.  His appointment, in my opinion, seemed to be a recognition of his qualities of being discreet.  But, also, in that period, which was the beginning of the war, he was professionally competent.  And leading the capital or being the préfet of the capital city was a position much, much sought after and that could be the subject or object of much covetousness.  

There was also an ongoing project with respect to multi-parties.  Therefore, in my opinion, it was necessary to have someone who would be a reconciliator, somebody who would be able to manage a difficult situation. 
Q.	Witness, from what you were able to find out or what came to your knowledge, did Mr. Renzaho play an active role in the repression which took place when that war of 1990 broke out? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know but please permit me to say it.  I do not know whether the word "repression" was -- is the appropriate word.  I would say that there were mass arrests, many people were arrested, including even friends.  Friends were arrested.  They were taken to the Nyamirambo stadium, but I do not see any role that Préfet Renzaho would have played because they started from the night of the 4th to the 5th and he was appointed only on the 6th, the 6th of October.  So, I think the services involved were the army, the gendarmerie, and probably the intelligence services which carried out those arrests.  In my opinion, he caught the train on the move. 

What I can add -- I will try to go more slowly.  What I can add is that amongst those people there were some people who were taken out and allowed to go home.  Others were sent to jail because, at that very time, I, as a physician, we had a ward where we had psychiatric patients in prisons.  I mean patients who were aggressive and whom we could not keep in hospitals, so we had a ward in prison for such patients.  So, there were friends, there were people whom I met in -- or whom I saw in prison.  And amongst those people I was able to talk to some of them.  Sometimes we could bring them some medication, but which medication we hid.  But they were entitled, they were entitled to defence counsel.  They were entitled to legal assistance.  I even remember the arrival of Professor Reyntjens and other international legal experts; quite a number of them.  I can also mention amongst the defence counsel, Mr. Mbonamepka -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are giving very many details and are still talking too fast.  You just mentioned one name.  Can you help us with the spelling of the second name?  We know Mr. Reyntjens who is well known in this Court, R-E-Y-N-T-J-E-N-S.  But the other name, please, since you brought it up.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, the name is Mbonampeka, Stanislas.  He was in charge of the defence of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's just the spelling, Mr. Witness, can you help us, of that name?  
THE WITNESS: 
M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, can you tell the Court where you were on the 6th of April 1994, that is, on the evening of the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On the evening of the 6th of April 1994, I was at home.  But before giving any details whatsoever, I would also like to say that throughout the forenoon I worked -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness named a place where he worked.  We didn't get the name.  Please, we are sorry, if he could repeat it.  
THE WITNESS: 
So I worked with my collaborator and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Where did you work, can you repeat that slowly?  Whenever you refer to a name or a specific institution we need to slow down to make sure that we get it.  Every one in this Court knows Rwanda well, but we still may have a need to get it right.  Now, please repeat.  
THE WITNESS: 
So, in the morning, I worked at the national radio television station in Kigali.  I worked together with my collaborator -- or the collaborator in the AIDS programme.  I am only going to give his first name.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maybe we don't need that name.  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well, Mr. President.  

So he was the person who was in charge of documentation.  We were working on a film.  We were working on an AIDS film.  We completed the film.  That was in the afternoon.  Being the boss of the AIDS programme, we gave ourselves a free afternoon.  We took off the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This was an important project, wasn't it, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Very important project, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
THE WITNESS: 
It was a very important project, especially as it involved many sectors of national life.  The people of Kigali -- over 30 percent of the Kigali population was concerned.  In the rural areas, more than 
three percent of the people were involved.  

So, in the afternoon, as I told you, we had some rest and I went to have a drink with him at a bar that was well known by everyone in Kigali.  This bar was near Total.  And after that, my driver dropped me home.  I asked my driver to also drop him at his home.  I'd had a nap; I was resting.  It was a late nap.  

At about eight o'clock, 8:30, that is when I heard explosions.  My wife and my children were preparing food because the following day in the evening I had an appointment with my boss, the minister of health, who had to come and have dinner at home, so my wife was preparing food for the following day.  So that is when I heard gunshots.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Maître Cantier, you are certainly authorised to interrupt your witness if you get information that is not strictly necessary to your case.  Will you help us with that, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I will do that of course.  But sometimes we do not know whether words that are unnecessary do not herald words that would be necessary.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	In any case, Witness, as the President has suggested, remain focused on answers required by the questions I'm putting to you.  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	The announcement of the death of the president, did you hear it on that same evening? 
A.	Yes, I heard it on that same evening.  I heard it over the radio. 
Q.	What did you do in the days that followed?  Can you remind the Court of the place where you lived? 
A.	I lived in Remera 3.  I lived in Remera 3, right opposite the airport. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court what you were doing or what you did from the 7th of April and in the days that followed? 
A.	I did nothing because from that moment on it was impossible to return to work.  Already, there was a curfew that was decreed and nobody could leave their home any longer.  Of course except in cases of emergencies, for example, as concerned people working in hospitals and also cases of emergency relating to matters of national interests. 
Q.	Witness, did you receive in your home people who were seeking refuge? 
A.	Yes, I did.  Well, I did not receive them as such, but there were people who were fleeing from their areas because after the 7th, the following day in the morning, fighting started.  So there were -- there was shooting.  You could even see bullets flying.  So, I and my neighbour, my next door neighbour, were able to host up to 70 people, including women and children whom we took into our homes, while the men remained outside. 
Q.	Witness, were you able to stay in your home in Remera 3 or did you flee? 
A.	On the 8th in the afternoon, the fighting was getting close to our homes, therefore, we had to flee.  We fled with everyone in our homes. 
Q.	Where did you take refuge? 
A.	I fled -- well, fleeing towards the centre of town, centre of Kigali was impossible because from the 7th right up to the morning of the 8th you could not see anything.  All you saw were soldiers.  Soldiers came to my neighbour's home asking for money, because that soldier first of all came to house of the sister of my neighbour's wife, and that woman, in order to get rid of that soldier, sent him to her sister saying that it was her sister who had money.  So that soldier found himself in my neighbour's home.  We tried to put together money and we gave him money, but without opening the door to our home or homes. 
Q.	To go to Masaka, Witness?  
A.	Well, I thought that we could first go towards Kibungo.  We were hoping that that would be practical, that we could pass.  But when we arrived at Kilometre 15, we were told that it was impossible, that after Kabuga it was impossible to continue.  So I went to my friend's home at Masaka together with everyone who was with me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, now you speeded up too much again.  You referred to a place called Kabuga, K-A-B-U-G-A. 
THE WITNESS: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Masaka is number 32 on the spelling list, M-A S A-K-A. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, Mr. President, it seems to be number 33 on our spelling list.  Counsel said number 32.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are now referring to the spelling list which runs from number 1, starting with Asterie, to which number?  Number 37 ending with Emmanuel; is that the spelling list you now referred to?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I don't think so, Mr. President.  The name I mentioned, Kayonga from memory, I did not hear it being pronounced. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now we had a big translation issue.  We have one big spelling list, that's the one we have from the Prosecution which was carried over from the last session.  And then you have kindly provided us with more limited spelling lists and the interpreter in the English version drew our attention to the number you referred to was different from the version he has.  And I am only trying to find out exactly which list you are now referring to.  I did not refer to Kayonga.  There is lack of communication between the two of us.  Now, the list you referred to, do we agree that that contains 52 names and that the last name is PECO, P-E-C-O?  Are we on the same wavelength?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it is indeed with this list that I'm working.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very well.  And on that list, Masaka is number 32.  So far we have clarified this.  Shall we continue then?  

Do you have the one, Prosecution, containing 52 names?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All booths, do you have the one containing 52 names?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President, we do.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping) ... please.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, when did you leave Kigali? 
A.	I left Kigali on the 28th of April. 
Q.	During the period when you stayed in Kigali, did you move about? 
A.	I only moved about twice.  Once, first of all, to go and look for some food in my house, but that was very difficult.  Otherwise, I stayed there -- I stayed where I had found refuge, that is, in my friend's house.  I also went to Kanombe in the -- to the house of a family friend.  The husband of the woman had gone on mission and I had to go and pick up the family, the two daughters of the family.  We stayed together with the two girls because we were afraid. 
Q.	Witness, when you went out, at least on those two occasions, did you have to go pass a roadblock? 
A.	Yes, I went passed roadblocks but it was very difficult for me to do so.  First of all, there was a roadblock at the place known as Kilometre 15; there was another one at Kilometre 17; and yet another one at Kilometre 19.  I also came across roadblocks during the period when I was in Masaka, roadblocks between Bicumbi and Masaka.  Between those two points, I was attacked. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Bicumbi is number 33 on the spelling list.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, what was the situation at those roadblocks?  Who was manning them?  Who was present at the roadblocks? 
A.	At those roadblocks you had almost everything -- or everyone.  Now, with hindsight, there were young people, but not children.  There were no women.  There were adults; old people, no, but it was a mix of various types of people.  What, nevertheless, struck me is that all these people had or were wearing the president's medal.  That was very striking, because I also wore that medal during the period when the MRND party, the single party, was the only party.  Everyone was MRND party until 1991.  And during that period everyone had that medal.  I had it also.  But what struck me, indeed, was that there were members, activists of various parties, be it the MRND party, the MDR or the PSD, the PL, and other parties, they all wore the same medal or everybody -- they all wore medals.  Some of them wore Interahamwe uniforms, some wore the uniforms of other parties; there were also people without uniforms who wore their normal clothes, ordinary or plain clothes.  

On those roadblocks sometimes you had the impression that there were people who were calm and others who were more agitated.  That is what I can say with regard to those roadblocks. 
Q.	Did you see corpses near those roadblocks that you crossed, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I saw corpses only on one roadblock when I was going towards Masaka.  I asked the children not to look at the corpses.  But on the other roadblocks, I did not see any corpses.  However, as I said, I saw corpses at the Masaka roadblock.  At the roadblock where I was attacked -- 
Q.	Witness, please go more slowly, please.  
A.	I'm sorry.  I'm speaking out of emotion.  

So, at that roadblock, that is the roadblock between Masaka and Bicumbi -- one of the members of my party who lived in Masaka had asked me -- because I had a car, I had a vehicle -- had asked me to help him go and look for his brother who was threatened.  He had received a messenger (sic) who was telling him that his brother was hiding.  His brother was a teacher, but that the group that was looking for his brother was looking for him in order to take away his motorcycle.  His brother had a motorcycle.  So -- well, he thought that it was for his motorcycle that they wanted to kill him.  So I went with that person.  

Now, perhaps I would like to clarify another point, namely, that when I went to look for food at Remera in my house, together with other men, one of the people with whom I was, was killed by a soldier.  He was killed at a petrol station.  He was killed by a soldier that was drunk.  We were refueling our car or vehicle --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Again, how many details do we need?  Isn't the point where the people were killed; why they were killed; where the roadblocks were; isn't this what you really want, Maître?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, neither you nor me were present in Kigali during the events in question.  What the witness is telling us is what he experienced, what he lived through.  This last detail, in my opinion, is not unnecessary, because, Mr. President, Your Honours, that detail shows what the situation was, the unbelievable situation of anarchy or anarchie that prevailed in that country.  It is what the witness went through, and I believe this is what the Trial Chamber needs.  Therefore, in my opinion, this detail is not unnecessary.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I did not refer to that particular detail, of course; I referred to the general flow of the testimony.  But we certainly realise that the fact that a situation of chaos is described can well be relevant in this case.  That is for sure.  

Let us continue.  
THE WITNESS: 
With your leave, Mr. President, let me add that I was explaining how it is that when I was called to assist I could not do it all by myself.  

But after the person with whom I was killed, there was a major whom I knew very well, and he made available some soldiers with whom -- well, this is the point I wanted to clarify, Mr. President.  So the two soldiers were given to me by the major because he also was seeking to protect these people among whom there were Tutsis as well.  
BY  MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, why did you leave Kigali on the 28th of April? 
A.	Because things were getting too dangerous.  The fighting was coming closer to Masaka.  The RPF was closing in, and so we had to flee in the opposite direction.  We thought that since the government was in Gitarama, it might be best to go to Gitarama. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I am sorry that I have to revisit some details that you raised with a lot of pain, but let me say a short while ago you said that you were almost killed at a roadblock.  Please exercise some measure of self-control and attempt as best you can to tell the Court in a few words what happened on that occasion.  
A.	What happened is that when we were going to get that gentleman, we went through the roadblock. 
Q.	Now, Witness, could you be clear as to which roadblock you are talking about? 
A.	On the way from Bicumbi to Masaka, there are some sugar cane plantations.  And -- so we are going to pick up this gentleman on the other side of the sugar cane plantations.  When he saw me driving towards him, he came down and we picked him up and went back.  At that time, I was in the company of soldiers whom, as I said, was (sic) made available to me.  When we got to the roadblock -- he knew that we had come to fetch him.  So the people at the roadblock told me, "Doctor, we know you very well.  We respect you, but we are not going to let you go through with that person.  He will not go through."  So I asked them why.

	You see, I had worked as doctor at Ndera and I knew most of those people who came for treatment in our hospital, and most of them knew me very well.  They told me, "You can go through in the same manner as you went through the first time, but he is not going to go through this roadblock."  So I insisted, I said, "I have come to fetch him so that he can go back with me."  So I tried to negotiate my way through, as always, and to try to identify who was in charge of that roadblock.  There was someone whom -- who appeared to be senior and educated to me, so I tried to talk with that person without stepping out of the vehicle because I felt that there was some danger.  I called him but he did not come to my vehicle.

So one of the boys who was there, it might have been one of my -- militants of my party, he came close to me and said, "Doctor, things are not going to be that easy.  They will not let you drive through."  So I was wondering how this could be, so I told them, "Gentlemen, do you believe that you are doing a service?  Even if you believe that all of this is because our president has died, do you think that you are rendering service to him or to his party?"  Then the answer I got was verbal attacks.  The young man told me, "You are not going to go through.  Either you leave this man and proceed, or you don't go through."  So what did I have to do?  I was in a position of weakness.  A soldier was behind me but he couldn't do much.  These people were armed with spears, they had machetes, and so the gentleman told me maybe if we give them something to drink it might work.  And although we didn't have much money at the time, I said well, "How much?  What can we give them?"  And he said there are more than 30 in number -- indeed, there were several of them at that roadblock.  So I said, "1,000?"  He said, "No, that's not good enough."  So I proposed 3,000 francs.  And he went away waving the 3,000 francs in the air shouting that he is attempting to corrupt me.  And that was rather catastrophic.  

So the other person who didn't want to come close to me attempted to do so at that point but still told me that I wasn't going to be able to drive through.  So I said, "Is it because you believe that the president of your party has been killed that all of this should be okay?  You know me and you know who I am."  And -- 
Q.	Please, could you conclude, Witness?  Please, could you conclude? 
A.	So what happened is that the gentleman to whom I gave the money came back and told me that my bodyguard should give him his grenade, "And on that condition, we would let you drive through."  And we said, "No, the soldier does not have to surrender his weapon."  So I was wondering what to do.  And I asked him to give -- so he gave it away and so this person came towards me and whispered in my ear.  He said, "Doctor, I am going towards the roadblock.  I will kick it with one foot and as it slides off, please drive through quickly."  And that is what happened.  So when I started the car, what did the others do?  They threw their spears at us.  And what this other person did after I drove through was that he launched the grenade into the crowd and some people died.  My car was damaged, but we were able to save that individual and others died on that occasion.  That is what I can say. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In your response you mentioned that you had worked as a doctor at a particular location.  It sound like Ndera.  Was that the reference?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I talked about Ndera.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
N-D-E-R-A. Thank you.  

Next question.  
THE WITNESS: 
That was before 1991.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, did you hear any messages from Préfet Renzaho over the radio? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	What do you remember of those messages? 
A.	I remember that people were asked to remain in their homes, to be calm, to remain at home, and to be vigilant above everything else, and to avoid confusing or taking neighbours for soldiers who were attacking us.  What I heard, indeed, was a call for people to remain calm and to remain in their homes. 
Q.	Witness, how do you explain the fact that Mr. Renzaho remained in Kigali, particularly after the 12th of April when the government had fled? 
A.	The only possible explanation I can provide is that, first of all, he had the mandate and authority to exercise powers over the city of Kigali and, therefore, he could not abandon his own people who were being attacked from all angles.  I also believe that he was a person who could not abandon people who were in misery and suffering.  They needed someone to organise them and to organise the services that could still enjoy some measure of organisation.  

I also can provide some information that I gleaned through my personal consultations, whereby someone testified that in Kacyiru families that had been attacked over and over by the militia and Hutu families had tried to check these militia and had appealed to the préfecture for assistance, and they did get such assistance when the préfecture sent gendarmes to collect these people who had been under threat, both Tutsi and mixed families. 
Q.	Witness, you mentioned a name, Kacyiru, can you please spell that name?  I don't remember that you mentioned that name and I therefore don't have it on the list.  
A.	Kacyiru is spelt K-A-C-Y-I-R-U, Kacyiru. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When you heard Mr. Renzaho speak on the radio, was that between the 12th until the 28th of April, or was it later?  
THE WITNESS: 
It was earlier than that, around the 8th.  I don't remember the specific date, but it was right at the beginning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then you explained the possible reasons for him to stay in Kigali after the 12th.  Did you have any conversations with him in the period between the 12th and the 28th of April?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, not between those two dates.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Has he, at any subsequent stage, indicated that these were the reasons why he remained in conversations with you? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, later on he did, yes.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was going to broach those similar questions, but -- 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Witness, while you were in Kigali up to the 28th of April, did you have any opportunity to meet and talk with Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	Yes, I had that -- such an opportunity when I left the place at which I was on my way to Gitarama, I talked with him. 
Q.	Can you tell us the content of your discussions? 
A.	I had obtained authorisation to go about or to move about because at the time one could not travel without such an authorisation.  That is what enabled me to go through the roadblocks and that was not easy.  

When I arrived Kigali, I decided first to stop at the Kigali-ville préfecture.  It wasn't easy to go through, but although I had heard that some friends were there -- and I'm not going to mention their names -- I went to see him and to find out what had become of those people.  So we talked, we chatted before I continued on my way to Gitarama.  However, he warned me to be careful at the roadblocks because he did not have any control over the roadblock.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And this was when?  
THE WITNESS: 
On the 28th.  On the 28th, I went through his office before going to Gitarama.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, as far as you know, was it the PVK and Préfet Renzaho who ordered the population to mount the roadblocks? 
A.	I do not think so.  As I already said, I never saw a communal policeman or a gendarme in Remera, but the roadblocks were there.  Furthermore, let me say that the messages he broadcast over radio did not include any invitation for the population to set up roadblocks.  So I do not believe that he was responsible for the setting up of the roadblocks.  You see, even when I left my house to go down to Masaka, there was already a roadblock but I didn't see any policeman or gendarme. 
Q.	Witness, you have known Mr. Renzaho for several years.  You have worked with him.  You have talked about his personality to the Court.  Would you think that Mr. Renzaho, at the time the events occurred on the 6th of April in 1994, do you think that he could have become an extremist? 
A.	I have heard that word often, but it is vague to me.  Could you please clarify the meaning of that word?  
Q.	Witness, in the prevailing circumstances in Rwanda at the time, that would mean somebody who participated in the genocide.  
A.	Well, I knew and I know Mr. Renzaho very well and I think it will be far fetched to tag or label him as an extremist.  Now that I have understood what your question means, I do not think that, knowing him and knowing his family, he could have been labelled as such. 
Q.	Witness, my next series of questions in a moment will touch on you as a politician.  But, before that, let me ask you whether you had any special relations or links, you and Renzaho, whether you had any special links with the Interahamwe militia? 
A.	I do not think so.  I would like to say that -- and this I have already said -- the préfet of Kigali-ville was supposed to be someone who upheld neutrality as far -- or who was neutral as far as politics and political parties go.  So the préfet was supposed to be someone who would deal with political party rallies of any party, PECO, PSD, MDR or MRND, or youth wings.  Irrespective of the political party, this individual was expected to take neutral positions.  And if there was any indication whatsoever that he had special links with any youth wings -- and I didn't mention militia because at the time before the events there were youth wings -- if he had any links with such groups, he would have been dismissed.  And as I have already said, the position of préfet was one that was sought after and the prime minister at the time could have easily replaced somebody who was involved in that kind of activity.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a difference between the English and French version.  You, Maître Cantier, you did, indeed, ask the following question, didn't you: "As far as you know, did Mr. Renzaho have any special ties with the Interahamwe militia?"  That was your question, right?  
MR. CANTIER: 
That was my question, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good.  Now what we have in the English version could give the impression that the question was different and that the witness only answered half of your question, but, in fact, he answered exactly the question in French.  So now that is stated.

Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, while you were in Kigali, did you observe the communal police at work? 
A.	I saw a few of them, maybe walking around, but I didn't see them often.  Most of the time, I was in my office or I was driving.  And it is only when one got to the préfectural office that one would see communal police.  Maybe at the market as well, but not in town generally.  
Q.	Witness, were you politically active? 
A.	Yes, I was. 
Q.	Can you tell us again, as briefly as possible, your level of political activity? 
A.	Let me say up front that I stumbled into politics.  But thereafter, it became interesting to be involved in politics.  I was appointed by presidential order as member of the préfectural committee as a native of Kayonza commune.  And, as I'd explained, these appointments were made according to communes.  And I remained as a member of that committee to the time of the advent of political -- of multiparty politics.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Kayonza is number 31 on the list.  
THE WITNESS: 
So with the advent of multiparty politics -- and as I said yesterday, many members of our party moved to other parties, but some remained in what could be referred to as the new generation of the MRND.  Some went to the PSD.  I can mention a friend, who unfortunately is also dead, and who was the vice-president of the PSD.  Then we had people in the PL, and others in PECO. And when I left the committee, I also created my own political party.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Witness, that is what I was driving at, that is your political activities.  
A.	So I split, like others, and set up my own political party.  And our motto or our mission was to focus on environment and health.  So the motto was a healthy environment for a healthy population. 
MR. CANTIER: 
PECO is number 52, Mr. President, on the list, number 52.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court what PECO stands for? 
A.	It stands for Parti des ecologists rwandais, Rwandan Party of Ecologists. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This party, it split from which party, or you left which party?  
THE WITNESS: 
As I said, everybody was initially MRND until 1991.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I know that.  We all know the period of multipartyism.  What we are trying to get clearly now is whether this split or establishment of the new party took place in connection with 1991 and the advent of multipartyism or whether it happened later.  That's what we haven't yet clearly understood.  Can you help us, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  The party was formed by myself and other colleagues, doctors, veterinarians, jurists, and it was referred to as a small party of intellectuals.  It was indeed a party of intellectuals who didn't have any previous political or financial experience.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's only one word you haven't responded to.  When?  That's the point.  When did this happen?  
THE WITNESS: 
Oh, very well, November 1991.  

Can I proceed?  What I want to add is the following --
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	No, no, please hold on.  Is this in relation to the party you set up?  
A.	Yes.  One month after the party was created, the MRND government was expected to hand over to a multiparty government, involving the new parties that had just been created.  There were nine of them.  A government was set up on the basis of those nine parties.  And if I remember well, it was on the 
	30th of December 1991, and it was led by Mr. Nsanzimana, Silvestre. 
Q.	Can you spell the name, Witness, because the name is not in -- the name is not on our spelling list? 
A.	I spell Nsanzimana:  N-S-A-N-Z-I-M-A-N-A, Silvestre.  

In the preparation of the government's programme of activities, my party participated.  But, unfortunately, we were excluded on -- and that was on the decision of the president of the republic.  The reason for this exclusion is that at the time the multiparty government was being negotiated, divergences in views emerged.  These divergences emerged in the meeting that brought together the president of the republic and the nine political parties.  At the end of the said meeting, four parties, namely, the MDR, the PSD, the PL, and the PSR, left the meeting and refused to be part of the government for -- or, on the grounds that these four parties wanted the president to appoint just one candidate to be nominated by the opposition.  The other parties said no, arguing that according to the president's prerogative, several candidates had to be proposed to him and that it was up to the president to choose among the candidates proposed.  There was another point of disagreement, which I'm not going to mention here, but it was -- that other difference of opinion led the four parties to leave.  So, the five remaining parties, including mine, had as an assignment, the setting up of the government. 
Q.	Witness, I believe that is enough as detail.  

Witness, in your capacity as chairman of PECO, did you intervene in the negotiations, the Arusha negotiations? 
A.	No.  I did not have that opportunity.  I think I should remain humble, but what I know is that the said negotiations were very difficult, and the accords were signed on the 3rd of August 1993.  Personally, it was an honour for me, even if there were some bitterness.  I was in this -- I was in the congress -- this congress venue to sign the said accord or agreement, and I signed the code of conduct to govern the parties.  That code of conduct was annexed to the Arusha Peace Accords. 
Q.	Witness, did you see Mr. Renzaho in Gitarama? 
A.	Yes, once.  I remember that he was a member of the delegation of soldiers that accompanied 
	Minister Kouchner.  Minister Kouchner was visiting at the time when the country needed humanitarian aid. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
K-O-U-C-H-N-E-R.  Have you finished the sequence on the political party?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This party, Mr. Witness, for how long did it exist?  Was it also in existence in April '94?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, it existed until 6th April 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Having existed from its establishment until 1994, I understand it was a rather small party composed of liberal intellectuals.  Just to place it in a context, did it take position in the political spectrum of Rwanda?  Was it close to a liberal wing, a conservative wing, a Hutu power wing?  Where would you just place it so that we know a bit more about that party?  Very briefly, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  In answer to your question which is very complex, I would say that our party came into being under the conditions that you already know, and it was more in the centre.  So, as I said, it comprised intellectuals, educated people who did not have a political background.  None of our members had been a minister, a permanent secretary of a ministry; so these were intellectuals who said that they would be concerned with matters related to ecology.  So we were more liberal, in the central.  

I will give you an example.  We were the first -- the first party to, in February 1992, visit to the war -- visit the war displaced persons at Rwebare.  Those displaced persons were more than -- they were several thousands.  They had been driven from their homes by the RPF.  And my message over the radio was clear.  I condemned the war, and I appealed for an end to the war and for negotiations so that a political situation -- solution be found to the war.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, you referred to a name.  It sounded like Road bare, can you us please with the spelling?  
THE WITNESS: 
Rwebare, R-W-E-B-A-R-E. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So your party was an ecologist party, it was not involved in ethnicity issues.  That was irrelevant to your party?  
THE WITNESS: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Witness, following on that question relating to the party of which you were chairperson, well, you've -- was the genocide agenda part of the agenda of your party? 
A.	All the politicians with whom I had contact, because I had several or many contacts, there is also the fact that we were a centre party, so, in fact, we had relations with many people.  Nobody run away -- nobody ran away from us.  In fact, we were even desired by many parties.  So the contacts that I had with others, in those contacts, I never found any project or plan similar to what we saw in 1994.  

The example I can give you is that with the setting of the government, governed by the Arusha accords, the ministry of public health had to go to the RPF, that is, the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  Since I was a director of the national AIDS -- or national AIDS control programme which was a very important department for -- or programme for the country, a programme which was also very important in terms of means and resources -- we should not hide that.  Besides, that was an envied position.  I knew that the RPF, right from the next day, will compel me or I had to do so myself, but the RPF will compel me to resign.  That is why I had asked for a loan from the Rwandan development bank, the 
	Banque Rwandaise de Developpement which was headed by a friend, a friend whose name was Augustin.  Augustin was also -- also lost his life during the events.  

On the 6th of April, I had just been granted a loan to open my office, a loan of over 4 million.  This is to say that even amongst us -- even amongst us -- Mr. Augustin was a Tutsi, I was Hutu, but we were good friends, very good friends.  But before that he granted me a loan.  This is to say that everyone -- well, another point:  I and the minister of public health, knowing that the ministry of public health will be given to the RPF or aware that in the two years to come, given the elections that were coming up, that it was possible for that ministry to be given to another majority party or group of parties, we discussed and made provisions knowing -- or being aware of the existence of competent doctors who were treating people.  In agreement, a Tutsi doctor was appointed director of public health in the ministry.  That was given to the ministry -- or rather to the RPF.  This is what happened after my departure.  This is to show that we could not see the -- any genocide plan in the minds of the people we contacted.  I could also mention members of the MDR or PL political parties. 
Q.	I believe that is enough.  The example you have given is enough.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Yes, Witness, I just want to find out since you said your party was a central party, were there Tutsi doctors or veterinary surgeons in that party?

THE WITNESS: 
There was a surgeon who was not a Tutsi but Hutu, but there was a veterinary surgeon who was Tutsi.  There is also the person I mentioned to you, the person with whom I was at the radio.  He was Tutsi and he was in charge of information within our party.  He was in the information committee.  So I had Tutsi in -- Tutsis in my party.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How many members were there in your party, approximately?  And now we really want brief answers, approximate membership.  
THE WITNESS: 
About four thousand. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of this four thousand, do you have any idea as to the ethnic composition of those four thousand?  
THE WITNESS: 
I did not check the various ID cards of the members, but what I can tell you is that there were many, many Tutsis.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, we are getting to the end of your examination-in-chief.  Did you know the last residence of the Renzaho family? 
A.	Yes, I knew very well where they lived.  That was in Kanombe.  They lived opposite the military camp. 
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of visiting him? 
A.	Yes, I was in -- at his home, together with my family. 
Q.	Was it a big house with a big courtyard?  Do you remember what type of house it was? 
A.	Yes, it was a big house.  Of course, a house that was commensurate with his rank or status.  It was a villa which also had a garden, a normal garden.  It was about 15 acres.  I'm comparing it to my house which I had in Kigali which had about 20 acres -- 23. 
Q.	Did you by chance meet other politicians or Interahamwe militia at his residence? 
A.	No.  When I went to his home, it was a family visit.  I did not meet any other person there neither did I see any other one, apart from his security guard, his watchman.  Of course, I saw his children too; that is logical.  But there was no other person, as I said, apart from the security guard who opened the door to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In English -- in English, we have that it was a family visit.  In French we have that c'etait en famille.  Now, can you clarify the position, please?  Were you related to this person that you visited, 
Mr. Renzaho, by family bonds or was it simply a private visit?  

THE WITNESS: 
No, I do not have any family links with Mr. Renzaho.  When I said it was a private visit, what I mean is that I was -- I didn't visit him alone.  I was accompanied by my wife, so we visited him in -- as a family.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, I would like to have you listen to an excerpt of a tape record, an audio tape recording.  You will hear a conversation and, thereafter, I'm going to ask you just one question once you would have listened to the recording.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we are going to carry out a difficult exercise.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And before we start, there will be no need for interpretation now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Because you will simply play what we've heard on several occasions and what we have in the transcripts.  And the point is voice recognition, isn't it?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, it is in a language which the witness understands and speaks.  Therefore, he doesn't need interpretation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Neither do the transcripts.
MR. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, perhaps the record should reflect the number of the exhibit before it's played. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, can you help us with that, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
A moment's indulgence, Mr. President.  

The reference is KT001084. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, get ready to listen, please.  
(Audio recording played)
THE WITNESS:  
Can you play it all over, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we possibly do that, why don't you indicate your question, Maître, so that he knows what the question is going to be?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I just wanted to be faithful and transparent.  First I wanted him to listen and then I would ask him the question.  But, in any case, I will comply with the Court's wishes.  I do not want to be holier than the Pope.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, we think you behaved exactly as you should.  We are very pleased with the way you proceeded.  But since the witness now said, please play it again, I think maybe he should know what answer -- what question you are going to ask him before we really take a position as to whether there is a need to play it again.  

So what is now the question going to be?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, my question is simple.  You have heard -- you've heard that excerpt.  Do you recognise, among the persons who spoke, the voice of Mr. Renzaho?  Or do you wish -- if you did not hear well what you just listened to, do you wish to have the recording played again?  
A.	Counsel, I would like to listen to it again.  I'm trying to follow the message.  So, indeed, I would like to listen to it in order to be able to answer your question. 
Q.	Witness, yes, the message may be important, but in our context -- in our context it's not the message which is important.  My question is simply to know whether you recognise the voice of Mr. Renzaho in that conversation? 
A.	I did not recognise his voice, even if it -- even if I have not heard him for a long time.  But I did not hear his voice, which I'm familiar with.

Now, if you can have me listen to the recording again, I would be pleased -- I would be happy.  But even though I have not listened to him or heard him speak for a long time, I did not recognise or identify his voice in that recording.  
MR. CANTIER: 
As far as I'm concerned, I think that answer is sufficient.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether the counsel has entered his question, but there is a point relating to the exclusion from my party from the Nsanzimana government.  I would like to make a clarification concerning that point 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that something the Defence would like to solicit from the witness, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I'm sorry, my headset is broken down.  A moment's indulgence, please.  

So, I'm with you now, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness indicates that he would like to make an additional remark about the exclusion of his party from the Nsanzimana government.  I am asking, before he volunteers that information, whether this is something you solicit from the witness?
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I do not think that that piece of evidence is directly related to my case. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, I believe you've already given a satisfactory answer to my question and I thank you for that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Then I think we can let it rest with that.  Was that more or less the last question in examination-in-chief or is there a portion left?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I have concluded my examination-in-chief, Mr. President, and thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  What is the estimated duration of the cross-examination of this witness?  
MR. MELLUISH: 
An hour to an hour and a half, two hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness has been testifying for quite some time.  Instead of having our 11 o'clock break from 11:00, we think we will today start at 10:30.  And for administrative purposes, we need a slightly longer break than usual.  So we will resume at 11:15.

The Court is adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 1 to 21 by Gifty C. Harding)












(Court resumed at 1127H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The timetable needs to be reflected on for administrative reasons, the bench needs some days outside the courtroom these days.  So our suggestion would be to end at 12:45 this morning and not sit in the afternoon.  We will then resume tomorrow morning at 9:30.  

Cross-examination. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honours, I have distributed around the courtroom a number of documents, which I may or may not use during the course of the cross-examination.  So that is what you find before you. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Mr. Witness, most of the questions, if not all of the questions that I am going to ask you, don't require more than a yes or a no answer.  I don`t wish to stop you giving important additional information if you have it, but I just want to alert you to the fact at the beginning that it isn't always going to be necessary for you to give us long answers.  And your testimony will finish much sooner if you try to stick to a yes or a no where possible.  
	
	Now, you said in your evidence in-chief that you were a very good friend --
MS. MELLUISH: 
I thought that was slow.  I am sorry, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Still room for improvement. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said in your evidence in-chief that the Accused was a discreet man, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	He was a man with a low profile, you said, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I said that.  I said he was evenly effaced. 
Q.	I am not sure if I understood that last word; do you mean self-effacing? 
A.	Someone who is effaced is someone who rather likes to lie low, rather than be in the spotlight. 
Q.	Would you say that he's a quiet man? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Anti-social? 
A.	No, I would never say that.  I knew him very well, Madam Prosecutor.  I would never say that of him. 
Q.	You said you used to visit his house in Kanombe, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I visited him, but not ordinarily. 
Q.	How frequently would you say you visited Mr. Renzaho's house? 
A.	Twice. 
Q.	Did you ever call him at home on the telephone? 
A.	At home, no, but at work, yes. 
Q.	Now, this quiet, discreet man who liked to keep a low profile, he was the first préfet appointed to the new préfecture of Kigali, wasn't he? 
A.	That's correct.  He was a very professional man. 
Q.	But he had never been a préfet before, before October 1990, had he? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And, indeed, he wasn`t before his appointment as préfet a high-ranking administrator, was he? 
A.	No, except within the army, because he was a soldier.  But that`s a different hierarchy. 
Q.	He was a lieutenant colonel in the army, wasn't he, in 1990? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would you agree as of 5th October 1990 the new préfecture of Kigali-ville was the most important préfecture in the country? 
A.	The most important because it was in the capital city.  Paris, for example, compared to the other provinces, would enjoy the same status. 
Q.	So it was very important -- so it was very important, wasn't it, that the person given the office of préfet of Kigali-ville was a powerful leader? 
A.	Not necessarily, and I can explain.  It had to be someone working in a city where you had the president, ministers, so it was somebody who had to be in that position and not in other people's positions. 
Q.	Now, you knew Renzaho from Kibungo, didn't you? 
A.	He is a native of our préfecture, and our communes are neighbouring communes.  Furthermore, there are only a few senior staff from those communes working in Kigali or elsewhere.  So it was only normal for Dr. Butera, the only doctor chairman of a party, to know the lieutenant colonel of a neighbouring commune. 
Q.	Now, in Kibungo, when Renhazo was there, he was well-known as the protégé of Colonel Rwagafilita?
MS. MELLUISH: 
Which is on the spelling list, number 15.
THE WITNESS:
Madam Prosecutor, that expression would not be exactly correct, because to say that a lieutenant colonel of the army is a protégé of another colonel would be incorrect.
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Well, after Colonel Rwagafilita retired, Renhazo was the senior officer in Kibungo, wasn't he? 
A.	No, there were others. 
Q.	And Renzaho was an expert in urban guerilla warfare, wasn't he? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I did not see his certificates in that regard. 
Q.	Well, it makes sense, doesn't it, to appoint such a man to the préfet -- to the préfecture of Kigali in October 1990, doesn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, you talked about the round up of Tutsi that occurred in October 1990, that was what could be described as repression, wasn't it? 
A.	I would say that these were arrests and not persecution.  As I said to the Court before, Mr. President, Madam Prosecutor, I knew some of these people who were even my friends. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you saying that it wasn't a repression or a crack down?  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, let me tell you that it wasn't only Tutsis who were involved, Hutus as well. 
Q.	Do you recall the statement you made for the Accused's defence on the 5th of April this year? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Because in that statement you described what happened in 1990 as la repression.  So was it or was it not repression? 
A.	There were arrests, I would say.  I will make a correction, there were arrests.
Q.	They were arrests of people described as accomplices, weren't they? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And people who were described as accomplices in October 1990 were Tutsis, weren't they? 
A.	But, Madam Prosecutor, you forget to mention that they were considered to be accomplices of those who were attacking Rwanda.  I think that is an important significant detail.  And among these accomplices there were Hutus and Tutsis.  And, as I told you previously, I met some of them. 
Q.	Those who were attacking Rwanda were the RPF, weren't they? 
A.	Yes, alongside Ugandan soldiers or elements. 
Q.	And on the whole the RPF were Tutsi, weren't they? 
A.	Probably, but not only Tutsi. 
Q.	Do you accept that many, if not all, of those arrested in October 1990 were arrested arbitrarily? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  It is true that people were arrested unjustly. 
Q.	That sounds like repression, doesn't it, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, let me revisit that term again, which I think we need to clarify.  There is a distinction to be made between repression and arrests. 
Q.	Were these people given fair trials? 
A.	Well, I don't know what to say, but all I am aware of is that they had counsel or lawyers defending them, and we already mentioned Mr. Mbonampeka, and we can also talk about Félicien Ngango and others.  So I believe that the trials were fair.  Maybe some were not, but I am not in a position to say because I am not a lawyer. 
Q.	Those people that --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You now mentioned two names, Mr. Witness, shall we take them one by one?  

THE WITNESS:
Mbonampeka.  And I also mentioned Ngango, Félicien, who unfortunately is also dead. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you agree that that is M-B--O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A (sic) for the last name?  
THE WITNESS:
N-G-A-N-G-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please listen to my question.  I am now spelling Mbonampeka, not the other name. 
THE WITNESS:
M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Easy.  And now the other last name, please.  Spelling?  
THE WITNESS:
N-G-A-N-G-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And there the first name was?  
THE WITNESS:
Félicien. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which is easy.  Please proceed. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Those people that you have mentioned who acted as, you said, as defence counsel, they were volunteers, weren't they? 
A.	Volunteers or counsel, they acted as lawyers in defence of their clients. 
Q.	And they are persecuted for it, weren't they? 
A.	What I know is they were not well perceived. 
Q.	And wasn't there an international outcry by human rights groups that resulted eventually in the release of many of those who were arrested in October 1990? 
A.	Yes, that has already been my testimony.  I said that Reyntjens was there.  I happen to know him.  And I am aware that other human rights organisations were also active in that matter.  That is correct. 
Q.	So it's simply not true to say these people were given access to justice and fair trials as a result of their arrests, is it? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, please kindly repeat your question?  
Q.	Well, you said earlier, that those who were arrested were entitled to defence.  You agreed with me that they were given the opportunity to be fairly tried on the basis of what they were alleged to have done, and I'm suggesting to you that that simply isn't true, yes or no? 

MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the witness answered the question, and he was very specific in his answer.  Now they're trying to put words into his mouth, different from what he has said, and with which the Prosecutor is not comfortable.  So I object to that on the grounds that the question has already been asked and answered. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are free to use the words you like, Mr. Witness.  But a proposition is being put to you, and it is stated that these trials were simply not fair; do you agree or disagree with that proposition?  
THE WITNESS:
	I disagree with that proposition. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, you said earlier this morning that the Accused was not involved in organising those arrests, didn't you? 
A.	It was my assertion that as préfet it would appear to me that he was not involved.  I experienced what happened in the night of the 4th to the 5th.  Bullets dropped in my home.  I think it was the army, the gendarmerie and the intelligent services that he was coordinating.  I do not see what other role he could have played as a newly appointed préfet, particularly given that the arrests were also carried out in other préfectures and other regions, not only in Kigali. 
Q.	That isn't enough, is it, Mr. Witness, to assert that he had no involvement? 
A.	Well, you have asked me whether he was involved, and what I have told you is at that time those who were arrested were presumed to be accomplices of the army that had attacked Rwanda on the 
	1st of October.  So I do not think that this was the business for one préfet, and there are other préfectures, not only Kigali.  You see, there were many people who unfortunately were arrested in Kigali, some of whom were innocent.  And I believe that the judiciary did its work. 
Q.	You said yourself this morning that Renzaho -- Renzaho caught the train on the move in respect of these arrests; that means, doesn't it, that he was involved? 
A.	When I say "to catch the train on the move", it's because there had been arrests in Kigali town and the newly appointed préfet was supposed to take an interest, I presume, in that file.  And it is my presumption that is what he did, because it is a matter that related to the inhabitants of his city. 
Q.	He didn't oppose the arrests, did he? 
A.	How could that be when it was already done?   
Q.	Do you not recall the criticism that Renzaho received for his involvement in the sale of the property of the Tutsi who had to flee as a result of the repression? 
A.	I heard about that, but I do not know whether it was Renzaho, the individual, who was involved or whether it was the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  So I think there was property that was sold and this may have been property that should have been sold to pay off some bank loans.  My house, for example, was sold to pay off a bank loan, although I was not in Kigali. 
Q.	Now, you told the Court this morning that on the 6th of April your wife was preparing food for a dinner on the 7th when the minister of health was due to come to your house, that`s right, isn't it?  
A.	Expected to come to my house, that is correct. 
Q.	The minister of health at the time was a man called Casimir Bizimungu, is that right? 
A.	Yes, Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, that's correct. 
Q.	He is currently standing trial at this Tribunal for his participation in the genocide? 
A.	I am aware of that. 
Q.	Now on the 8th of April you left your home in Remera, didn`t you, to go to Masaka? 
A.	I was going to Kibungo, but I was forced to change my itinerary halfway through. 
Q.	Well, you spent the period from the 8th of April to the 28th of April in Masaka, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And Masaka, if I'm not mistaken, is in the préfecture of Kigali-rural, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	During those 20 days that you were at Masaka, you were with about 70 others, weren't you? 
A.	Yes, except that some people, for lack of food, had to return to their homes or to seek refuge elsewhere, maybe in Gitarama.  But there were about 40 who remained there until the end. 
Q.	And you said, didn't you, that a major assisted you by giving you soldiers for protection, isn't that right? 
A.	Two soldiers., after he had witnessed someone shoot one of us. 
Q.	So soldiers were available for the protection of a group of, say, 40 people such as yours? 
A.	70 people initially. 
Q.	Now, you said that the reason you went, or you tried to go to Kibungo rather than the centre of Kigali, was because it was simply impossible to go towards the centre of town on the 7th or 8th of April, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct, Madam. 
Q.	The reason you said it was impossible was because there were soldiers everywhere, is that right? 
A.	First of all, there were roadblocks at which you could find militia.  But there were also soldiers, soldiers of the RPF and the Rwandan army fighting each other.  So, on the one hand, there were the soldiers who left the CND.  So there was one group of RPF soldiers, on the one hand, and then there is the Kanombe camp, on the other, which is a big military camp.  So everything around the airport was in fact an area of great danger.  It would have been dangerous to venture into that zone. 
Q.	And as far as you know, because from what you have said you didn't make that journey.  But as far as you know between Kanombe camp and the centre of Kigali, there were other roadblocks -- more roadblocks? 
A.	There were -- there were some. 
Q.	And that would have been true, wouldn't it, not just on the 7th or 8th April but on the 9th or the 10th or 20th April, wouldn't it? 
A.	No, I, I -- I don't think the situation was that on the 6th.  Because I went to work on the 6th.  There was no roadblock on the 6th, Madam Prosecutor.
Q.	I think perhaps you misunderstood my question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In French the question included the 6th, but English started with the 7th.  So the question is simply from the 7th onwards, Mr. Witness.  

Do you agree that there would have been roadblocks also on the 7th, the 8th, the 9th, the 10th and the 20th?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were roadblocks; that's correct. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And it's right, isn't it, that the principal difficulty that confronted people at roadblocks was that if they wore a Tutsi identity card, or the appearance of being Tutsi, they were in danger of being killed? 
A.	That's correct, but I would add the following:  Sometimes if one did not have an ID card, if you did not have an ID card you could be allowed to pass if you were not known, or if your attitude towards the situation that prevailed was known. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What you said in the original language was, Mr. Witness, was you could be allowed to pass if you were known, isn't that so?
THE WITNESS:
With respect to what I said. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And this is what happened to you, isn't it, when you had that difficulty at a roadblock you described in Masaka when you took -- you had been asked to help a friend to cross that roadblock, it wasn't you that was in trouble there, was it? 
A.	When I was crossing the roadblock I was not the one who had problems.  It is because I had someone with me.  I will also explain the following: I was unfortunate, or perhaps I was lucky or unlucky, that during the three months of the tragic events that happened in that country of Rwanda I was without an ID card.  I did not have an ID card.  Why?  It is because, as I have already said this morning, I have taken a bank loan and on the 6th I asked my accountant at PNLS to go and look for statements relating to our loan.  So I stayed for three months without an ID card.  I will explain later on. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you now refer to something called PNLS? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I talked of PNLS.  This is the national program for the fight against AIDS.  PNLS is an acronym. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
P-N-L-S?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	I would like you, please, to clarify some confusion I have about your testimony this morning.  I recall that you said initially that between the 8th and the 20th of April when you were in Masaka you only moved about twice, firstly, to go and look for food, which was very difficult, and, secondly, when you went to visit a friend in Kanombe, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Later you were asked whether you had any conversation with the Accused during that period and you said:  No.  Do you recall that? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel.  But I can explain why, because when I went to Kanombe, the purpose was not to seek Renzaho or to go to Renzaho's house.  It was for going to visit a friendly family because the husband or the man of that family was not in, and the wife of that house had problems.  She was afraid for her daughters. 
Q.	Yes, I understand that, Mr. Witness.  What I am concerned about is that you then went on to say that in fact you had seen Mr. Renzaho during the course of that period.  Do you -- 
A.	No, I did not see him.  I did not see him. 
Q.	You said you went to the préfecture office, didn`t you? 
A.	That was on the 28th of April. 
Q.	So it is right that between the 8th and 28th of April you did move around more than twice? 
A.	Before the 28th I went out only twice, as I told you, and the third time was when I was going to Gitarama, when I was going to Gitarama towards Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And in this period you did not see Mr. Renzaho during those two occasions when you went out nor did he visit you.  You didn't see him.  It was only on the 28th that you saw him.  Is this the evidence?   
THE WITNESS:
That's right, Mr. President. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So why is it, Mr. Witness, that in your statement of 5th of April 2007 you said:  "I was able to realise it or to notice it" -- in reference to Renzaho's authority over Interahamwe: "I was able to notice it when I went to Kigali and I spoke to him." 
A.	When I was going to Gitarama. 
Q.	You didn't see Renzaho more than on that one occasion and yet you say he had no authority over the Interahamwe, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before we do that, these shifts between languages makes life difficult.  Could you now read that portion of the statement in French slowly, so that we have a complete authorised interpretation of what he said in his statement?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Certainly.  Okay, I will read the full passage just to make it clear what the reference is to the militia:  He was not. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel continue, please?  
BY MS. MELLUISH: 
Q.	He was not considered as an extremist.  He was not at all close to the militias over whom he clearly had no authority.  I was able to notice this when I had to travel to Kigali, when I had to go to Kigali, and I spoke to him."
A.       Counsel, I do not see where the confusion arises, I believe everything is clear. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the basis for that statement in your written declaration is your sighting of Mr. Renzaho on the 
28th of April?   
THE WITNESS:
That's entirely correct. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Do you recall what time of day you went to the préfecture office on the 28th of April? 
A.	It was around midday, 2 p.m., because to cross from Masaka to Kigali going past roadblocks, as I said, was not an easy task. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
I wonder if the Exhibit P. 28 (sic) could be shown to the witness?   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time did you spend at the préfecture office on that day, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
It wasn't long, I was not there for long, I can't remember how much time I spent there exactly, it must have been between 20 and 30 minutes, but not more than that because I had to go to Gitarama and that should also be borne in mind. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Can you move while we are waiting for that Prosecution exhibit, please. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Certainly. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You didn't have any trouble finding the préfet on the 28th of April, did you? 
A.	Difficulties?  No, I wouldn't say so, because I went to the roadblock and I had to wait.  I had to wait nevertheless. 
Q.	No, but I`m talking about at the préfecture office, when you got to the préfecture office you were admitted and able to see the préfet without trouble, is that right? 
A.	To say without trouble or difficulties, that would not be accurate, because as I noticed, it was very busy, he didn't have much time and there were many people. 
Q.	And you were able to get a laissez-passer from Renzaho himself, is that right? 
A.	No, I had my laissez-passer, which I had obtained in Kanombe and not in Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Perhaps I misunderstood your evidence earlier, but I thought the reason for gong to PVK on that day was to obtain some sort of travel document, so you could leave for Gitarama, is that not correct?  So what was your reason for gong there? 
A.	My visit to PVK was, first of all, to greet the préfet and to have an idea of what was happening because I was in a remote area where I was kind of cut off, so to speak, and I went to the PVK to find out what was happening, because I knew that I also had to go to Gitarama. 
Q.	Just have a look at that document that has been placed in front of you, Mr. Witness.  I believe you read English, is that correct? 
A.	I read English, but my English is not that good.  I'm sorry. 
Q.	Well, firstly, Mr. Witness, this document is a memo. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Sorry, perhaps --
MR. CANTIER: 
Is this document one of those that you disclosed to us a short while ago?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, it is the Prosecution Exhibit number 29. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
29 or 28?   
MS. MELLUISH: 
My records show it is 29.  The K number at the top right-hand corner ends in 975. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You asked for P. 28 to be given to the witness, according to the transcripts, or P. 29.  What I have in the English version is P. 28.  What do you have there, P. 28 or 29?
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 29.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excellent, so that is only a typing error.  Does that clarify the matter for Defence?  We are referring to 
P. 28.  Do you have it in front of you?  

MS. MELLUISH: 
No, it is P. 29. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let's ask the first question now. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	That document is dated, isn't it, 28th April 1994, do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see it bears that date. 
Q.	And the subject heading is:  "Meeting between Col.  Yaache and Col. Renhazo, préfet Kigali-ville district."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can follow. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I suppose this is Y-A-A-C-H-E. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Now, below that it says:  "The above mentioned meeting was held between 1130 hours and 
	1400 hours."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I have read that.  I can follow you. 
Q.	Then it goes on to repeat those who were present at the meeting, doesn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So it's simply not possible that you went to see the préfet whilst he was involved in a meeting with Colonel Yaache, is it? 
A.	But if you remember what I told you, this was within the period of 12:00 and 2 p.m., and it was after the meeting that I saw him. 
Q.	You recall this meeting, do you? 
A.	I did not attend the meeting. 
Q.	It is just that I got the impression from the evidence you gave a moment ago that when you found the préfet at the préfecture office he was busy dealing with lots of people who were coming to seek his attention; isn't that what you said? 
A.	No, not at all.  No, that is not what I said.  You asked me the time frame and I said it was from noon to 
	2 p.m..  But as soon as he ended his meeting, that is when I saw him, and that did not last long since I had to go to Gitarama. 
Q.	If you look further down in this document --
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- at paragraph numbered 4, you will see that it says:  "Colonel Renhazo replied that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerating somewhat in this report.  He indicated he was in charge" --  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Not so fast when we read.  Start again. 

BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	"Colonel Renzaho replied that the ICRC was perhaps exaggerating somewhat in this report.  He indicated that he was in charge of forces within his area.  He indicated that due to a lack of trust in UNAMIR, neighbourhood militias had formed to protect themselves from the RPF and that they were defending their neighbourhoods in concert with the overall aims of the government."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I am with you, Counsel. 
Q.	That reflects what, to a member of UNAMIR, Colonel Renzaho was saying on the 28th April 1994.  You maintain, do you, that on that one visit of yours to the préfecture office you were able to assert that Renzaho had no authority or links to the Interahamwe at all, is that right? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that, because at roadblocks there were places where all authorities -- any authority would have had difficulties in order to cross. 
Q.	Do you agree from what I have just read you from that report, Renzaho was asserting that the militia were acting in accordance with the government's orders or aims? 
A.	Counsel, I could ask you whether this report has been countersigned by Mr. Renzaho.  I believe it is a report prepared by someone of UNAMIR.  UNAMIR had just abandoned the people of Rwanda by withdrawing the Belgian contingent.  

Therefore, if I say that Renzaho had signed this report I would have nothing to add.  But I believe that this is a report of someone of UNAMIR to his boss, because if UNAMIR had remained and if they had interposed themselves between the belligerents, I believe neither my friends nor members of my family would have died. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you finished with the document?   
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, according to the text here the meeting was held between 1130 and 1400 hours.  That`s what we read here. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And your meeting or visit to the PVK was between midday and two o'clock.
THE WITNESS:
That is what I said.  But it was after the meeting ended that I saw Mr. Renzaho. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you observed this meeting?   

THE WITNESS:
No, no, not at all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, when you say it was after the meeting ended, it is as if you have information that there was in fact such a meeting, whereas what we heard you say previously was that he was busy.  But were you in fact aware of him being in a meeting with Colonel Yaache and other persons?  Did you observe that?   
THE WITNESS:
I was not aware of it, I did not know that.  

Mr. President, what I said is that I was - or, rather, I did not know who was in the meeting.  When I arrived his secretary asked me to wait until the end. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The end of what?   
THE WITNESS:
The end of his meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the secretary informed you that he was in a meeting?   
THE WITNESS:
That he was busy, busy. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He was busy, but there was no reference to a meeting. 
THE WITNESS:
No, no.  Mr. President.  I was in charge of the AIDS program, when I gave orders to my secretary that -- when I told my secretary that I was busy, I was busy.  So I was told that he was busy and that I had to be patient. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that is a virtue for all of us.  You have clarified.  Thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said this morning that you heard Renzaho talking on the radio, and that he was always calling for calm and asking for people to stay at their homes.  As far as you recall, you never heard him calling for acts of violence to be committed, is that right? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	And you would say, wouldn't you, that would be most unlike the Renzaho that you knew? 
A.	I did not quite understand the meaning of the question. 
Q.	You've told us that in your opinion Renzaho was appointed préfet because of his neutrality, because he was likely to be an appeaser amongst opposing political groups, isn't that right? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	So, in your opinion, Renzaho was not the kind of man to call for acts of violence on the radio, was he? 
A.	I confirm that, in my opinion, he would be unable to do that. 
Q.	You didn't hear him on the radio on the 21st of April when you were still in Masaka? 
A.	I didn't hear him. 
Q.	You don't recall him saying -- asking the population to consider whether a stranger in their neighbourhood was untrustworthy, and then, and I quote:  "You inform the population.  You surround him.  You attack him and you neutralise him."  You don't recall hearing that? 
A.	No, I don't. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which radio station?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Radio Rwanda.  That extract, for the benefit of anybody, is from P. 53, page 30 in the English. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You don't recall, Witness, on 22nd April, similarly on Radio Rwanda the préfet, Renzaho, said: "Besides, in times like these do not bother yourself with too many questions.  We say that you should shoot those who want to interfere with the security of people.  Anyone with a gun should shoot.  That is it."  
A.	No, I didn't hear that. 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Again, for the benefit of anyone in the courtroom, that it is P. 54, page 15 in the English.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	You said in your examination-in-chief this morning that so far as you were aware Renzaho never called for the establishment of roadblocks, is that right?  
A.	Could you kindly repeat, because to be honest I didn't quite understand. 
Q.	Do you remember that this morning you talked about Renzaho on the radio, and you said that he didn't ever call for - he didn't invite people to erect roadblocks?  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I said that. 
Q.	You don't recall on the 11th of April the préfet through a communiqué on Radio Rwanda, saying: "Roadblocks may only be set up at night"?  You don't remember that? 
A.	No, I did not hear that communiqué.  But, Counsel, I would also like to point out to you that when I escaped from my house I had only three minutes to land.  So I didn't even take on a radio set which would have enabled me to listen to announcements.  I was even -- even unable to pick up my certificates. 
Q.	But I understood from your evidence this morning that you heard the préfet -- can you hear me? 
A.	I heard him, but this was during the first days when I was still home.  He said:  "People stay indoors".  Then he also talked about days when we could go to market, but because -- before this we could go out.  People would ask to go out and get food.  I was not all the time glued to the radio to listen. 
Q.	So you left Kigali-ville préfecture on the 8th April, and you left Kigali-rural préfecture on the 28th April, so you had no radio after the 8th April, if I understood what you just said correctly, you can't possibly assist the Court with what the préfet Renzaho did or did not do in respect of the genocide, can you? 
A.	Counsel, I told you that I listened to the radio, but I was not all the time listening to the radio.  And this because of the responsibility of those with whom I was.  So I had a radio in my car -- in my vehicle, but I could not stay in the car all the time in order to listen to announcements. 
Q.	You were asked to listen to a tape recording this morning, and you said that you did not identify either speaker as the préfet.  Do you recall now the contents of the discussion on that tape? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Did you hear one of those speakers asking to speak to the préfet? 
A.	Yes, I heard that. 
Q.	And did you hear that same speaker talking about the situation in a place called Gahengeri? 
A.	Counsel, that is why I also wanted to listen for a second time to the message, so as to clearly understand.  But the voice of the speaker is unknown to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The location was G?  
MS. MELLUISH: 
G-A-H-E-N-G-E-R-I. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last letter being I, thank you. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Gahengeri is in Bicumbi, is that correct -- isn't it?  
A.	Avenger (sic), I'm not very sure, but perhaps it may be so. 
Q.	Do you agree that the person who answered to the title of préfet spoke about a Kigali unit being sent? 
A.	I repeat that I did not clearly understand the entire message.  I want -- I listened once, but I wanted to listen a second time, and that is what I am repeating.  I say I do not recognise the voice of the speaker or speakers. 
Q.	When you heard this tape played in court this morning, that wasn't the first time you had ever heard it, was it? 
A.	I heard it once, but I can assure you that I don't remember.  I do not remember all that was said in the tape and that is why I wanted to listen to it again. 
Q.	Did you hear the man who was referred to as the préfet saying that he checked with the military headquarters and that the Kigali unit was on its way? 
A.	No, don't remember that. 
Q.	Please forgive my Kinyarwanda, but do you recall hearing the words "mubakinbagure rwose"? 
MS. MELLUISH: 
Perhaps I should spell that for the record.  M-U-B-A-K-I-N-B-A-G-U-R-E.  New word R-W-O-S-E.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	And those words, Mr. Witness, mean exterminate them truly, don't they?  
A.	Counsel, unless one is being cynical, I do not see Mr. Renzaho saying that.  That is, the words -- the words you just used, "Exterminate them".  First of all, exterminate who?  I find that cynical.  Certainly he is not the one who uttered those words.  Besides, the voice is unknown to me.  I have already stated that. 
Q.	Surely, you agree that the speaker was a préfet from Kigali? 
A.	I say no to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is a difference between the English and the French version.  The English question was, "Surely, you agree that the speaker was 'a' préfet from Kigali?"  Would that change your answer, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, that would change my answer, because what I said is the person who passes for préfet in my opinion is not the préfet.  It is not the préfet's voice. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
According to you, was a préfet speaking?  Did you hear any version in that position based on your general knowledge of important Rwandan personalities, any of those voices on that tape?   
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, could you kindly repeat the question, because I am unable to follow you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I am trying to understand why you changed your answer after my clarification of the question.  And in order to do this in an efficient way the question is as follows:  Did you hear the voice of any préfet on the tape?   
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I heard the voice of a certain préfet.  But that voice is not Renzaho's voice. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Whose voice was it, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I do not know.  It is an unknown voice. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But if the voice is unknown, how can you know the position of the person having that voice?  You don't really know the identity of the person having that voice, is that the testimony?   
THE WITNESS:
That`s not what I am saying.  I said that the person who is passing for a préfet and who purports to be Préfet Renzaho, there is a major difference between him and Renzaho.  I heard mention of a préfet, but I did not hear Préfet Renzaho's voice.  That is the difference.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And having listened to the various voices, did you know any of the voices on that tape?  
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, what is happening now is not satisfactory to me.  I am afraid that we will not be able to elicit reliable answers or information from this witness.  Why?  Because, first of all, I had asked the witness to focus on the voice, because the Prosecution case was the subject of polemics, and this is what surprised us.  You disclosed a document, and in that document there was a name other than that of Renzaho.  I believe the Chamber or the Bench will recall that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President nods. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was to have this tape recording listened to by the witness or witnesses.  I am trying to -- I am trying to lay a foundation for my objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there an objection?   
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President.   

But I am laying a foundation for that objection, so that it should be clearly understood by the Chamber, because we are now dealing with the cross-examination which is based on the examination-in-chief.  Objection to questions -- I am objecting to questions relating to the substance of the message because as far as we are concerned in the testimony in-chief, I did not refer to the substance of the message.  

I questioned the witness only with respect to the issue of knowing whether among those involved in the conversation he, the witness, recognised the voice of Mr. Renzaho.  Therefore, any discussion relating to the substance of the message may be biased because the witness is not familiar with the utterances that were made.  

Moreover, the witness wanted to hear the utterances once more.  I said no, because I did not see the relevance of that.  So I am objecting to the question that has been raised with respect to the substance of the message. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That objection is noted.  We will rule on it tomorrow after having heard your response to it, and also having recapitulated what is actually in the transcripts both during chief and cross.  Thank you.  

So we will then adjourn, and as mentioned earlier, we have to start at 9:30 tomorrow morning.  

That is when your testimony continues, Mr. Witness.  Please do not discuss it with anyone.  We wish you all a pleasant afternoon.  Thank you. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I heard 9:30 a.m., 9:30 tomorrow?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is true that is an unusual time for starting but that is what we said, of course. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Very well, I just wanted to be sure.  I thank you.
