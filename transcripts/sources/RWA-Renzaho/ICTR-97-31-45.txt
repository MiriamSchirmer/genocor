MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, the Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Renzaho.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your cross-examination continues.  

Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.
THARCISSE RENZAHO,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, when we broke on Friday, I was referring you to a passage from Exhibit P. 54.  And in fact I was referring you to the paragraph subsequent to a paragraph that you had been read in the course ever your evidence-in-chief.  Do you remember that?  It's page 20 of the French.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you found it, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, sir, I am hesitating.  The -- the page, page 20 in French is not even in French, it is in English.  And I can't find the page, exactly.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	It is page 20 in French, K0246838.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have seen the page.  
Q.	Now, as I just indicated to you, there was a passage read by your counsel in the course of your evidence-in-chief where you had said:  

"That is why I would call on you to make every effort so that the organisation of patrols should be improved, so that opportunity should not take advantage of it to attack the innocent population.  We have started noticing some of such criminal acts in several secteurs where some youths are colluding with reckless soldiers to attack members of the population, so that the population" -- sorry "of the population, extort money, and loot houses."  

Now, that passage was read out to you during the course of your evidence-in-chief, and not only did you not say, "No, that's not me", you gave a lengthy explanation about that passage during which you had said, amongst other things, "If I had some other means to react other than speech, other than speaking, I would have used those means."  

Do you remember answering that question and giving an explanation about that passage to your counsel?  
A.	I do recall, Counsel.  
Q.	You see, it's only in the following paragraph of the same speech, Mr. Renzaho, that you indicate that you're going to introduce a military officer, who you then do, who says, amongst other things, "We will be working together to see how we can improve on the civil-defence system in the course of the meetings that I will soon be having with you."  

Now, Mr. Renzaho, that's not consistent, is it, with the position you take, namely, that there was no civil-defence system introduced.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I thank you for your question, and I would like to use this opportunity, first, to place that text in its proper perspective.  That text was put to me recently by counsel for Defence, and I was asked to say how I intended to follow up the recommendations of the meeting of 8 April 1994.  I then said that the meeting with the bourgmestre would allow me to know exactly what was happening within the population, and to see if the measures that had been taken were actually applied within the population.  That meeting is precisely within that framework.  I have thought it out, and I've tried to refresh my memory, and I believe it is precisely in that context in which the message should be placed.  

Now, concerning your allegation to the effect that a civil-defence system was in place, I would like to point out to you that the situation that broke out on 6 April did not change positively so as to warrant a removal of those roadblocks.  Worse still, it was impossible for us to carry out effective actions to abolish those roadblocks and organise them in a satisfactory manner.  If you are referring to my statements here, then you feel that I express some regret for -- or, that not enough was done to rectify that situation.  

Now you are referring to an officer who is there.  I do not recall the presence of that officer, but one thing is certain:  This situation we faced was such that events happened in a -- in a rush.  Please allow me time to give you the necessary facts so you can understand the situation.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But in your -- the course of your evidence-in-chief, and at the beginning of my cross-examination on the issue of civil defence, you said that there was no civil-defence system in Kigali during April to July.  Are you now saying that that's not right, that in fact there was a civil-defence system?  Yes or no.  
A.	No.  No, and I do confirm that there was no civil-defence system.  
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you for your explanation, we'll take it -- what we can from it.  

The next passage that I would like to refer you to is another passage that was put to you during the course of your evidence-in-chief, and it's from Prosecution Exhibit 56.  It's under tab 10.  It's a -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses.  Before we move on.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This page 20 in French which you have just dealt with in P. 54, it's found where in the English version?  
MR. MOSES: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  The passage I was reading from was the last two lines on page 13, and it goes over the page to the first four lines of page 14.  And then the next two paragraphs are the introduction of the officer.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the reference to the civil defence?  
MR. MOSES: 
Is in the course of the speech by the officer, he isn't -- who introduces him, Esdras Mushimiyimana, the end of the first line in that paragraph and into the second line. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, in what he is quoted to say does not use "civil defence", but the other officer introducing that officer is using that term.  
MR. MOSES: 
Absolutely. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

And now P. 56.  That's which tab?  
MR. MOSES: 
That's tab 10, Your Honours.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Firstly, Mr. Renzaho, for the French, it's on page 19, the second paragraph.  
MR. MOSES: 
And in the English, Your Honours, it commences on page 12, the third paragraph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	While you're finding it, Mr. Renzaho, I'll refresh your memory with what it states there.  It was read to you by your counsel, and you were asked questions by him and by Judge Møse about it.  It was a passage where you had said:  

"It is therefore necessary that directives adopted in this regard are complied with.  It is for this reason that we have decided to arrest all those who rape and want to commit criminal acts so as to punish them.  For example, we punished about three people.  It means that we have started to check whether these directives are complied with."  

Now, you recall that being put to you and you accepted that that is what you had said; correct, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, those are my words.  
Q.	Well, bearing in mind the importance you place on putting something in context, can we look at the question which was asked of you?  
MR. MOSES: 
And in the English it is in fact the first paragraph of page 12, Your Honours.  And in the French, it's page 18, it's the last paragraph of page 18 going on to the first paragraph of page 19.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Or, rather, it's the penultimate paragraph on page 18.  The question.  
MR. MOSES: 
You're right.  Thank you, sir.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Whilst you're finding that, Mr. Renzaho, I'll -- I'll read out the first couple of lines of that question.  The person interviewing you says:  

"Thank you.  One other thing about which we would request you to remind listeners of Radio Rwanda is security at roadblocks.  It is noticed that those entrusted with materiel, like firearms, are behaving irresponsibly at roadblocks."  

That's the part I would like, first of all, to ask you a question about, Mr. Renzaho.  Would you agree with me that the interviewer describes firearms as materiel entrusted to those at roadblocks?  Is that right?  Yes or no.  
A.	That is how it is written.  But, Counsel, once more I would like to express reservations.  That transcription is actually transcriptions of audio cassettes that were not given to me.  And I do not intend to attribute things to people, but I've discovered a number of irregularities in some documents that have been presented to me.  Notably, the famous cassette which talks of a conversation I had with the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, which is not even in my commune.  I found the same trains in some documents that I have with me.  So, please, I believe that the transcription, bearing in mind what somebody said could be found in there -- but I think it is my speech and it is true -- but in the present state of the transcriptions, I think.  But that does not stop you from answering me questions, I would like to answer them.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
I would like to record for the record, however, that on the 10th of January this year, full audio copies of all documents produced were provided to the Trial Chamber and to the Defence. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, if you look at the first paragraph of your answer, and in respect of that it is the final paragraph of page 18 in the French -- 
MR. MOSES: 
-- and in the English, Your Honours, I'm looking at the second paragraph of page 12.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	The last line of your reply says this -- you've been talking about meetings with officials.  You say:  

"Together they examined the issue of security for their cellule and deal with distribution and well thought out use of civil-defence materiel at their disposal."  

So, Mr. Renzaho, I'm suggesting to you that in your answer, which is in the paragraph prior to the one you accept being you, you are talking about distribution of civil-defence materiel.  And bearing in mind the question that you are asked linking firearms as being materiel, I'm suggesting to you that you were talking about the distribution of firearms.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I am before the Chamber right here, and all through this trial I have not seen anybody who has actually testified that I gave them weapons at the préfecture.  Those who have come to make allegations that we have explained thoroughly, what else do you want me to say?  That I should invent that weapons were distributed at the préfecture?  I was not alone at the préfecture.  All what we did, we did with the intention of preserving the security of the population.  And there were many of us -- at least those that were available at the préfecture.  

So I insist on what I have told you, and I have tried to explain to you what happened.  I did not distribute weapons at the préfecture.  Be that as it may, I tried to explain the complexity of that situation.  Firearms were available within the population.  I saw them.  When I went to intervene at CELA, I saw arms.  When I went to Kanombe, there were arms.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, I'm sorry to interrupt you -- I'm sorry to interrupt you again, but I've read a passage from what you have said, and I'm wanting to know whether you agree that you said it.  You talked about civil-defence materiel being distributed, didn't you?  
A.	On what occasion?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Renzaho, now we read out a sentence to you, that was what Mr. Moses did.  And the last few words in that sentence was "use of civil-defence materiel".  Now, did you use that word?  
THE WITNESS:  
I could use the word "civil defence" if such a system existed.  If it is the reaction of the population in the face of danger, in the face of the RPF offensive, be it at the outlying areas, that is, with the entry of RPF troops into populous neighbourhoods, or its entry within the FAR military mechanism, can I stop people in that case from defending themselves?  But the system as such, that included organisation, and that appeared in the directive of the prime minister on 25 May 1994 I know nothing about.  There was no structure.  The speech that I purportedly delivered in the presence of bourgmestres, in that message I insist on the fact that there was still a lot of confusion in their jurisdictions, and that they were not working hard enough to set up crisis committees in their areas of jurisdiction.  That message was given out on 21 April.  And you agree with me that 21 April was a well-advanced date with regard to the operations in Kigali.  And so we are far from the situation that we want to place out of the population, because the war was within the population itself.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you did use the word "civil defence" in that speech?  
THE WITNESS: 
I do not recollect very well.  If that is what it says, if it comes up with respect to organisation, how could I have used a concept that does not refer to anything?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, to further refresh your memory, Mr. Renzaho, can we look at the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the English on the same page, and in the French it is page 19, the first line of the third paragraph.  And it says:  "Actually" -- you said:  "Actually, there are people who believe that the civil-defence materiel being distributed is their private property."  
A.	Well, that is what I said.  But I retort -- I give you back what I said a while ago.  Are these words mine?  Because I signed documents and handed them over, I signed communiqués that you can use.  But the words that have been reproduced by a radio programme, now, check and see what happened.  At any rate, I think it will be rather obscure for me, and I'm not claiming that there were no weapons within the population, since I saw those weapons.  Now, the problem is, how did the weapons get there?  Because the weapons were there at the roadblocks.  Was it the préfecture that distributed those weapons?  That is the question.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Mr. Renzaho, you will assist this Chamber better if you answer questions instead of asking questions and being evasive.  They have asked you this question many times, you don't give us any definite answer.  You go round and round and come back to the point, and end up asking us a question.  So how do we know?  You are the person in the position to answer the questions.  You are the one to tell us whether those words were issued by you or not.  Don't pose a question to the Chamber.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And, finally in respect of this transcript, Mr. Renzaho, can I refer you to a passage in the fifth paragraph of the same page on the English, starting with the words "Civil defence".  And in the French it is in the middle of the fourth paragraph on page 19 of the French.  And this is what you said, Mr. Renzaho:  

"Civil defence materiel belongs to members of the population, because it was provided by the state.  It must serve the interests of members of the population equitably and appropriately."  

It's quite clear, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho, from your own mouth, that the state was providing civil-defence materiel to members of the population?  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	If it is the state that gave out those -- the materiel, then point to the member of the government who gave out the materiel.  Once more, I am telling you that this materiel -- well, I saw firearms within the population.  I saw firearms at the roadblocks.  I don't know the origin of these arms, and I tried to explain the phenomenon as it was.  Had weapons been given to somebody?  Because you needed structure for these weapons to be distributed.  But I saw the arms, and the situation we were going through had a number of uncontrollable situations.  There were deserting soldiers, gendarmes, and soldiers who came from all over the communes that had been overrun.  

At the time when that statement was made on 21 -- that is, the statement you claim I made, if that statement were made on the 18th or 19th, then they would have crossed the RPF lines and come into Kigali.  All that crowd was in the city.  How do you expect that weapons would not circulate within the population?  The weapons were there.  The problem, to my mind, is the use of such weapons.  And I'm saying, "Please, don't start to create an unavoidable situation here."  If weapons are to be used, they had to be used to protect the population.  No more, no less.  
Q.	I'd now like to move on to another radio broadcast, another one which had been put to you during the course of your evidence-in-chief and which you did not disagree that it was you.  
MR. MOSES: 
It's P. 61, Your Honours, under tab 15, from the 8th of June 1994, referring on the English page 5, second paragraph; and French it's on page 22, the fourth paragraph.  If you could provide the French to Mr. Renzaho.  And it's on page 22, the first line of the fourth paragraph in French.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Whilst you're finding it, Mr. Renzaho, I will read you what it says at the commencement of that paragraph.  It says:  "In continuation" -- you say:  

"In continuation, I will now address another subject, namely, the organisation of civil defence.  As you know, our youths are currently fighting fiercely in their respective secteurs."  

Do you remember saying that, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, I do recall, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  And two paragraphs further down in the English, it's the top of the fourth paragraph.  And in the French it's on page 23, the second paragraph, this is what you say:  

"What I want, in the final analysis, is that civil defence, which has been in existence for some time now, should be organised."  

That's what you've said on the 8th of June, Mr. Renzaho, that civil defence had been in existence for some time.  Correct?  
A.	Counsel, you actually say 8 June.  It is correct on 8 June we received directives from the prime minister.  On 25 September (sic) he said a team of officers was appointed to take care of recruitment training of soldiers that was -- were required by the army, and they were used in the city on various fronts.  And that is what it is all about.  And I do confirm to you that I actually said that.  And I -- I gave a quotation on the attack that they carried out in Gisozi on Mount Mburabuturo, and other fronts, notably behind the Saint Antoine school.  These people were used by the army, they were trained by the army.  So I don't see any civil-defence structure as such, as existed in other préfectures.  I don't see those structures existed in Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Both in French and English we heard you say the 25th of September, but you meant, of course, the 25th of May as the directive of the prime minister.  Can you just confirm that with a yes?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I do apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And then there was a location called Gisozi.  Can you spell that to us?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Gisozi, G-I-S-O-Z-I.  Gisozi.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Moses?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Is this directive the one that you told the Trial Chamber on Thursday or Friday that you didn't receive until after you'd left Rwanda, or had never seen before?  
A.	Precisely.  I saw that directive out of the country.  And I would like to tell you again that the team of officers that came, came from the army staff command that was sent to the préfecture.  That team did not receive directives from me, they received a mission from the army and they executed that mission.  Thank you.  
Q.	But it's you talking about it, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho, on the 8th of June, saying that civil defence had been in existence for some time now.  That's not consistent at all, is it, with your claim that civil defence didn't exist? 
A.	I have -- may have been blind, maybe, or I was not in Kigali, then I'm talking to you about things I don't know about.  But, concretely, that civil defence did not exist in Kigali as such.  I may also use this opportunity to say that the rules of engagement, within the framework of the accord that was in force as of 6 April, provided that the Rwandan armed forces, in order to bow the way to the advance of the RPF troops, came in late.  They even came and set up their positions in the peripheries of populous neighbourhoods.  And it is that complexity that made it such that cohabitation between the soldiers and the population created problems -- all the more so as this was seen in the setting up of irregular roadblocks.  

And the officers that you mentioned were sent to address the various issues with the local authorities.  That is why I presented that officer there, because I presented the issue to the officials, saying that the anarchy had to be addressed, and then the officer was going to report to his bosses who had sent him.  He did not even stop at the préfecture.  That is the enlightenment I wanted to make.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did civil defence, in real life, exist in Kigali from a certain point in time?  Or did it never exist?  Was it really implemented from a certain date?  
THE WITNESS: 
I would like to be candid with you, Mr. President.  Civil defence, to be implemented, needed a legal framework, instructions from the government.  And those instructions came with the directive of the prime minister that asked for structures, because structures no longer existed in Kigali, because the people who fled -- the people who could be part of the organs, for instance, the civil defence committees.  I don't see them.  So we had a situation where people were taken unawares.  We tried to reorganise the population in their homes by instilling order.  But because of the intensification of the fighting, we did not succeed.  And the statements that have been mentioned actually illustrate the situation very well, because I sought to know from the bourgmestres what the situation was, what we could do to further improve the situation.  But that is a situation we had until the end, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, the legal framework came on the 25th of May, not before; is that the evidence?  With other words, civil defence was implemented with effect from the 25th of May; is that the evidence?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, all over the country, yes, that is how it went.  But in my area, I had no real basis to organise such a thing.  All the more so as the army was rather interested in persons who would go to reinforce the staff training that was completely eroded.  That is it, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So a civil-defence system was implemented on a general basis from the 25th of May, but not in Kigali.  
THE WITNESS: 
In Kigali, we maintained -- or, tried to organise the situation in the anarchy that we knew from the beginning.  But we did not succeed in setting up the proper structures as provided for in civil defence.  That is what I meant.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you started to organise the situation in the anarchy, with other words, you started to set up a civil-defence system in Kigali from the 25th of May onwards, but did not succeed.  That's how I interpret your answer.  Is that a correct interpretation?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, the organisation undertook to eradicate anarchy began with our first meeting with the communal authorities on the 8th, and after that date we tried to make some order, prevent excesses in the neighbourhood and on the roadblocks. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when you say the 8th, you mean the 8th of which month?  
THE WITNESS: 
The 8th of April, the date of my first meeting with the communal authorities.  The 8th of April 1994, in a meeting I held with the communal representatives and the members of the urban council.  So we were consistently trying to establish order, but the various shifts and movements in the town, the combat, did not make it possible to improve the situation significantly.  Every time there was a new reversal, that brought to nought our efforts to re-establish order and safety.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But these attempts, with effect from the 8th of April, did they include civil defence attempts?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I must again state here, in various neighbourhoods, we had people who had established roadblocks, and those roadblocks we tried to get to the bottom of them, the origin.  They were anarchical and caused much disorder.  And that's what we applied ourselves to.  And there were gangs who attacked in various neighbourhoods, also, to kill, to steal.  That was the situation we tried to handle, confront.  So it was a situation of excesses that we had to bring under the control of the local authorities, but we did not succeed in doing so.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
So, Mr. Renzaho, can we now have the answer to the question.  Did civil defence exist in Kigali, or not, during the events?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, madam, I want to tell you that civil defence, as prescribed by the prime minister, did not exist in Kigali.  After the -- the outbreak of hostilities of the night -- in the night of the 6th to the 7th, and with the ensuing unfolding of events, it -- it was the logic in which we were imprisoned.  Elsewhere there wasn't war.  The war came elsewhere later, and they had the time to apply the instructions of the prime minister.  But in Kigali everything went up on the same day, it exploded in the same day.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, if it didn't exist, how can you then, on the 8th of June, say that the civil defence which has been in existence for some time should be organised?  
THE WITNESS: 
The situation I've tried to describe, I've described to the best of my abilities.  But I don't know whether it merits the term "civil defence".  Because organised by who, and along -- according to what model?  That is the problem I have with my understanding.  However, it's true that they had set up roadblocks in various neighbourhoods.  The roadblocks existed, and people manned them in turn.  All the witnesses who have come here to testify have said so.  But what -- in what structure?  In the framework of what structure?  Who were the authorities?  Was it authorities who'd consulted each other and decided to proceed by A, B, C, D?  No, I cannot answer clearly that question, which would have been a proper -- the installation of a proper system.  But such a system did not exist -- such a structure did not exist.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	We'll move on, Mr. Renzaho, to another transcript that you were shown.  It's P. 61 -- I'm sorry, we'll move on to P. 62, if we can.  
MR. MOSES:
That's tab 16, for the 18th of June.  English, page 3, and third -- the second or third paragraph, Your Honours.  It commences "We have therefore asked".  And in the French it is page 26, third paragraph going on to page 27, first paragraph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I'll read you the sentence I want to focus on, Mr. Renzaho, and ask you questions about it.  You said on that occasion:  

"We have therefore asked those in charge of civil defence in the cellules and in the secteurs to issue permits for movement, because these are people who come to see us in order to obtain fuel for use in those vehicles."  

Now, Mr. Renzaho, first question is that it's clear, isn't it, that there are people in charge of civil defence in the cellules and in the secteurs?  Correct?  
A.	In the words you've referred to, I spoke of the establishment of crisis committees to manage the situation in the various secteurs.  If that's what you're referring to, yes.  
Q.	Well, we can see -- we'll be able to see at a later point what is actually written there, Mr. Renzaho.  
But the other important factor is, Mr. Renzaho, is the fact that these people who were involved in civil defence were coming to see you to get fuel, weren't they? 
A.	I was at the préfecture with other people.  If the people -- if people tell you that the préfecture had a stock of fuel, you probably would accuse me of being a liar.  I have explained all the problems in relation to fuel.  We had the possibility of obtaining a bit of fuel from the army, because everything that remained had been requisitioned by the army.  I had no stock of fuel, Mr. Prosecutor.  Thank you.  
Q.	All right.  Well, I'd also now like you to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What -- what did you mean by that, "We had the possibility of obtaining a bit of fuel from the army"?  What did you mean by that sentence?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I should like to tell you that it was possible for me to send my vehicle to go and obtain fuel from the army.  That's what I mean.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Only for préfectoral purposes, or for people who came to ask for fuel at the préfecture?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I think we have to try and put ourselves in that place at that time.  Not only did the war block all borders with our neighbouring -- neighbouring countries, but immediately led to the conquering of all strategic fuel stocks of the country.  I don't think it would be realistic to imagine that a government department, whoever it was, could have accepted to distribute fuel to anyone who wanted to go about their business.  I don't know anything about that, and I don't see the possibility there was no fuel in Kigali, nor was there any fuel supplies, nor was there any drinks.  That is what I can tell you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	The préfecture was providing fuel, wasn't it, not only to the civil defence people, but to préfectoral vehicles, and also, can I suggest, too, vehicles from other government departments who were not préfectoral vehicles, such as ORINFOR -- O-R-I-N-F-O-R; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	I know of no such case.  Please, Mr. Prosecutor, I never dealt with any such case.  
Q.	Well, I'd ask you then to be shown, please, Prosecution Exhibit 34.  It's in tab 30 of volume 1.  

And just to put on the record, this is a letter dated the 1st of May 1994, addressed to Mr. Jean Baptiste Butera, signed by you, in which you remove him from his responsibilities of being the liaison officer with the ministry of defence.  
MR. MOSES: 
And for Your Honours' purpose, I'm looking at the final paragraph. 

That's 44.  I'm sorry, I thought I had said P. 34, Your Honour.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said P. 34, and it is P. 34.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Tab 30.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, do you recognise this letter, Mr. Renzaho?  It's got your signature on it on the second page.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The microphone, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, quite.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, in the final paragraph of the first page, you cite examples of -- and the reasons why you are removing Mr. Butera from his position of liaison officer with the ministry of defence.  And you state that:  

"Today," that's referring to the 1st of May "for example, you'd refused to provide petrol to the vehicles of hygiene and of ORINFOR".  And as justification, you -- Mr. Butera had said he was not the dog of the préfet.  

You remember that letter, don't you, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	It's signed by myself, yes.  
Q.	Mmm.  Well, Mr. Renzaho, that's an example, isn't it, of the préfecture providing fuel for ORINFOR.  That wasn't a préfectoral vehicle, it was an ORINFOR vehicle, wasn't it?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think we can't really indulge in a game of denial or acknowledgement.  I am, in general terms, a responsible man, and I will say to you that, as stated, it was the army that had held the fuel, and this letter does not say the opposite.  It is possible that official vehicles might come to the préfecture on duty and ask for some fuel.  He, as liaison officer, should go to see if there is any fuel at the army to serve the vehicles, to supply the vehicle.  But when you tell me that perhaps I supplied fuel to people coming from anywhere, I don't know where, well, you'll understand that the situation was difficult.  If it's difficult to provide a government vehicle with fuel, I don't see how one could be generously, or with largesse, supplying fuel to other vehicles.  
Q.	Thank you for that answer, Mr. Renzaho.  I would now ask you if could be shown and look at -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I understand that there is no translation of P. 34.  

Could you read, Mr. Renzaho, the last paragraph, (French spoken), into the record, so that we just have the English translation.  I think we should read it in context.  Can you help us, please?  
THE WITNESS: 
Oui, Monsieur le Président.  

"For example, you're not authorised to refuse to provide fuel -- you're not allowed to refuse fuel to official vehicles on official duty under the pretext that you will supply them when appropriate.  Today, for example, you refused fuel to public hygiene or sanitation and ORINFOR vehicles on duty.  As a justification, you said you were not the préfet's dog.  That is why the functions you -- ascribed to you as liaison officer are withdrawn and you will be replaced by Mr. Utazirubanda, Apollinaire.  I would ask you consequently to hand over -- to hand back all instruments provided to you for the work that you had -- with which you were tasked."  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  Now that surname is spelt U-T-A-Z-I-R-U-B-A-N-D-A.  Apollinaire. 
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, do you want us to do the whole letter?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there anything else we need to read from this letter, according to the parties?  Not at this stage, all right.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	It's quite clear from the letter, however, Mr. Renzaho, that it was Mr. Butera who was providing the fuel.  That's what you say:  "You refused to provide fuel".  
A.	I think it is quite clear, Mr. Prosecutor, that Mr. Butera was the liaison officer.  He refused to drive the vehicle to the army to ask for fuel.  He didn't have any stock.  He was a liaison officer.  If he had stock, he couldn't have refused it.  But there would be no point in pointing out that he was the liaison officer with those who did hold the fuel stocks.  
Q.	All right.  Just to round off the issue of civil defence, Mr. Renzaho, I'm wondering if you could please look at the document you wrote in Congo-Brazzaville in 1997, headed up "Testimony on the bloody tragedy of the people of Kigali from 6 April 1994".  
MR. MOSES: 
It is one of the documents, Your Honours, that was provided at the commencement of the cross-examination, and it was shown to the Accused early on, and he accepted that he had.  

And for Your Honours, I'm going to focus on page 13 of the English under the heading "Distribution of weapons to civilians".  

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And, Mr. Renzaho, if you could please turn to page 22 of the French document.  Page 22, under the heading (French spoken).  Do you have it in front of you, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Oui, Monsieur le Procureur.  
Q.	This is what you said in 1997:  

"The national defence, which was fighting a widespread war, implemented a structured and organised civil-defence programme for the mobilisation of youth volunteers and their rapid training to prepare them for secteur-based operations.  Recruits were -- who were enrolled could have weapons.  Apart from this, I cannot imagine where a préfet could have weapons.  An officer was placed in every préfecture.  For this purpose, he collaborated directly in military operations.  Civil defence is a practical system, even in other countries.  In the case of Rwanda, it seemed to respond to a reality regarding which, following the Arusha peace accord, the government resolutely began a peace process by demobilising and not enlisting new recruits."  

That's what you wrote in 1997, correct, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	That is correct, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And you'll agree, therefore, that a structured and organised civil-defence programme was implemented.  
A.	This paragraph refers to the prime minister's instructions of the 25th of May 1994.  And it matches what I said at the time in 1994.  An officer and a team were appointed, and he went to the general staff.  But without the knowledge of the préfecture, he recruited young people who served in the Rwandan armed forces on various fronts.  
Q.	You'll agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that in 1997 you certainly didn't indicate that civil defence was not implemented in your own préfecture, did you?  
A.	I don't see how I could tackle the question directly, except that I said an officer was appointed for Kigali town, and what he did I've spoken of here on several times.  He did proceed with recruitment and training of young people who then went to serve in the ranks of the army, the army who clothed and supplied and fed them.  I really can't say much more.  
Q.	Well, if we look at what Mr. Kambanda said about civil defence in Kigali, I would like your comments.  
MR. MOSES: 
And I'm going to refer Your Honours to -- it's side B, K0154885, line 5 downwards.  And in the French it's on page 24, line 9 onwards.  

I don't know if the registry can assist. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is another of the documents you distributed at the beginning.  It's in the same folder.  

MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, since this goes back to the use of this document, and in fact the use of this statement, the interviews of Mr. Kambanda by the Prosecutor, this document should have been disclosed to us before.  But there were -- there were -- he did so only after (sic) the cross-examination.  The OTP had this document, and I would have loved to have disclosure of it in a timely manner so as to prepare for it, and not to be -- to be confronted at the cross-examination without having to prepare -- to present it to Mr. Renzaho.  That is the objection I'm making to the use of this document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I note that there is a difference between the English and French version of what Maître Cantier just said.  I will now repeat the sentence in French as he formulated it:  "It was only after (sic) the cross-examination."  (French spoken).  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Oh, "before".  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"It was only before the cross-examination".  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Comments?  
MR. MOSES: 
Standard practice, Your Honour.  Nothing's been requested of the Defence -- by the Defence prior to -- to that.  And I'm actually checking, because I'm certainly aware some of the Kambanda tapes were disclosed at the end of last year, I believe.  But, in any event, it doesn't prevent the Prosecutor from using such documents.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your objection goes on record, but we have to overrule it.  It is true that it is allowed to put documents to a witness and disclose it in connection with the commencement of cross-examination.  That has been the practice for many years in this Tribunal.  This said, it's often suggested that some documents be distributed a bit earlier, but if that could jeopardise the purpose of cross-examination, it is not required.  

So what, now, is the question?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, in that passage there -- and I'll avoid reading the entire passage on to the record -- he says that you were there for civil defence, just as the soldiers were there to fight the war, and he was asked about the activities of the civil defence.  And he said:  "In reality, they carried out the massacres."  

And it goes on down there, and you can see what he was asked about, and Mr. Kambanda said -- or, was asked:

"Okay, when you say Renzaho controlled the town..." Kambanda says, "He was in charge of the civil defence, and knowing what the civil defence did at the time, it can be said that Renzaho carried out the massacres.  But we can't simply say 'Renzaho massacres'."  

Do you agree with the prime minister that you were in charge, in fact, with civil defence, and it was the civil-defence programme that carried out the massacres in Kigali?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I regret to disappoint you; I do not agree with what the prime minister says.  And I would like to say that the example of the prime minister that you are using is not appropriate.  First, that person is from the opposition.  That created a lot of problems in Kigali.  Two, I did not live with the prime minister to make an observation or an authority.  I saw him on the 11th at a meeting, that is what I said, and immediately the government moved to Gitarama.  And then I saw him again briefly for 30 minutes when he stopped at the préfecture in May.  So, tell me, how can he make me the centre of civil defence?  He was the one who signed the directives that came out.  Did I attend the government meeting that prepared the draft for the prime minister's signature?  Sincerely, I think that this man pleaded guilty.  He is your witness, and I think it is my right to claim that that person should come here before the Chamber and say so, so I will give -- have the opportunity to ask him questions, thank you.  
Q.	Just one point of clarification:  You say that the prime minister was a member of the opposition.  I didn't think you were a member of any party, Mr. Renzaho.  
A.	I did not belong to any party, and I regret that all through the multiparty politics period I did not know that man.  I did not see him.  I dealt with the serving prime minister.  I saw him when he was appointed after the death of the president.  And if you place him in the same category as Gasana with the documents that are presented to me here, I would say the same thing.  These are people who had their own ways of doing things and seeing things. 
Q.	I put to you, finally on this topic, Mr. Renzaho, the reason you are so anxious to disavow any involvement or knowledge with civil defence is because you know very well that civil defence was another name for carrying out the killings, and you were in charge of it in Kigali.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I've explained to you in what way I was involved in the tragic events of Kigali.  If you have been following me from the 6th, then you would know on a minute-by-minute basis how I was dragged into the Kigali events.  Now, tell me sincerely, if knowing a situation that was going to happen involving the civil defence, I would have accepted to live in times of torment in the face of an overwhelming and a terrible situation where nobody could do anything?  Because I was there on the ground and I was a victim of the situation myself.  So you think I would have created a situation in which I would be humiliated?  So it is difficult to answer that, Counsel.  I thank you.  
Q.	Moving on to a new topic, that of rape.  Do you agree, Mr. Renzaho, that as early as mid-April 1994, you were getting reports of women being raped in Kigali.  
A.	I received information on what was happening during a meeting with the bourgmestres, notably, that of Nyarugenge, who was generally there with his conseiller.  So I received the information.  I received information, but in my capacity I would have preferred that people be brought to me so I could punish them.  That is what of interest -- is what of interest to me.  So what could have happened anywhere?  I mean, in what sense?  What was the evidence?  That is the problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when was that meeting?  
THE WITNESS: 
I just realised that there was a meeting that happened on the 21st, and I do not recall all the meetings that happened.  But 21st April.  That is it.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And we've heard evidence, haven't we, from a number of Prosecution witnesses that you were given regular reports about individual persons who had been -- Tutsi women who had been raped?  Do you agree with that or not?  
A.	Counsel, when somebody comes -- 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho -- 
A.	I am not -- I do not agree.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I do not agree with that proposition, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And your advice on the radio -- 
MR. MOSES: 
I won't -- at this stage I won't put it -- the transcript to Mr. Renzaho to try and save some time, Your Honour.  But at P. 54 under tab 8, page 15 of the English, third paragraph at -- commencing "These people who come to rape children and women".  And in French it's page 22, I believe the third paragraph.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you recall saying this, Mr. Renzaho, on the radio:  

"These people who come to rape children and women in the quarters must absolutely be thrown out.  Chase them away.  Besides, in times like these, do not bother yourself with too many questions.  We are saying that you should shoot those who want to interfere with the security of the people.  Anyone with a gun should shoot.  That is it."  

Do you accept that you said that?  
(Pages 1 to 18 by Kirstin McLean)

1015H
THE WITNESS:
I did not know.  I cannot recall it.  So it is not really very correct.  It is possible 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Where would you be asking that the rapists be chased away to, Mr. Renzaho?  Next door?  
A.	Please, I did not quite understand your question.  I did not understand your question, sir. 
Q.	In the passage that I read out to you, you had indicated that those who were raping should be chased away, and my question for you was, where you thought that the rapists should be chased away to?  
A.	I believe that our concern in the situation we experienced had to do with the neutralisation of all these persons who were committing crimes within the population.  That is the idea we had, and that is what I remember of that statement.  

Now, where to chase them to?  They had to be arrested and brought before the courts, but the courts were not working.  And in the various neighbourhoods the local authorities could seek assistance from the military authorities that were there.  Now, chase them out to send them where?  That is the problem I put to you.  Where would they have been sent to?  
Q.	No one was arrested for rape under your watch as préfet of Kigali between April and July 1994, were they?  
A.	Counsel, I regret to say that nobody was brought before me on charges of rape and then I let them free or tolerated them.  The préfet is not able -- is not a conseiller, is not a chef de cellule, he is not all of that.  So I think we should face the reality of things. 
Q.	The reality of things, Mr. Renzaho, was that your whole approach was consistent with that attributed to you by Prosecution Witness AWO, who said that you had told and spoken to Hutu men and called Tutsi women "food".  That's consistent with the approach that you took during that period, isn't it?  
A.	Counsel, I never used that word ever since I came out of my mother's womb; and I do confirm that to you.  

And regarding that incident that you mentioned of Calcutta, I gave explanations that I consider satisfactory.  First, I was not there.  Then, if you are talking about the 10th or the 11th or even the 12th, I was not at the orphanage of the sisters of charity of Calcutta.  I don't even know where the orphanage was found.  And to use that as a hammer and to strike on my head, not knowing whether my head would stay, please, I don't know, because the charge is baseless.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, moving onto a new topic and your movements in the first two or three days of the genocide.  According to you, there had been a state of war from October 1990 up until and including the 6th of April, correct? 
A.	Sorry, I may not have been attentive, I did not get that question.  
Q.	According to you, the country was in a state of war from October 1990 up until the 6th of April, at least, and then continuing; but I am focussing on the 6th of April.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  

Now, according to your testimony, you had been living in your house for almost two years.  According to the Prosecution evidence, you had been there for almost one year, correct? 
A.	It is not correct.  It is not correct.  I had been living there since May 1992. 
Q.	That's almost two years, according to you? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	You were the most senior communal official, préfectoral official in the capital, correct, for all that time? 
A.	I am sorry, Counsel, I don't understand the question. 
Q.	You were préfet during all that period, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	It's simply nonsense for you to suggest that you were unable to contact anyone after you left your office from your house for almost two years in a period of war, because you didn't have your phone connected.  That's nonsense, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Call it what you like, you have the right to.  But the circumstances that I describe here are very clear.  Thank you.  
Q.	And on the morning -- well, I am suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you had a telephone that was in good working order.  
A.	It wasn't in good working order.  That is what I said, and others have said so too.  
Q.	On the morning of the 7th, as I understand your testimony, you fortunately were -- decided to dress in military uniform, then fortunately found out about a meeting of senior military officers that you decided to attend, and that by the end of that meeting, which you had to ask permission to join, you were placed on the crisis committee.  That's a summary of what you said in evidence in chief, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I believe that should be it.  
Q.	And the meeting at ESM started around 10:15, didn't it?  
A.	Yes, I believe that is correct. 
Q.	And that would have provided you with ample time to collect weapons at around 10 o'clock from Hôtel des Diplomates and go to the préfectoral office and to ESM, because they were all very close to one another, weren't they?  
A.	Counsel, I believe what you allege there is not correct.  And I have stated the time at which I got to the préfecture office and the persons with whom I conversed.  And all those persons are not dead.  I believe they are alive; I mean, persons who know and have it precisely, and they can be contacted.  Therefore, it is not correct.  I could have not gone simultaneously to look for weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomats.  And, please, the weapons at the Hôtel des Diplomats, according to the witness who mentioned it, were handed out at 11 a.m., not before ten minutes past ten.  So I remember what he said.  I think what you say is not correct, Counsel. 
Q.	The record will speak for itself on that issue.  

At ESM the meeting you attended, were you told about the murder of the prime minister?  
A.	I believe that if I listened carefully the issue was raised at about 11 a.m., and it happened when the explosions were going off in Camp Kigali concerning the incident with the Blue Berets.  The camp commander got into the meeting hall and narrated what was happening at Camp Kigali, saying that he had tried to cope with the situation but the riot had grown out of hand and he could not cope with it.  It was on that occasion that the issue was raised.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who was the camp commander?  
THE WITNESS: 
He was Colonel Nubaha, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And he narrated orally to all participants what was happening in Camp Kigali with the soldiers there?  
THE WITNESS:
No, when he entered the hall he addressed the rostrum.  Since the hall was kind of small, we could hear what he was saying.  He spoke to those on the rostrum. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Who was on the rostrum, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	I saw General Ndindiliyimana, Colonel Bagosora and General Dallaire. 
Q.	All right.  And were you also made aware of the murders that were taking place of the other members of the government? 
A.	Yes, later on.  Yes, at a meeting of the crisis committee in the evening of 7 April 1994. 
Q.	All right.  And you say you were also aware that ten Belgian soldiers were being killed just 2- or 300 metres from where you were having the meeting; is that correct? 
A.	Well, I didn't measure, but it could have been something like that. 
Q.	Well, my question is, you were told of what was going on a short distance from where the meeting took place? 
A.	When the camp commander came in and briefed the officials of the meeting, yes.  But, before, we had heard explosions but we did not know what they were, and I remember the attitude of some officers who were saying that maybe we have been ambushed, so we should get out quickly from this ambush.  But we didn't know what it was all about.  
Q.	All right.  Now, in the afternoon of the 8th of April, did you go home before nightfall? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And that was after you had done a tour of the roadblocks between two and three in the afternoon, as Witness AFB has said; isn't that correct?  
A.	That is very incorrect, Counsel.  
Q.	All right.  Let's move on to CELA, if we can.  You will agree with me that you were present at CELA for two hours? 
A.	Counsel, yes.  From 9:00 to about 11 a.m.  I don't know if I left at exactly 11 a.m. or a few minutes to 11, but that is correct, I was there within that period.  
Q.	Do you accept, as was said by Witness UI, he met you outside the gate and in fact handed over to you a list of the names of those who had taken refuge at CELA?  Do you remember that happening?  
A.	You are speaking of Witness U?  I don't know.  Maybe it is even UI you are talking about.  No, I did not see him.  I did not speak to him, no.  
Q.	You see, according to the Prosecution witnesses, persons were put to one side under the excuse that they were accomplices and then they were taken away and killed.  You will agree that's a summary of what a number of Prosecution witnesses have said?  Whether you agree with them or not, that's a short version of what they allege.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And according to you, there was no sorting out of infiltrators? 
A.	I did not take part in any such scene, Counsel.  I did not witness any such event.  Thank you.  
Q.	You didn't ask anyone who was there to sort out infiltrators? 
A.	No.  That was not my mission, no.  
Q.	Because you will agree with me, if you had, that would be consistent with the account that the Prosecution witnesses have given, namely, that you did and were involved in getting others there to sort people out?  You will agree with me that that would be consistent? 
A.	I am not in the habit of making assumptions.  I was speaking of concrete things that happened to me.  Things did not happen that way.  Thank you.  
Q.	Okay.  Did Commander Nyamuhimba go with you to CELA on the 22nd of April?  
A.	I do not know.  I explained the circumstances under which I intervened and the way I did that.  I did not take time to identify the persons who were with me.  I don't know.  
Q.	All right.  We have heard your explanation in the course of your evidence in chief.  I would like to refresh your memory with what you said in your statement that you made in 1997.  And so, if you could, please look at, in the French, it's on page 20, the final two paragraphs.
MR. MOSES:
And in English, Your Honour, the description starts at the bottom two -- it's the last two paragraphs of page 11, but I am going to be focussing on, particularly, the first two paragraphs of page 12.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, Mr. Renzaho, I would like to read to you a sentence which commences -- it's the last sentence on the bottom of page 11, Your Honours:

"I called Lieutenant Colonel Munyakazi again, telling him to perform his duty and that I would immediately go there with the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge, Jean Baptiste Bizimana, the chief of police, Major Nyamuhimba, and a few other civil servants.  At the scene, the situation was very tense.  Lieutenant Munyakazi did not come to the place."

This is the next bit which I would like to read and ask some comments on:  

"With so much difficulty, I was able to establish dialogue with the attackers who agreed to allow the gendarmerie to check whether there were infiltrators among the refugees." 

Do you see that Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	So, did you, in fact, have the gendarmerie check whether there were infiltrators among the refugees?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think the situation is very, very clear.  It was necessary to take back to the hands of the authorities a situation that had gotten out of hand.  And when questioned about this, I said that in discussing with the representatives of the group for what reason they'd taken those people at the CELA, and they said of killers in hiding who had killed three of their people.  So, the thing was, now that the authorities were handling the matter, the crowd should go home, the citizenry should return to their homes.  And that's what I managed to obtain.  
Q.	But, Mr. Renzaho, here it says that you were able to establish dialogue with the attackers who agreed to allow the gendarmerie to check whether there were infiltrators amongst the refugees.  It's not what you told us in the course of your evidence in chief, is it?  
A.	It is exactly what I said, because when we discussed, in an aside, in the presence of the man leading the gendarmerie -- the officer leading, I asked those people who had attacked the CELA site what was the point of their incursion, and they said that people among them had been killed there.  And I said, well, can we agree that those who were killed doing the task we've undertaken can end, as of the moment the people with authority take matters back in hand, return to your homes and we will handle the matter.  And that is what they accepted.  I think that's what I said.  Perhaps if I didn't -- if I didn't say so, it would have been a mistake, but I am sure that's what I said. 
Q.	So, did the gendarmerie then check for infiltrators, is that what you are saying?  
A.	Not at all.  After having sent the attackers home, I invited the citizenry to go with the gendarmes' escort -- the people to go to Sainte Famille escorted by the gendarmerie.  That's what I did, and then I left.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There were some names in what you read out, Mr. Moses.  It was Jean Baptiste Bizimana and Major Nyamuhimba, and that was all in the enumeration.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why should you mention in 1997 that there were a check of infiltrators if there was none?  Why did you write this?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have reflected exactly what happened when I came to that site and managed to establish dialogue with the attackers.  They told me that some of them had been killed nearby, and consequently, among the crowd there must be people with arms who were firing at them.  That was what they were claiming.  And to solve matters I said, "Well, okay, now we are here, we represent authority -- public authority -- the state, you have finished what was your duty to do in bringing the matter to our attention, you may now go home."  And I told the officer there to bring -- you could see them within the crowd.  The leaders told them that they would move with the gendarme escort to Saint Paul-Sainte Famille.  The first ones began to leave before my eyes, and then I turned on my heels and left.
MR. MOSES:
I am sorry, Your Honour, I don't know that that answers Your Honour's questions.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Why did you write about the fact that you'd negotiated with the attackers who agreed to allow the gendarmerie to check to see if there were infiltrators?  Why did you write that?  
A.	Because that is the truth.  That's what happened.  That was their claim.  That was how they would justify their aggression; that there were people among them who were firing at them.  So I had to answer that specific point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, then, there was a check, then?  
THE WITNESS:
My main purpose was to get the attackers to leave.  That was the immediate purpose.  On that pretext or another pretext, they were the threat, and so I sought -- I mean, to get them to disperse, to go home.  I told them, "We are taking matters in hand, you can go home".  That was the point.  And they did; they then went home.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You see, what you describe there is, in fact, you will agree, consistent with what Prosecution witnesses say happened; namely, that people were separated on the basis that they were suspected infiltrators and taken off to be killed. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think the situation is quite the contrary to your theory.  According to the witnesses, the witnesses said that an attack organised by the councillor, and Abbé Munyeshyaka, Mukandituye, et cetera, et cetera, with my cooperation; the attack was led by me, that I arrived at the CELA at the head of these people who were attacking the refugees, and I would then have proceeded to select a number of people, separated them, put them in the inside courtyard, make them kneel down, and everything that they said.  I have tried to narrate the circumstances under which I intervened.  And what I did is what I am telling you here.  
Q.	And you didn't know any of those persons at CELA, is that your evidence?  Any of the refugees?  You didn't see anyone you knew?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I didn't know anyone.  Maybe if I had had the time to spend some time with the refugees, I might have identified a few people, but I didn't have the time; I didn't have the opportunity.  
Q.	And, so, a number of our -- the Prosecution witnesses who mentioned the fact that you spoke to Mr. Mugiraneza, M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A, is just a lucky guess from their point of view that it's someone who you admitted, in fact, knowing in the course of your evidence in chief? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think I have been questioned on this matter under examination-in-chief; my memory hasn't quite abandoned me.  And I answered it, that Mugiraneza, if that is the person who worked at the ministry of foreign affairs, whom I knew very well, whom I would visit at his office.  I'd never seen him at home at his residence, but I knew him well.  Because in the past he had studied for a while at the school where I followed him, and we would sometimes walk together because we came from the same home area.  So that person, I knew him.

But, now, on the matter of the 22nd of April 1994, in full awareness I tell you that I did not see that person.  As I came, I left.  I did not have a conversation with any of the refugees, apart from communicating to them the decision taken.  I don't know.  I heard it here for the first time.  
Q.	Well, you were aware of the allegation against you, as early as 1997, weren't you, Mr. Renzaho, because you were writing this document as somewhat of a self-serving description of the events that took place in Kigali between April and July?  You have been aware of the allegation of your involvement at CELA for ten years, haven't you?  At least ten years?  
A.	That is correct, and I have read many books, much literature on Rwanda's dramatic situation.  I have read reports put together by various NGOs.  I have read all that.  
Q.	The truth of the matter, Mr. Renzaho, is that you were there on the morning of the 22nd of April with communal police, gendarmerie, communal officials and other members of the population, and that you did have the refugees selected on suspicion of infiltration as a ruse to have them taken away to be killed.  That's the truth, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I think you err.  You are in error.  If you persist in thinking so, it is further error.  Quite simply, remember the circumstances under which I intervened.  It was in Nyarugenge commune, and Nyarugenge had its bourgmestre; and he himself in his testimony, to show the importance he attached to it because he did want to stress that he was the first to come there.  But, unfortunately, that's not true.  

However, let us remember that it was in a commune where the bourgmestre should intervene, and the bourgmestre did come there.  That is a fact.  
Now, tell me, in what cases a préfet is to play the role of turtle, bringing a bourgmestre on his back to come to a commune?  It is completely topsy-turvy.  That's why I had to go there, and I have explained why, and I really don't think I should say any more.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I am now moving on to Saint Paul's.  Shall I commence?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a long sequence?  
MR. MOSES: 
We are making a lot better progress today I am pleased to advise the Trial Chamber.  It's -- it will take a wee bit of time, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have the 11 o'clock break now, then.  The Court is adjourned.  We will resume at 11:20
(Court recessed from 1055H to 1122H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you heard Witnesses ALG and BUO both say that you were at the gates of the Saint Paul centre on the morning of the 14th of June.  You heard them both say that, didn't you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't remember hearing ALG saying or BUO saying that I was at the gate of Saint Paul. 
Q.	Well, you don't remember ALG saying that he had a conversation with you and you'd just returned via Gitarama, and you had advised him that his wife had just had a baby?  Do you remember that testimony now?  
A.	Yes, I remember.  But it wasn't -- that wasn't the way he said it.  He said I was coming from behind, and I wasn't yet --  I was behind him in a car and he heard my car and he stopped, and that's when we allegedly spoke together, at least that's what I heard, but not at the gates of Saint Paul's, no.  
Q.	All right.  Your evidence and your evidence in chief was, however, that you didn't return to Kigali until the evening of the 15th of April.  Is that -- that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Quite correct, Mr. Prosecutor; that's absolutely correct. 
Q.	And what time did you get back, according to you, to Kigali? 
A.	In the evening of the 15th, and I remember very well.  We didn't even have any more electricity in Kigali, so it was dark.  People did as they could to have a bit of light, so it was in the evening of the 15th. 
Q.	And what day did you depart from Cyangugu, the same day?  
A.	Not at all.  It -- just a bit before; it took about three-four hours (sic).  
Q.	Just so I am clear, it took you three or four hours from Cyangugu to Kigali; correct? 
A.	Perhaps, I did not express myself correctly or I was misunderstood.  I said the trip to and from Cyangugu took three or four days. 
Q.	Well, I'll ask:  When was it that you left Cyangugu? 
A.	I think I left Cyangugu on the 14th, and I have the impression I took the Zaire-nil divide road and I entered via Gisenyi.  I came down from Gisenyi through Gitarama.  That's how I entered the town.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for the record, so that it shall not be argued that the witness contradicted himself.  He did say in his first response, "three to four days".  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So what time in the morning did you leave Cyangugu on the 14th, according to you? 
A.	Really, I don't recall quite completely, but generally when I travelled I left early, so that would be between eight and nine. 
Q.	So, according to you, you were with your family on the morning of the 14th of June in Cyangugu between eight and nine; is that right?
A.	It's possible.  It's possible.  I left in the morning.  
Q.	You will agree that there has been no notice of alibi filed in respect of this incident has there, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	The incident at Saint Paul, the incident of the 14th of June, I think I even mentioned a UN report.  There was an intelligence officer who made an enquiry into what happened at Sainte Famille and Saint Paul concerning that incident.  And I saw two things in that report; first of all, he stated that he called a meeting as to continuing the movement -- the transfer of refugees to the RPF zone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem of communication.  The question is simply whether you would agree that, in the present case, there has not been, procedurally, any notice of alibi by the Defence in relation to this incident.  Do you have any comment on that?  
THE WITNESS:
I am just speaking in my defence.  I am not a legal expert.  I don't know.  Maybe we can give that alibi.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	According to you, you were with your wife and children in Cyangugu on the morning of the 14th of June; is that right?  
A.	I left Cyangugu in the morning following the Zaire-nil divide up to Gisenyi, and from Gisenyi I went to Kigali.  
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you know very well that's not the question I asked you.  The question was, were you with your wife and children on the morning of the 14th of April in Cyangugu -- 14th of June, I am sorry?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone.  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  I told them goodbye that morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need help with your itinerary.  You said, "I left Cyangugu in the morning," and then you followed a particular road or itinerary up to Gisenyi.  Can you repeat that answer?  We don't have it in the two languages.  
THE WITNESS:
I said that I left Cyangugu for Kibuye.  I took the Kimonyo (phonetic) hill for Gisenyi, and then from Gisenyi the next year (sic) I left for Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That word; we need help with that word.  

"I took the..."  What did you take?  Can you spell it, please?  
THE WITNESS:
The Cyangugu-Kibuye road, and then from Kibuye I took the Congo-nil hill, that is, the road that leads directly to Gisenyi.  And from Gisenyi the next day I went to Kigali, Congo-nil, crête de Congo-nil.  So it is spelt.  Congo, then a dash and nil, N-I-L; that is, it's a slope, kind of.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the word crête also comes in there?  
THE WITNESS:
Should I spell crête, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just want the record clear.  We now have Congo-nil thanks to your spelling.  But in a previous version, I also heard the French word crête.  Now, if you used it, please help us so that we get all three elements of that name so that we can move on. Will you help us, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. It is spelt, crête-Congo-nil.:  So C-R-E with a small cap over E, then T-E.  Congo-nil.  It is the line, the upper slope.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You will agree with me, Mr. Renzaho, that you are the only person that has testified in the course of your defence to you being present in Cyangugu on the 14th -- morning of the 14th of June? 
A.	What I am telling you here is the truth.  My family was in Cyangugu on that date, and I have explained the meeting at which my representatives in the committee to organise the repatriation of refugees were present.  I wasn't there.  And that is what is mentioned in the report I gave you; the report I presented to you.  Thank you.  
Q.	Yes, and on the 15th of June, when you got back in the evening and there were no lights, do I take it that you didn't have any meetings at that point in time, to the best of your recollection?  
A.	When I returned in the evening of the 15th, there was no meeting. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
I would now ask that the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit P. 40.  It's under tab 5A of volume 1, and it's an interoffice memorandum, a UNAMIR document, Your Honours.  And I am looking at the third page, it's paragraph O -- K000326.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you say volume 1, Prosecution exhibits?  
MR. MOSES: 
That's correct.  It goes up to 30, and then after 30 it goes into 1A, 2A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, this is a memorandum dated the 15th of June, a UNAMIR document, and at paragraph O, the writer records this:   

"Finally, this morning, I received from the préfet of Kigali a letter dated the 14th of June 1994, which states that in their opinion the evacuation at Sainte Famille was unilateral as opposed to bilateral, as no trucks were moving to the RGF side." 

Do you see that, Mr. Renzaho?
A.	Yes, yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, I see it. 
Q.	You see, if they received a letter dated the 14th of June from you we're suggesting to you that you were in Kigali on the 14th of June?  
A.	Counsel, I think that there is a principle that I learnt a long while ago:  Authority is never absent.  So I had a number of people, since there was a bourgmestre of the commune and persons who participated in the coordination meeting for the exchange of refugees.  As, so, in the same report, it is stated that representatives of the préfet took part at that meeting.  It does not say that he himself took part in the meeting.  So the letter may have been written, but I was not the one who wrote it.  I was not there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this letter was from the institution, the prefect, but you, the person, was not there, you had delegated your power, someone else was acting?  Is that the evidence?  

THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And if we look at the next exhibit, which is Exhibit P.  41 under tab 6A, which is a UNAMIR report from Dallaire to Annan covering the period of 6 o'clock in the morning till 6:00 at night, and if I can refer you to page 3, the bottom paragraph, it's L0006963, this document records the following:   

"The CMO held a meeting with the COSRGF, ops officer gendarmerie, and the préfet of Kigali city at Hotel Diplomat." 

Once again, Mr. Renzaho, this is recording a meeting taking place between you and others on the 15th of June at a time when you say you were not in Kigali.
A.	It is the same principle.  It was a meeting -- was it a meeting at the Hôtel des Diplomates?  I don't know; I did not take part at that meeting.  But if it was a meeting that prepared evacuation operations, because that is where I got the report when I returned, I knew that my men attended that meeting.
Q.	Well, we have heard that you were made aware of the fact that people were taken from Saint Paul on that day and killed, correct? 
A.	I returned in the evening, in the dark, except for a few storm lanterns that were in the main hall of the building.  And immediately I was assailed by refugees who were complaining and saying that a major incident had taken place at the préfecture.  They told me about the departure of some refugees that were at the Kigali préfecture, and they also mentioned the kidnapping of persons at the Saint Paul centre.  So I received them there, and I remember that later on, in a report that I saw, that is, a report of the questioning of Nikuze, and Nkulikiyinka, Dieudonné, I saw something to the same effect.  So I was informed by refugees on the spot when I returned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the second name after Nikuze?  Can you just repeat that name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Nikuze -- N-I-K-U -- is that not the one, sir?  Astérie Nikuze.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, just listen, please.  Nikuze is easy.  I just want to make sure that the second person you referred to is the one we have correctly identified.  Could you repeat the second person's name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Dieudonné.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And neither the bourgmestre nor the conseiller who had asked for these people, the night before, to be arrested, nothing happened to them, did it, Mr. Renzaho?  You didn't arrest either the conseiller or the bourgmestre; yes or no?  
A.	They are still alive, I haven't killed them.  
Q.	They weren't arrested though, were they?  
A.	There was no legal system, Mr. Counsel, and I have discussed this issue at length.  
Q.	And they remained in their positions until you left Kigali; that's correct?  
A.	As you yourself can observe in the report that you showed, the UN report, the investigation was not conclusive, and from the deduction from the witnesses that you had here, you could not have the feeling that the end of that incident was -- is clearly perceived.  I received information to the effect that these people, through a bargain, were included in the group of persons transferred to the RPF side and that some of them even declared on Radio Muhabura that they were going to come back; this time they will be coming back with the attacking troops.  We were conducting investigations, and you will agree with me that the situation was so complex that carrying out an investigation required a lot of time.  We were in June, and at the end of June we were leaving the city.  Can you at least give me the benefit of not having enough time to apply the indispensable sanctions, and that I did not have the indispensable structures to implement such sanctions.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, I am in fact suggesting to you that the reason nothing happened to anyone is because you were there at Saint Paul's on the morning of the 14th of June, telling ALG that you would take care of things, and then went on to tell those militia, including BUO, to carry out the attack.  That's why nothing was done to investigate or punish anyone there because you were right at the heart of it.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I will tell you exactly what I heard from the testimonies that I heard with everybody here present.  In the testimony of Witness KZ --
Q.	Mr. Renzaho I am sorry, I don't need you to go through all the testimony.  I have put a simple proposition to you which you either agree with or you don't agree with.
A.	You say it is simple; I do not accept it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And just for the record, the Dieudonné you referred to a couple of minutes ago was Mr. Nkulikiyinka, number 376; is that so, Mr. Renzaho? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, on the early morning of the 17th of June, you found out that the RPF had come and rescued some of the refugees from Saint Paul's, didn't you?  
A.	I did not have the opportunity to realise that because I did not go there.  I spent the night watching because the artillery had fired all night long. 
Q.	When do you say you found out about the RPF incursion at Saint Paul's? 
A.	Well, listening to the firing that had broken out at about midnight and which continued until morning, and the firing went right up to the top of the plateau, so I was expecting an attack to overrun that position.  So I heard it like everybody else did.  
Q.	So was that the early hours of the morning of the 17th of June, then?  
A.	Counsel, I am saying that the firing broke out at about midnight, shortly before midnight, and continued until dawn of the 17th, in the morning.  
Q.	When did you find out that people had been taken from Saint Paul's?  Was that early in the morning of the 17th of June? 
A.	I will tell you my reaction; what I did. 
Q.	No, no, I don't want to know your reaction, Mr. Renzaho.  All I want to know is when.  When did you find out that people had been taken from Saint Paul's?  
A.	At about 11 a.m. on 17 June 1994, Counsel. 
Q.	And you had been called, in fact, earlier that morning by one of the priests from Saint Paul's, hadn't you, Father Paulin?  
A.	That is incorrect, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, you have heard Witness KZ describe how he was present when Mr. -- when Father Paulin called you, and that Father Paulin got off the phone and told others at Saint Paul's that the priests at Saint Paul's had been hiding Inyenzi and deserved their fate? 
A.	That is a statement of your Witness KZ.  But I am telling you that I received no telephone call.  And if Father Paulin was still alive -- and I said that I sent somebody to check, and that the father, the priest had died two weeks before -- I just wanted to have things clear in my mind.  What you were told was not correct.  
Q.	What KZ said about Father Paulin having been a schoolmate of yours was true, wasn't it?  
A.	He was not in my batch at school.  He was younger, but he is somebody I knew very well.  
Q.	You were extremely angry at the RPF having gone in the early hours of the 17th of June to take away the Tutsi refugees from Saint Paul's weren't you, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	Counsel, the statements I made I included in the interview I had with Radio Rwanda on 17 June 1994.  It is in that interview that I expressed all what I thought about the attack.  Thank you.  
Q.	Yes, well, perhaps it's an appropriate time to look at what you said on the 18th of June, in fact.  
MR. MOSES:
And that's P. 63, Your Honours, page -- it's at tab 18, English is page 6, the fifth paragraph, and in the French, it's on page 9 in the first paragraph.  

And as it's being brought over, it's the very final document, the final tab, Your Honour, in the -- and, Your Honour, I am going to read out from the sentence beginning, "Look at what happened in Kabgayi," it's the second sentence of the fifth paragraph. 

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	This is what you said, Mr. Renzaho:

"Look at what happened in Kabgayi and here at the Saint Paul pastoral centre where they killed and injured many others.  There they killed the inhabitants, except for their kind, whom they took with them." 

That's what you said on the 18th of June, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And when you talk about "their kind", you are talking about Tutsi, aren't you? 
A.	That is correct.  And I am telling you that that is how it happened, because those that were not selected by the intelligence service were simply killed. 
Q.	But, Mr. Renzaho, you will agree that you are portraying the Tutsis as not your kind, aren't you?  They are the RPF kind.  
A.	Those who agreed to go over to the RPF had the right to do so.  But in other times, it was possible to indicate to the population that people had the right to go where they wanted, so that should be clear.  Now, if they wanted to go over to the RPF, it meant that they felt more secure with the RPF.  That is an obvious fact that I cannot deny.  Thank you.  
Q.	The RPF and the Tutsi refugees, they were all Inyenzi, weren't they?  All the same kind?  
A.	I did not say that.  I would not like words to be put in my mouth.  That is not it.  I didn't say so.  
Q.	You certainty weren't addressing, on the radio, on the 18th, those persons of the kind who were at Saint Paul's centre, were you?  You were addressing Hutus?  
A.	Counsel, we still had persons -- we still had lots of Tutsi refugees at Hôtel des Mille Collines and at the Kigali city préfecture offices.  They were also at the Notre Dame de Cîteaux and Charles Lwanga in Nyamirambo; there were lots of people.  So the only operation that was conducted in the night of 16th to 17th could not take away everybody that was still on our side to the RPF.  So there were still persons who had to be evacuated to the RPF side.  Thank you.  
Q.	You see, Mr. Renzaho, when you look at what you'd said here, when you hear what Witness KZ said about what you had told Father Paulin in the morning of the 17th of June, it's all very consistent, isn't it, with what happened subsequently; namely, attacks were led but by you on those Tutsi refugees who remained at Sainte Famille as a retaliation of what the RPF and their kind had done? 
A.	Counsel, for the Prosecution, you have made an assertion that requires to be examined carefully.  In previous questions that you have asked me to the effect to know whether I was there on the spot, I told you that I was not there because the operation that was carried out on that site in the night of 16 to 17 June 1994 was a proper military operation, and that operation was successful as normal law and order operations, as we know them.  And those who planned that operation have never told us at what time that operation was supposed to end.  So I don't know how I would have presumed to go to the site, not knowing what had happened and not knowing what to do, since I had neither the means of carrying out any action, and since the people had been taken away in any case.  And, so, I don't know if your assertion has any basis that will convince me that, really, on that night, for an attack that ended at dawn, I mobilised resources and prepared a counterattack on people who had already left.  There were the Rwandan armed forces who could attack the Saint Paul site.  The attack soldiers of the RPF broke through the FAR lines.  From that point on, the operation was purely military, and it did not concern me.  

And I have never received a complaint from the army to claim that I had usurped their duties and interfered in military matters at Saint Paul.  So, it is an assertion that requires careful consideration, Mr. Prosecutor.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When Mr. Moses read out a quote from this exhibit, we should probably repeat that the first sentence was, "Look at what happened in Kabgayi".  That was the word.  And then there was another word which was pronounced a bit fast, that was Charles Lwanga, with other words, number 261.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Moving on to another topic, and it's the intercept of the telephone conversation that you had with Mr. Rugambarara which you denied here.  That's the next topic I want to address briefly.  Can we agree on a few things regarding what is said in the radio -- in the telephone intercept, even if we can't agree on the fact that it was you, Mr. Renzaho?  Firstly, would you agree that the speaker, the bourgmestre, is speaking to a préfet? 
A.	I heard it, yes.  
Q.	And the préfet is talking about sending troops from the town to Kigali-rural, correct? 
A.	I did understand there was a request for intervention of armed forces towards the area that was attacked.  That's what I heard.  
Q.	Very well.  You will agree also that the person who is named as the préfet -- or called the préfet is telling the bourgmestre for -- that persons should be exterminated?  That was the word that was used, wasn't it?  
A.	I think the conversation was in Kinyarwanda.  I don't know -- the translation is perhaps the sore point, I don't know.  I don't know.  There are different ways of interpreting words in Kinyarwanda.  So perhaps you are taking the translation that fits your theory.  
Q.	I am relying on the official translation, Mr. Renzaho.  You disagree that the Kinyarwandan words used mean "to exterminate"?  
A.	I do not agree, Mr. Prosecutor, all the more so since on the date of 18th, 19th and 20th I know that the entire region was occupied by the RPF.  

I received the bourgmestre, Rutagangwa (phonetic), Jean Marie Vianney, whose statement I have over Radio Rwanda here; he spoke of what was happening.  He spoke to all Rwandans.  And what he was saying was quite true.  So how do you want to convince me that we spoke of extermination, of a situation where an entire region was already occupied by the RPF?  Extermination by whom?  That is the problem.  And it's true there was extermination underway, that's true.  But it was the RPF that was exterminating.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Renzaho, is it your view that the words mubakindagure rwose does not mean "exterminate them", linguistically, leaving aside the context?  
THE WITNESS:
It doesn't mean extermination.  Maybe it means -- it depends on the context.  If you hit hard on someone, you say muta -- you say "I hit him, I struck him, I gave him a blow".  Mubakindagure doesn't mean to kill, it means to strike very hard, a drive, a strike, a blow; it doesn't necessarily mean the death of a person receiving the blow.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Can you help me understand, Mr. Renzaho, are you saying now it was you but you were meaning something different than the translation that we have been given?  
A.	No.  First of all, you mustn't regard Bicumbi as being part of Kigali-rural.  I had enough problems on my plate in Kigali.  Why and how could I concern myself with what was happening in this very distant commune that wasn't part of my daily concerns, my daily duties? 

Secondly, I think that the events, such as people narrate them, would involve the -- a certain amount of infrastructure being in place.  I am saying that on the 7th, the telephone, even to Kanombe, in any rural areas, did not operate.  I couldn't speak to my family.  Numbers beginning with 7 were faulty from the 7th at 8 o'clock in the morning.  Did I have a switchboard at the préfecture?  

I don't understand, Mr. Prosecutor, and I cannot commit myself to a situation where I don't see myself at all.  Moreover -- and I should like to finish with this -- something I do not manage to seize.  Your cassette was used, I know, in another trial.  They could not identify who had recorded the cassette.  In my specific case, the man who was brought here showed everything -- explained everything, except that he was the author -- original, authentic author of the cassette, and he didn't even bring an original cassette.  So there is something confused around this that leads me to think that somewhere or other there is manipulation.  Thank you very much.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, at the beginning of the witness's answer he used an expression that the interpreter did not get.  Something about a slice of cake on the tongue.  I don't know if it's important or not, if you want it repeated.  But we did not interpret the expression, not fully understanding it.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for drawing our attention to it.  I think we can leave it a bit unclear, just that part.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So the reason you are saying you didn't contact your family on the 7th was not because they didn't have a telephone, but you are saying the numbers with 7 in Kanombe weren't working? 
A.	I am telling you that 7 already wasn't working, Kanombe included, in the eastern section of those using the 8; 7 only functioned in town, the former town, the heart of the town, the traditional city itself.  But you couldn't call anywhere else with the telephones, the lines were faulty.  
Q.	All right.  Kigali-rural is not, can I suggest, a long way off from where you were préfet; it's a neighbouring commune?  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	That is not correct, Mr.  Prosecutor.  If you are speaking of Bicumbi, Bicumbi is even further than Kanombe.  It's of course, neighbouring Kanombe, but further on.  In relation to the town, it's quite far away.  
Q.	And the préfet of Kigali-rural was Mr. Karera, correct? 
A.	The préfet of Kigali-rural, yes, he was appointed a préfet sometime between April and July 1994.  I cannot recall the exact date. 
Q.	And around the 15th to 20th of April, he was in Kigali was he?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, really, if I could answer in the affirmative I would do so, but I have nothing to go on.  I have no way to answer you on this.

1215H
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, bearing in mind the context of what is recorded, and you have wanted to hide context throughout your testimony, you will agree with me, would you not, that in terms of who it might be, who was a préfet, talking of troops being sent from town to Kigali-rural, it would really either have to be you or 
	Mr. Karera, correct? 
A.	I know absolutely nothing about that.  I can speak for myself.  As far as I was concerned, I couldn't speak of a virtual situation which I did not know of, so it was not me that spoke in all that business. 
Q.	And we have heard, haven't we, from four persons who have known both you and Mr. Karera well, who all say it was you on the tape; and they're right, aren't they, it's clearly you speaking on that tape? 
A.	Well, that it would be right, I doubt very much.  I wouldn't be contesting that if they were right.  And then to say who someone is speaking on a cassette, well, really.  Were they there with the person?  I don't know.  So I don't understand the assertion, on what grounds it makes such an assertion, that someone spoke -- someone who spoke is this or that person.  

And the specialists have given me to understand that manipulation exists, fabrication, intonation of the voice, then you say it's someone else.  All the more so since this sort of document, and I have checked, was handed over by the general secretariat of the RPF.  No one can convince me of the opposite.  And from that point of view the document must be a fake; whether it's one way or another, it's a fabrication. 
Q.	All right.  And are you aware that in fact, just as the tape says, that troops are going to be sent to Bicumbi, that in fact FAR troops were sent to that particular commune at that approximate time?  Are you aware that in fact the reality was consistent with what is recorded on that tape? 
A.	I know nothing of it. 
Q.	Well, if I can ask you to look at P. 27.  
MR. MOSES:
It's at tab 23, Your Honours. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Volume 1?  
MR. MOSES:
Volume 1, thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	We have already looked at this particular document in respect of the third matter that is recorded on page 2 of it.  It's regarding monitoring of Radio Rwanda news.  What I'd like to have you look at is in fact paragraph 1 from the 24th of April, 1900 hours.  

It says, "The Rwandese army keeps firm in fighting against the enemy.  This was announced by the ministry of defence.  The same ministry goes on stating that RPF soldiers kill innocent people as it was done today in a displaced camp in Bicumbi commune, some 30 kilometres from Kigali going east.  It affirms that the RPF continued to shell" - that's probably as far as we need to go.  

Now, I'm happy to read the rest of it just for completeness.  It affirms that RPF continued to shell into Kigali town to set fear into the civilians.  For this reason it calls on all the population to be aware and to point out any suspected RPF sympathiser or any RPF soldier to the RGF.

Now, Mr. Renzaho, especially looking at that final part, it's clear that as of the 24th of April, would you agree, it's talking about events in Bicumbi commune and it is calling on the population to point out any suspected RPF sympathiser or RPF soldier to the RGF?  The RGF were in Bicumbi commune around the 24th April, just a few days after the telephone conversation was recorded.
A.	Do you want me to answer or make a comment?  
Q.	I'm suggesting to you that that report on the radio, asking the population around Bicumbi where the RPF was to point people out to the RGF soldiers is consistent with what was on the tape, namely, there was a unit being sent from Kigali town to Bicumbi compound a few days prior to that news report? 
A.	I really have nothing to say.  I'm completely out of the loop.  I don't know if I'd been in any way involved, I could say, yes, I know this, we did this or that.  But I know nought, I know nothing about it. 
Q.	Well, I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you were -- it is you on that telephone conversation that was recorded and that you were telling the bourgmestre there to make sure that the people were exterminated, "Exterminate them truly", that's what you said, didn't you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I won't be - say such a thing.  Sing, sing, maybe we listen to your song, but really I'm happy to have to say what I say.  I know nothing about it.  This bourgmestre of Bicumbi, do you know the first time I saw him was in exile?  You speak to someone you know.  I never said those things and I've repeated it on several occasions.  I said yet again -- I said nothing of what you said.  I just do not see myself in the frame you paint. 
Q.	To a new topic, Mr. Renzaho, very briefly:  It's correct, isn't it, that you had persons going around the neighbourhood in Rugenge, R-U-G-E-N-G-E, looking for suspected infiltrators, looking for Inyenzi, looking for Tutsi, including those at Elie Munyankindi's house on about the 28th April?  You had persons going around doing those things, didn't you? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I'm here before the Trial Chamber, and I should like to say that I never had any unit of hunters, or any other specialised unit to go and seek out infiltrators.  I had no unit.  I told you how many policemen I had.  My only force was that.  

As for the rest of it, the population which was at home, how could I find people to go and seek infiltrators?  I had no units whose task it was, and all those who were with me can bear testimony to that.  That is what I say to you.  

Now coming to the reality through which we lived at the time of the events, you perhaps are talking of the presence of infiltrators in Kigali town.  Well, of course, there were.  That is certain.  And some of your experts say so.  You only need to read Dr. Des Forges, she speaks of it, and 
Professor Filip Reyntjens mentions it too.  I even have a film, if you allowed me to show it, I'd show you whether Mr. Jean Pierre Bugabi (phonetic), Mr. Ruzibiza who wrote a book -- a UNAMIR officer discussed this very, very delicate question and contrary to what people might think, yes, there were infiltrators in Kigali. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he said. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I was specifically asking about an incident in Elie Munyankindi's house and I take it from your answer that the answer is:  No, you didn't? 
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  No, I know nothing about it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just for clarity, Mr. Rugambarara was the bourgmestre of Bicumbi, true, Mr. Renzaho?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he should have been the bourgmestre of Bicumbi. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But Bicumbi is in Kigali-rural, that's your evidence, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And I'm further suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you also had a journalist known as 
	André Kamaye, K-A-M-A-Y-E, he was hunted down and killed, correct? 
A.	I've found that in the indictment you gave me.  Yes, I read that, Counsel. 
Q.	And you had him hunted down and killed, didn't you? 
A.	No, and, believe me, I had other duties to attend to, rather than run after somebody, whereas I was in charge of other persons. 
Q.	And that Akajigari, A-K-A-J-I-G-A-R-I, on about the 9th April, you were also present when Interahamwe were entering the homes of Tutsis in that area to kill them, correct? 
A.	No, I was not present, Counsel.  And I've had occasion to say something about this, I did so yesterday, yes, thank you. 
Q.	And in respect to a meeting that took place at Hotel Kiyovu in June, the reasons you provided in your evidence in-chief for you not taking part in such an incident were that it was not in your nature, you're not an adventurer, and you would not receive officers at Hotel Kiyovu; those were the reasons you gave in your evidence in-chief, correct? 
A.	Counsel, I would have found a lot more fundamental reasons, maybe it was the tiredness that destracted me, but I feel that the first reason was that I was not there.  I was not in Kigali and was not there.  

The second reason is that the hotel for quite sometime had not been functioning.  And not only was it not functioning, but at the period under consideration it was in the line of fire of the machine guns that were stationed 500 metres from there on the Muruhuto (phonetic) hill.  

And talking about the persons with whom I am charged, I immensely regret, and I must say so here, be it Colonel Bagosora, Colonel Ephrem Setako, Anatole Nsengiyumva, none of them can assert before people that they talked to me before 6 April and before that period.  And what I'm telling you is only sincere.  These persons, who curiously are situated with me at Hotel Kiyovu, were not there with me at the Hotel Kiyovu on 14 June 1994.  Bagosora was away on mission, out of the country for a long time.  And Anatole was then head of a secteur and an operational sector in Gisenyi.  I wonder if he had the time to come to Kigali for such a commonplace incident as a roadblock at the Hotel Kiyovu.  So one does not really see reasons why people should meet there.  

Setako was negotiating with the RPF at the UNAMIR headquarters.  We even have documents to attest to that.  They can come here and confirm that.  So I am saying if you put this together, I'll have a reason to tell you, Counsel, that I did not take part in that incident. 
Q.	Yes, well, Mr. Renzaho, you forgot to mention in your evidence in-chief that you were saying that you were out of Kigali at the relevant time, and your story is just coming apart, isn't that right?  You're trying to patch it up.  You were in Kigali on the 14th and 15th of June, weren't you? 
A.	I've told you that I was not in Kigali on 14 June.  I don't have any other means to make that clear to you, I was not there.  Besides, have you tried to look again at the attitude of Witness AF when he was narrating about Hotel Kiyovu?  Is it likely?  Is it probable?  

In the interval, I have contacted the former owner of Hotel Kiyovu who gave me very precious information on this issue.  And if it is necessary, I will communicate that information to you.  So I'm telling you again and again, that the Hotel Kiyovu incident did not take place. 
Q.	And I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Renzaho, that you were working together with many persons who shared your commitment to commit genocide of the Tutsi in Kigali during April to July.  They included Father Wenceslas, Rose, Angeline, Odette, all of those names that we've become quite familiar with during the course of the testimony.  And that you worked together with those persons and others to commit genocide.  
A.	Counsel, I would like to tell you that tragedies are not mere illusions, tragedies are not imagined, tragedies involve the killing of people and happened in broad daylight.  Tragedies do not even seek to hide evidence because they are obvious.  
The tragedy that we experienced in Kigali from April to July 1994, I've tried to go through it all with you and the Chamber here, and I believe I have not found enough words to express that tragedy.  I think it is beyond any kind of play acting.  If there was any evidence that could involve me with any group of persons with whom I agreed or planned to carry out an extermination campaign against the Tutsis, then I will not even ask to leave this hall; I'll ask that my head be cut off right here before you.  

And what I've tried to demonstrate proves clearly that not only did these people not have any relationship with me at the time, but also at the material moment I was not alone.  There are people who contend that I was with this or that person and did this or that thing.  

Counsel, sincerely, I believe, I do regret that if I had more bad people material I would disclose them to you because I am one of the main persons who suffers a lot from what happened in Rwanda.  And if I could, I would do everything to get to the bottom of all these things.  Thank you. 
MR. MOSES:
Did Your Honour have a question?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, the truth of the situation is that you and the militia soldiers and gendarmes who were working for you and together with you, carried out a plan which was the destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group, the accomplices, that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel, you certainly have an objective to attain.  That notwithstanding, I would like to tell you something. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, no -- to be honest, no.  I'm sorry.  Do you agree with the proposition I put forward?  I take it from your evidence that you don't; but I just want to have that recorded on the record? 
A.	I do not agree with your proposition and you are the one who is saying that the proposition is simple. 
MR. MOSES:
All right.  Your Honours, I'm getting towards the end of the cross-examination.  There are a number of matters that I just want to go through briefly from his 1997 statement and then wrap up with a final proposition. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So, I would ask, Mr. Renzaho, that you take another look at the statements you prepared from 1997, and I want to briefly and quickly to go through a number of passages in it.  If the witness -- I don't know if he has the statement from 1997, testimony on the bloody tragedy of the people of Kigali from 6 April? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you have this document in front of you, Mr. Renzaho?  Page?  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honours, if I can refer the witness to -- it is page 4 of the English version below the second paragraph, "The meeting adopted the following emergency measures".  And the French -- looking at page 6 of the French after the second paragraph with The meeting adopts. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you see in that document you listed, I believe, nine measures to be taken as part of a plan at the meeting on -- that you say took place on the 8th of April; do you see those there?  And, in particular at number 8, you talk about action against looting.  Do you see that, Mr. Renzaho?  The action against looting is on page 7, and you say that this action was taken against looting in collaboration with the army.  You talk about a contingent set aside to deal with the looting; do you see that, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	I do see it, Counsel. 
Q.	There's no action plan with the army or anyone else to stop killing, is there? 
A.	I am not authorised to speak on behalf of the army, which had its commanders. 
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, you have stated that the meeting there was adopting a process where you in conjunction with the army were going to have people set aside to stop looting.  There is nothing in your action plan that you have recorded there to deal with -- involve anyone to stop killing.  There is to stop looting, but not to stop killing; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel, may I say that looting went hand-in-hand with killing.  If there was looting, notably in the populous neighbourhoods, then it was accompanied by killing, that is a fact.  And you did not give me time to tell you what I had to say on the name of the sub-lieutenant that appears in that document.  It was precisely upon insistence that people, the local authorities, instead of working just anyhow, had somebody who dealt with the issues and who referred to the military authorities on the ground who intervened.  That was the mission of that young man and we intervened with the elements of the gendarmerie.  

But as the fighting went on, the gendarmerie unit was engaged in battle and was no longer available.  And it already mentions how the local community could use -- to instill order in the neighbourhoods could work.  

And I also forgot to tell you that since the army had no other possibility of intervening, since it came in late, positioned its lines just outside the populous neighbourhoods, that collaboration was therefore necessary. 
Q.	But you'll agree with me that there was no action plan put in place to deal specifically with the killings, was there? 
A.	That is the plan I'm telling you about because intervention in the neighbourhoods was precisely to get at killers and looters.  That is what I was talking about. 
Q.	Protection of property was far more important to you, wasn't it, than protection of the innocent Tutsi civilian population because they were just Inyenzi? 
A.	No, Counsel.  I've heard that comment from Madam Des Forges.  I (unintelligible) against that gratuitous assertion.  The property first belonged to the persons that had been prosecuted (sic), the Tutsis in the neighbourhoods that were defending -- well, apart from the few cases in the commission -- Egena centre that was brought up.  That centre was attacked on a number of occasions and as we came in several times and disposed of them, as well as in the neighbourhoods.  So that is the problem we had.  That is what we had to do to protect those people.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have in English that the property belonged to the persons that had been "prosecuted"; is that what you said in French?  
THE WITNESS:
That is it, Mr. President.  The property belonged to the persons who were persecuted, who were unsafe. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Persecuted, thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	The next statement I went to refer you to, Mr. Renzaho, is in the English, page 7, the final 
	two paragraphs.  And in the French it's on page 12.  It is the third to bottom paragraph, Mr. Renzaho, commencing with the word "avec".  

Let me refresh you with what you said in 1997 about the situation in Kigali, "With the supervision of the people, PVK authorities could practically control the situation from 17 April 1994 because there were no longer massacres in Kigali town.  Fortunately, that situation came with the stability of the battlefront, which remained almost stable until 4 July 1994; that is, the day civilians evacuated from Kigali."  

Now, that's what you said in 1997, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	It is true, that is what is written.  But there are two aspects.  First, the stability -- the stabilisation of the situation, which at the end of the month of April was relatively under control in the neighbourhoods.  If there were killings, then really they were outbursts in keeping with the information we received.  But generally -- and you can receive confirmation for this in the report of the ICRC at the time.  

So, this situation was coming under control in the neighbourhoods with respect to the killings.  But with regard to the fighting, I don't know.  There's clearly a mistake, because fighting continued, that is certain.  Fighting continued especially towards Nyamirambo and the south of Mount Kigali and probably towards the interior of the country, maybe to close off the little outlet that was the outside world.  So, I mean, the fighting did not stop.  Since I personally had to place my head on the ground and creep up to Mount Kigali.  I mean the firing was so intense.  So there must be something not quite correct there. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Renzaho, the only thing not correct is what you've been telling this Court.  This is consistent, isn't it, with what the prime minister said, namely, that you had Kigali under your control?  It's consistent with that, isn't it?  The PVK authorities could practically control the situation from 17 April? 
A.	That is not correct, Counsel.  And this -- your personality, the prime minister, if he had the courage to stay on, he would have spoken in this area with some authority.  Thank you. 
Q.	And the witness you called, remember last week?  I think it was Witness PAT.  He agreed with the proposition I put to him, that if the war front was stable from the 17th of April, there's no reason why the military and others couldn't take down and control the situation in Kigali; in fact, that's what the situation was.  It was only that the communal authorities and the military didn't want to stop what was going on; that's the situation, isn't it? 
A.	Your scenario is not realistic.  First, from the operational military standpoint in Kigali, if I spoke to you about the hurried recruitment of soldiers who went to reinforce the army, it means that the army was entirely eroded.  And I heard that officer, he took up command of the unit that was in Mount Kigali, that had lost almost 75 per cent of its force.  

So, how do you expect me to accept your proposition?  It is not correct.  The Rwandan troops had to face the RPF troops that were reinforced and that continued to receive reinforcements from outside.  And I show you that the situation continued to worsen until we left Kigali.  So, there was no force to wage war on the citizens or to compel them to dismantle the roadblocks.  You understand that if it were possible, the army would have done that well before, but it was not possible. 
Q.	That's not what you said in 1997, is it? 
A.	What is written here is not gospel, all the more so as we were in a situation of distress.  We were emerging from death and we told ourselves that the little that we had in our heads we could put down in writing.  So don't take it as the gospel.  It was not written in optimum conditions that would enable anybody to write a very consistent and exhaustive text.  Please, I do ask that of you. 
MR. MOSES:
I note it is about 1 o'clock.  If I can just indicate, I only have one more matter to put to him from this statement.  Then I have a concluding matter which might take perhaps ten minutes.  So, I would expect I would be approximately 15 to 20 minutes at most after the lunch break, if that's of any assistance or guidance to my learned friend. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you for that information.  Could you, just like the Defence, put on a piece of paper the documents you want to tender?  I think of those you had in your bundle you have used four new documents and you may wish to assist Mr. Matemanga with those four.  

We will then have re-examination.  I leave it to the Defence to -- based on the time of re-examination to consider whether there will be time for Mr. Lugan to start his testimony today and when he should be called.  Do you have a preliminary response to that question?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, if the Prosecution sticks to his timeframe, the timeframe he's given us, I believe we could start with the history expert this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If that's the case, we must make sure that he's available from around 3:30 or 4, what would be your -- 
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, we will inform you.  Since he was scheduled to start this afternoon, then he should be available. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very good, the Court is adjourned to 3 o'clock.  
(Court recessed from 1301H to 1502H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

We'll now hear the last part of the cross-examination.  

Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Renzaho, looking at the same document, your statement from 1997, I'd ask you, please, to look at page 18 in the French.  And it's the second paragraph commencing (French spoken).  And in the English, it's on page 10 about the seventh paragraph.  It's under the heading, "Relationship with international community".  

It's just one sentence I want to read to you, Mr. Renzaho, and ask for a comment.  There you say, "Moreover, I did my best to protect property belonging to various embassies until the evacuation from Kigali.  Certainly as from then on I could no longer do anything."  

Now, a simple question, Mr. Renzaho:  What did you do to protect the property of the embassies? 
A.	Thank you.  I noted that in Kigali there were a number of embassies that had left some staff behind and I tried to provide assistance, especially to the embassy of Tanzania, the embassy of Germany, the embassy of France, the headquarters of the European Union community, and a number of other buildings, especially the Korean embassy, I believe, towards Rwanga.  We did our utmost in order to strengthen the protection team of these embassies.  

Furthermore, within the framework of the logistics committee that had been set up, I tried to recover all the vehicles of NGOs that had been abandoned here and there on the streets and the vehicles were assembled in the UNDP parking in Kigali.  Up until the 3rd of July the parking lot was full.  So this is what we tried to do. 
Q.	In terms -- perhaps I'll be more specific, if I can.  In terms of protecting the property of the embassies, which is what we are talking about in that paragraph, did you place guards at the embassies to protect their property? 
A.	We provided assistance to the guards that were there and we patrolled the different locations and we did provide additional security.  And besides there were refugees who tried to seek refuge in these locations, a few of them.  There were a few refugees there. 
Q.	All right.  I'll leave that.  

Mr. Renzaho, you will recall the questions I put to one of the Defence witnesses regarding a comment that General Ndindiliymana had made to General Dallaire around the 20th of May 1994, where 
General Ndindiliymana had told General Dallaire not to trust you, you remember that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So General Ndindiliymana didn't trust you, did he? 
A.	I don't know what it means:  Trust somebody. 
Q.	Okay.  We'll move on to another issue, and I'd ask you to look at Prosecution Exhibit 22 at tab 17.  It is a UNAMIR interoffice memorandum signed by General Dallaire dated 27th January 1994.  And it's only in English, Your Honour.  This was a memorandum requesting to establish a small radio monitoring and translation centre in UNAMIR.  

And in paragraph 2, halfway down, General Dallaire gives us one of the reasons for requesting such a unit, "For example, it came to my attention that the préfet of Kigali stated on the Kinyarwanda radio station that the RPF is sheltering the persons in the CND who committed recent murders in Kigali.  This type of statement is inflammatory and untrue, but can only be refuted by UNAMIR if we know about it in an accurate and timely manner."  

It's clear from that document also, I suggest, Mr. Renzaho, that General Dallaire is recording the fact that he believes you to have been making untrue statements over the radio in January 1994; do you agree that is what the document shows? 
A.	Well, you have just read it out and I could not respond otherwise, that is what is written.  But is it the truth?  We are on the 27th January of 1994.  On the 27th of January of 1994 the war had not reached the city of Kigali yet.  How would it have come to my mind to denounce bombings in the town when there had been no fighting in Kigali?  There were murders, that is true.  There were acts of violence.  There were armed attacks, but I would never have just denounced shelling of neighbourhoods when on 27th January 1994 the war had not yet reached the city of Kigali.  Thank you.  I think this is yet another example of manipulation. 
Q.	And the prime minister, Kambanda, was asked about whether you were someone to be trusted; that is on side B, K0154886.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, and we will come to that.  But the point in this document is that it is argued that there is an untrue statement on the radio concerning persons in the CND who committed recent murders in Kigali; did you make such a statement?  
THE WITNESS:
All my statements on Radio Rwanda have been put on transcripts, and I wonder why some of them are available and others are not.  What you should remember is that I intervened when it was necessary to do so.  

Just to tell you that I did not replace the authorities who were to rule on specific cases, such as the minister of information or any other official who was in Kigali.  So, I do not recall having made such a statement.  I don't recall, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And now the Kambanda statement. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  It is in the side B document KO154886, the first four -- first two questions and answers.  And in the French, it`s on page 25 commencing with the words (French spoken). 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In this passage, which I'll read, Mr. Kambanda was asked about you, "Was he" -- referring to you -- "someone you trusted?  Could you say he was honest and told you the truth?  Or, was he someone whose word you couldn't take as such?"  The answer given was, "No, I couldn't say he was telling me the truth."  I believe the French says, "I couldn't say that out loud either, but I knew he wasn't telling me the truth."  

That's what is recorded there, Mr. Renzaho.  And can I suggest to you that the picture built up by the comments from the head of gendarmerie, the head of UNAMIR, and the prime minister are of someone, namely yourself, who is making false statements and is not to be trusted.  And that's an accurate picture of you, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I wish to answer your question, but give me sufficient time to answer your question correctly.  First of all, the allusion you're making to the general chief of staff of the gendarmerie is his responsibility and the responsibility of the person he discussed it with.  Every single time 
	General Dallaire required my services he contacted me and he asked me to attend meetings he organised.  And there was never a time when he submitted a problem to my attention which I did not try to solve.  If he had any specific observation to make to me, I believe he would have done so.  
Now, as regards the chief of staff of the gendarmerie, in particular, I wish to observe that I'm not here -- I know that he is here and that he is also standing trial.  I am not here to say anything that might have some bearing on his case.  But let me merely note that I was not employed by him and that in most of the cases for which I had to ask for the intervention of the gendarmerie, he was not there, and these interventions were successful.  

So my question is, quite frankly, on the basis of what information he could judge a person he has never even talked to?  And I believe this is not typical of him.  It might happen.  He's my elder, and I don't think he is the kind of man who would say anything -- just anything, anything that would come to his head without any reason.  

As for Kambanda, I am going to repeat once again that I saw Kambanda again on the 
11th of April 1994.  This man was a political activist.  I had never had any dealings with him.  I did not know him.  On the 12th he left.  On what basis can he say that he trusts me or doesn't trust me?  On what basis did he ever trust me with a mission I did not carry out?  Or did we ever exchange words or nothing?  I don't see when such thing happened.  

And I will even go further:  In another trial that took place here there was an individual who was asked to testify and who recounted horrible things regarding this meeting of the 11th of April 1994.  I would have preferred for that person to be facing me and to repeat what that person said.  Unfortunately, I was not present.  But other people who were present confounded him completely.  

So what is one to believe?  This is manipulation.  People are saying I am not to be trusted.  I have worked with people who have always trusted me.  I have friends who even to this day in the prison trust me.  I have not betrayed anybody.  I have not tried to harm anybody.  This is my nature.  And I'm not of those people who will say the truth with brutality, with too much brutality. 
Q.	The truth is, Mr. Renzaho, you committed genocide in Kigali between April and July 1994 and that your attitude towards the Tutsi in Kigali throughout that period was that of "je m'en fou", I don't care.  That's the truth, isn't it, Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I believe you should show more humility, and history will show that.  Forgive me for saying such a thing to you.  I believe you should not make any premature judgement.  Time will tell.  I know what I did and I am too modest because, as I stated previously, what happened to Rwanda was nothing that the small country deserved.  

And if you consider that all the chain of events which have led to the downfall of this country are to be attributed to me, well, I believe you can then make such a statement.  But otherwise, let me tell you in full conscience that I do not give any credence to what you have just stated. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, that is the end of the cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Do you have the list of exhibits available?  
MR. MOSES:
I do, Your Honour.  It's only -- there are a number of documents listed in this document.  It is only numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 that were in fact used during the course of the cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could the Defence be given a copy of this document?  
MR. MOSES:
Absolutely. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This seems accurately to reflect the documents that were used during cross-examination.  Any problems or objections with the tendering of these four documents, Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
No, we are looking at the list, and I believe we don't have any problem with it, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much indeed.  

Mr. Matemanga, will you tell us what is the first next Prosecution number?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
P. 114. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So number 2 becomes P. 114, number 3, 115, number 4, 116 and number 5, 117. 
MR. MOSES:
Just in respect to that, the first document and the last two documents both have an English and a French. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
A for the French and B for the English in P. 114 and P. 116 and P. 117.
(Exhibit No. P. 114A and P. 114B admitted) 
(Exhibit No.  P. 115A and P. 115B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 116A and P. 116B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 117A and P. 117B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before giving the Defence the floor for re-examination, I think it might be useful to address the issue of Mr. Lugan.  You will recall, Mr. Moses, that you indicated that there were two possible scenarios for the way you would approach the expert.  We have the expert report.  We also have your notice under 
Rule 94 bis where you dispute the witness's qualification as an expert, where you do not accept the report as an expert witness statement and where you wish to cross-examine Mr. Lugan.  
It is, of course, up to you whether you would wish to carry out a voir dire and go into these matters.  But you may be aware that our Chamber has heard Professor Lugan on two occasions in Ndindabahizi and Military I.  In Ndindabahizi it was undisputed that he was an expert and in Military II it was disputed, but we ruled in favour of his expert status.  So, you may wish to consider the situation. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm well aware -- well aware of that situation.  Your Honours, I'm happy for perhaps a middle approach if my friends are happy with it.  That is -- I won't concede, they can simply tender the CV.  On the basis of Your Honours' earlier rulings, I assume, it's fair to say, you would qualify 
Mr. Lugan.  And really there are some questions I would like to ask him which there may be objection to on the basis that they should have been raised in respect of his qualification.  

Now, I'm happy for it all to be put in one group of questions as long as I'm not prevented from doing so during the course of his cross-examination.  That would, I think, speed matters up.  It would mean that we don't have to go through the procedure of a voir dire, I simply would not -- they could tender his CV, I would concede, but not ask any questions.  And then during the course of my cross-examination, I could deal with some of the matters which I was intending to cover in the voir dire.  

Now, if Your Honours were happy with that and the Defence are -- then the other thing that could speed matters up, as I indicated last week, is, on the basis that Your Honours found him to be an expert, I'd be happy for his report at that stage to be tendered and he simply be asked any questions -- follow-up questions, as it may be.  

Does that assist, Your Honours?  I don't know. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think that is a step in the right direction.  And we will come back to this immediately before 
Mr. Lugan will testify.  This was just so that no one will be taken with surprise and can plan the most expedient way to carry out examination and cross-examination on the next witness.  

Defence, you have the floor for re-examination. 
(Pages 37 to 50 by Melissa Hook)








1530H 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not wish to put any additional question to the witness, 
Mr. Renzaho.

But, may I broach the subject of Mr. Lugan, since it has just been referred to?  I am trying to follow my learned colleague.  From the accusation in his explanations, and if I understand him correctly, he is not contesting the expert status of Mr. Lugan.  If I understood him correctly, that is not exactly what was stated -- either we should engage in a discussion on the subject or we shouldn't.  

If you wish, and this is what I understood, if you wish to attempt to discredit Professor Lugan on the substance of his report, this might be dealt with during the cross-examination.  But for the time being, I wish to have your clear position on his qualification as an expert; it being understood, Mr. President and Your Honours, that we do have the CV of Professor Lugan here in our files and that we are in a position to provide it.  

As far as Mr. Renzaho is concerned, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not have any re-examination.  As for Mr. Lugan, I am trying to understand exactly what my learned colleague from the Prosecution wishes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will come back to that.  

Mr. Renzaho, we have now heard your examination-in-chief, cross and re-examination, and this means that your examination has come to an end.  We would like to thank you very much and you can now resume your seat together with the Defence team on the right-hand side.  Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, I wish to thank the Trial Chamber for having kindly listened to me, and wish it an excellent work.  Thank you very much.
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Moses, could you, in a very brief form, recapitulate your position in relation to Mr. Lugan, very briefly, please?  
MR. MOSES:
Yes, Your Honour, there are some questions which I had proposed to ask during a voir dire session, which I am happy to place in the body of my cross-examination of Mr. Lugan.  

My only concern with that is that I am not prevented from asking some questions regarding his world view, which may be -- which may be relevant to his interpretation as an historian.  

Now I can deal with those matters in cross-examination of -- and what I was proposing, Your Honour, is that in order to save time, if Mr. Lugan is sworn in and shown -- and produces his CV, I was proposing that I do not cross-examine him, and there would be no need for a voir dire, but that I would not concede, formally, his expertise, Your Honours' would then rule and he would then be -- and I am aware, Your Honour, that the Trial Chamber has found him to be an expert in the past.  And so I'm not wanting to belabour the point for the -- just for the sake of it.  So I would assume, Your Honours, 
would -- on the basis of his CV -- find him to be an expert; we could then proceed with his 
evidence in chief, and I could cross-examine and include some of the matters I had intended to ask during the course of his voir dire in the body of my cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would clarify the matter.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, Your Honours, if questions will be put to Mr. Lugan on the world in general, and his world view -- which is the term used by my learned colleague -- I shall wait until I hear the specific question, because I believe this will prolong the proceedings.  

In order to make matters simple, I believe we can deal immediately with the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination.  And I cannot tell you beforehand, my learned friend, whether I will accept these questions on the witness's world view.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The normal situation will continue, namely, that objections are made after having heard the questions, but we note then the position of the Prosecution and we call in the next witness, namely, Mr. Lugan.  
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, if it is of any assistance to the Trial Chamber, we had an English translation of the last portion of -- an official translation of the last 16 or so pages of the French report.  We didn't have time to have it all translated into English, but if having that final portion, which was dealing specifically with the issue of the Accused, if providing that to the Trial Chamber is of assistance, we can do that now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would appreciate that and, of course, the Defence will also get a copy of the English, an unofficial translation of the last 16 pages.  Thank you.  
MR. MOSES:
There are six copies here, Your Honours:  Three for Your Honours, one for the registry I believe, and one for the Defence -- and one for the Accused.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Lugan. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are a witness before this Tribunal, the exact status will be clarified in a couple of minutes.  
You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Bernard Lugan in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a CV of the witness, isn't there? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, we've gone to fetch it -- it will be here soon.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And hopefully the interpreters will get a copy, which they don't have as yet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would be good to have it very soon, actually now. 
MR. CANTIER:
I fully agree with the Trial Chamber; it's a small error, a technical -- a technical fault.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you have a few introductory questions in parallel with the photocopying of the CV so that you could start, Maître Cantier? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, that's exactly, indeed, how I intended to proceed. 
BERNARD LUGAN,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF ON VOIR DIRE
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Professor.  

Professor --
A.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Without a microphone:  "Good afternoon".  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, in view of the conversation that took place here, the question of your qualifications is no longer in doubt, that we are going to proceed with examination-in-chief and cross-examination as is the custom or as is customary.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not exactly the case.  We need now to be presented with the witness's CV and an overview of his qualifications, but those questions could be reduced to a minimum if we had the copy of the CV.  

Don't you want now to introduce the witness to the Chamber, highlight his professional activities in 
oral form now, while we are waiting for the CV?  And then the Chamber will rule on his expert status without much ado, and then we will start with the examination-in-chief proper.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, I had not quite understood where we stood, but now, however, I do.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, my first question, Mr. Expert, concerns your professional -- professional itinerary, and can you tell the Trial Chamber what you -- what tertiary distinctions you've -- qualifications you've acquired, especially the most recent ones? 
A.	The most recent -- the most recent date?  From 30 years ago, I have a state doctorate in history.  I am at the end of my career, so my qualification was obtained sometime ago.  
Q.	On what subjects did -- on what subjects were you dealing with that you -- that you obtained this doctorate? 
A.	I was studying Rwanda and my last memoir was a study of Rwandan economic and social history, more particularly, trading in Rwandan custom, and my doctoral thesis, which was several volumes long, between the servitude of the hoe and the bewitchment by cows -- or, bewitchments involving cows, a historical history of Rwanda.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, that's off the cuff.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we need a repetition of that.  The title of the thesis, will we find that on the CV? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you say it once more, only the title?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would you like it in French also, Mr. President or should we let him say --
THE WITNESS:
So, it's an enigmatic title, but it demonstrates the dualism of society -- traditional Rwandan society.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
So we'll try to translate it now.

THE WITNESS:
It is between the servitude of the hoe and the witchery -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'd have to think about that one.  
THE WITNESS:
The witchery associated with cows, rural -- traditional -- the traditional rural world in Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you to the interpreter for the efforts in connection with this enigmatic exercise.  

The next point? 
MR. CANTIER:
I do agree, Mr. President.  We have Professor Lugan's CV that we are in the process of photocopying as many copies as necessary.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, my next question is: In addition to these written works, did you continue your studies in relation -- in respect of Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have made reports -- for example, to the ICTR here, and I have written three works -- three books on the subject which are all three on my CV.  

There's an overall history of Rwanda that I am -- reneged upon, especially -- that I retract, especially part of it pertaining to contemporary history.  

Then, another work entitled, "Genocide, the church and Rwanda", I also retract part of what I've written there in view of what has unfolded since.  And a book for which I take full responsibility, the present status of my research specifically devoted to or dealing with the French army in Rwanda, entitled, "François Mitterrand, the French army and Rwanda".  And, finally, the last of my works which appeared a few months ago, "Rwanda, counter-investigation on the genocide".  In addition to which I have published a certain number of articles, and given interviews here and there -- without my specific teaching of Rwanda history before the trainees of the main French military academies.  
Q.	Thank you, Professor.  Let us come to your specific activities as a teaching -- as an academic teach -- with regard to your teaching, what -- and the institutions where it takes place? 
A.	My alma mater is University Lyon III, Lyon III, where I deal exclusively -- I teach exclusively 
African history and Rwandan history at the level of masters and doctorates.  

In addition to which I am -- I chair the seminar on African history at the interarmy defence college -- in fact, that's the new title of the École de guerre where we teach history, both French and African.  And I teach at the IHEDN, which is the Institut des hautes études de la défence nationale, I-H-E-D-N, the higher -- the defence college of higher military studies, the defence college of higher military studies.  

And lastly, I teach at the CHEM, C-H-E-M, which is the Centre des hautes études militaires, which is the highest level at which I teach, because there I train higher ranks -- colonels already awaiting their stars to be appointed generals.  So that is the highest level of training in the French army, and I have 12 to 15 trainees -- seminarists. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a reference to "CID" in your CV.  Have you told us what that abbreviation stands for? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I'll give it to you in full:  Collège interarmée de défence, interarmy defence college -- interarmy defence college, which is a barbarous term for what we still call in traditional terms, 
"l'école de guerre", roughly translated as "war school". 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Professor, does that mean beyond your historical competence or competencies in history, you also have competencies -- or, you're also competent in the military arts?  
A.	Counsel, if you're asking me to teach trainees how to pack their stomach parachute, I could do so, but that is not what I do.  I don't teach them how to use arms.  I -- what I convene is in the academic courses of the higher ranks.  So I know the military spheres and, I am of course aware of everything that might have a bearing on the commitment -- the reality or legends in relation to the French presence in Rwanda, and more particularly, in respect of the conflict of -- from 1990 to 1994 - the 1990 to 1994 conflict.  
Q.	Professor, could you tell us what methods you did employ in undertaking your work, and I am thinking in particular of your written works with respect -- in respect of the situation in Rwanda, let us say, after the 1980s? 
A.	Well, as any other scientist, I use a certain number and type of sources -- written sources, oral sources, primary sources, secondary sources and, of course, what is in constant evolution.  And I think one of the original aspects of my work is to attempt, to the extent possible, to keep track of things as they evolve, which means I work considerably with the lengthy proceedings underway here at the ICTR.  

And I must say that for some years the proceedings -- the documentation produced, the expert's report and others that are sent to me make it possible for me to advance considerably in this field.  So I'm in osmosis with what is being written here at the ICTR and I'm open to all available sources.  
Q.	Do you think in view of the work you've done, and you continue doing what you have produced, do you think -- and are producing -- do you think you are in a position to enlighten the Trial Chamber, to bring light to bear to the benefit of the Trial Chamber in respect of what happened in Rwanda after 1990, and more particularly, with respect to the role or position of the Accused? 
A.	Very modestly, but the Trial Chamber will be the judge of that.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, I think that with respect to the CV and the question of qualification, I have finished.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any questions at this stage, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES:
No, Your Honours, as I have indicated earlier, the Prosecution's position is that we don't accept, but we're not going to make any submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you been in Rwanda after 1994, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, as I had the opportunity to tell you a few months back, the answer is no.  I also said that I was very near to Rwanda, but I did not actually return to Rwanda itself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the fact that we may have met in the same courtroom previously, we still need to place everything on record in the present case.  

But, if you have not been to Rwanda since 1994, were you in Rwanda in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, in 1994 I was -- in 1994, I was in Africa but in another part of it, because at the time when the tragic events occurred in Rwanda, there was a great hope abroad in the southern part of the continent, in South Africa, and I was on the spot to see the changes -- the mutation that unfolded there at that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And were you in Rwanda before 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I -- I think altogether I spent about 11 years, give or take a few months.  If my memory serves me right, I arrived in Rwanda in September 1972 and I left in July or August 1983.  So, I stayed about 11 years over that period, and I was at the time professor of African history -- African and Rwandan history at the Université Nationale du Rwanda -- the UNR, the Rwandan National University. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Knowing now that you were 11 years in Rwanda before '94, but that you have not visited Rwanda in '94 or after '94, what is it then which makes you qualified as an expert before this Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
I think I have two-fold knowledge of Rwanda.  Firstly, knowledge on the ground; I think I'm amongst all the experts -- apart from the missionaries -- I'm amongst all the experts who have testified before you.  
I can name a few:  Filip Reyntjens, Alison Des Forges, André Guichaoua, Chrétien -- the one who stayed the longest in Rwanda, Chrétien himself never was in Rwanda; he was in Burundi.  Guichaoua came a bit later.  

Also, I'm the only Frenchman to have written a state doctoral thesis -- a state historical doctorate thesis on ancient Rwanda -- historical Rwanda.  And what distinguishes me from all the other experts is that I work on the long term in history -- historical Rwanda and present Rwanda because everything is connected.  

Add to that the facts that I have worked considerably in all the archives -- the existing archives on the contemporary situation.  In all modesty, as I've said before, I think I have a minimum -- I do know a substantial minimum about Rwanda and, more particularly, the period in question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have in front of us the CV of Professor Lugan who has been teaching at the institutions mentioned during the questioning by Maître Cantier.  He has written three books of a certain relevance to the matters at hand.  He has been in Rwanda for 11 years.  Admittedly, he was not there in '94 or later, but that is not an absolute requirement for becoming an expert.  Also other experts may not have been there in '94 and, indeed, only in brief periods thereafter.  

This Chamber has previously found Professor Lugan to fulfil the criteria of being an expert both in Ndindabahizi and Military I.  We are reaching the same conclusion now.  Another matter will be a concrete evaluation of the testimony based on the entire file.  But when it comes to the status, we will grant you expert status before this Tribunal, Professor Lugan, and you will now be examined in chief by Maître Cantier, who has the floor.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If at all -- it would be useful, Mr. President, we still don't have a copy of the CV in the booths. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear that, Mr. Matemanga?  Please make sure that the booths have the CV.  

You have the report? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's on its way, I believe -- oh, the report, we have it in French.  Has an English translation been finished?  We seem to have quite a bit of stuff.  Thank you. 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Expert Witness, we shall not deal with the history of Rwanda prior to the events that are of interest to us -- and which are of interest for this trial, even if, indeed, you can provide some responses on the matter.  My first question will be to ask you who, to your mind, launched the war of 
October of 1990 in Rwanda? 
A.	According to me, this is -- should not be the question.  We are in front of something that cannot be questioned, and has not been questioned.  The war was launched on the 1st of October of 1990 by the armed wing of the Rwandan patriotic front, which was the APR.  When it crossed the border into Rwanda from Uganda in the extreme north-eastern part of Rwanda -- in the northern part of the national Akagera park at Kagitumba -- do I need to spell out all the names or is the Trial Chamber familiar enough with the names? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber and everyone in the courtroom are familiar with most of the names, thanks to all the experience represented in this room, but if there is a name or two that we do not know, we will ask you to spell it, thank you.  

So we have noted the answer as to who started the war.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	What was the composition of these troops and what was their origin? 
A.	I wish to refer to the writings of the best expert of the RPF, who is Prunier, and I also wish to refer to the information notes that we were able to get from the French side or the Rwandan side -- the forces that attacked when crossing the border at Kagitumba are made up, for the most part, of units of groups or individuals, who up to then, had been members of the Ugandan army -- most of them.  With one particularity in that there were not any ordinary members of the Rwandan army, but were, rather, members that had one thing in common: They were the first generation offspring of the Tutsi who had fled Rwanda during the events that occurred throughout the independence and post-independence period, who had sought refuge in Uganda, in a specific region in that country, which is the region of the former kingdom of Ankolé, spelt A-N-K-O-L-É, acute, in French.  

This Ankolé region is peculiar because it is, in fact, the extension towards the north of Rwanda and in this Ankolé region, there a population which is related to the Tutsis of Rwanda, the Himas, H-I-M-A.  And throughout the long civil wars that would take place in Uganda, these Tutsis, these Rwandan Tutsis took the side of one of the Ugandan warlords, the present president, Museveni, who is a Hima, and who recruited 70 per cent of his troops within two ethnic national troops:  The Baganda, a population from Uganda, and the Tutsi as well as the Hima. 

President Museveni won the war.  President Museveni came to power and had in his army between 
25 to 30 per cent of Rwandan Tutsis, and this is at all levels, even the highest levels.  It is these Rwandan Tutsis who were members of the Ugandan army who, in fact, deserted that army and attacked at Kagitumba on the 1st of October. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This "Kagitumba", is that with a G or D?  Can you spell it once more slowly, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Kagitumba K-A-G -- it's a G, Kagitumba.  It is the border post which is located at the extreme northern point of Rwanda, Kagitumba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now "Baganda", can you spell that please? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, Mr. President.  Baganda is spelt B-A-G-A-N-D-A.  The Baganda are the subjects of the Buganda kingdom.  B-U-G-A-N-D-A.  Buganda, Baganda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we probably agree that Hima is written, H-I-M-A, is that so? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, there is a problem with Hima because further north -- and further south there are Hemas, the name of which is spelt H-E-M-A.  But in the present case in point it is Hima, H-I-M-A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for this.  Unless absolutely necessary, when I'm asking you to assist us with the spelling, please only give the spelling without any additional comments.  

And now we will hear Maître Cantier's next question.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, this conflict you have just referred to, is it, as -- and your answer has to be provided as an historian -- is it an internal conflict within Rwanda or is it an international conflict? 
A.	Both, Counsel, both, because we are dealing with a conflict which engages Rwandan refugees who attacked their homeland; that is to say, an internal conflict.  But these Rwandan refugees are 
members -- or were members of the army of a foreign country.  And throughout the war, from 
October of 1990 up to the victory of the Rwandan patriotic army in July 1994, the base for these fighters will be Uganda.  The logistics, medical base will be in Uganda, and also the place where they will go back to, because this will occur on two or three opportunities -- and perhaps we shall refer to it subsequently.  So, it is not only an internal conflict, but also an international conflict.  So it is quite difficult to provide any other answer than the one I just provided.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now Professor, you are well versed with the proceedings in this courtroom.  Can I ask you:  One, to speak slowly; and B, to be brief, and brevity is really important.  

Here comes the follow-up question.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, did this war of 1990 -- or, rather, was this war of 1990 at the origin of the events that this Tribunal is dealing with -- that is to say, the event that occurred in 1994?
A.	Yes, Counsel -- I am being brief, Counsel, yes.
Q.	Yes, well, Mr. Expert Witness, in order to improve the quality of our proceedings I am speaking to you in French.  You understand what I mean immediately, but please observe a pause between the question and your answer because the interpretation has to take place -- even if your answer is yes or no.  

So you have answered "Yes" to my question.  Could you briefly tell us what is the link between this war of 1990, and the events that occurred in Rwanda -- and, more specifically, from the 6th of April of 1994? 
A.	Once again, I shall be very brief and I shall give you four dates:  The war starts on the 1st of October, but it did not end with the defeat of the Rwandan patriotic army.  It continued with three peak events:  22nd of January of 1992, Ruhengeri attack; 5th of June of 1992, the attack on Byumba; the 
8th of February 1993, the attack in the direction of Kigali.  So the war continued with the final point of the campaign, the attack launched on Kigali on the 7th of April of 1994.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just given us the main episodes of the war throughout that period.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber what were the consequences of this situation on -- on interethnic relations in Rwanda? 
A.	Well, the four dates I have provided, I have tried to set up a framework.  Each of these attacks from the Rwandan patriotic army -- and let me specify that none of the attacks came from the camp of the Rwandan armed forces --  each of the attacks I referred to would lead to large-scale movements of population with many displaced persons.  And attack after attack, there is a problem that would be at the heart of the matter, which is that of the displaced persons.  Because Rwanda is a small country, geographically speaking, and the regions that are the most affected by the war are, in fact, the most densely populated areas of the three northern préfectures, which are Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Byumba.  

So, the first consequences of these attacks will be social in nature, because on the axis towards Kigali, there will be very large refugee camps that will be established.  The second type of consequence -- they are political in nature -- because since 1991, Rwanda had launched multiparty politics.  And the war, with the destruction it brought in its wake, and with the consequences of this war will completely disrupt the democratisation process.  I consider -- and I have already said so in my writings, that to compel Rwanda to democratise in a war context was an irresponsible attitude.  
Q.	I was about to put a question to you on political developments, but if you have something to add, 
Mr. Expert Witness, please go ahead. 
A.	Counsel, I am willing to answer your question.  I could speak about it for hours, but my -- I believe, it would be better for me to be specific and brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the question you were asked was a bit more specific than the answer -- namely, what was the consequences of the situation on interethnic relations in Rwanda?  With other words, the consequences of the war, and isn't the core that that led to increased tension? 
THE WITNESS:
That was a third part of my answer.  In addition to the social aspects and the economic aspects that we will not refer to, there was the problem of internal relations amongst the different parts -- or components of the Rwandan population.  

I must say that my analysis has somewhat evolved on this matter.  With hindsight, it is possible to see that the period -- the Habyarimana era was an era of ethnic pacification.  I shall not go into details of that, but it was so to the point, that some were led to think that the ethnic evil had been done away with and this ethnic evil will be awakened, because of the war -- and because of multi-party democracy.  Because the two elements will add on to one another and, perhaps, we can go into further details on the matter subsequently.  

For a number of Rwandan Hutus, the attack by the RPF will seem to be -- whether they were right or wrong -- but the weight of mentalities played a part, and this attack would appear as an attempt to put in question the 1959 revolution; that is to say, the accession of the Hutu majority to power.  I'm answering in brief, but of course I'm fully available to you in order to go further into details on this matter.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Expert Witness, you have talked about the military situation.  The specific question I wish to put to you and to which you have already partly answered has to do with the role of the democratisation process -- the interethnic relations in the country.  And please add on to what you had started saying without repeating yourself.  
A.	I wish to respectfully request from the President, if I can go further into this point, but I would need at least five or six minutes to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a long time.  

What do you need, Maître Cantier?  Please assist the expert witness so that you get what you need for the case.

1630H 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, my first question was put on the consequences of the war episodes, and inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda.  The expert witness made an aside and talked about the consequences of democratisation.  We interrupted him, and I would now like to -- the witness to be able to conclude his contribution, as rapidly as possible, on the consequences of democratisation on inter-ethnic relations.  
THE WITNESS: 
Late 1991, democratisation was launched with a clear trend towards multiparty democracy.  But the context is a context of war, so that several political poles will emerge, that of the attackers, the Rwandan patriotic army, which at the time made use of a strategy which was the conquest of power.  But, of course, no mention is made of that.  They will, instead of that, have democratic claims in order to try and destroy what one might call the Hutu bloc in order to weaken the Hutu population, that is to say the 80 per cent of the population, as compared to the 20 per cent represented by the Tutsi.  

Second bloc, or pole, that of the Hutu opponents.  I am going to set aside the small parties and focus on the main ones.  The democratic movement, which in some ways is at the head of the PARMEHUTU of the first republic, and from the beginning the war will bring about a break within this party.  All the members of the party want to overthrow General Habyarimana, but all the members of that party are not willing -- or, rather, are not ready, in the name of their fight against Habyarimana, to give the power to the RPF.  So the different trends will oppose one another within the MDR.  

As the war unfolds, and as the multiparty -- multiparty democracy system accelerated, because what is paradoxical, and what is incredible from the political standpoint, is that the war will not in any way hinder the advent of multiparty democracy.  The precipice is in front, and everybody is running towards that precipice.  

Third pole, which might be called the presidential movement, with all those faithful to President Habyarimana and the official movement.  This bloc will adopt the same policy as the RPF.  It will attempt to represent the main group facing the opponents, and will try to weaken its direct opponent, which is not the RPF, because from the electoral standpoint, the RPF only represented 20 per cent with the Tutsis.  Its opponent was the MDR, representing the Hutus from their central part of the country.  

So that everyone will officially play the democratic game, while cheating, in order to please international bodies, in order to please President Mitterrand.  Because President Habyarimana depended on French military assistance, which was one of the prerequisites for democracy.  So everybody will play the game of pluralism and democracy, whereas all of them are standing by their positions.  So that was the key, and this was brought about by the context of the war.  So one could not look at one without the other.  

And let me make an aside on this issue.  For me, my main point of divergence with Alison Des Forges, who minimised constantly in work, which is very respectable, but which minimises -- or, she has begun to change her position gradually, that reality of the war.  If you're not entirely immersed in the war situation at the time, you're advancing on only one leg.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	A question for you, Mr. Expert, which has concerned the Trial Chamber, all of us:  That term "Inyenzi".  From what you know of it, what is the meaning?  Is it pejorative?  Could you tell us, the historian that you are, how do you understand the term?  
A.	Counsel, you have given me the opportunity to give you a perfect example of the unfolding of historical knowledge.  History is never written, otherwise it's a religion.  In the case of Inyenzi, we are before a perfect illustration, perfect example.  I, first and foremost, for many years I wrote that Inyenzi was an invention by the Hutu to designate in a pejorative way the Tutsi who, like cockroaches, attack at night.  You don't see them, and in the morning they're on the walls of the houses.  And I wrote it -- I wrote it in my previous works.  And history moves on.  History moves on, and we learn, in rapid succession, that the concept of Inyenzi is anacronym.  It's an acronym invented as a standard by the Tutsi.  

Of course, I won't give you all the references, but -- it would take us too far from the subject at hand.  But we have the interview given in an RPF newspaper by the one who founded the Inyenzi, and whose name was Aloys Ngurumbe, N-G-U-R-U-M-B-E.  Ngurumbe, Aloys, or Aloisius, who in 1961 created the Inyenzi, and in the RPF newspaper in 1992 gave the origins of the word.  You see, this is absolutely fascinating.  It shows that between received wisdom and historical truth, from time to time we have to face up to concrete reality.  And I would say that in regards to Rwanda, that is the stage we are as far as everything is concerned.  
Q.	Doctor, Professor, in your work on Rwanda before 1994, does the name "Mr. Renzaho" appear anywhere?  
A.	Yes, in the civil service organisational table.  He was an important military authority at the time when he held an important military -- significant military rank.  And then, of course, when he was part of the civil service.  He was known among the other préfets of Rwanda, or the other colonels.  Colonel Renzaho was particularly well known to me because he'd taken part, practically in the beginning, if I remember correctly, of the establishment of an excellent unit of Rwandan army where several French military colleagues, officers, served, the paracommando battalion.  And that is why I knew him in -- well, there's no other reason, apart from those.  
Q.	Mr. Expert, are you in a position today to tell us who was the organiser, or the organisers of the attack that resulted in the death of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Well, Counsel, no professional historian can tell you that he is -- can identify.  But he will answer, as I am about to answer, that there is a consensus among all experts, including Alison Des Forges, including Guichaoua, including Reyntjens, which appears to be to ascribe paternity of the incident to the RPF.  On what do we base?  In the present stage of knowledge and documents in our possession, a certain number of historical -- scientific facts, excuse me, that are extremely useful.  There are the confessions of a number of RPF dissidents, where I don't need to name them; we know them.  And the order -- the decision rendered by Judge Bruguière who seems to establish with a great deal of precision, that -- contrary to what the Prosecution has stated before and no longer states, that it wasn't the work of extremist Hutus who shot down the plane in order to have a coup d'etat and take over the reigns of power and implement of programme genocide.  That is no longer claimed; that is ancient history.  
Q.	Professor, what was the purpose pursued by the author or authors of this attack?  
A.	If -- and I will say it again.  If the attack was committed by those who at present are in power in Kigali, by the RPF, that is to say, or at least by certain members of the RPF, the attack is part of a strategy.  I come back to the question of democratisation and multiparty politics.  Let us clearly put ourselves squarely in the context of the times at that time.  

The RPF is predominating in the field as of the moment the French army withdraws.  The Arusha Accords were signed, the RPF obtains practically 50 per cent of the army and a significant number of ministerial posts, but the RPF has lost.  It has lost.  Contrary to what many have asserted, the RPF has lost.  

And why has it lost?  Because President Habyarimana understood that, contrary to what some experts still understand, he was -- he did not want to block the Arusha Accords, he wanted, on the contrary, to implement them completely as soon as possible.  He wanted to go to the end of their implementation.  Which is why, in the weeks preceding his assassination, he makes all the concessions.  And it's the RPF that then holds back, because the RPF is faced with a big question mark.  The ethnic reality comes through.  Because what is due to happen at the end of the Arusha process?  Elections.  Now, whatever the scenario, even if the Hutu parties are divided, 80 per cent Hutu, in democratic terms, will always weigh more than 20 per cent Tutsi.  

So, the RPF leaders must go to the final phase of their strategy to conquer power, which is to resume hostilities.  Which is now possible for three reasons:  Firstly, the French have left.  Remember, the condition -- non-negotiable condition to the establishment of the last phases of implementation of the Arusha Accords, the departure of the French.  There will, therefore, no longer be French soldiers on the ground to bolster the RGF.  

Secondly, the Rwandan army's completely disorganised.  The Rwandan army lacks ordnance, lacks ammunition.  There is no resupply, there is no re -- building up of stocks for three months.  And thirdly, the campaign, the disinformation and denigration campaign, smear -- campaign of smearing President Habyarimana and the tall stories about Akazu, the lies about the death squads, the impostures regarding the lists -- the pretence regarding lists, all this an attempt to make a Hitler, or whatever you want, of Habyarimana.  So, as of then, they know very well, the leaders of the RPF, that no one will come to Habyarimana's support, to Habyarimana's rescue.  

So they decapitate Rwanda in committing this act -- attack, in committing that act -- perpetrating that attack at the very most delicate moment in the transition.  Now, what is the most delicate point in the transition?  We are between two systems.  We are emerging from the constitution of 1991, and we're not yet under the constitutional principles of Arusha.  There is only one element ensuring the transition, and that is the president.  And he's the one who is killed.  As of that time, the rest ensues.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have to stop now, unfortunately.  Please be briefer tomorrow morning.
