MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, the technicians informed us that the microphone has been fixed, so we want to try it and see if it works. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The microphone still has a sound on your side, so we appreciate it if you would sit on the other side, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry about that.  The technicians told us they tried to fix it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are grateful for that attempt.  Thank you. 

Defence? 
WITNESS RGI,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, yesterday when we were taking the break, you were explaining, in response to the question that I put to you, that the road safety company, when asked from when the weapon-free zone was established, end of December 1993, was in charge of roadblocks.  I suppose that was, indeed, the answer you gave me yesterday, essentially.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, now, now.  Can we observe speed and pauses, as we have mentioned a few times?  So pause, Mr. Witness, between question and answer, please.  

And Mr. Nekuie will pause between the answers and the questions. 
Here comes the next question.  

MR. NEKUIE:
Very well, Mr. President. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, are you able to say who entrusted this duty to the Kigali road safety company? 
A.	This duty was assigned by the general staff headquarters of the gendarmerie, who gave instructions for me to collaborate with the UNAMIR that, in the event that they request for troops to man roadblocks, I should not hesitate in assisting them.  
Q.	What was the purpose of this mission of establishment or erection of roadblocks, Witness? 
A.	The purpose of the roadblocks was to search vehicles for weapons which were illegally in circulation. 
Q.	Did you, indeed, have the opportunity to erect these roadblocks in some parts of Kigali city? 
A.	They were particularly erected at the entrance to Kigali city, that is, Nyabugongo-Nychianga road and Nychibobo-Gikukinyi (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need those two names, please.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, are you able to spell those two names?  
MR. NEKUIE:
Because they do not appear on our spelling list, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:
Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A.  

Nyabugongo, N-Y-A-B-U-G-O-N-G-O.  

Gitikinyoni, G-I-T-I-K-I-N-Y-O-N-I.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, during searches at the roadblock, was it -- did it happen that those who were -- did it happen that the road safety company people asked drivers to bring -- present their documents? 
A.	That did not happen.  The order to search for weapons did not include searching for or controlling identity documents.  
Q.	And for how long did this collaboration with UNAMIR last? 
A.	It started from when the free zone area was established up until 5th April 1994 and should have continued until the 6th.  But on the 6th we waited for the UNAMIR troops, and they did not arrive. 
Q.	Were you informed about the crash of the presidential plane, which occurred on that 6th April 1994?  And under what circumstances did you get to know? 
A.	I got to know in a message from the general staff headquarters, disseminated to the gendarmerie units.  And the title was as follows -- or, the -- it was drafted as follows:  "This is to inform members of the units about the attack against the presidential plane and redouble your vigilance."

And the same telegram was inviting the unit commanders to a meeting, which was to be held at the senior military academy at 10 on the 7th. 
Q.	Did you attend this meeting at the senior military academy on the 7th at 10 a.m.?  
A.	I went there as a unit commander.  
Q.	Do you know if Colonel Renzaho was also present at that meeting? 
A.	I saw him there. 
Q.	On this issue, Witness, because this testimony might just be a testimony of alibi, which I was not expecting -- so please be sincere in your answer.  

If you saw Colonel Renzaho on that day, say it honestly.  And if you did not, then say it.  
A.	I saw him in the hall. 
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, I would like to say, for the benefit of the Prosecution, that this was not intended to be part of my evidence.  But since it has come up, I might use it as an alibi, and I'd like to pray the Prosecution and tell them that it was not intended -- this information was not intended to be hidden away from them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please slow down. 

Mr. Witness, you are not observing the pause. 

Mr. Nekuie, you did not know during the preparatory conversation with this witness that this would come up?  
MR. NEKUIE:
I did not know, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, for me to keep to the line of preparation that we started, did you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  We didn't understand counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Can you repeat your question, please?
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	The question was as follows:  Witness, did you discuss the issue of roadblocks in the course of this meeting held on the 7th April 1994? 
A.	No.  The purpose of the meeting was different from the issue of roadblocks.  
Q.	But in the days that followed the 7th April 1994, did the issue of roadblocks not become a serious issue for your company? 
A.	You know that, following the crash of the presidential plane, the security situation in Kigali changed.  Missions of gendarmerie units also went through some readaptation process.  As far as my company was concerned, Kigali town was in a state of war, what is referred to as an active front, that is, that the fighting was going on at the door of the capital, and some sensitive installations had been attacked.  

So there was no need to erect these roadblocks, even though the general staff headquarters had entrusted me with the mission of erecting them to control vehicles on account of the prevailing situation.  But I encountered difficulties in implementation of that mission, and I reported to my immediate superior. 

Regarding the difficulties, the -- all along the road to the main roundabout -- roundabout, all the way to Nyarutega, where I should have erected the roadblocks, there were so many roadblocks, some of them manned by civilians and others manned by troops of the Rwandan armed forces.  I found it that it was improper to erect my roadblocks alongside those ones.  That is why I reported to HQ that the situation on the ground did not allow me to easily accomplish my mission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We lost something in two languages.  You said, Mr. Witness, "All along the road to the main roundabout, all the way to --" someplace where you should have erected the roadblock.  What was that reference, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I made reference to the Kigali main roundabout, and the Nyarutega bridge.  The Nyarutega bridge is the bridge over Nyabarongo, between rural Kigali préfecture and the Gitarama préfecture.  That is going towards Gitarama préfecture, for those who know the region. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Nyabarongo is well known, I think, N-Y-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O, but that name of the bridge can you spell, please?
THE WITNESS:
Nyarutega, N-Y-A-R-U-T-E-G-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, did you get to know who asked the civilians to erect roadblocks and why the civilians erected roadblocks? 
A.	To my knowledge, no one gave instructions for the roadblocks to be erected.  And those roadblocks were erected by the residents, as part of their self-defence, so as to identify the RPF infiltrators and also to be able to report at the appropriate time on the advancement of the RPF so that the rest of the population can flee.  Because it was normal, on account -- based on the account of those who lived in the combat zone, that the RPF was committing atrocities along the way, killings and so on.  
Q.	When you make reference to civilians, what kind of persons were present at those roadblocks, since you had the opportunity to see them? 
A.	It was a mix of persons.  There were young people, adult men of about 30 years old.  There were even people who were loafing around because there were people who were roaming around the town.  And they took that opportunity to go to the roadblocks because, very often, they would draw some advantages from that. 

Apart from the role that they were -- they were expected to play, at some roadblocks some -- the people who were manning the roadblocks were harassing road users.  
Q.	When you make reference to harassment, what are we to understand? 
A.	By that I mean that they were stealing from users -- road users, taking their money, other belongings, and sometimes they would even use violence to achieve those objectives. 
Q.	Given this conduct from those persons, did the authorities of the gendarmerie and the army not find it necessary to take measures to correct them? 
A.	I have told you that fighting was raging on in the capital itself from the 7th of April.  The camp of the Presidential Guard had been attacked; Kacyiru camp had been attacked, and it became necessary to reinforce those positions so as to face up to the attackers.  

The personnel of the -- the troops of the armed forces was not enough to engage in activities relating to restoring law and order.  They were engaged in fighting. 
Q.	But, Witness, do you think that activities of outlaws facilitated the fighting of the army against the enemy, as you said? 
A.	It, rather, made it difficult.  It made the task of the army difficult.  

On the one hand, these roadblocks which had been erected were often the place of refuge from -- for people who had deserted the war front, troops who had deserted from the war front, who had come to loot the population and engage in looting activities.  And that reinforced the position of the outlaws, and that also weakened the front.  Consequently, the command did not have a reserve unit to call upon to come and strengthen the hand of the army.  
Q.	Are you able to tell the Chamber if, among those people who were so -- were perpetrating so much trouble at the roadblocks, were militiamen of political parties? 
A.	When you make reference to militia of political parties, it will -- this was only de facto because there was no legal provisions accepting those militia organisations.  Most of the parties had what we call the political youth wing of the parties.  The MDR (sic) had what was referred to as the Interahamwe.  MDR had JR Inkuba -- GDR Inkuba. 
Q.	Witness, when you mention these names, please spell them before you move on to other names for the purposes of the transcripts.  Thank you.
A.	I spell Interahamwe. I-N -- 
Q.	That is known.  
A.	Inkuba, I-N-K-U-B-A. 

The youth wing of the PSD was known as Abakombozi, A-B-A-K-O-M-B-O-Z-I. 

Not to forget that the opposition party of -- the opposition parties also had their youth wings.  On all those roadblocks, one could not distinguish whether the people belonged to the youth wing of the MDR, PSD or RPF, since they had their elements within the capital.  

One could also note -- one could not also tell if these were deserters because, very often, these deserters, when they flee from the war front, would wear civilian clothes.
Q.	Yes, Witness.  How, then, do you explain that all these persons were at the roadblocks and that the authorities did not -- the civilian authorities did not even take any measures in collaboration with the military authorities to stop their activities? 
A.	I have told you that, regarding the armed forces, the units were engaged at the war front.  The troops who were -- who remained behind at the gendarmerie, apart from the defence of the Camp Kanciru (sic) and the defence of the sensitive installations, had been added to guarding the displaced -- the war-displaced persons.  There was the Sainte Famille, the minor Saint Paul seminary, Mille Collines, and the Notre-Dame de Citeaux lycée.  All those positions were guarded by the gendarme.  

As far as the préfecture authorities are concerned -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you are coming up with all these names again.  

Do you need this, Mr. Nekuie?  We will get the names on record, but do you need these details? 
MR. NEKUIE:
Quite honestly, these were not the answers that I was expecting.  But since I could not interrupt the witness, I allowed him to go on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But let me say it once again:  You are absolutely authorised to interrupt the witness.  We encourage you to interrupt the witness.  Please stop him.  

Now, let's get these names.  There was the Sainte Famille and the minor seminary of Saint Paul.  And then we have the Mille Collines and the lycée Notre-Dame de Citeaux.  These were the names; isn't that true, Mr. Witness?  Yes or no? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  I just want you to explain to me why this passiveness in relation to the conduct of those people at the roadblocks, whereas in the town you had civilian and military authorities.  But I believe you have answered it somehow, even if you went further in your answer.  

And now let me ask you, was it possible, all the same, for those authorities at least to go through those roadblocks and to accomplish the missions that you started mentioning within the town? 
A.	It was not possible because I, myself -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I really have to insist on this.  You're making the work of persons in the courtroom difficult.  Can you please remember the pause?  It's not because we are difficult; we simply need to ensure that everyone can perform his or her task.  

Now the answer.  
THE WITNESS:
I was saying that it was not possible because these people were heavily armed.  Because I, myself, as a unit commander, had difficulties accomplishing the mission that had been entrusted to me when they required me to enter roadblocks.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Now, when you say these people were heavily armed, what type of arms are you referring to and where did they get them from? 
A.	These were war weaponry.  Now, these weapons came from various sources.  You know that, in times of war, there's a proliferation of wars -- of weapons in a country, and that was the case for Rwanda.  

With this war, the Rwandan armed forces had some deserters and those deserters who go with their weapons.  The civilian population itself managed to illegally acquire weapons by buying from soldiers who wanted some money. 

Further, with the resumption of hostilities, some civilians had soldier friends who would bring them these weapons upon their request.  At these roadblocks, apart from military vehicles which were evacuating people who got wounded in war, evacuating them to military hospitals established in places that had not yet been hitten (sic) by the war, very often there are weapons in these vehicles.  They will seize these weapons and ammunitions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, again, can you slow down?  Your words have to be interpreted.  You require the interpreter to talk very fast.  When he speaks fast, those who are transcribing what you are saying are faced with challenges.  It's really very simple:  Pause and speed.  Please help us.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  

Let me repeat:  The sources of these weapons, I was saying that in times of war there is a proliferation of weapons, and that was the case for Rwanda.  These weapons came from various origins.  There were the deserters from the war front.  They leave with their weapons and ammunitions.  There were -- there was the population, who buy weapons from soldiers, soldiers who wanted money, who steal weapons from their colleagues and sell them.  I have a case in point where I intercepted a Kalashnikov in the boot of a vehicle which was coming to Kigali, and I reported that. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, are you able to just limit yourself to listing the sources of the weapons without going into the details regarding such -- details that -- examples that you are giving? 
A.	Then there was the procurement by civilians of weapons through their friends.  There were also weapons coming from the RPF to arm their infiltrators.  These weapons were also at the roadblocks.  As I said, that at the roadblocks there were persons whose origins one is not able to determine. 
Q.	Witness, do you know if, among the these -- among the population, there were persons who received weapons from the préfecture authorities -- who received orders from the préfecture authorities? 
A.	To my knowledge, the préfecture had no stock of weapons, and the acquisition of weapons by the préfecture had to follow a certain procedure.  The préfet would make a request to the ministry of interior, who, in his turn, will make a request to the minister of defence.  And the minister of defence had no stock of weapons.  The weapons were managed by the staff headquarters. 
Q.	I'm sorry to interrupt you, Witness, but you've answered my question.  I just wanted to know if, from the experience that you went through at that time, the préfecture authorities had had to give weapons to some of these persons.  You answered with a no.  So let's move on, if that doesn't worry you. 

Witness, these explanations that you are giving give the impression that it were -- was these persons who imposed their law in Kigali town.  Is that what the Chamber is to understand from your testimony? 
A.	That is what the Chamber could understand because they were heavily armed and they operated freely, without any problems, because no one could intimidate them. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
At least the Chamber understands it now, since the witness was assisted so much in choosing that formulation.  

The next question.  
MR. NEKUIE:
I did not realise that I was suggesting the -- the answer to him.  I'm sorry about that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, you said that those persons were heavily armed.  Now, the regular units of the army, who had the kind of difficulties that you referred to, but they were also armed at the time that they got to those roadblocks.  
A.	Just some troops.  This was just some troops and not a unit.  And just these troops cannot face up to this large number of outlaws. 
Q.	How many outlaws were there compared to the regular troops of the army in the town, if you are aware, during this period from April to July of 1994? 
A.	In Kigali town I told you that there were youths of different political parties.  With the resumption of the hostilities, we were added to the population from Nyacyonga, which was coming into town, fleeing the hostilities.  

The units -- as for the units that were there, there was only one unit that was entrusted with the mission of counter-infiltration on the road alongside the Nyabarongo river.  

And let me spell out Nyabarongo -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, we already have spelt that.  Thank you, very much, Mr. Witness.  

But you mentioned another word in your answer.  You said the population came from somewhere into town.  Can you repeat that place?  
THE WITNESS:
Nyacyonga, N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So it's the name we had before. 

Now, the question by counsel did not really invite an analysis.  He wants a number.  How many outlaws were there compared to the regular troops?  Can you give us an assessment of the number or the respective size?  That's what he wants.  Try to answer that very briefly.  
THE WITNESS:
I am not in a position to give precise figures, but they were spread throughout town.  
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, your answer is satisfactory, as far as I am concerned. 

Could you tell the Trial Chamber what mission you were entrusted with during this period, because I -- I believe I understand that, from the 5th of April onwards, you stopped manning roadblocks.  So what were your activities from the 6th of April onwards and for how long? 
A.	From the 6th of April onwards, the unit was entrusted with the mission of defending Muhima and would receive ad hoc orders from missions from the general staff.  

************* a team to the Belgian embassy in order to strengthen the team of guards. ***************** the religious authorities, who had sought refuge at the house of their colleague of the Kigali archbishop towards Gitarama, and I had difficulties fulfilling that mission.  But, with the assistance of God, they arrived safe and sound. 

I was also entrusted with the mission ************ the people who came from the Amahoro hotel to the governmental area because the area was under RPF control.  And there was an exchange with people who had sought refuge in their localities I mentioned previously. ******************* the expatriates. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you need an overview of all his assignments from the 6th of April onward, Maître Nekuie?  
MR. NEKUIE:
If the witness had merely indicated that he carried out missions involving escorting or transfers, because that is, indeed, what I understand it is, it would have been sufficient, but I believe the witness wished to provide further details. 
BY MR. NEKUIE:
Q.	Witness, we shall later on deal with the details of your missions.  But let me continue by putting to you the following question:  Throughout all the missions you have partly listed to us, did you ever conduct missions in collaboration with the authorities of the town of Kigali? 
A.	There is one in particular where there was an authority representing the préfecture.  It was the mission for the transfer of the displaced persons due to the war, which was done at Mille Collines, and the préfecture was represented by the bourgmestre of the Nyarugenge commune.  I believe he was representing the préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, for how long did you conduct such missions in collaboration with the town authorities, or even all the missions you listed previously? 
A.	When I was in the company of the authorities, we conducted three trips, and the displaced persons from the Mille Collines hotel were all evacuated.  There were further operations that were to be carried out, but then I was assigned to another unit. 
Q.	When you were assigned elsewhere, can you tell us when that occurred and what was your new occupation within that unit? 
A.	I was assigned elsewhere in late May of 1994, and I was sent to a combat unit which was defending the Kacyiru camp.  
Q.	And how long did you fight in that unit? 
A.	It was merely for the month of June because on the 4th of July we had to leave the town of Kigali, which was completely circled by the enemy.  
Q.	While you were fighting in this unit, did you ever receive reinforcements from troops from the civilian defence system? 
A.	At the Kacyiru camp, we were not reinforced by any troops of the civilian defence.  And, as far as I know, the civilian defence was only in -- at its very beginnings.  It had just been launched, but time did not permit for it to be fully implemented. 
Q.	Thank you for your answers, Witness.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, this marks the end of the examination-in-chief of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honour.  If I can just indicate at the outset, by virtue of the fact that there have been one or two new matters raised, I'm not quite sure how we will be for time.  I may need a brief adjournment to go to my office and obtain some other material which might be needed in the course of cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want to come back to the break at a later stage, or -- 
MR. MOSES:
Yes.  I'm in Your Honour's hands, whether you want a 10-minute break now for me to obtain that material from my office or you want me to go as far as I can without.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just start as you indicated, and the moment you need a break, you just tell us and we will grant it. 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, will you agree with me that the gendarmerie is an armed force created for maintaining and restoring public order and for the enforcement of laws? 
A.	I concur with you. 
Q.	And yesterday you said that, however, in a time of war, defence of the nation had a higher priority than that for which the gendarmerie was created.  
A.	I stated that it was an extraordinary mission that the gendarmerie was carrying out, following the orders -- perhaps I did not specify that that mission was carried out following orders from the ministry of defence, which would ask the gendarmerie to come to the assistance of the army.  So this is clarification I failed to provide previously. 
Q.	You'll agree with me that nowhere in the act which sets up the gendarmes, or in any other act, does it state anywhere that the role of defending the nation is to take priority over the core role of the gendarmerie, which is to defend -- sorry, to maintain and restore public order and to enforce the laws? 
A.	I did point out that, if the number of troops permitted, such missions were carried out jointly. 
Q.	With respect, Witness, that doesn't answer my question.  My question is, do you agree with me that nowhere in Rwandan law, the law governing the gendarmerie or elsewhere, does it state that the gendarmes in a time of war shall defend the country and that that takes priority over their core role and the reason for their formation, namely, to maintain and restore public order and to enforce the laws? 
MR. MOSES:
I see my friend standing.  
MR. NEKUIE:
Yes, Mr. President.  Without wishing to interrupt the Prosecutor, I wish to point out that if questions deal with acts, or laws, we might end up in the same situation as yesterday when I was trying to have the witness refer to them and there was an objection from the Prosecution.  So I wonder whether this is a correct line of questioning, to ask the witness whether there are acts mentioned when others cannot be. 
MR. MOSES:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are not interested in your legal interpretations, but it is now an attempt to find out the basis for your statement about priority.  And do you know whether there is any legal basis for your statement that priority had to be given to defend the nation?  
THE WITNESS:
There are the core missions entrusted to a force, and, indeed, the defence of the territory was the prerogative of the Rwandan army.  And, as specified in the laws, the gendarmerie was a force which was set up in order to maintain public order.  

But to that mission it is also added that the gendarmerie can come as reinforcement, following orders of -- from the minister of defence, if that is deemed necessary.  And the chief of staff can execute, or implement, the orders given to him.  

When the minister is giving orders, he is aware of the men available to him.  I did not mean that priority was to be given to the operational defence of the territory by the gendarmerie.  But what I did mean was that, once the country was under attack and the gendarmerie was requisitioned, that was the first order it was to comply with.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And on what basis do you say it was the first order it was to comply with? 
A.	There's an order of priority in the missions entrusted to you by the -- your superior, and when a mission is entrusted to you, your superior takes into account the means, or resources, available to you in order to implement such missions.  For instance, if you are faced with difficulties in the implementation of your mission, then you should explain what that difficulty is. 
Q.	So, in fact, the basis of you saying that it was to be given higher priority than your core role was because of the orders you were given from your -- your superiors?  Is that the correct understanding? 
A.	Yes, that is what I mean. 
Q.	Now, Witness, during the period of 7th of April to the time you left Kigali, you'll agree with me that you were able to regularly cross through roadblocks throughout the city? 
A.	As I stated, I was not able to do so because the first mission I was given was to set up roadblocks.  And I was not able to do that because of the difficulties I mentioned.  

The second mission, which was the -- to escort the religious authorities, during the course of that mission, I was, myself, stopped at one of the roadblocks, and the religious authorities left unaccompanied.  And, thanks to God, they arrived safe and sound.  

So even ourselves, as law enforcement officers, had problems crossing through the different roadblocks for the reasons I mentioned previously.  There were people who were, like, mad.  They were armed, and they did not obey anyone.  
Q.	Just so I'm quite clear about this, are you telling the Trial Chamber that, apart from the missions that you have specified during the course of your evidence in-chief, you never crossed roadblocks in Kigali during the period of April to July 1994? 
A.	We passed through roadblocks when we transferred the displaced persons because we tried to convince them of the interest in exchanging such prisoners. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  I'm going to stop you.  You're not listening to my question.  My question was quite specific, and it was, apart from the missions that you have listed, are you telling the Trial Chamber that you never passed through roadblocks in Kigali from April to July 1994, yes or no? 
A.	I passed through some roadblocks because all the groups were not as aggressive. 
Q.	You will agree with me that the gendarmerie had the right to arrest people because they were illegally armed, yes or no? 
A.	I would say no.  The gendarmerie did not have enough staff, as I told you, since the gendarmerie troops had been sent to combat in Kacyiru as well as assigned to the defence of the displaced persons and sensitive areas. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see that the French translation was different than your word "right."  That's why he answered as he did.  Do you want to repeat your question?  
MR. MOSES:
I will.  Thank you, sir.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, the gendarmerie had the legal obligation to arrest people who were illegally armed at those roadblocks, weren't they, under such a duty?  
A.	Could you please repeat your question?  
Q.	The gendarmerie had a duty to arrest people who were in possession of illegal firearms at those roadblocks; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is correct, but we did not have enough resources to disarm these people. 
Q.	You've talked of the activities at the roadblocks, and you've referred to looting, stealing and some assaults.  The reality of the situation, Witness, is that thousands and thousands of people were killed at those roadblocks in Kigali during the period April to July 1994, weren't they? 
A.	I did not talk about any attacks or assaults.  I talked about people being beaten up.  
Q.	Well, let's talk about killings, shall we?  Do you agree with me that there were thousands and thousands of civilians who were killed at the roadblocks in Kigali from April to July 1994, yes or no? 
A.	I was not aware of any such killing.  But what I would hear was that there were killings elsewhere, in the other neighbourhoods.  But at the roadblock I passed through, there were no deaths. 
Q.	You say these roadblocks were set up to identify infiltrators.  How was one able to identify an infiltrator, Witness? 
A.	Well, those manning the roadblock were those who would choose their mode of operation, and I had not given them any orders, so that I could not respond to your question.  I do not know how they would go about it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to one roadblock or to several roadblocks that you had knowledge of, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to the roadblocks I was aware of, but it was probably the case in other -- on other roadblocks that might have been set up in other neighbourhoods. 

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Just so we're quite clear about this, are you telling the Trial Chamber that you were unaware that people, civilians, were being asked to show their identification cards at roadblocks so that those there could determine what ethnicity they were?  Is that your evidence, you weren't aware of that? 
A.	I told you that I did not know how they would go about it. 
Q.	Were you aware during April to July 1994 that Tutsis were being targeted and killed on a massive scale in Kigali by reason of their ethnicity?  Were you aware of that, Witness? 
A.	As for that, I would say that it was not only the Tutsis who were killed in Kigali town.  The -- there were Hutus who were also killed in the town. 
Q.	That doesn't answer my question, Witness.  Do you agree with me that Tutsis were targeted and killed on a massive scale in Kigali by reason of their ethnicity?  Do you accept that or don't you? 
A.	I did not know. 
Q.	So do we take it from that that you -- well, do you agree that there was a genocide of the Tutsi civilian population in Rwanda from April to July 1994, Witness, or was that something you are also unaware of? 
A.	It was only through the media that I heard that when I was in exile.  To say that the Tutsis were targeted and killed on a large scale by the Hutu, I do not accept this assertion.  

I've told you that this roadblock (sic) were manned by outlaws who were going around the town.  And they were made up of various types of persons.  I have told you -- I have made reference to the youth wings of the political parties, and that in those youth wings there were Tutsis as well.  And these Tutsis, if certain reprehensible acts were committed, they did participate.  

I made reference to the RPF youth wing, or infiltrators.  I did not talk about Tutsis or Hutus.  But the fact that it was proved that there were infiltrators in the capital, well, I did not dwell on how the infiltrators got into the town and how their number increased overnight. 
Q.	All right.  Would you agree with me, Witness, that there were at least 100 gendarmerie officers who were in Kigali during the period of April 6th to July 4th, 1994? 
A.	You are saying about a hundred gendarme? 
Q.	Gendarme officers.  
A.	I don't think so.  

Even if there were, they had been assigned to various services, various units, with different missions.  
Q.	I just asked about the numbers.  And would you agree with me, Witness, that during that same period, April to -- the 6th to July the 4th, there were only three gendarme officers who were killed during that period, those being Major Murekezi -- spelt M-U-R-E-K-E-Z-I; secondly, Major Burakali, spelt B-U-R-A-K-A-L-I; and the third, Captain Munayabarenzi, spelt M-U-N-A-Y-A-B-A-R-E-N-Z-I?  

Those were the only three gendarme officers killed, weren't they? 
A.	I knew them, and I can give you the circumstances under which they were killed. 
Q.	No, that's not my question.  My question is, would you agree with me that those were the only three gendarme officers killed in Kigali during that period? 
A.	There were others who died on the war front. 
Q.	I'm talking about in Kigali, Witness.  They were the only three in Kigali, weren't they? 
A.	There was a second lieutenant, called Mudenge, who had deserted from his unit and who was engaged in looting activities.  He was killed.  From what I heard people say at the roadblocks erected by the outlaws, at ONATRACOM, this officer was being sought after actively, and he was part of the -- he was in the unit to which I was assigned later on. 
Q.	All right.  We'll take into account him. 

Now, amongst the gendarme forces in Kigali, would you agree with me that they numbered approximately 3,000, or slightly less than 3,000, gendarmes in Kigali during that time? 
A.	I am not able to give you an accurate figure because I was not in the personnel office.  But, if you wish, I can give you the details on the units. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, thank you.  

Now, the person you referred to, the second lieutenant, was that Mudenge, M-U-D-E-N-G-E?  Is that the correct spelling, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, would you agree with me that there were less than 20 gendarmes who were not officers who were killed in Kigali from April to July 1994? 
A.	Are you able to tell me the circumstances under which they were killed? 
Q.	I'm just asking you, Witness, whether you would agree with me, as an officer, that there were approximately 20 or less gendarmes killed in Kigali during that period.  
A.	I have told you that the gendarmerie unit -- 
Q.	Witness, my question only requires a yes or no answer.  You either agree with me or you don't.  And, if you don't, you could give an indication to the Trial Chamber as to how many gendarmes you would say had been killed.  
A.	Let me tell you, the gendarmes that I am able to say died on the war front -- 
Q.	Witness, I don't want -- I do not want that degree of specificity.  I've asked you a question, namely, do you agree with me that there were approximately 20 gendarmes, or less, who were killed in Kigali from the 6th of April through to early July.  Do you agree with me?  I don't want to know the circumstances of any of their deaths.  
A.	There were gendarmes who died, but I do not know their number. 
Q.	All right.  And would you agree with me that, during that same period, three-month period, in terms of the Rwandan armed forces, there were only approximately 100 FAR soldiers who were killed in Kigali during that three-month period? 
A.	I am not able to say that there were no deaths or losses -- losses in the Rwandan armed forces, given the fact that they were engaged in the war.  But I do not know the number because the situation of loss of men was kept by the units, which would forward it to their respective staff headquarters -- general staff headquarters.  

As an officer in a unit with its own mission, I will not know the number of men who died in one or the other unit.  For my own unit, yes, I am able to say, but, for now, I am not able to say that there were X number of losses.  
Q.	Do you agree with me, Witness, that the Kacyiru camp, that gendarmerie camp that you have talked about, was never taken over by the RPF during the period up until the time that you left Kigali? 
A.	The camp was taken over.  I can have said that, and it became necessary to bring reinforcement from the army to come and fight in Camp Kacyiru for them to fight off the RPF troops from the camp.  These were troops of the Huye battalion who were based in Kigali.  

I don't know if that answers your question. 

And, subsequently, the RPF troops remained in the neighbourhood of Kacyiru camp.  Camp Kacyiru was about encircled halfway round, and there were only the portion -- the central portion facing Kigali -- facing Kigali town remained. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did the RPF get into the camp or not?  
THE WITNESS:
I have no clarification on that, but the camp was attacked.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	I thought you were there during June.  Is that not right? 
A.	In July (sic) I was present.  

I told you that half of the camp was surrounded.  For those who know Kacyiru, the -- the RPF troops occupied the coffee plantations of Kacyiru camp.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to be specific here.  Mr. Witness, I am now reading out what you said in French, and I want your confirmation that that was your first -- first sentence in your previous answer, "I was present in the month of June." 

Did you say that?  
THE WITNESS:
I was asked if the camp had been attacked, and I said in the early days, but I did not continue for the subsequent days because the RPF continued with attacks, skirmishes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must really focus on the questions.  Did you say that in June you were present in the camp? 
THE WITNESS:
In July (sic) I was in the camp.  My unit was defending the camp.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, again, are you saying June or July?  
THE WITNESS:
If I did say July, I must have overspoke -- misspoken.  My mission was entrusted to me in May, and I carried it out in June.  And -- and on a daily basis we carried out combats with RPF troops. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have now heard you say "June" three times, and that's now what we have in English.  

Now, let's move on.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that none of the gendarmes who were killed, who were on active service, were killed at roadblocks, or anywhere else in Kigali, attempting to arrest anyone? 
A.	Can you please repeat the question slowly? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Would you agree with me, Witness, that, of those gendarmes who were in active service, who were killed in Kigali during April to July 1994, that none of them were killed whilst trying to arrest anyone? 
A.	I am not aware of this information. 
Q.	We have heard evidence, even during the Defence case, of killings of perhaps more than 100,000 civilians in Kigali during that period.  How many arrests did you or the men you supervised make for the killings of civilians during that same period? 
A.	Thank you for that question.  With the resumption of hostilities, activities of the judicial police came to a -- a stop, and they engaged themselves exclusively to combat activities.  So I am not able to say that we arrested one or the other person for this or that case.  

Further, each unit was entrusted with its own mission.  I have told you about the mission entrusted to my initial unit, and then the other unit to which I was subsequently posted.  

I cannot -- I can, therefore, not give you additional information because the mission of judicial police was the duty of the Kigali group, which at that time was no longer operational in that area on account of the intensity of the war in Kigali town. 
Q.	Is that a long-winded way, Witness, of saying "none"? 
A.	I did not carry out any arrests. 
Q.	Let's talk a little bit, if we can, about one of the tasks that you had, and that was the transfer of persons from the RPF side to your side, and vice versa. 

Would you agree that the discussions surrounding those transfers also involved the involvement of UNAMIR? 
A.	The operation was led by UNAMIR itself.  They designed the operation.  At the time that they were receiving requests from persons to go and fetch their -- to go and get persons who were holed up on the RPF side, seek them out and bring them, this also on the initiative of UNAMIR.  And the Rwandan party accepted it, as well as the RPF side. 
Q.	You agree with me that the head of the gendarmerie was General Ndindiliyimana, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the head of UNAMIR was General Dallaire, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you report to General Ndindiliyimana? 
A.	I was given my mission by the general staff headquarters.  And what makes me say that the operation was on the initiative of UNAMIR was as a result of many requests, plus the fact that there was a humanitarian situation. 
Q.	I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the question I was asking you was whether you reported to General Ndindiliyimana.  Now, did you or not? 
A.	A report was made regularly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
To him?  
THE WITNESS:
To the general staff headquarters and not to the person. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was he there?  
THE WITNESS:
On which date, please?  

BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, would you agree with me that these transfers took place during May? 
A.	I agree. 
Q.	And is General Ndindiliyimana someone who you respect? 
A.	He was my immediate superior, and I owe him respect and obedience. 
Q.	Were you aware that General Dallaire has testified at this Tribunal in the case of General Ndindiliyimana? 
A.	I am not aware.  You are telling me. 
Q.	All right.  I want you to listen to an extract which I want to read from the cross-examination of General Dallaire by General Ndindiliyimana's counsel.  And I want -- well, then have some questions to ask you about it.  
MR. MOSES:
And for Your Honours, I've distributed the transcripts, and I'm reading from page 60, and from line 7.  It's a question from -- from the Defence counsel to General Dallaire. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which is extremely long. 
MR. MOSES:
I'm not going to read the entire -- entire bit, Your Honour.  I'm -- it has to do with the first eight or nine lines. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Just to put this in context for you, Witness, General Dallaire is being asked about a passage in -- a book that he wrote in which he had described a meeting with General Ndindiliyimana on the 21st of May 1994.  

And General Dallaire was asked about this -- what -- what General Ndindiliyimana's counsel referred to as a confession passage, and he read out the passage which I'm going to read you and ask you some questions on.  

"Before the attack, I had met at the Hôtel des Diplomates with Ndindiliyimana, who had finally reappeared earlier in the month at a political session in Gitarama.  He had approached me to arrange to meet with me alone in Kigali.  And so Ndindiliyimana and I sat together, ostensibly to resolve some gendarmerie operational concerns with the transfers between the lines.  He seemed terribly ill at ease, but determined to speak his mind.  He warned me that the préfet of Kigali was not to be trusted."
MR. MOSES:
That's -- although it goes on, I don't -- I'm happy to read further, Your Honour.  That is the relevant part.  If Your Honour thinks I need to read further to be fair, to place anything else in context, I am happy to do so. 
(Pages 1 to 21 by Ann Burum)





































1030H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go down to the word "there", please.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	"He went on and confided that Bizimana, the minister of defence, was despondent due to the failures in the field, the loss of his properties in Byumba, and the deaths of his relatives there."  

Now, Witness -- sorry, I should go on to say that General Dallaire confirmed -- and that's on page 61 at line 6 -- he was asked whether that was the gist of the conversation he had had and he said, "I remember that one".  

So, Witness, here we have a description of a conversation that took place between the head of the gendarmerie and the head of UNAMIR, where the head of the gendarmerie tells the head of UNAMIR, "Don't trust the préfet of Kigali".  Now, that being from one who you have indicated that you respect, can I suggest to you that was a view, namely, that the préfet of Kigali was not to be trusted, which was widely held.  Do you agree with me?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for the witness, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not agree with you, because each has it -- his or own assessment of the situation, and this is the assessment of General Ndindiliyimana regarding Mr. Renzaho.  He has reasons to say so that only belong to him, and I cannot make any further comment on that point. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	So you were aware that it was General Ndindiliyimana's view of this Accused, that he was someone not to be trusted? 
A.	I told you that I am not able to give my opinion as to the assessment made by them of Colonel Renzaho, that was their testimony, and if -- you should, rather, ask me what was my own opinion of Colonel Renzaho, and don't ask me to make any comments on other people's assessments.  They were high officials; they would meet in meetings perhaps, in different meetings, and there might have been some points of disagreement amongst them.  So I cannot go into such details, and I would ask to be spared doing such a thing. 
Q.	Witness, the question was whether you knew -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, there is possibly a difference between the languages.  The question was "So you were aware that it was General Ndindiliyimana's view of this Accused, that he was someone not to be trusted".  Was that what you just responded to, Mr. Witness?  

THE WITNESS:
That is indeed the question I just answered.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did General Ndindiliyimana share his opinion of this Accused with you? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question, and at a leisurely pace?  
Q.	Did General Ndindiliyimana share with you his opinion of this Accused, namely, that he was someone not to be trusted? 
A.	First of all, I did not give you my own opinion, and second, I was not aware of the opinion of General Ndindiliyimana regarding this official. 
Q.	Can I suggest to you that he did not do that because he saw you and the Accused as being in the same camp, the same group of people that he was trying to dissociate himself from -- in that conversation? 
A.	Well, let me point out at this stage that the relationships and the opinions of such authorities should not be the subject matter of an examination here in this courtroom.  

And I will ask the President to, perhaps, spare me from answering such questions, because I believe these are personal matters that have nothing to do with official activities.  If you are asking me whether the operation -- the transfer operation was jointly organised with the general staff -- the general chief of staff of the gendarmerie and the commander of UNAMIR, I would agree.  But what I do know is that there were incessant requests from UNAMIR regarding the people who were imprisoned at the Amahoro stadium, and this transfer was a humanitarian operation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is nothing wrong with that question, Mr. Witness.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	We will move on, Mr. Witness.  Do you agree with me that the distance between PVK and ESM, where a meeting was held on the morning of the 7th of April, is approximately 500 metres? 
A.	Not even that.  
Q.	And if one was in a vehicle one could do that trip, therefore, in less than one minute, couldn't one?  
A.	Yes.

Objection.  I could provide clarifications regarding this matter.  If you are exiting PVK from the ESM you would not spend a minute doing that because you have to give priority to other vehicles, and you also had to manoeuvre in order to turn, but for a vehicle that would be advancing, I don't believe even one minute would be necessary to cover the distance.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, it may be that I have some matters that I want to go to in closed session, which will probably take 20 minutes.  I then would like to have a brief -- I don't know whether to do that now, and then come back to the events of the 7th of April, or whether we should take the break, for me to come back, finish off this topic, and go into closed session.  I am in Your Honours' hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's try to stick to the normal procedure.  The closed session now for about 20 minutes, then you can have the break and get whatever you need.  You are now requesting a closed session?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to grant that.  We will then have a closed session.  After the break, will you then be in open session again?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, Your Honour, but it will be reasonably brief, five or ten minutes to finish off the cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So to those in the public gallery, this courtroom will now be closed from now until 11:30.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 25 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 22 to 24 by Judith Baverstock)






















MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness RGI, we are now in open session to conclude your cross-examination.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Witness, do you agree with me that the Hôtel des Diplomats is closer to PVK than ESM is? 
A.	To be specific about the distance, I haven't measured the distance.  It's easier to go to the ESM than to go to Hôtel des Diplomats.  Maybe they are at equal distances. 
Q.	Thank you for that.  Now, would you agree with me that the meeting at ESM on the 7th of April commenced after General Ndindiliyimana arrived there at ESM? 
A.	We were invited to that meeting, and there was -- there were those who had to lead, and the general --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We didn't hear the end of the witness's answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your answer, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I said that I was invited to the meeting.  I took part, and General Ndindiliyimana was present.  Maybe I can give clarifications.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	That's sufficient at this stage.  

Do you agree with me that General Ndindiliyimana arrived at 10:15?  That's when the meeting started.  
A.	I did not talk about the timing.  I talked -- I said that meeting was to start at ten.  It may not have started exactly at ten, but the fact is that the meeting took place and General Ndindiliyimana was there. 
Q.	All right.  Just to summarise what you have said, you agree that it may have started some minutes after ten? 
A.	Yes.
MR. MOSES: 
With that answer, Your Honour, I think that's the end of my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Any re-examination?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
No, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:
May I address the Court, Your Honours?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do.  
THE WITNESS:
I wanted to give some clarification regarding the cross-examination of the Prosecutor.  He asked me questions on the number of -- numbers, that is a technical term.  We are talking about numbers, but in terms of operationality, if each commander was asked how many gendarmes were operational on such-and-such a day, that is what will lead to taking account of the gendarmes, because people may fall ill, and there are those who are in charge of common services for the survival of the unit and so on and so forth.  So you have to count the operational troops and not the number on the battlefield.  

Secondly, he asked me questions on my activities while I was in exile.  He asked me whether I was in contact with Colonel Renzaho.  That is within his rights.  If he organises a resistance, whether I am entitled to participate.  That is why I answered (sic) the question that he put to me.  

Thirdly, you did say that this was -- the proceedings were in closed session, but let me draw your attention to this, Your Honours.  I am the one involved -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but now we are in open session.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but I want to point out that my security, where I live, will be more affected than ever.  And at the end of this session, I am requesting from Your Honours to meet the accused person who asked me to come and testify.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As for the meeting with the accused person, that will be arranged by the witness protection unit.  No problem with that.  

When it comes to your security, we have endeavoured to ensure it by having the sensitive parts in closed session.  

As regards your additional information, in view of the cross-examination, the question goes to the Prosecution.  Is there any follow-up based on what he just said?  

That's not the case.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, I just have two questions to ask you.  Were the Tutsis targeted in Kigali between April and July 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
To say that the ethnic group was targeted, no.  There was killing on all sides.  There were killings and these killings were directed against either the Hutus (sic) or the moderate Hutus -- or even Hutus who were killed because of their properties because others wanted to appropriate their belongings.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
And the next question: Was there a genocide in Rwanda from April to July 1994, and if so, were the Tutsis the targeted group?  
THE WITNESS:
I refuse the term "genocide".  People killed each other.  There were killings.  There was not -- the killings did not target one or a single ethnic group; it was against many or various groups.  There were Tutsis who died, there were Hutus who died.  So, not only the Tutsis were targets. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  We would like to thank you very much for having come the long way to the Tribunal to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much indeed.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
During your cross-examination, Mr. Moses, you first referred to the transcripts in Military II for Wednesday the 6th of December, English version, page 60 and 61.  Is that sufficient or do you want this as an exhibit?  
MR. MOSES:
Those relevant pages are all that are required.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The reference is enough; you do not need an exhibit, or do you want to have it as an exhibit?  
MR. MOSES: 
I don't need it as an exhibit, Your Honour, I don't need to clutter up the record any more.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  There is no request.  

Then, the ICG document, does that require any follow-up?  
MR. MOSES: 
I would ask that it be tendered, obviously, only an appendix was specifically referred to.  It may be that it is going to be referred to again, but I leave it in Your Honours' hands as to whether Your Honours consider there was sufficient cross-examination on the other parts for that to be tendered.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any comments on this?  The question is whether the front page, plus that page called appendix E, should be tendered.  You are making a request, are you?  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes, I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Any comments on that?  
MR. NEKUIE: 
Mr. President, if this document will be entered, then the Defence will wish the entire document to be entered, because we may have to use it subsequently.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Defence did not really object to the tendering of the document but wants a complete version.  Do you have any comment on that, Mr. Moses?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, if one looks through the table of contents, I had printed out -- apart from the appendixes that I have provided, pages 1 through to 17, which you will see on the -- under the table of contents, includes the topic "The Rwandan patriotic army versus ALIR".  One then goes on to the Burundian armed forces, Ugandan situation, a section about Mr. Kabila, Angola, Zimbabwe, which I didn't consider at all relevant.  So, I have no problem at all -- I am happy to produce up until page 18.  If my friends want further matters included, again, I have no problem with producing other parts of it.  I am not trying to hide anything, I am just trying to focus on the matters which I thought were relevant.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have no problems with this document in its entirety -- 
MR. MOSES: 
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
 -- as produced by today?  And with other words, not only the front page and E; you have no problems with that entire document being entered?  
MR. MOSES: 
None whatsoever, and, in fact, it may, to be honest, save some problems in the future if we refer to witnesses who are prepared to discuss the other parts, we will then end up having an exhibit of the same name under two different exhibit numbers.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will then simply admit this document as it is and note that only one page was actually used during cross-examination.  That seems to be acceptable to everyone.  

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 111. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there is no need to place this document under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 111 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we bring in the next witness, please?  
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness WOW in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.  
THE WITNESS:
Yego.

WITNESS WOW,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, what was your age, as of the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I was 22 years old. 
Q.	And where did you live? 
A.	I lived in the ****************************** in Rugenge secteur. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I shall be using for the rest of my questions, Exhibit P.  3.  This has been produced. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And Witness, during the break, I am going to ask you to indicate on that sheet where your house was located. 
A.	Very well.  
Q.	But, for now, are you able to say close to which important building was your house located?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are in open session.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Hold on, Mr. Witness.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. I didn't have the reflex to think about that.  So, for my initial questions, I would request for a closed session and then we will come back.  I have about two or three questions which, in my opinion, relate very closely to the witness and which will require that we go into closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will do that.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 36] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 30 to 35 by Judith Baverstock)



MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness WOW, we are now back in open session in connection with the beginning of your cross-examination.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what happened in your neighbourhood on the 7th of April, in the morning? 
A.	On the morning of the 7th of April, around seven, we saw a vehicle arrive with members of the Presidential Guard.  They arrived in our neighbourhood and we heard gunshots; they started firing.  
Q.	Do you know whether anyone was killed at that time? 
A.	Yes, some of our neighbours were killed, some families that lived not far from my place of -- my residence were killed. 
Q.	Do you remember the names of people who were killed at that time? 
A.	Stanis Nyirinkwaya was killed.  A lady and her husband, whose name was Ngunda were also killed.  Charles Rwanga was killed.  And another lady called Kanakintama was killed, along with the girls who lived in the JOC hostel.  They were all killed by members of the Presidential Guard. 
Q.	Witness, the first name you mentioned, I did not hear it properly.  Who was it?  
A.	Nyirinkwaya, Stanis.  
Q.	I do not have that name on my list, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the last name is probably the same as under number 304; and the first name is probably S-T-A-N-I-S.  Would you agree with that, Mr. Witness, concerning the first name?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then this lady, Ngundalinda?  
THE WITNESS:
It was the husband that was called Ngunda, but he was shot down at the same time as his wife.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 265. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ah, N-G-U-N-D-A.  All right.  Thank you. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, the third name?  
A.	I talked about Kanakintama.
MR. CANTIER:
Number 151 on the list.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And, then, Witness?
A.	I referred to Charles Rwanga. 
MR. CANTIER:
	Which is number 347 on the list.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, what did you do on that day, the 7th of April?  
A.	On the 7th of April, I could not do anything.  We stayed there following the news in order to know what the situation was. 
Q.	Witness, were there any roadblocks set up in your neighbourhood? 
A.	Yes, roadblocks were erected by Interahamwe, and other inhabitants who were in charge of security in our neighbourhood. 
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Trial Chamber what was the name of the cellule in which you were in Kigali? 
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat your question?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the witness.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	The name of the cellule in which you were? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not really want that, do we?  He said the name of his cellule in closed session, and we noted it and added it on the personal information sheet.  The cellule is a small place.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was disturbed by that matter, about the closed session and I did not hear the response.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, please, Witness, do not provide that answer. 

The name of the secteur? 
A.	Rugenge. 
Q.	Witness, who was the conseiller of that secteur?  
A.	Her name was Odette Nyirabagenzi. 
Q.	Witness, did you personally hear messages from the préfet requesting that roadblocks be set up? 
A.	No, I never heard such messages on the radio. 
Q.	Witness, were there communal policemen on the roadblocks? 
A.	I did not see any policemen manning a roadblock.  There were only Interahamwe and inhabitants of the neighbourhood. 
Q.	Witness, according to you, who was in charge of the roadblocks that were set up in your neighbourhood? 
A.	Those in charge of the roadblocks were the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Do you remember the name of one such leader? 
A.	I remember one Fidele Castar. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Number 52 on the list.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, were you a member of any political party or any youth wing at the time of the events?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Youth movement", correction from the interpreter.  
THE WITNESS:
I did not belong to any political party or any youth movement.  Because of my occupation, I was a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) people who were members of different political parties.  So I had to remain neutral because I needed to have customers.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Even though there are very many persons belonging to that group, I think we will place it under seal, since we dealt with that in closed session.  So the profession will be placed under seal.  

And the next question?  
MR. CANTIER:
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, did you ever move around during the events? 
A.	On the 9th, ******************** Gitarama. 
Q.	Witness, who were these people, without giving their names?  What type of customers were they?  
A.	They were not customers.  They were people who were under threat.  They were thought to be Inyenzis, and so ************************* Gitarama. 
Q.	Witness, did you have a laissez-passer? 
A.	No, I only made use of my identity card, but I also had a laissez-passer for my vehicle, and I would show that laissez-passer at the roadblocks.  
MS. MELLUISH: 
Your Honour, I'm troubled, simply because it wasn't even disclosed to us that -- the particular occupation of this witness.  And certainly in the will-says that we have received and the signed statement, there is no mention of this trip.  I really -- I do object to this evidence being led in the circumstances.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I am checking the identification sheet, and it is, indeed, only the present occupation of the witness that was mentioned, and not the occupation he had in 1994.  But, I believe this is a piece of information that does not come as a surprise, and can enlighten the Trial Chamber as to the activities of the witness during the events.  

And as he just testified, the trip he made was not a professional trip, as I thought it was, but rather, was something he did personally.  That is what he just stated.  I fail to understand why such a question should give rise to an objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is, in principle, all right, and the profession is not, in itself, such a great surprise, maybe.  But what you are about to deal with now, this trip, is that something which is relevant in this case and which can effect the Prosecution case, and hence should have been mentioned in advance, or is this just a parenthesis?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, it was just a parenthesis to ask the witness what he did during the events, and it does not affect the Prosecution case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Let's follow the evidence, then see how this develops.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Witness, when you made that trip, did you have any problems at the roadblocks? 
A.	Yes.  We would encounter difficulties at the roadblocks.  And sometimes we had to give money or drinks or food to the people manning the roadblocks.  Because they needed those to survive. 
Q.	Witness, you testified previously that there was a location that you knew, the name of which you mentioned, CELA.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber what was happening on the CELA site from the 7th of April onwards? 
A.	On the morning of the 19th, I was going to the market and I noticed that there were refugees at CELA. 
Q.	That was not my question, Witness.  I wished to know whether you knew what was happening on the CELA site from the 7th of April onwards.  Were there any specific events that occurred at CELA from the 7th of April, that is, the question I'm putting to you?  
A.	From the 7th of April onwards, there were refugees at CELA. 
Q.	Did you know some of the people who were there? 
A.	Yes, some of my friends were there as well as some of my neighbours. 
Q.	Could you give the Trial Chamber the names of the people you knew, and who were at CELA? 
A.	There was one of my friends called Nizigiyimana; there was also one Muriwanashyaka.  
Q.	Could you please observe a pause after each name so that I can provide the number under which it appears on the spelling list in order to enable the Trial Chamber to follow your testimony.  
The first name you mentioned is?  
A.	I talked about Nizigiyimana. 
Q.	Number 270 on the spelling list.  
The second person, Witness?
A.	Muriwanashyaka. 
Q.	What letter does it start with? 
A.	M.  
Q.	It is number 241 on the list.  
A.	Muhayimana.  
Q.	Number 212 on the list.
A.	And there was also Emmanuel.  
Q.	Number 62 on the list.  

Witness, did you keep contact with these persons while they were at CELA? 
A.	Yes, I was in contact with them because I would bring them food.  
Q.	Witness, do you know whether the CELA site came under attack? 
A.	Yes, we heard that the CELA had been attacked. 
Q.	How did you come to hear about such an attack? 
A.	In the morning, I was going to the market and I passed by CELA, and I saw young people as well as Interahamwe who were at the gate of CELA, and was -- were trying to enter the premises.  

There were also gendarmes who were trying to push the Interahamwe back, and the Interahamwe were saying that there were Inyenzis there.  They were saying that the Inyenzis were firing at them, and they wanted to know who were the people who were shooting at them.  So when I was passing by, this is what I witnessed.  
Q.	So, Witness, during the break, I will ask you to show on the sketch you made what was itinerary on that morning, it being understood that the document I will propose to you is the same document as the one appearing here, but on a smaller scale.  

Witness, let me backtrack somewhat to put two questions to you:  First question, what time was it when you were passing by the CELA? 
A.	I had just left my home, around 7:00 in the morning, and I was going to the market. 
Q.	And, Witness, the market -- and you can say so now and show it later on, on the plan, where was the market where you were going? 
A.	The market was in downtown Kigali.  It was the Nyarugenge market.  So one had to use the road from Gikondo to downtown Kigali, the centre of town, and this road passes in front of CELA. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Which date is this, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
It was on the 22nd of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
These four persons you knew at CELA, did you know their ethnicity?  
THE WITNESS:
They were Tutsi, but one of them was a Hutu. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And who was the Hutu?  
THE WITNESS:
It was Nizigiyimana. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you mentioned names of persons killed by the Presidential Guard on the 7th of April.  Did you know their ethnicity?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I knew that they were Tutsis, and besides, they had been jailed during the period when the accomplices were jailed.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
On that day, you were (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) or you were walking?  
THE WITNESS:
Which movement were you talking about?  
JUDGE EGOROV:
On the 22nd of April, you left your home at around 7:00 a.m., were you (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) walking?  
THE WITNESS:
I was on foot, because during that period one could not get fuel.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, you did say a while ago that you saw a crowd in front of CELA.  There were the Interahamwe and gendarmes who were trying to stop them.  My specific question is as follows:  How long did you stay there watching the situation? 
A.	I did not stay there for a long time.  I stood there for about ten minutes. 
Q.	Witness, at what time do you situate your arrival in the market? 
A.	I will say that I arrived in the market around 7.30.  But this is just an estimate. 
Q.	How long did you stay in the market? 
A.	I went to the market and I started buying my items.  So I'll say that I stayed in the market from -- for between 30 and 40 minutes.  
Q.	What did you do next, Witness?  
A.	I went back home. 
Q.	Did you pass in front of CELA once again on your way home? 
A.	Yes, I passed in front of CELA.  It was the only route to my house. 
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court approximately at what time you got to CELA? 
A.	Approximately -- after I bought my items, I got -- I came out, so I'll say that I got to CELA around 8.30. 
Q.	And when you got to the neighbourhood of CELA, what did you do? 
A.	When I got to the CELA neighbourhood, I realised that the situation had changed.  I saw that those young persons and Interahamwe had become more violent, and I realised that there was a larger number of Interahamwe than I saw previously, and I realised that the gendarmes were pushing them back with force, asking them what they wanted at CELA.  And the Interahamwe were saying that they wanted to get the Inyenzi who were firing at them during the night.  
Q.	What did you observe, and for how long did you stay there on this occasion? 
A.	I stopped for some time, because this was something quite unusual. 
Q.	Did you observe any particular event while you were there? 
A.	While I was there, I saw that the young persons were screaming, saying that "Release those persons to us".  And he said, "You" -- these gendarmes -- "You want to kill us, the Inyenzi".  I was there, and then suddenly I heard people saying behind me that the préfet had arrived.  I was curious, and I saw the préfet, who was there in front, and he started talking to the gendarmes-- 
Q.	In order to avoid long answers, maybe you should take successive questions so as to shed light on these issues for the Chamber.  

So you just said that you saw the préfet arrive. Now, still approximately, are you able to say around when the préfet arrived? 
A.	Approximately, the préfet arrived between 8.30 and 9:00 a.m. 
Q.	So, Witness, you've just stated -- by anticipating a little on my question -- that you saw him speak to the gendarmes, but before then, let me ask you this question:  When you saw the préfet arriving, was he alone or was he in the company of others? 
A.	The préfet was not alone; he was accompanied by two policemen. 
Q.	Let me ask you to go back to your account a while ago.  You said you saw the préfet arrive with two policemen, you saw him talking to the gendarme.  What then happened? 
A.	Following his arrival, the préfet spoke to the gendarmes.  I don't know what it was that they discussed.  All I saw is that I saw him turn and face the Interahamwe and told them -- and asked them, "What do you want here?" And the Interahamwe said, "We are looking for the persons who are here, the Inyenzi who were firing at us in the evening." The préfet then told them, "You think those persons who are here are Inyenzis?"  And they said, "We want those persons who are here and who are Inyenzis."  And the préfet said, "That is not true.  You said that there were persons who were firing at you, so they have to be people who were carrying weapons.  But those persons who are here are members of the population who are afraid and who sought refuge here."  The préfet told them, "I don't know why you want to attack these persons, they are members of the population, just like yourselves." The Interahamwe then -- some of them started moving their heads, and others said they do not understand why the préfet is preventing them from attacking the Inyenzi, and some of them even said the préfet is an accomplice, and we do not understand why he is preventing us from attacking these Inyenzis who fire at us every day." 

I then saw the Interahamwe disperse angrily, saying that the préfet had just prevented them from killing the Inyenzi.  They started moving away.  We were still there standing, and we saw the préfet turn towards the gendarme and the refugees; and he asked the gendarme to call the other refugees.  And I saw some people come out of the group of refugees and got closer.  I was also curious, and I wanted to see what was happening and what was being said, because some of my friends were at that place.  So I got closer to listen to what the préfet was saying. 
Q.	I am going to put a question to you, Witness.  I believe we have understood what you have just told the Court.  But let me ask you a question, on account of the layout of the place, when you got to the neighbourhood of CELA, were you on the pavement of the road, since you were coming -- you were going home?  Did you remain at that place or did you move? 
A.	I did not remain by the roadside because what was happening was interesting.  I became curious and got closer to the premises to hear the statement of the préfet. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you have explained to us that refugees came out.  Where did the refugees come out from, just so we can understand, because we know the lay out of the place somehow?  We have looked at the plan.  Where were the refugees?  Where were they?  Where did they come out from, Witness?  
A.	The refugees came out of the buildings and moved into the courtyard where there was a car park. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you may proceed.  You heard the préfet, who was discussing with some refugees.  Very quickly, what was the discussion that took place between the refugees and the préfet? 
A.	The préfet called them and told them that, "You see, there is no security here, organise yourselves and I'm going to give you gendarmes who are going to escort you to another place where there are other refugees so that they do not attack you here.  You see that the evildoers have become very violent." 
Q.	Witness, towards which other location did the préfet propose to move these people? 
A.	He was telling the refugees to join other refugees to Sainte Famille church or at Saint Paul's, because that is where there was a larger number of refugees. 
Q.	Witness, among the attackers, did you know some persons?  Where did the attackers come from? 
A.	The attackers were Interahamwes who lived in the neighbourhood. 
Q.	Was -- did they have a leader among them who was directing the operations, whom you are able to identify as such?  
A.	The leader of these attackers was one Fidele. 
Q.	Is that the name that you mentioned a while ago, Witness?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  He was the one in charge of roadblocks in the neighbourhood. 
Q.	Witness, during that event, did you see the conseiller? 
A.	I did not see her. 
Q.	During that event, did you see a woman whose first name is Angeline? 
A.	I did not see her. 
Q.	Witness, this scene that you have described to the Court, how did it end, the scene during which the préfet was talking to the refugees?  What happened thereafter? 
A.	The préfet spoke to the refugees.  He then asked the gendarmes to accompany these refugees.  I left the place and I stood close by the road.  I saw the préfet come out, and he left in the company of his two policemen aboard a Renault 21 vehicle, white in colour.  They went into the vehicle and I do not know where they went. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Court, in general terms, the time that elapsed between when you saw the préfet, which you situate between 8:30 and 9 a.m., and the time when you saw him leave?  That is, the entire duration of the scene that you have described; how long did it take? 
A.	The scene lasted about an hour.  The préfet came out around 10 a.m. 
Q.	Witness, you explained that you went back up to the road.  So you are saying that once you got to the road, it was when you got to the road that you saw the préfet pass by in his vehicle.  And you have just said that this was around 10 a.m.  Now, what were you doing at that time?  Did you remain there or you moved on? 
A.	I remained there to see the fate that will befall my friends who were among the refugees.  The refugees were escorted, they passed by -- they passed close by where I was standing.  I saw my friends and I greeted them.  I expressed my sympathy to them.  I remained there briefly, and then subsequently I went home. 
Q.	Witness, do you know if there were other incidents at the CELA, apart from the one that you have just described to the Court? 
A.	I went home, prepared some food to eat and then I went to bed.  The following morning, I heard that the attackers went to kill people at the CELA centre. 
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court who gave you this information? 
A.	During the period of war, everybody was moving around.  This -- these were people who lived close to the CELA complex who gave me this information.  They told us that the Interahamwe had attacked CELA and killed the refugees who were there. 
Q.	Witness, did you receive information on another attack which may have taken place at CELA the previous day, that is, 21st April? 
A.	I was never aware of this attack. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
So when you went home and prepared some food to eat and then went to bed, was that still on the 22nd?  
THE WITNESS:
I was coming from the market, and that was on the 22nd.  And I heard that people had been killed on the 23rd.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, did you get to know of attacks directed against the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille locations? 
A.	Yes, I was aware. 
Q.	Did -- first of all, the dates of these attacks, did you get to know them and do you recall the dates of these attacks? 
A.	This was a long time ago, and I do not have a clear memory of these dates.  I recall that there was an attack of the Inkotanyi; and the Inkotanyi abducted people of Sainte Famille and Saint Paul. 
Q.	And the dates of these events? 
A.	I do not recall the dates.  But I remember that the attack did take place and people were abducted.  We were not paying attention to dates.  The situation did not allow that. 
Q.	Did you hear that Interahamwe had attacked the Saint Paul and Sainte Famille locations? 
A.	Yes, the Interahamwe attacked those centres.  After the RPF had abducted people from those centres, the Interahamwe became very furious. 
Q.	And, Witness, did you know who carried out these attacks or, rather, who led the attacks? 
A.	These attacks were led by the Interahamwe, and Angeline, and the conseiller, Nyirabagenzi. 
Q.	Witness, did you get to know if the préfet, Renzaho, participated in these attacks? 
A.	I tried to get some information, but I never heard that Renzaho took part in these attacks. 
Q.	Witness, do you know Angeline Mukandituye, in particular? 
A.	I knew her.  She ***************.  I used to go to her house.  I used to go to her house and her friends were -- her children were my friends. 
Q.	In a moment, would you be able to indicate on the plan where Angeline's house was located in relation to your own house? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Are you able to say approximately the distance from your house to Angeline's house? 
A.	There was a distance of about *********** metres between my house and Angeline's house. 
Q.	Witness, did you know Angeline's political activities? 
A.	Angeline was a member of the MRND.  She very often wore the MRND uniform. 
Q.	Mr. President, do you want me to ask another question or did you want to interrupt?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't want to interrupt you, but maybe this is a good time for the lunch break?  If so, I understand there are two remaining witnesses, one is BIT and then another one.  This witness, how much is left, approximately, of the examination-in-chief of him?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, maximum 15 -- ten to 15 minutes.  And we have requested the section to prepare -- to get the next witness ready, TPO -- PPO. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  It seems that we can allow ourselves two hours lunch break today.  So we start at 3 o'clock.  

You will not have a very long cross-examination
MS. MELLUISH: 
No, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we understand that the BIT witness cannot sit in the afternoons, is that so?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, but in any event, we will not have been able to take her -- take him this afternoon.  He is a witness with some health problems and a health certificate testifying to the fact that he can only testify in the morning.  So we are thinking of Friday morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's see how this develops.  Thank you for the information.  

The Court is adjourned till 3 o'clock. 
(Court recessed at 1300H)
(Pages 37 to 47 by Judith Baverstock)
















(Court resumed at 1500H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, the Court is session.  

Defence.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we were talking about the case of Angeline Mukandituye.  You told us that she was involved in political activities and that her house was near yours.  Mr. Witness, my question is as follows:  Did you see the préfet go to the house of Angeline on the 21st and on the 22nd of April 1994 -- or, did you come to know that he had gone there? 
A.	I did not see the préfet go to Angeline Mukandituye's house.  Angeline Mukandituye's house was near my house.  We had the possibility of visiting Angeline's house.  We knew the préfet's vehicle very well because he was an authority.  So if he had come to Angeline's place, we could, at least, have seen his car.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda around the end of June 1994.  
Q.	Did you return to Rwanda, and, if so, when? 
A.	When I left Rwanda, I passed through Gisenyi where I spent some days before crossing the border in order to go to the former Zaire.  I then returned to Rwanda in September 1994.  After my return to Rwanda, I remained in Rwanda.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you prosecuted in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I was prosecuted in 1995.  After being arrested and detained in prison, I was released in 2003.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were telling us you were released, but had you been tried as such accordingly? 
A.	Yes, I was tried.  My trial took place before a court of law and I was acquitted.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when and why did you flee Rwanda? 
A.	I fled Rwanda in 2005 because the Gacaca court, once again, summoned me, whereas I had already been tried and acquitted.  I have to specify here that before Gacaca courts, judges are actually ordinary members of the public; they are not professional judges.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, I've completed my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year was the year of your acquittal, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I was acquitted in 2002 in December, December 2002 -- that is when the judgement was delivered.  I left prison on the 14th of January 2003.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Prosecution? 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So, Witness, just to clarify:  You fled and now reside where you do to avoid prosecution?  
A.	I fled Rwanda because I noticed that people who had already been acquitted following regular trials were, once again, arrested and accused of having committed crimes in respect of which they had already been tried.  And, therefore, I thought this was an injustice and I decided to flee the country. 
Q.	Isn't it more an indication of guilt to flee prosecution, Witness? 
A.	Personally, I don't blame myself with regarding anything.  I just noticed that people who had already been tried were, once again, arrested in spite of the fact that they had been tried publicly -- prosecuted publicly, they were still arrested.  There were prosecution witnesses who would testify by telling lies, so I thought this was unlawful, particularly given the fact that the Gacaca trials take place in courts whereby -- where judges are not professional judges, they are not lawyers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to clarify:  Did you, Maître Cantier, ask this witness to draw a sketch in the break or to mark something?  And if so, was there any result of that?  And if there was a result, is that something you want to show us or is the issue moot now? 
MR. CANTIER:
That's what I asked the witness, but I've not yet had the time to ask him about it.  I had intended to ask him at the end of my examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, have you drawn the sketch with indications which you were requested regarding your residence, as well as the position where you were within the proximity of your residence and the indicated areas? 
A.	I -- I was not given a sketch on which I would have made indications requested of me, because at the beginning of the lunch break I was taken to the place where I was being accommodated and, therefore, I've not had the time to carry out that exercise.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, there's a mistake here because we did give a sketch for -- the sketch to be given to him.  So apparently there was a misunderstanding, because the witness has not received the sketch.  But with your leave, we can give him the sketch again immediately.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The two remaining witnesses are PPO and BIT for this week, I understand.  You indicated that 
Witness BIT only can testify in the morning.  Your proposal was that that witness should then testify Friday morning.  

The preference of the Bench would be if that witness could testify tomorrow morning, and if this witness is not finished by then, we can then have BIT in the morning, and the other witness -- or PPO in the afternoon.  Can that be arranged because we would really like Friday for working purposes.  Is this possible? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I have a serious problem.  We expect on Monday to lead a witness via video link, and I'm the one who's going to lead that witness.  Now, in view of our schedule, I made a reservation -- a flight reservation for tomorrow evening in order to go to where that person is, and I need time to see him, and as well as to return here.  And since I've worked with Witness PPO, that option would be incompatible -- I mean, the reality would be incompatible with the proposal being made by the Bench.  

And I'm sorry about this, but, really, I can't see how I can do things otherwise.  Unless, Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon, since I'm taking my plane late in the afternoon, I can lead Witness PPO.  But in that case, I'll request the Trial Chamber's leave not to be here during examination-in-chief, and ask -- request the Trial Chamber to allow my co-counsel to represent me in cross.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No problem.  But if you have to leave tomorrow night, that is the situation, isn't it? 
MR. CANTIER:
That's the case, Mr. President.  I have to be free at around 2:30 in the afternoon -- 4:30 in the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And are not the chances good that we can start PPO immediately after cross-examination of this witness, and then finalise BIT in the morning, plus PPO before you leave?  Or alternatively, as you suggest, that you have PPO in chief and your co-counsel is present in cross, which would appear to be no problem.  
MR. CANTIER:
That seems possible, Mr. President.  This afternoon I'll request -- I request that PPO be brought here, but I don't know how long my learned friend will take in cross-examination of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you finished the sketch, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga, can you show the sketch to Defence counsel and then to the rest of us.  
You have seen the sketch, Maître Cantier, does it speak for itself or does it require any follow up before we really start the cross-examination? 
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I know the layout of the place, but the witness is testifying in Kinyarwandan.  I don't know whether the indications are in Kinyarwandan, but this document in my opinion, is not immediately understandable when one looks at it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But why don't we follow the normal procedure; namely, we will give this to the Kinyarwandan booth and ask them to translate the Kinyarwandan words on this sketch, and then I suppose Defence counsel can come back to this. 
MR. CANTIER:
That's preferable, Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Defence counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Then we leave the sketch at this stage for the time being and let us proceed with the cross-examination.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Witness, you confirmed this morning some details about yourself on a personal information sheet.  You didn't include your ethnicity.  You are, in fact Hutu, aren't you? 
A.	Yes, I'm Hutu.  
Q.	And you mentioned some attacks that took place on the 7th of April 1994, carried out by the Presidential Guard.  And you said that they -- those attacks included some girls who were killed at JOC.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And those girls were Tutsi, weren't they? 
A.	Yes, they were Tutsi.  
Q.	And it's right, isn't it, that the Presidential Guard that carried out the attacks in -- that you mentioned this morning, they had lists of people they were seeking out to kill, didn't they? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Now, the Presidential Guard are, aren't they, members of the then government armed forces of Rwanda? 
A.	That is correct, they were a unit which was entrusted with the task of protecting Habyarimana.  
Q.	So you agree, don't you, that as early as of the 7th of April government forces were out on the street killing Tutsi? 
A.	I acknowledge that I saw some soldiers of the Presidential Guard; however, I do not have further information which would allow me -- allow me to assert that other units of the Rwandan army committed massacres.  
Q.	Well, we can, at least, agree that this particular unit of the government army did? 
A.	I agree with you, because I saw soldiers of the Presidential Guard kill people whom I mentioned.  
Q.	Did you see the Presidential Guard kill Charles Rwanga who, you said, was killed on the 7th of April? 
A.	The vehicle of soldiers passed there.  Soldiers had a list and they entered into houses of people who were to be killed.  Most of the people who were killed were people who had already been arrested on the pretext that they were accomplices of the Inyenzi.  So they were the people who were killed as from the 7th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you see Charles Rwanga be killed?  That was the question.  
THE WITNESS:
I was not an eyewitness to the actual killing, but we heard gunshots.  After the soldiers had left, we were curious and we wanted to know the identity of people who had just been killed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you saw his dead body or didn't you? 
THE WITNESS:
When we went to Rwanga's place, we found the other people who told us that Charles Rwanga had just been killed.  But the body I was able -- the bodies I were able to see was Ngunda and Nyirinkwaya's bodies who were *******************************. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can we have the spelling of those names?  Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ngunda is probably 265.  

And the other name, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
Stanis Nyirinkwaya.
MR. CANTIER:
304, Mr. President, we mentioned him this morning. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So the answer, Witness, is that you didn't see Charles Rwanga killed and you didn't see his dead body? 
A.	The fact is that he was killed, because some young people told us that they had seen Rwanga's body down on the ground in his compound.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, in order for us all to be efficient, it's important to listen to the question and answer them very briefly.  And, isn't the answer, no?  You did not see Charles Rwanga be killed, and you did not yourself see his dead body.  Isn't the answer, you did not? 
THE WITNESS:
You're correct, Mr. President. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Thank you, Witness, please try to limit your answers, where possible, to yes or no.  

Now, you said that you had friends at CELA, didn't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It's right that people sought refuge at CELA after the 6th of April because they feared that they would be killed or otherwise attacked if they stayed at home? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you agree, do you, that it was mainly Tutsi who were afraid of being killed or otherwise attacked? 
A.	I do not agree with you on that point, because even members of opposition parties were afraid of being attacked or being killed.  
Q.	Well, do you agree with this proposition, Witness, that between the 7th of April and the 
17th of July 1994, there was a genocide against the Tutsi ethnic group in Rwanda? 
A.	I agree with your proposition; however, I have to add that there were other people who were not Tutsis who were killed during that period.  
Q.	The majority of the refugees at CELA were Tutsi, weren't they? 
A.	Yes, the majority of people who had sought refuge there were Tutsi.  
Q.	And you say that you took food to your friends on a regular basis in the first few weeks after the 
6th of April, isn't that right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And you were able to move about freely like that because you were Hutu.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And isn't that why you were able to stand around, you said, watching while Interahamwe attacked CELA? 
A.	Yes, I was able to do that because I was a Hutu.  
Q.	You never had any trouble at roadblocks in Rugenge secteur, did you? 
A.	I did not have any problem except on some few occasions, and that is when those who were manning the roadblocks needed money to buy some beer or needed some foodstuffs.  And on those occasions, we would give some money or some foodstuffs if we were coming back from the market.  
Q.	And you said this morning that the roadblocks in that secteur were erected by Interahamwe and inhabitants who were in charge of security.  That's what you said, isn't it? 
A.	Nibyo --
Q.	So you agree --
A.	-- that was my statement this morning.  
Q.	You agree then that the Interahamwe had been given such a role to be in charge of security by the authorities? 
A.	I do not confirm that the mission was assigned them by the authorities, because even members of the population who were manning roadblocks were doing so on their own initiative, because members of the population had realised that they were being attacked by RPF troops.  
Q.	So, according to you, Witness, what was the exact purpose of the roadblocks? 
A.	The roadblocks were intended for road checks so as to get those who were infiltrating.  And those who were intercepted, were killed.  
Q.	And did you yourself work on a roadblock, Witness? 
A.	I was at the roadblock, like the other members of the population, because when one did not go to man a roadblock, you have to pay a fine -- and you even run the risk of being considered as an accomplice, a supporter of RPF that was attacking the country. 
Q.	Where was the roadblock where you worked, Witness? 
A.	That roadblock was located down hill from where we lived.   And the Interahamwe on some occasions would come to ask us why we took the liberty to remain in our homes when they have to keep the roadblocks to ensure our security.  They, therefore, forced us to go and man those roadblocks ourselves.  
Q.	For how long did you man that roadblock?  By which I mean, was it just for a matter of days or for the period April to July '94, or something in-between? 
A.	I manned that roadblock for some days, because I was never at ease -- when I had to go and man those roadblocks, I did not want to go and check identity documents of people who were passing through.  
Q.	So, are you saying that despite the Interahamwe threatening you, you were able only to work on a roadblock for three or four days? 
A.	I manned that roadblock for some days, because we did not support the idea that some people -- we'd keep arresting other members of the population who had the same rights as ourselves.  
Q.	How many people were arrested when you worked at that roadblock, Witness? 
A.	At that roadblock in -- during that period, some persons who did not have the required documents were arrested, and some of those persons were interrogated.  And they were able to indicate the neighbourhood they originated from.  But some of them were taken away by the Interahamwe who went and killed them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many? 
THE WITNESS:
I was among those who remained at the roadblock, but I observed that there were, at least, two persons who were taken away by the Interahamwe, but I really do not know if those persons were killed by the Interahamwe because the Interahamwe -- if they killed those persons, they did so in another place; they didn't do that at the roadblock. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	How many RPF infiltrators did you stop at your roadblock during the time you worked there? 
A.	At that roadblock, an RPF element was arrested and he was shot immediately because he had a -- he was armed with a pistol, and he was shooting at those people manning the roadblock.  
Q.	So someone was killed at the roadblock when you were there, Witness? 
A.	I have told you that I saw the Interahamwe take away the two persons who were taken away, and I did not see those two persons again.  But, regarding the RPF troop, he was not killed exactly at the roadblock because he was fleeing; and while fleeing, he was still shooting at the persons who were manning the roadblock and who finally shot him.  
Q.	All right, Witness, now on the 22nd of April you said that you went to the market, and you saw Interahamwe at CELA, and then you came back from the market and there were even more Interahamwe at CELA.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	You didn't mention your seeing Interahamwe on the way to the market in the statement you made in May of this year for the Defence, did you? 
A.	This morning I did say that I saw these Interahamwe, because when I was passing by, these Interahamwe were pushing the gendarme because they wanted to enter into the premises of CELA to kill the refugees who were there.  
Q.	Do you agree that you didn't mention it in the statement you gave to the Defence in May of this year? 
A.	But I'm repeating to you that I saw them, so I stand by what I'm saying.  
Q.	Well, perhaps it wasn't important enough back in May, but you agree, do you, that the Interahamwe you describe were armed with machetes, clubs, guns and so forth, do you? 
A.	That is correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What exactly is the contradiction here, if any, between the testimony and the statement?  And I'm asking this if you look at page 1 and count from the bottom, the fifth paragraph from the bottom. 
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, Your Honour, it's -- it's really the fact that the paragraph above that beginning "après" says that on returning from the market "I noticed a group of young people" and so on.  And there's simply no mention of seeing them on the way, but it's not a very significant point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, all right. 
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	Tell us, Witness, how many Interahamwe you saw, let's say, on your way back from the market? 
A.	I did not count the Interahamwe that I saw, but I would say that there were between 50 and 60.  
Q.	And do you remember how many gendarmes you saw? 
A.	I managed to see three gendarmes.  
Q.	Where exactly were you when you saw this apparent attack, Witness? 
A.	I was behind the fence.  
Q.	So how were you able to see those three gendarmes behind a mob of 50 or 60 Interahamwe? 
A.	The Interahamwe were not between myself and the gendarmes.  I was on high grounds and because of that I was able to follow what was happening.  
Q.	Behind a fence, Witness? 
A.	Yes, in fact, there is a gentle slope -- and where I was was higher ground in relation to the premises of CELA.  
Q.	Despite the weapons that the Interahamwe had, you yourself, weren't frightened at all.  Is that right? 
A.	I was not frightened because I'm not among those who were being chased out.  And among the attackers, there were persons that I knew -- and on some occasions, I even had the opportunity to have a drink with some of them.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Sorry.  Mr. Witness, could you remind us what the distance was between you and the place where the Interahamwe and gendarmes were? 
THE WITNESS:
Between 2 and 3 metres.  
BY MS. MELLUISH:
Q.	So, some of the Interahamwe were your friends.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I was not selective.  There were Interahamwe who were my friends, and at the same time I had friends among those who took refuge at CELA.  I was a member of the population just as any other, and I did not discriminate.  I had friends among the Interahamwe -- just as I had friends among those who had sought refuge at the centre.  
Q.	You weren't an Interahamwe yourself then, Witness? 
A.	I was not an Interahamwe.  Besides, the nature of my work did not allow me to join any political party; that would have been incompatible with my job.  
Q.	But after the 6th of April, Witness, things weren't quite normal, were they?  Were you not part of a mob of Interahamwe? 
A.	No, I was not one of the Interahamwe, because as I told you, my job did not allow me to join any political party.  I was at the service of everybody, whichever political party they belonged to.  
Q.	All right, let's put it another way:  Weren't you a militiaman yourself, Witness? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Isn't that what you've been accused of and why you fled from the Gacaca in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I was, rather, accused for the same offences that I had already been tried for and acquitted, and let me remind you that my trial was in public.  
Q.	And were not the allegations against you in that trial that you were a militiaman? 
A.	No, that was not among the charges brought against me --  even if the charges brought against me were trumped up.  The fact is at the end of my trial I was acquitted.  
Q.	So what was it that you were accused of? 
A.	I was accused of having burnt the bodies of persons who were killed.  But investigations were conducted, and the court found that those persons who were accusing me were lying, simply because we had a dispute between us.  
Q.	Now, back to CELA, on the 22nd of April, you said that the -- that the préfet arrived with two policemen.  Are you sure, Witness, that those were the only two people who accompanied the préfet when he arrived? 
A.	I am sure because I even saw these two persons when the préfet was entering, and they were on board the same vehicle.  
Q.	You are sure you didn't see any soldiers with the préfet or other militia? 
A.	I'm sure, because the vehicle on board which the vehicle -- the vehicle on board which the préfet was travelling, could not have contained two more persons.  
Q.	You didn't see the bourgmestre, Jean Bizimana? 
A.	I did not see the bourgmestre.  
Q.	And you said earlier you didn't see Odette Nyirabagenzi or Angeline Mukandutiye?
A.	That is the truth and I did not see them. 
Q.	So Renzaho came with just two policemen and he dispersed the 50 or 60 threatening Interahamwe.  That's your evidence, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is so and I'm sure that the Interahamwe themselves were disappointed, because the préfet was preventing them from killing.  And when the Interahamwe left, they were saying that Renzaho himself was an accomplice.  
Q.	So, we agree, at least, that the préfet had authority over the Interahamwe? 
A.	I'm not able to confirm that because subsequently the Interahamwe were able to go behind the préfet and kill the people who were at CELA.  
Q.	Well, Witness, that's what you told us you heard.  You told us that this morning, but you said the opposite, didn't you, in the statement that you made in May?  In that statement you said you didn't know of any abduction of any refugees at CELA on that day.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	That is what I said in my statement, but I also added that I heard on the following day that during that attack there were people who were abducted at the CELA centre.  
Q.	Well, Witness, you didn't add that in your statement, did you?  Does your story change every month or so? 
A.	I recall that I explained that to the persons who interviewed me -- except the person who recorded my statement omitted that aspect of the statement.  
Q.	Witness, you weren't at Saint Paul's or Sainte Famille during the abduction of the refugees that you talked about this morning, were you? 
A.	That's right.  
Q.	And you weren't present during the Interahamwe's attack the following day, were you? 
A.	I was not present.  
Q.	But, interestingly, you were able to tell the Court that the Interahamwe were led by Odette and Angeline, weren't you? 
A.	I said that at the Sainte Famille location, the Interahamwe -- led by Odette and Angeline -- attacked the element of the RPF, and this attack was carried out because the two women were complaining that these persons were spared instead of being killed.  
Q.	So your friend, Angeline and the conseiller, Odette were leaders of the Interahamwe, were they? 
A.	It is true that they were leading the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Thank you.
MS. MELLUISH:
I have no further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, just one question:  When the préfet arrived at CELA, you said he addressed the refugees.  What were the options he gave them?  You said he mentioned certain places where they could go to.  Could you just repeat that? 
THE WITNESS:
After dispersing the Interahamwe, the préfet told the refugees that they were not safe there and therefore, they had to leave that place in order to go to the other sites where there was better security -- or where there were other refugees.  

The refugees noticed that the préfet was telling the truth, and the préfet asked the gendarme to escort the refugees so that those refugees could go and join the -- join the other refugees at the 
Sainte Famille church or at the Saint Paul centre.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Did the préfet ask them that those who wanted to go back to their residence should do so? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not hear the préfet say that; however, I heard him say that the refugees could leave, and those who opted to return to their homes returned to their homes.  Whereas other refugees went to the site of the Sainte Famille church or to the Saint Paul centre.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Thank you.  

JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, am I correct that once you witnessed the detention of two elements of RPF at the roadblock? 
THE WITNESS:
There were people who did not -- who are not able to show their identity cards, so they were taken away and they were told that they had to go and show the areas or neighbourhoods where they lived.  But after that, I never heard anything about those people again.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
So the fact that those two persons were RPF elements was established on the basis that they failed to identify their place of residence.  Is it correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Those two people were arrested because they did not have normal documents -- although they were saying that they were ordinary members of the public.  That is why people manning the roadblock took them away so that they could show them the exact place where they lived and so that their neighbours could identify them.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are just waiting for this sketch to be returned with the necessary translations.  
(Pages 48 to 59 by Jean Baigent)


















1615H
JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, I just saw from your statement that the préfet gave three options, either to go to Saint Paul, Sainte Famille, or go home.  And you went on to say that some of your neighbours went to Sainte Famille and others returned to the quartier, so my question now is this:  What happened to those neighbours of yours who returned to the quartier?  
THE WITNESS:
I said that the préfet asked the refugees to go to places where there was security.  Since the refugees were coming from different places, some refugees preferred going to the Sainte Famille centre, and some decided to go to the Saint Paul Centre.  And all those were escorted, but some of my friends returned to the quartier, that is, the neighbourhood.  

But -- and people -- neighbours were -- were asking them were did they go to CELA.  Here, I'm referring to Nizigiyimana.  But I saw the neighbours who joined the group -- or, the groups which went to the two proposed sites, that is, the Saint Paul centre and the Sainte Famille church. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any need for any follow-up, Maître Cantier, concerning the annotations on the sketch?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, if it appears to you that the indications here are clear, then I don't see the point of dwelling on this.  I'll just -- I wanted to make sure that the Trial Chamber understands what his itinerary was on that particular day in respect of refugees.  I know the place, but maybe you can look at the sketch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we just note this sketch, no problem? 
MS. MELLUISH:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Do you want to tender it?  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President, yes, Your Honours.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 70. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. 70 admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This was the end of your testimony, Mr. Witness.  Thank you so much for coming to Arusha to testify.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
I would also like to thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused)
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Everyone has the new spelling list, until number 401?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President.  The interpreters have the list.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness PPO in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.
(Declaration made by Witness PPO in French)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have a document with your signature in front of you, Mr. Witness; isn't that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 71. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 71 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Defence?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I would like to request a closed session for the first few questions which I would like to put to this witness.  After that we can go into an open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the duration of the closed session, approximately five minutes?  
MR. CANTIER:
Between 5 and 10 minutes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will do that. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 63 to 64] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 60 to 62 by Ann Burum)



















MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness PPO, we are now back in open session in order to hear your examination-in-chief.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were there civil -- were there Tutsi civil servants at the PVK? 
A.	Yes.  At the PVK, just like as in all state institutions, you had a mixture of all ethnic groups existing in Rwanda.  At PVK you had Hutus, Tutsis, but I don't remember whether there were Twas.  But there were Hutus and Tutsis were who were represented at PVK. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
A.	The names of heads of department at PVK?  We had an administrative and legal department, which was led by Jean-Baptiste Butera.  Then you had the social -- social welfare department, which was headed by Mr. Aloys Simpunga.  

Then there was the police service -- or, police department, which was led by Major Nyamuhimba.  I do not know his first name.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  I think that is it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will delete the penultimate sentence in that answer and place it under seal. 

We are in open session now.  Be careful, Mr. Witness.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	That is why, Witness, I had warned you.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).
MR. CANTIER:
Number 50 is Butera, Jean-Baptiste, Mr. President, on the list.  Simpunga is 382, and Nyamuhimba is number 300.  

(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid we have to delete a couple of words from your last remark.  So we will simply say that Maître Cantier said the following:  "That is why, Mr. Witness, I had warned you."  Full stop.  And the rest is also under seal. 
MS. MELLUISH:
And, Your Honour, perhaps the question that preceded it which also used that word, the original question by my learned friend.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The same word which was now deleted will also be deleted in the question at 16:12:44.  You are absolutely right, Ms. Melluish.  Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I saw you raise your arm.  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I forgot to say that we had a financial services -- financial and economic services department at PVK, which was led by Bunani, Fabien. 
MR. CANTIER:
That is number 47 on the spelling list.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell us in which neighbourhood did you live in Kigali in April 1994? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
"Neighbourhood" can be very concrete.  Do you mean the 12 houses or do you mean the larger area?  If you mean something very small, we don't want to have that answer, do we?  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President, for the caution.  The answer which will be given to us actually covers an area which is quite big and, therefore, cannot reveal information which could identify the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
In April 1994 I was living in a neighbourhood known as Remera-Nyarutarama.  
MR. CANTIER:
Number 322 on the list, Mr. President.  That is the Remera area.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you hear about the president's death? 
A.	I heard about President Habyarimana's death on the 6th of April at around 11 in the evening, a few minutes after 11 p.m., yes, some minutes after 11.  I heard about it on Radio Rwanda, which announced that the country's president, that is, Rwanda's president, as well as the president of Burundi and their entourage which accompanied them, had died in an airplane accident.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You rightly drew our attention to the fact that Remera is 322, but the witness gave another location after that.  Can you repeat what you said after Remera, and possibly spell it if it's complicated?  Just spell it first.  
THE WITNESS:
Remera-Nyarutarama.  Nyarutarama is spelled -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, he didn't spell it.  He just repeated it, "Nyarutarama." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And can you just spell Nyarutarama for us now, Mr. Witness, so that we can move on?  

THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Nyarutarama is spelled N-Y-A-R-U-T-A-R-A-M-A, Nyarutarama. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the night of the 6th to the 7th of April, were you at your house?  Did you spend the night at your house? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I spent the night of the 6th to the 7th of April at home.  I had come back from work, and I was at home.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did you do on the following day, that is, on the 7th of April? 
A.	After hearing the news on the radio, that the two heads of state and members of their entourage had been killed, at around midnight, between 11 p.m. and midnight, there was an announcement which announced the death of the two presidents.  

On the following morning, on the 7th of April, very early in the morning, between 6 and 7 a.m., there was a radio announcement from the ministry of defence, asking everyone to remain calm and stay at home for security reasons.  

So I, too, stayed at home, just like everybody else, in spite of the fact that they were -- there was shooting coming from left, right and centre.  There was firing throughout the night.  I could hear heavy weapons, light weapons.  I could hear explosions, and that continued up to around 9 a.m. on the 7th.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you remain at home? 
A.	No, Counsel, I did not stay at home because the sound of shooting of light weapons, heavy weapons, explosions was in -- was intense.  I decided to leave my house.  And what led me to leave my house, in particular, was that a domestic worker who worked for me came to knock on my door -- or, rather, on my -- and told me that there was a dead body in front of my house's gate.  I went to the road and looked there, and I saw a dead body which had been decapitated, without its head.  That frightened me so much that I could not remain there. 

One or two minutes later, a neighbour of mine, whose name is -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Should we mention the name if it comes, Mr. -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not want that name, I think.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, it's not -- there's no need to do that, and, in any case, we are in an open session, Mr. Witness. 

BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Continue, but just say "a neighbour" without mentioning his name.  Thank you very much.  
A.	A neighbour of mine, who was more courageous than me, came and knocked on my window and told me, "Let's leave."  

I followed him immediately.  We abandoned our houses.  We abandoned our residences.  I sought refuge at a place called Remera Kimironko, at the primary school. 
MR. CANTIER:
Kimironko is number 181. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now, to shorten your evidence, because the main thing for me is to know when did you -- when did you join PVK, Kigali city préfecture? 
A.	It took me some time to get to the PVK.  As I said earlier on, my neighbour and I, and other people we met at Remera Kimironko, we sought refuge at the primary school, where we stayed for about three or four days, approximately.  That place is opposite -- is opposite a hill, where there was an RPF position.  Bullets from the RPF position hit the premises of the Kimironko school.  I was one of the first people to leave that area.  And, once again, I sought refuge in another neighbourhood of Remera, known as Remera groupement -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Groupment" in English.  
THE WITNESS:
I spent about two weeks there.  After that, a friend -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please, when did you arrive at PVK?  Which date?  What was your first working day, if any, during this period there?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I arrived at PVK end of April 1994 -- or, rather, around -- or, towards the end of April. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Witness, when you joined -- or, when you went to the PVK, what was your objective? 
A.	The main purpose of going there was, firstly, to seek shelter, a refuge.  Secondly, I had heard that Mr. Renzaho, who was the préfet of Kigali city, was already there and that he is trying to look for his members of staff.  But I went there basically for two reasons:  One, to seek refuge; secondly, to support the préfet for our usual work.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
Mr. Witness, throughout your itinerary, which I requested you to shorten because it was not essential for the Chamber, did you come across roadblocks? 
A.	Counsel, you can't imagine the situation.  There was so many roadblocks.  There were too many roadblocks.  I took time to move from Remera to PVK, a lot -- a long time, because there were many roadblocks, which were manned by people whom I did not know.  

They did not have uniform.  They were young people who were armed.  Sometimes you'd find them drunk.  I remember that on our way to PVK we had to turn around at two roadblocks, one at around Kicukiro, another at a place called Gatenga.  There was a terrible roadblock, and it caused us a lot of problems. 
MR. CANTIER:
Gatenga is number 88 on our list.  Kicukiro, which we know, is number 178.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you're not a Tutsi, yet - yet - you're not a Tutsi.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), and in spite of all that, you encountered all those problems when you were going to the PVK? 
A.	Counsel, what you are saying is true.  I encountered all sorts of problems, in spite of the fact that I had all my documents.  I introduced myself; I explained myself.  

But, as I was saying, the people manning the Gatenga roadblock, I met a group of five or six persons.  They looked drunk and in an uncontrollable state in a Suzuki vehicle.  They wanted to take everything we had.  They threw everything out.  They searched our pockets to see if we had some money.  We explained, but they were not the -- did not -- they didn't want to understand us.  It was by the grace of God that they subsequently left us to go. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Witness, when you got to the PVK, maybe if, in the course of the examination you are able to recall -- able to remember and give us a more specific date than the one you gave us previously -- but my question is, when you got to PVK, did you meet the préfet?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And before we start with that, we will delete the beginning of this second sentence of Maître Cantier's previous question.  With other words, all the words before "and in spite of all that," in that sentence. 

And now your question, Mr. Witness -- or, answer.  Now your answer, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I got to PVK.  I cannot give you specific dates because this was 12, 13 years ago, but I think it was around the 18th of April, plus or minus one or two days.  I got to the PVK, I think it was, around 1600 hours.  I found the préfet, Renzaho.  He was there.  

When he saw me, I was -- he was surprised because he thought I was already dead.  He was surprised and happy to see me alive and to see me back at the PVK.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  My question, what did he tell you and what instructions did he give you when he was happy to see you back? 
A.	Well, the préfet received me happily.  He took me into his office, and he started explaining the situation at the PVK to me, the absence of staff, the situation of war.  And then he immediately informed me that they had set up a crisis unit at the PVK so as to be able to permanently monitor the development of the situation and to find certain solutions to certain problems that might come up as a result of the war situation.  
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell us in a more specific manner what he asked you to do? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  
MS. MELLUISH:
Your Honour, it seems to me that most of the last answer should be in closed session.  Perhaps we -- perhaps we ought to go in closed session, in fact, if we're going to follow this kind of evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have to do that.  The last answer must be placed under seal.  

Is it possible for you to continue in open session, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER:
In fact, Mr. President, the questions I'm going to put to the witness are on his activities, and, therefore -- well, I thank my colleague for her reflex.  And in his answers, it is possible that he will be identified.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For planning purposes, approximately how much time is left of this witness's testimony, which we have realised now should be conducted in closed session?  What is your estimate, Maître Cantier, the remainder of his examination-in-chief?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, I am about 30 per cent through my examination-in-chief, so I'm left with about 70 per cent.  In terms of time, my estimate would be between one hour and one hour and a half.  I believe one hour should be okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You did tell us, Maître Cantier, that you also are responsible for examination-in-chief of BIT.  Is that the situation? 
MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No?  
MR. CANTIER:
It is Mr. Nekuie who would do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then Judge Arrey was right and -- as usual.  Then the best solution seems to be that we finish this witness's examination-in-chief from 8:45 tomorrow, that we continue immediately with this witness and then move to BIT without cross-examination of this witness so that it will be possible to hear BIT in the morning.  

What is the length of BIT, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER:
From memory, I believe we wrote four hours.  I do not have the document here.  

Yes, it has been confirmed to me that it's four hours, two hours and two hours, because Your -- Mr. President, Your Honours, we made our estimate on the basis of two hours for examination-in-chief, two hours for cross-examination, based on what our colleagues of the Prosecution did.  But here it appears that our colleagues from the Prosecution side are faster with their cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a comment on what is the best procedure to be followed tomorrow morning in view of the health situation of BIT?  
MS. MELLUISH:
Well, if -- if my learned friend is confident that their chief will not take more than two hours, then I suggest we start with BIT -- start with BIT in-chief then carry on with PPO in the -- in the morning to finish his chief.  

Cross-examination, hopefully, will go on in the afternoon.  We can follow on with BIT on -- the second half of BIT, be it, hopefully, cross-examination, on Friday morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In order to avoid any risk for you, Maître Cantier, we think that it's probably best to finish this witness, for whom you are responsible, first at 8:45, and when his examination-in-chief has finished after about one and a half hours, we will then switch to chief for BIT and think that that will be finished approximately around lunchtime.  If that is not the case, we will spill BIT over to Friday morning.  

MR. CANTIER:
Very well, Mr. President.  Very well.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are informed that Laity Kama courtroom on the 4th floor is not in use.  It's closer to all of us, compared to walking down here.  We will, therefore, move to Laity Kama courtroom tomorrow morning at 8:45, and that's also where we will be sitting on Monday, as you know, with the video link.  I think there is reason to believe that we may well sit in Laity Kama on Friday as well, but that will be confirmed. 

Mr. Witness, your testimony continues tomorrow morning at 8:45.  

The Court is adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1707H)
