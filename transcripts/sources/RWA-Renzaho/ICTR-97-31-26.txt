MR. PRESIDENT: 
We should start in open session unless this is a witness whose entire testimony needs to take place in closed.

Defence?  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are a protected witness and will be referred to as Witness BOU in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness BOU in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You have a document in front of you -- you have a document in front of you bearing your signature.  Isn't that so, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, indeed, the information is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Matemanga.  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 44.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 44 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Defence?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, there are -- there is some information which the witness will be revealing or giving.  That information may reveal his identity.  And that is why I would like your Chamber to order a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For a portion of the testimony, not for all of it; is that the request?  We start in closed?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, the answers that I would like to have from the witness would not all reveal his identity.  So, whenever I think that such a risk exists I would ask for a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's good.  That's good, but we cannot change between open and closed all the time.  That's unpractical, so why don't you now start in closed and then you can find a systematic approach which reduces the need for change of venue all the time?  

We will then move into closed session.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness BOU, we are now in open session and your examination-in-chief continues. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  But I would like to hear the question again. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	How do you establish the link - or, what link do you establish between multi-party politics and the denunciations or the accusations that were brought against civil servants, particularly Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	As I have just said, the opposition at the time was made up of people who did not want Renzaho to enjoy a good reputation.  Particularly, because people of the opposition would also have loved to be in his position.  That is at the helm of PVK.  So they were doing everything to discredit him, so that he may be dismissed, and in which case they might have a chance of replacing him.  And in so doing, have an opportunity to cause further trouble within the préfecture. 
Q.	Witness, when did you leave Kigali-ville? 
A.	As I have already said, I left Kigali on the 12th of April at about noon. 
Q.	On your way out of Kigali -- and by the way, where did you go from Kigali, if you would tell the Court? 
A.	I wanted to go from Kigali to settle in Gitarama, where I spent two or three weeks and then moved onto Kibuye.  And I was in Kibuye until July 1994.  

So as I left Kigali town, and as I went through the town, that was the first time I noticed that people had died.  As I went through Muhima sector on my way out of the city, I saw roadblocks that were entirely different from the ones we had in Kibuye, our neighbourhood, which was simply a place for us to relax somewhat.  But now I saw dead bodies around roadblocks and that was the first time for me. 
Q.	From what you observed, who was manning those roadblocks? 
A.	I don't have any names that I can offer.  But these were people of youth wings, we referred to them as bandits because they were not disciplined and they would attack everybody.  

So I was lucky to be known by most of these bandits who were at those roadblocks, because they knew me, given the position I occupied.  But it was easy for me to go through them because they would recognise me easily, but other people didn`t have my kind of luck.  So, I cannot tell you who it was that manned the roadblocks.  These were anonymous people, but basically they were youth. 
Q.	Were there any soldiers and gendarmes on any of those roadblocks? 
A.	I don't think it was possible for soldiers and gendarmes to be there, because they were supposed to be at the battle front.  Anyway, for myself, on my way out I did not see any soldiers or gendarmes at the roadblocks. 
Q.	Witness, and this is one of the reasons why you are here, can you tell this Court what the activities of the préfet were ordinarily in normal times? 
A.	Well, in ordinary times and in accordance with the rules, the préfet had to provide guidance for the population, ensure development within his préfecture area and contribute to the smooth functioning of the préfecture.  This would be in ordinary times, he would go about within the préfecture and educate or sensitise people on various issues and development of matters.  That was the role of the préfet in ordinary times and he was also expected to report accordingly to the authorities. 
Q.	Witness, from the observations you made of the situation in Kigali, would you say that the préfet of Kigali was able to discharge those normal duties at that time or not? 
A.	That is a difficult question.  You see at that time he was no longer préfet of the population he had authority over because it had become heterogeneous.  He was dealing with bombing and war within his own city, so the situation was no longer normal.  Inhabitants of the city were expected to stay at home and so the situation wasn't normal.  And people could have been asked to leave their homes where possible.  And so, under those circumstances it was difficult for any préfet to discharge their duties normally. 
Q.	Witness, from your observations, and from the information available to you, was the préfet of Kigali from the 7th of April 1994 in a position where he had the necessary resources to maintain order, law and security? 
A.	No, he had nothing.  He had nothing.  Because in order to maintain law and order he should have been in a position to have the necessary security forces.  And the only force was the gendarmerie, but the gendarmerie at that time was at the war front with the soldiers.  

Now a thought that comes to mind, rather belatedly, is that this préfecture had a police force, but not only from his préfectoral office.  And, as I have said, there was a curfew from the 7th, and the only area which was more or less safe was downtown, the centre of the city.  

At that time there was no security or no policeman living in that area.  The only way to get back would have been by bus, by taxi or by bicycle.  So I don't know how he managed to get a few policemen in his préfecture because at that time most of them they lived far away from the préfectoral office, and it was difficult for them to get back to the préfectoral office. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you provide an example, a specific example relating to these policemen who did not live downtown and who were therefore far away from the préfectoral office? 
A.	I have several examples.  Many of them came from Kigali-rural, some from Kanombe commune, some from my native commune and others were members of my family who worked at the PVK as policemen.  

And I think around the 9th, they were no longer alive.  They had already died.  So if others had the same difficulty getting back to the préfectoral office, then I am surprised that he was able to find a few policeman.  What I can say is that as I moved around the PVK in that time, I did not see a single policeman who could have been useful in maintaining law and order. 
Q.	Now, witness, you were (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, Counsel mentioned the préfecture.  I don't  -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, yes.  Now, Counsel, you mentioned his title and a region, so we have to place that under seal.  That will not be in the normal open session records.  

Please reformulate the question. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Can you tell the court, Witness, whether the préfet of Kigali-ville had authority over the Rwandan 
	armed forces including the military and the gendarmerie? 
A.	The law on the préfectoral office provides that the Kigali-ville préfecture and Kigali-rural préfecture were préfectures with special standing, in which case the commanders of the gendarmerie detachments were under his command.  And if this was not a war zone, the area commander was also under the authority of the préfet.  For the other préfectures -- but there was no gendarmerie detachment, there was no military detachment for Kigali-ville préfecture and Kigali-rural préfecture.  

So both of them relied on the general staff, and if the préfet -- whenever the préfet of Kigali-ville needed assistance for the maintenance of law and order under, normal circumstances, he would have to apply to the general staff of the gendarmerie or ask the commander of Camp Kigali, so that the necessary troops could be provided for that purpose.  And that obtained as well for Kigali-rural préfecture.  

But the other préfectures were organised in such a way that they could of their own rely on the security services that were within their préfectures, and by simple application the various forces would be provided.  

A short while ago we said that the general staff of the gendarmerie and Kacyiru camp were already busy elsewhere and these were the only sources from which troops could be obtained.  There was no other source. 
Q.	Witness, did you know, or did you find out, that Mr. Renzaho had some relationships or leanings towards the Interahamwe militia? 
A.	As far as I know, well, maybe there were some personal issues which I'm not aware of, but as far as I know and in view of his position as préfet, he was bound to be politically neutral.  He was therefore not expected to have any special links with any political party and further still with any militia. 

MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, I was going to release a secret once more, but let me rephrase.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, in your previous position, did you ever hear mention of Interahamwe militia being trained in Kanombe? 
A.	You need to be more specific.  Kanombe is a commune.  But, anyways, generally speaking, it was being said that Interahamwe were being trained somewhere in the country.  But personally I never heard that except when the opposition in a commune wanted to make some noise or if they saw some youth having a rally, they would complain that it was the Interahamwe or the MDR youth, or some other youth group.  

But this is what happened, whenever any suspicious activity was being undertaken by the youth of any party, what happened was that the bourgmestre of the commune or the conseiller of the secteur in which certain activity was taking place would be informed.  So if there had been any such report in the Kanombe, I might have been able to provide an answer. 
Q.	Let us be a little more specific.  And again my question only relates to the time when you were in office, for if there had been any training of militia in Mr. Renzaho's house or residence, if that had happened, would there have been a reaction on the part of the population or the political parties?  And if that were to be the case, would you have been accordingly informed?  Would you have been accordingly informed?  
A.	Yes.  It would have been blatant and the entire country would also have been informed.  You see -- in his position, if any training had taken place at his residence under the prevailing political climate at the time, that would have been a wonderful opportunity for the opposition to publish any such information in the press.  

And I am sure that he wouldn't have held that position two to three days after such a publication, because the president of the republic would have reacted accordingly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will read the transcripts this evening, Maitre Cantier.  You will say to yourself that, "The question I asked, the previous one, was quite leading.  Actually there were two leading questions in three sentences."  But we just continue now.  But you will see that when you read the transcripts tonight.  Shall we continue?   
MR. CANTIER: 
Well, now I feel bad, right away.  

Now, Mr. President, again I had struggled with this issue of the closed session with this witness.  You see, it is a little tricky, and I hope there will be no problem and I will soon be done.  My examination-in-chief will soon be over.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now let me ask you, Witness, what was the situation of the civilian self-defence that you encountered in your previous position, and even thereafter when you returned to the presidency of the republic? 
A.	As I knew it when I was in that position, the idea of the civilian self-defence was simply to identify strangers who would come into any neighbourhood, particularly at that time of war.  Particularly in view of the idea that there were infiltrators coming from the RPF and who were infiltrating the population.  

So the civilian defence system was set up to identify any strangers within the cellule and report accordingly to the situation.  

If it was an unknown person, an infiltrator, that person would be referred to the commune for further explanation.  If it was a known person, an infiltrator, then that person would simply be treated as such.  

But when I moved on I -- to another ministry, I no longer monitored this issue of civilian self-defence.  But all I know is that it was a system for monitoring strangers infiltrating the population. 
Q.	This is my last question, Witness.  You, who were a senior civil servant and intellectual, how can you explain, in a nutshell, what happened in Rwanda from the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I would take many days to tell the story, but to summarise would be quite difficult.  What I can say, however, is that the prevailing atmosphere at the time, from January, was one with latent tension because Gatabazi was assassinated in January, and shortly after the president of the CDR.  So things were brewing.  Then all of a sudden two to three months thereafter the president himself was also murdered.  

It was a surprising situation, and one can only say that it depended on what each individual thought in their mind, because it is difficult to explain that you will be with someone in the evening and kill them the next day.  It is difficult to explain.  Even those who were present cannot fully understand this. 
Q.	Could anyone have stopped that cataclysm? 
A.	I do not know anybody who could have suddenly stopped what happened after the 6th.  But maybe before the 6th, only President Habyarimana was in a position to calm things down by speaking to the nation.  But those who remained and who were able to provide any instructions and call for peace and reconciliation, most of those were either busy trying to share the booty or prepared to flee, because they didn't know what to expect.  So there was no one who could have gotten the unanimous attention of the population. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And that will be all for my examination-in-chief, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much indeed.  Prosecution?   

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Just on that last point, Witness.  You were asked for an explanation in a nutshell as to what happened after the 6th of April, correct? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Could an explanation be that it was genocide organised and carried out by the Rwandan interim government, its civil servants and its military? 
A.	That is a very technical question.  I cannot even dare to try to define it.  I find at least two words which I can come back to.  First of all, the interim government was set up.  Whereas after the massacres had started for about three days, so they could not have planned something that had already occurred. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you follow up on that.  I just recall that you wanted the witness to draw on the map, 
Maitre Cantier.  And I suppose that was done during the break.  Was there anything you wanted the witness to show us as part of your examination-in-chief before we really start with the cross-examination.  Maybe you even want to tender something?   
MR. CANTIER: 
That is a very good idea, Mr. President.  Absolutely.  The issue of the delineation of Kigali-rural and Kigali-ville, we asked the witness to indicate where he was during the evening.  I would like that document to be tendered into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Could that document be shown to the Prosecution and then to the Bench and the Defence.  And once we have all had a look at it, we can make a decision. 
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we felt that we should do the same exercise with several witnesses, so that every time the Court could see what the witness is talking about.  So, subsequently, we will present another map, if the Court so desires, when we are dealing with the other witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please feel free to come back to that.  Any problem with that document?  No says the Prosecution.  

You have marked two red spots, Mr. Witness, one with a cross.  Was that where you were working or living?  That was your residence with the cross, and the circle was where he was born.  Excellent.  

Next exhibit number.  

MR. MATEMANGA:  
	D. 45.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I think we will probably have to place that under seal since there is an indication of where he was born and had his residence. 
(Exhibit No. D. 45 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Just so that we know where we stand at the outset, Witness, do you accept that Tutsis were targeted during the period of 6th of April to July and killed by reason of their ethnicity in Rwanda? 
A.	There are several questions in that same statement.  Could I proceed one at a time?  Because there are various elements.  You are asking whether I can accept.  I did not follow you.  I didn't get the rest of it.  Could you please rephrase the question in a more specific way?  In smaller bits. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Were Tutsis targeted during the period from the 6th of April to July?  That is the first element. 
THE WITNESS:
That is a fact, but it's not all Tutsis who were targeted, because there were some Tutsis in my own house.  So it's not all Tutsis who were being targeted.
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Do you accept that Tutsis were killed, by reason of the fact that they were Tutsi, during that same period? 
A.	Yes, some elements.  There is indication to show that some people were killed because of their ethnicity, because their identity cards were requested at the roadblocks.  If somebody's ID card showed that he was Tutsi, there were greater chances that that person would be killed, that is a fact. 
Q.	Right.  Now, you say you found out that the president had been killed approximately five minutes after this plane was shot down.  How did you find that out? 
A.	I received the information by telephone and it is the bourgmestre of the commune where the plane had been brought down who called me to give me the information. 
Q.	So the bourgmestre of Kanombe? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And am I correct that you remained in your house from the evening of 6th of April until the morning of the 9th of April?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  However, at the time instructions were made and I was one of those who had to implement the orders.  A curfew had been ordered and at the time of the curfew, I knew when there was a curfew, I knew what would happen to those who would not respect the curfew order.  So I would like to confirm that I stayed at home from the 5th in the evening, after 8:30 p.m., up till 9:00, in the morning. 
Q.	And on the morning of the 9th on your way to (By order of the Court, the name has been extracted and filed under seal), did you come across any roadblocks? 
A.	I've already said that I came across one roadblock which was between the presidency and the        Hotel des Mille Collines.  Slightly above the presidency and just before the commercial centre there was a roadblock that was manned by soldiers.  And that was the only roadblock that I had go through going through the préfecture or to the market. 
Q.	Now these persons who you were trying to assist, had they themselves been assaulted at a roadblock at an earlier point of time? 
A.	With your permission I will come back to the situation of these four people.  To better understand the context, on the night of the 5th, that is, the before the plane crash, these four people, two couples, were at the residence of another family for a week.  One couple lived in Remera just beside the Amahoro stadium, the other couple lived in Kacyiru.  

Since they were involved with a fight at the residence of another family that also lived in Remera, the couple in Kacyiru was accompanied by the other Remera couple in their vehicle and they did not know that the plane of the president had been brought down.  

Once they got -- if you look at the Kigali map, when they got to the roundabout just near the 
Presidential Guard camp they came across a roadblock manned by the Presidential Guards who asked them where they were coming from.  Since they had heard about the plane crash they thought everybody had received the information.  

So it is from there that the Presidential Guard realised that one of the women were (sic) pregnant.  And that is what saved them, because they were in a car.  Instead of going back home, they said they were going to the maternity.  And that is how the soldiers took their ID cards, returned their ID cards and told them to continue on their way.  

Once they got to the maternity they called me and that is how I learned that they were at the maternity and that they had been cut off from their families.  So they asked me to tell their children that they were at maternity and once the situation became normal they would come back home.  

So the only roadblock where they had problems was this roadblock manned by the Presidential Guard, but not the roadblocks in town.  Because the roadblocks in town you could go through those without any problem.  I could go through the roadblocks without any problem. 
(Pages 42 to 49 by Melissa Hook) 





1530H 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Was the reason they had problems was because they had Hutu ID cards -- sorry, Tutsi ID cards? 
A.	No, not at all.  They were Hutus, but they looked like Tutsis. 
Q.	So your evidence, just so I'm quite clear, as early as the evening of the 6th of April, Presidential Guard were targeting people on their appearance and placing them in danger? 
A.	I'm talking about the two couples.  I don't know if other people were attacked on the basis of their appearance.  
Q.	Now, on the -- you told the Trial Chamber in your evidence in-chief that you had gone to the préfecture office on the morning of the 9th to get ID papers, and later I think you referred to laissez-passers and that failure of these persons to have such travel documents would have exposed them to the death penalty.  Is that what you -- fair summary of what you said earlier? 
A.	I think there was some misunderstanding.  I said that, first of all, the priority was the market.  I went to the market in the morning.  After going to the market, I went to the maternity to see my friends.  It is then that I learned that they did not have identification papers, and after which I went back to the préfecture.  So that was in the afternoon. 
Q.	In any event, Witness, do you agree that on the 9th of April, as far as you're concerned, the failure of persons to have identity cards, or laissez-passers amounted to a death penalty?  Do you agree with that? 
A.	That's what people thought was happening at the roadblocks, and that is why I am saying that, at the préfecture of Kigali, there were many displaced persons who left their neighbourhoods and who could not go back to their préfectures of origins without papers.  So they needed to have at least a pass to prove that they were from Kigali-ville and to ensure that they were not coming from Uganda or elsewhere or from the war front.  So it was just a security measure to control the safety of the population. 
Q.	Witness, we're going to be here for an awfully long time if you don't listen carefully to my question.  

My question was:  Would you agree that earlier today that you had indicated that, as of the 9th of April, the failure of a person to have either an identity card or a laissez-passer amounted to a death penalty?  Is that what you told the Trial Chamber earlier today? 
A.	I don't think I said that.  I said that it was almost a death sentence.  If, for example, somebody like myself, I do not have identification papers, I could easily go through without being killed because at least my name or my appearance would have been identified easily, or more easily, than somebody who was not known, who was going through a roadblock and who did not have identification papers.  

That does not mean that that was equivalent to a death sentence.  Otherwise, everybody would have been killed.  A pass was a means of identifying people who were not known and to enable them go through more easily. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to read from the transcript.  Earlier today -- 
MR. MOSES:
And I don't know whether what's on here, Your Honour, is easily identifiable in terms of page or number. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You said this, and I quote:  "Then I came to the realisation they had no identification papers, so I, at that time -- at that time, if you did not have any identification papers, you were exposed to the death penalty, so to speak."  

Is that what you said earlier this morning? 
A.	I said it was like a death sentence, virtually like a death sentence.  However, we had -- I had friends who did not have papers and who looked like Tutsi.  I must add that.  We had trouble. 
Q.	But, according to you, you hadn't seen anyone who was dead as of the 9th of April? 
JUDGE ARREY:
Counsel, you've already made the point.  And it's in the transcript, and that's what he said, too, so can you move ahead? 
MR. MOSES:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, from the 9th to the 12th of April when you left Kigali-ville, did you remain at home or were you wandering around the streets? 
A.	That is what I clarified a while ago.  I said that people from my neighbourhood have a system to relax.  It was not -- they were not physical roadblocks, as such.  They would just come out and visit their friends or walk in the streets just to stretch their legs.  It was some kind of a mobile roadblock, more to relax on the roads.  But I did not have -- I did not remain in the house -- this was between the area called Peage and my house. 
Q.	Did you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Try to slow down, Mr. Witness.  We have mentioned that a few times.  

And the last word was "Peage," P-E-A-G-E. 

And now the question. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Did you visit the Kacyiru gendarmerie camp between the 9th and the 12th of April?  
A.	How could I have been to Kacyiru?  
Q.	Did you visit the Muhima gendarmerie camp between the 9th and the 12th of April? 
A.	Yes.  Since the market in Nyarugenge, it's slightly below the Kayumiya (sic) camp -- Kamuyima (sic) camp, so I had to go through that place. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we agree that we talk about Muhima camp? 
MR. MOSES:
Muhima, correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And there were gendarmes at the Muhima camp, weren't there, on the -- between the 
	9th and the 12th of April?  
A.	No, I did not see any gendarmes, but the -- at the Muhima brigade, I realised that it -- the Muhima brigade was not closed because it was near the road.  I did not see any single gendarme.
Q.	Now, did you see the Accused again between the 9th and the 12th of April, after having seen him briefly at the préfectoral office? 
A.	No, I never saw him again till today.  When I received the four passes, I never saw the Accused again till this day. 
Q.	All right.  And when you left on the 12th of April, was that following a visit by a person -- to your house by a person of the name of Georges Rutaganda?  Did he come and visit you just before you left Kigali on the 12th of April? 
A.	No.  Rutaganda never came to my house, but everywhere I went in the country, from the 9th of April up till I left the country on the 15th of July 1994, I never saw him. 
Q.	He was an associate of yours, though, wasn't he?  You knew him?  
A.	By name.  I knew he belongs to the Interahamwe community, but I had no links with him.  
Q.	Did you travel to Gitarama on the 12th of April by yourself or in a convoy of vehicles, more particularly, a government convoy of vehicles? 
A.	I was alone.  I was alone, along with one of the other couples with the pregnant woman.  I was with them because I had to take them to the single maternity that was around.  So going from Kigali to the roundabout was not a problem for me.  I was driving, and the couple and my wife were with me.  
Q.	And you didn't have any problems getting through the roadblocks, according to your earlier testimony? 
A.	Whenever I came to a roadblock, I would provide explanations, and they would let me go through.  I didn't encounter any particular problems. 
Q.	Well, you said that these were youth of the parties.  Which parties are you talking about, Witness, who are on these roadblocks? 
A.	I don't think that is what I said.  I didn't say "party youth," I said "youth," because at that time there -- there were no parties, as such, because all youth had come together in one party, which was ultimately known as "Interahamwe," and those who were together were referred to as "youth."  And I didn't talk about political parties. 
Q.	Now, you spoke in your evidence in-chief about the advent of multipartyism, and you said that people in opposition tried to discredit the Accused.  Who are the opposition?  Opposition to what? 
A.	I did not only say that they were tarnishing the Accused's reputation, but I said it applied to everybody, all senior civil servants who had remained as members of the MRND and who upheld the ideals of that party.  Those who had left the MRND to create other parties did everything to discredit them, so it was not targeting the Accused or myself, but simply all those who had opted not to follow them into the MRND -- or, into the opposition, but who had remained within the MRND.  So all those who remained within the presidential party were given a bad label by those people. 
Q.	And to make it quite clear, we agree, do we, that the Accused was an MRND man? 
A.	I said of MRND leaning.  You see, as an administrative authority, he did not have to display his political leaning, even if it was the belief of his heart, because that was a matter for him to manage personally.  But he didn't have to display that he was a PSD, CDR, or MRND.  Because, from his position, he was expected to serve the population without any distinction. 
Q.	Now, I'm sorry, Witness.  You've just been talking before in your previous answers about the fact that opposition parties -- and you referred to those who had split off from the MRND -- targeted those who remained loyal to the MRND.  And you had referred in that context to the Accused.  So I'll ask you again:  Do we agree that the Accused, according to you and your information, was an MRND man? 
A.	He was more of the MRND leaning, but I cannot say whether he was a member because I do not know whether he had a membership card.  Because one could be of a political leaning without necessarily being a member of that party. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your previous answer, Mr. Witness, you said that, from the Accused's position, he was expected to serve the population without any distinction.  Was that the answer?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
JUDGE ARREY:
Witness, from your testimony, you said some people remained in the MRND, but, as a préfet, he was prevented from being an active member of any political party; is that right? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE ARREY:
His job as a préfet did not allow him to activate in any political party; is that right? 

THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
JUDGE ARREY:
But could he be said to be a sympathiser of the MRND?  Because you are talking about leaning.  Leaning means you sympathise with the party but, because of your duty, you can't come out openly to support that party.  Are we in agreement?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, yes.  He was referred to as such.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, you have said that, to the best of your knowledge, he did not have any contacts or dealings with the Interahamwe.  Is that a fair summary of what you have said? 
A.	Yes, I said as far as I know. 
Q.	So would you agree -- when you say "as far as you know," would you agree that there was a possibility that he did have contacts with the Interahamwe and you simply are not aware of them? 
A.	That would be speculation because I never saw him support them.  I never saw him maintain any contacts or links with such people.  I cannot make that assertion.  All I can say is that, even not being aware of it, by virtue of his position as préfet, he was not supposed to have any particular links with the militia of one party or another.  Well, if he was involved in any such thing, he must have hid it very well.  And I am not God to know what is in his heart.  
Q.	Are you aware, Witness, that the MDR party, as early as 14th of May 1992, issued a report on those behind the Interahamwe and listed the Accused as one of those charged with recruiting from amongst the reservists for the army and gendarmerie, persons to join the Interahamwe?  Were you aware of it? 
A.	I am not aware of that report, but if I had seen it, I would have remembered.  Now, to say that he was involved in recruitment, I don't think he had the possibility to do so.  However, I was not, and I am not, aware of that report.
Q.	And, as you've indicated, you weren't in Kigali-ville, also from the 12th of April 1994 till the end of the genocide?  That's correct, isn't it? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, would the Prosecutor kindly repeat the question for the interpreters?  Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And you've -- you can confirm, can't you, that, from the 12th of April 1994 till the end of the genocide in July 1994, you weren't in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that I never returned to Kigali, which was being shelled and bombed.  I had taken my family out of that war zone, and I had no reason whatsoever to return to Kigali.  
Q.	And can I take it from one of your earlier answers that you gave at the beginning of my cross-examination that your opinion is that the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda was a spontaneous reaction of the people to avenge the death of President Habyarimana?  Is that your philosophical and -- position?  
A.	I am not sure that I understood your question, but let me attempt an answer.  Whether this was spontaneous is something that is a fact because there was never any mention of planned killings before the 6th.  If it had been planned before that time, one way or the other, it would have been known.  The bourgmestres and the conseillers and all members of the administrative apparatus would not have been overwhelmed in the manner they were, and I think somehow they would have known that there was such planning.  And that is one of the reasons why it became very difficult to bring the population under control. 
Q.	And is it also your position, Witness, that, despite the fact that you weren't in Kigali for most of the period during the genocide, you believe that the RPF disguised themselves as Interahamwe and carried out most of the killings at the roadblocks?  Is that your personal belief also? 
A.	That is my opinion after the fact, after looking back on the killings that took place in Rwanda, after having discussions with other people from other parts of the country and -- and those who were in exile as refugees.  And in piecing the pieces back together, we then became aware that there were genuine Interahamwe and there were fake Interahamwe who were those who killed the most.  And we also realised that even at the roadblocks what happened -- and I'm saying this in hindsight, when the RPF was in a commune that was far away from Kigali, say in Kibuye, on the road, they would arrive and say that "We have come.  We have been sent by the Interahamwe from Kigali to assist you in setting up roadblocks."  

And that would be done.  And they had control over the situation, and they were the ones who identified those who had to be killed.  

But other roadblocks had been set up simply to identify strangers and ask them to identify themselves.  So, on hindsight, we realise that those who were most active on the roadblocks were RPF infiltrators who had now joined the Rwandan youth. 
Q.	Okay.  And would you agree with me that one of the reasons for Tutsis being targeted during the period of the genocide was because of the hate radio, and, in particular, the messages that were coming out over RTLM?  Would you agree with that? 
A.	RTLM only covered a very small part of the country, but there was latent conflict as far back as 1990.  Now, once the population became aware that the majority RPF who were attacking the country were Tutsi, then the whole idea began to spin around in their heads.  So it was not because of Tutsi, as such, but simply because the majority of the RPF were Tutsi.  Tutsi had been recruited from various Tutsi families to join the RPF in preparation.  So this is what was found out.  

What I am saying, therefore, is that the role of the radio station could be minimal. 
Q.	And you were a shareholder of RTLM, weren't you? 
A.	Yes, as a private investor, as anybody else who wants to venture into a profitable business, so I had shares in that business. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, we're now going to -- I now want to ask some questions in closed session, if I can, which may reveal his identity.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you do not have plans to go back in open again?  
MR. MOSES:
No, I don't. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will then move into closed session with the witness in order to hear the rest of your cross-examination.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 57 to 64] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 50 to 56 by Ann Burum)























MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be referred to as Witness LAA in these proceedings.  You have to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Jean-Baptiste Butera in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You have a document in front of you with your signature, isn't that so? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the information in this document is correct, isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
I conclude the information is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Matemanga?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 46. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 46 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, this witness told me that he would like to renounce -- he would like to waive his protective rights and would like to testify under his own name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that element of information. 

Can you confirm that, Mr. Witness, that you want to testify under your own name, not pseudonym, and, therefore, have decided not to require the protection of the Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to reconfirm that fact.  I would like to testify under my own name, particularly, as when I would have to disclose some information, I could still be identified through that information. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have methods in this courtroom to make it possible for witnesses to reveal information which can disclose their identity, and we do that in closed session.  And this happens all the time.  But the question to you is whether you think that it is without risk that you reveal your identity and that the testimony be heard in open session.  That's what we are considering now.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am very aware of the fact that there is a danger, particularly as I occupied an office in my country of origin, and, consequently, the danger is obvious.  But I would like to say that, even on Earth -- while we are on Earth, we will always run risks, so I am always aware of that fact. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  You accept that risk, and we will then call you by your proper names in these proceedings.  Do we agree on that?  
THE WITNESS:
I agree with you, but, Mr. President, with your leave, there are some things which could involve other people.  Maybe I should seek a closed session on those issues. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, do you have an idea of what the witness is referring to?  Can you help us?  
MR. CANTIER:
No, Mr. President, I am not thinking of anything in particular.  This was not discussed with the witness, so I don't have any answer to your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask you, then, Mr. Witness:  These other persons who may risk something through your testimony, are these persons relatives of yours, family members, maybe?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  These are third-party individuals; that's all I can say, third parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Once you waive your protection, Mr. Witness, it will all happen in open session.  And we cannot see how persons not belonging to your family should be a reason to close a session.  So this would appear to be the legal situation, and I am simply saying this to you so that we do not have any lack of communication between you and the Bench.  

With other words, if you are not able to provide a more specific clarification, we will start calling you with your proper name, your own name, and it will all take place in open session.  Are you ready for that?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will, then, start the testimony of witness Jean-Baptiste Butera.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  By your leave, to address the concern just expressed by the witness -- 
JEAN-BAPTISTE BUTERA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Sir, if you would think that you would raise the names of people who could be threatened, avoid raising those names.  

Good -- good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court why you have accepted to come testify before this Court in defence of Mr. Renzaho?  
A.	First of all, it is because I know Mr. Renzaho well, Mr. President, particularly because of the fact that we are from the same préfecture, the Kibungu préfecture, and, furthermore, we have the opportunity to work together at the level of our préfecture, besides our initial duties.  

I would also like to say that we worked together with other people, intellectuals from Kibungu, following the development of our préfecture.  That is the first reason. 

The second reason is that, since 1988, I was part of the Kibungu préfectoral council, and there were some political events that I witnessed. 

Third reason, by your leave, Mr. President, Honourable Judges, I would also like that justice be done.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kibungu is number 43 on the little spelling list.  

You do not have to address the Court by saying "Mr. President" and "Honourable Judges."  You can just focus on the answers, but we appreciate your courtesy. 

Here comes the next question.  
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, do you have a professional -- simple professional relations with the Accused, or do you have friendly relations? 
A.	I also have friendly relations besides professional relations. 
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court what your background -- your educational profile and your professional background? 
A.	As I told you, I am from Kibungu.  I did my studies, my secondary studies, in Zaza (phonetic), and then I continued in the Butare school group.  And from the Groupe scolaire de Butare in -- in '73, I went to Moscow to pursue my medical studies.  And when I finished, I came back to my country of origin, Rwanda, to work in a psychiatric hospital.  
Q.	Witness, could you please try to speak more slowly? 
A.	I will try.  
Q.	You want to continue? 
A.	Okay.  As a doctor specialised in psychiatry, which I did for 10 years, before -- I did that for 10 years before I was appointed as the national programme director for AIDS control. 

That was in '82.  So from 1982 to '94, I was in charge of coordinating the AIDS control programme.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So national programme director for AIDS control?  
THE WITNESS:
I said I was a director of the national programme for the fight against AIDS in the ministry of public health.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, could you please tell us under what circumstances you knew Mr. Renzaho? 
A.	As I have just said, as a medical doctor specialised in psychiatry and working in Kigali, I went to my commune very often, but I also met politicians from my place.  So one morning I learnt over the radio that the presidential order had just made me member of the Kibungu préfectoral council.  And this is a council that was composed of 12 members, intellectuals from various disciplines who were referred to -- or, who were called upon to support the préfectoral officials. 

That is at the time when, in Rwanda, there was only one -- one party.  Within that framework, the préfectoral council, or committee, that was called AED was composed of 24 members, including -- 12 of whom were appointed by presidential order and 12 others who were appointed at the level of the préfectoral congress.  So that is how I got to know Mr. Renzaho at the level of our préfecture, besides his duties in the military and my own duties as a -- as a medical doctor. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the abbreviation you used to characterise the préfectoral council?  Can you just repeat that acronym?  
THE WITNESS:
I have not understood the question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now listening to the English translation of what you have said, and, according to that English translation, you said that "Within this framework the préfectoral council, or committee, which was called --" and then followed something we think was an abbreviation.  And then you continued that this council was composed of 24 members.  Now, this abbreviation, do you have that abbreviation?  Could you give it to us once more, please?  
THE WITNESS:
If it was the préfectoral committee, the préfecture committee of the MRND, which at the time was the only political party before multipartyism came to our country.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
THE WITNESS:
By your leave, Mr. President, I will also like to add that, in this committee, it was later on that some officials created their own political parties which were born -- or, set up in 1991.  

That is what I wanted to add, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Witness, just for the sake of clarity, could you tell us the year when you were appointed at the same time as Mr. Renzaho in this préfectoral committee? 
A.	It was in 1988.  
Q.	How can you explain the fact that two people from Kigali would find themselves in a préfectoral committee of another préfecture than the one where they reside? 
A.	At that time what happened, as far as politics was concerned, was that personalities from other préfectures who were working in Kigali or elsewhere, and who -- Kibungu had 11 communes, so         12 people were appointed by presidential order from each commune.  And, besides that, there were other people who were appointed at the level of the congress.  Since they were resource persons and they had some level of expertise and competence, they were called upon to come to another préfecture to support the préfet and his team for the development of this préfecture.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could this be a good moment to end for the day?  It's 5 o'clock.  
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

So your testimony continues tomorrow morning, Mr. Witness, at 8:45.  
THE WITNESS:
That's all right, Mr. President.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is adjourned.
