MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session.  

Good morning, Professor Lugan.  

Today, it is important to remember brevity, as I said a couple of times yesterday.  

And, Maître Cantier, as you know, the Bench has worked on the Rwandan issues for many years.  We know quite a bit about the general situation in Rwanda, the political context, the history, the etymology, the word Inyenzi; all this is known to us.  What we probably think could be useful in this case is, if you want to focus on matters of direct relevance to Mr. Renzaho.  Please bear that in mind.  The expert report is self-explanatory.  It will be tendered as an exhibit.  But you may wish to go into further details in relation to some of the portions of the expert report, if you think that is useful for the case.  

Please proceed.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for your recommendations.  It is, indeed, the main purpose for the coming of Professor Lugan as an expert witness, which is to enlighten the Trial Chamber on the specific role of the Accused in the matter.  And after putting one last question to the witness, I shall go straight to that matter.  It being understood that the role ascribed to him and his effective role are to be taken into account given the context that was prevailing in the town of Kigali throughout the events.  
BERNARD LUGAN,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Professor, yesterday, as we were reminded by the President, we looked into the background of the situation.  I have one or two additional questions to put to you which are purely historical in nature, and then we shall go onto matters which pertain more particularly to the préfet of the capital city.  

Mr. Expert Witness, my last question yesterday was to know what was the objective of the authors of the attack against the president.  And the following question, which to my mind is important, is as follows:  Could the perpetrators of the attack expect the events that took place from the 6th of April 1994 in the evening onwards? 
A.	This is an essential question and it will probably open new perspectives, even of a judicial nature, because we are faced with a problem.  Either the RPF -- it is, indeed, this group that assassinated President Habyarimana -- launched a process which would lead to what we witnessed, and did so knowingly, and in the specific case in point the Defence are upholding the official theory is completely reversed and turns against the RPF.  

Let me be more explicit.  The RPF tells us that the Hutu extremists had planned and programmed the genocide of Tutsis.  But this genocide, if it had been planned, started the day following the assassination of President Habyarimana over the ensuing days.  If the genocide was planned, the RPF is responsible for launching this genocide.  So it is a position which is difficult to hold, especially since we are aware of the fact that the RPF was fully apprised of all the things that were happening on the government side, on the side of the Rwandan armed forces.  And so we need to put matters into context.  

What is the other assumption?  The other assumption is that the genocide was not planned, and it is the thesis that I uphold.  I consider that the RPF is exonerated, because the RPF knew that serious events were going to take place, killings, and I cannot imagine that the RPF might have made the decision to assassinate President Habyarimana, if it had known that the genocide had been planned.  I cannot go beyond this response.  Of course, we are dealing with a hypothesis.  Was I clear in my answer?  
Q.	Yes, thank you, Professor.  

In order to be quite clear on an essential matter before this Tribunal, which is that of the existence of a genocide or lack thereof, can you tell the Trial Chamber in a few words whether, in full conscience, you consider that there was a genocide of the Tutsis that took place from the 6th of April of 1994 onwards?  
A.	Counsel, you are aware of the fact that the existence of the genocide has been established through judicial notice by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTR.
Q.	Well, I am asking the question to the historian, and I am asking the historian to provide us with his analysis and his conclusions on the existence of this genocide.  You have produced writings on the matter.  
A.	As far as I am concerned, the situation is quite clear.  As I often stated before this Trial Chamber, it is obvious that there was a genocide.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, let us now move onto the issue of planning of the genocide, which is of importance to Mr. Renzaho, since he is accused of having participated in the genocide, and according to the Prosecution case that this genocide was planned.  Do you believe on the basis of the research you were able to conduct, and throughout your work, that there was, indeed, a planning of this genocide that we have just referred to? 
A.	I am assertive in my answer, which is no, just as I was in your previous question when my answer was yes.  There was a genocide, according to the present state of knowledge; and I wish to insist on that point.  In view of the present state of knowledge, nothing enables anyone to state that this genocide was planned.  
And I will go even further.  The last expert brought by the Prosecution who was supporting the hypothesis of a planned genocide, Mrs. Alison Des Forges, stated before this very Trial Chamber, and after extensive research on the matter, that she had not been able to demonstrate that the genocide was planned.  What is strange is that in her testimonies, she also states that she's more and more convinced that such a genocide was planned.  It seems to be inconsistent with any legal or scientific reasoning.  So this is my answer to your question.  
Q.	Mr. Expert, were you able in your research to determine whether Mr. Renzaho had participated in the discussions that took place amongst the senior officers of the Rwandan army during the night of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	To my knowledge, Préfet Renzaho did not participate in these discussions.  As far as I know, he was not present at that meeting, unless I am mistaken.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, do you know whether Préfet Renzaho participated in the meeting of the main military leaders that was held on the 7th of April of 1994, in the morning? 
A.	On the minutes of this meeting, the name of Préfet Renzaho appears, but upon reading the summary of the discussions I have not seen any significant intervention from Préfet Renzaho, but it seems that he was indeed present at that meeting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we now referring to the meeting at ESM in the morning from around 10:00 and 11:00?
THE WITNESS:
We are referring to the first meeting that was held in the morning, and indeed with military leaders.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you have seen the minutes from that meeting?  
THE WITNESS:
I saw the name, I believe.  If my memory serves me right, I believe I saw the name of Préfet Renzaho.  Perhaps it will be necessary for me to take a look at my notes, but yes, I do believe I did see his name, unless I am mistaken.  

I am insisting on that fact, unless I am mistaken, because I cannot be certain about anything.  Perhaps I could be granted two minutes to take a look at my notes, because I might be more specific?  I do not have an absolute and inviolate knowledge of the situation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary at this stage.  Thank you. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	No, Professor, there is no discussion on this matter.  It was just a follow-up question.  

Mr. Expert Witness, did you know what were the responsibilities of the préfet of the capital city in the area of maintenance of law and order, as well as security?  This is not a legal matter I am putting to you; it's just a factual question.  
A.	Yes, the role of any préfet is the maintenance and restoration of public order.  And among his or her many duties there is that one, indeed.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, in light of the Arusha Accords, which you mentioned briefly yesterday, was there any other authority than the préfet who had similar duties in the town of Kigali? 
A.	Well, it's a good thing that you are referring to similar duties, because there is, indeed, UNAMIR that had duties that were of the same nature, even though they were not exactly the same.  UNAMIR had among its main duties to contribute -- I believe that was the word used in its terms of reference -- to contribute to security, to law and order, and so on and so forth.  So it can be said that there are two bodies, two structures, two organisations, which I believe we shall come back to the matter because we will have to show the organisational differences at that level.  
Q.	Yes, Professor, perhaps you can make these observations regarding the organisational issue you have just referred to.  Perhaps you could provide details immediately, since we are dealing with the subject. 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Préfet Renzaho was responsible for the maintenance and restoration of public order without having the requisite means to do so, in view of the peculiar situation prevailing from the 7th of April, in the morning onwards.  Whereas UNAMIR had the necessary means, but was bound by the clause of non -- of military -- of nonmilitary intervention.  So we are faced with one of the other major contradictions of the Rwandan tragedy.  
Q.	I shall put to you a number of additional questions on this matter which are at the heart of our concerns, that is to say, notably the resources or means that were available to Préfet Renzaho in order for him to discharge his duties of maintenance of law and order and security.  

Mr. Expert Witness, do you have a specific idea of the resources that were at the disposal of the préfet?  What forces were at the disposal of the préfet at the capital?  
A.	In times of peace, under normal circumstances, the préfet had no force at his disposal.  The only possibility for him would be to commandeer forces -- law enforcement forces that are mainly the gendarmerie.  But he has absolutely no authority over the gendarmerie and cannot command them.  The forces commanded their own hierarchy.  He does not have any authority, either on the army or on military units.  So what possibility has he of commandeering forces?  

And regarding normal police activities, such as traffic control and so on and so forth, he had at his disposal a force that was mentioned several times before this Trial Chamber and which is well known to it, which is the communal police. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber if you were aware how many communal policemen there were at the time? 
A.	In Kigali, of course? 
Q.	Yes, of course.  
A.	In Kigali, in theory, there were some 250 to 300 communal policemen.  But what is interesting is that these police will disappear into thin air during the night from the 6th to the 7th, so that only a dozen of communal policemen will be available.  I cannot give you any specific numbers.  In my report, I am referring to some 30 or 40-odd policemen, but it is a figure which needs to be confirmed.  What I can tell you regarding the communal police officers, and I asked questions to my French informers and notably officers of the French gendarmerie who had retrained the members of the Rwandan gendarmerie, I asked them -- and it appears in my report; I asked them about their military value of this communal police force, and they were evasive, to say the least.  Besides, the communal policemen only had weapons that were obsolete and they had no real training.  No, it was a communal or municipal police as we have in any major city who are taking care about wandering dogs, about policing the market, and so on and so forth.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, what were the forces of UNAMIR posted in Kigali town on the 6th of April in 1994 in the evening, and it is related to the question I had already put to you on the specific mission of UNAMIR in Kigali, which was to contribute to the maintenance of law and order? 
A.	If you take into account the outskirts with Kanombe, notably, we can estimate -- and this will be a realistic estimate -- that there was a minimum of 1,200 operational men.  As for the -- and that was the force that could be used in the region, with the possibility of sending units more towards the north -- or, rather, with the possibility of bringing back to Kigali other forces that were posted towards the north.  Amongst these forces some were perfectly operational, and I am referring more specifically, as we all know, to the Belgian units, the Tunisian units and the Ghanaian units. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, let us now move onto the 6th of April, in the evening, after the announcement of president -- the president's assassination.  Were there any units deployed in the city of Kigali in order to prevent any disruption? 
A.	Counsel, are you referring to the Rwandan armed forces or to UNAMIR?  
Q.	We are talking about maintenance of order and security, since this was the prerogative of the préfet of the capital city. 
A.	It is surprising to note that during several hours nothing happened:  No soldiers patrolling, no disruption, no notable unrest.  And I am using, in order to make this response, the testimonies by General Dallaire, who moved around in Kigali, and who for several hours did not mention any military activity, as well as Colonel Maurin, or other witnesses.  

What happened was that a plan, a well-oiled plan that was defined in 1992 and upgraded in 1993 with the assistance of French soldiers, was set up.  And the objective of this plan was the protection of the higher Kigali region; that is to say, the normal posts within the outskirts of Kigali.  And the military posts we see in Kigali during the few hours after the attack are positions that are provided for in the plan for the defence of Kigali.  But there were two innovations, strengthening of forces around the strategic junctions around the Nyarugenge plateau and around the defence areas -- defence areas or positions in the CND area where the Rwandan patriotic army had its barracks.  

As regards UNAMIR, what strikes me is that during all these hours, and the hours that will follow, there is a total lack of coordination.  There is no leader.  There is no one commanding over the men.  And there was a serious problem of commandment, and this will explain many of the things that will occur subsequently.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, when did the unrest break out in the city of Kigali?  I am not referring to the acts of war; that will be the subject of a question I will put to you subsequently.  I am referring to the unrest in Kigali from the 6th, in the evening.  
A.	On the 6th, in the evening, there was no unrest in the city of Kigali.   The disruption will start, according to the information available, between -- until a few months ago, I still believed that everything started around 5:00, 5:30, 6:00 in the morning, but today I believe that the unrest started earlier in the night.  It seems that it was around 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning that the first gunshots were heard around the CND.  And, after that, around 7:00 in the morning, that the killings of officials started.  After that, we do not know what happened, and we can only see any clear event which was observed in the beginning of the afternoon with the launching of the war process, and the attendant consequences.  

But, if I may, Counsel, I wish to state, and I believe my approach is somewhat different from that of those you have been able to hear in front of this Trial Chamber.  I wish to say that these events were not written, and it was not destiny that such events should take place.  Because if we backtrack a little bit, and this is explained extensively on page 48 of my report in its French version, in the middle of the night, when the meeting that was held with senior political leaders came to an end, the situation was under control.  

The situation was under control.  The military leaders discussed extensively with Mr. Booh-Booh, who proposed a solution in order to resolve the crisis.  The soldiers agreed with General Dallaire.  And General Dallaire was requested to inform the RPF that anything that might be -- or any action that might be undertaken by the government forces was aimed at putting the Arusha Accords process back on track.  

If we take the example of Colonel Bagosora, in the middle of the night he went back home and went to bed because the situation was under control.  And the situation will know a clear reversal when the RPF decides to launch the ultimate phase in its policy of conquest, that is to say, the general offensive.  And from then on, no one will be able to control the events in Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The source of Colonel Bagosora going to bed, is that his testimony?  

THE WITNESS:
Well, it's simply a way of speaking because, in fact, he didn't go to bed he went to take a shower.  It was just an image I was making use of.  I believe I have worked at length on the specific case of Colonel Bagosora, and I believe I have been able to demonstrate that contrary to what was written by Reyntjens, there was no hidden agenda.  I explained it at length before this Trial Chamber.  I am deeply convinced that there is a sequence of events which is legal, which is mine, and one that is pure fantasy, which is that of my colleague and friend, Reyntjens.  

All that to say that when the meeting that followed the meeting with Mr. Booh-Booh came to an end, the city of Kigali was calm, simply because in spite of the horrible tragedy that had just befell Rwanda, the spirit of reaction and responsibility of the soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces made it possible to calm the volcanoes that might erupt.  And I'm saying that the situation was under control.  Nothing happened.  And, once again -- once again, the launching of the activities -- sorry, the launching of hostilities came from the RPF with shots. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone is off.  The interpreters cannot hear his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered my question about the source.  That's fine.  Thank you.  

What is the next question, please?  

Do you have a question, Judge Egorov?
JUDGE EGOROV:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just push the button.  

So, now, it is Maître Cantier to ask the next question, please.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am much obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, there is one matter that is in my mind, and I believe is in the minds of all of us present here, because I believe that we are all convinced that this genocide could have been avoided.  Even if the situation was under control as you state, why is it that the United Nations forces did not deploy in the capital city as a preventive measure in order to show its men and deter any action from troublemakers, since we know that they will indeed act from the 7th onwards?  Why was there not such a reaction on the part of the military leaders, and especially the military leader of the UNAMIR forces? 
A.	Mr. Booh-Booh is quite clear on the matter, and he clearly states that his subordinate made a mistake.  He clearly states that his subordinate did not report to him and that his subordinate did not mind his own business.  Instead of acting as a soldier, and instead of adopting military measures in coordination with the Rwandan armed forces, and perhaps in coordination with the Rwandan patriotic army, he completely went out of his prerogatives; and instead of remaining at his post of command during the night of the 6th to the 7th, he moved around Kigali and participated in the meeting of political -- of military leaders during which he appeared as a political leader, since he pronounced himself in favour of Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  This is the responsibility of Dallaire.  He was not fulfilling the part that was his.  

Subsequently, when the military situation will evolve to the stage we are all aware of, his hesitations, his incapacity to act, and I would say his absence of self-control, will be the origin of the tragedy.  And for any historian who is somewhat versed in military matters, it is almost indecent to see or to witness the role given by the media to General Dallaire, a positive role, when General Dallaire has significant responsibility in the development of this tragedy.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But didn't UNAMIR have a mandate limited by the Security Council? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, your question is quite a normal one and is quite legal in nature.  But, Mr. President, when one is a military leader, when you have a mandate that is binding to you, and when you have people who are being killed under your very eyes, well, your duty is to go beyond your mandate.  And in any war situation and in any similar situation, a leader makes use of the resources available to him and does not shield behind legal matters, which is an easy alibi to hide one's irresponsibility.  And in the specific case of the death of the Belgian Blue Helmets, I do not hesitate to say that it is a show of true cowardice, because what -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, he should have violated the mandate of the Security Council?

Please don't use words like that in the courtroom.  Cowardice is a very strong word, we don't like it.  

But should he have violated the mandate? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I believe I have used this strong word on purpose, which shocked you.  I am alluding to a very specific event.  When a leader passes by and sees two of his men being lynched and he does not intervene to the peril of his own life, it is a behaviour which is unacceptable in any army throughout the world.  That is all.

Now I wish to withdraw what I said.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Professor, we are not dealing with the matter at hand.
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, as you stated, this is a question to which I would personally want to have an answer.  I was not referring to any war acts, but I was referring to the deployment of UNAMIR within the framework of the maintenance of order and security, which was one of the terms of reference of UNAMIR, the deployment of UNAMIR forces in Kigali in whole or in part, which from what we know was not yet affected by any unrest from the evening of the 6th of April.  So that was the question I put to Professor Lugan, and his explanation on what might be considered a serious fault.
THE WITNESS:
The Court has been presented with a map of Kigali.  Kigali has two plateaus, a lower zone and a passage area.  It is obvious that if UNAMIR had deployed in Kigali and displayed its force, its mere presence, that would have reassured the population to start with.  When it was seen that the population was abandoned to itself, they had to take initiatives because nobody was defending them.  

Secondly -- and this is really fundamental -- that deployment would have dissuaded the RPF from attacking because it would have faced an international force that would have placed it in a back posture.  

That is why, Mr. President, I am very hard on General Dallaire because he had all the means at his disposal; first, as part of his terms of reference; and, secondly, once the nightmare had started, he had to go beyond those terms of reference, because, I mean, he was not assisting a person in danger.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Well, Professor, it is on that precise question, a prior deployment before the commencement of the killings --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier, we are not so interested in Professor Lugan giving evaluations of Alison Des Forges's personality or General Dallaire's behaviour.  Can you help us to steer his testimony in relation to the core of the case, please?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Professor, please let us avoid controversies with regard to some of the players or the analysis of the tragedy.  
My question deals directly with the case of Mr. Renzaho because it affects the security situation of the city of Kigali.  My question, Mr. Expert, please, in a very concise manner, can you tell us, when fighting started in the city of Kigali, as you mentioned, what was the progress, what was the development of such fighting in the days that followed?  And it is for that reason that I asked you to prepare a map that will help us to visualise and better understand the evolution of the military situation, then I will ask you a question on the impact of that situation on security in the city of Kigali.  

So, Expert, can you briefly tell us something about the evolution of the fighting in the city of Kigali?  I believe that with the help of your map, we will make out the zones that remained under control of the republic.  
A.	I apologise to the Chamber for the document I am going to present.  Because it is handwritten, it is not a perfect map.  How am I going to do this?  Is there a camera or something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you a sketch in front of you there?  Can you just show it to me so that I know the size of the document?  All right.  We could try the screen and see whether it is at all possible, but the best way would have been to have made photocopies and distributed it to everyone in the courtroom.  Let's try the screen.  

But maybe it is possible for you to start orally, based on the map, and then we can come back to the sketch afterwards.  

Why don't you try this without walking over to the screen?  We will see whether we need you to move.  

What is your answer?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, sir, a few technical constraints.  It's all right, but the problem is that to understand the map there are colours and we don't have a system of colour photocopying.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Expert, I believe you have the map you have prepared before you.  So you can tell us, since we know a lot here in this Chamber; we know a lot about the city of Kigali.  Can you tell us something about the evolution of the situation on the military front in the city of Kigali?  And I insist on Kigali.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
While you start doing that --

Mr. Matemanga, maybe you could take the map and show it to the Prosecution, and then we will also have a look at it, on the Bench, and the Defence as well, while the witness is explaining what he is about to do.  So, please take the map.
You can manage without the map for a couple of seconds.

Just let us have a look at it, please.  

What's your first question, Maître?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the fighting that began on 7 April 1994, what were the zones that were affected, especially in the Kigali city préfecture by the fighting?  
A.	Well, since we are in the military domain, you are asking me to jump on the sides in the night without a map.  I see that experts in parachutes are smiling.  

Mr. President, humbly, can I have my map back?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you will get it back in a moment.  But I am sure you remember which zones were particularly affected.  Do you remember?  
THE WITNESS:
All right.  Fighting resumed the night of the 6th to the 7th.  There is a debate on the exact moment.  So, enable me to try to fine-tune the moment between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. in the morning.  So, firing resumed at the CND area, and an APR offensive started from the CND.  And that offensive lasted until 9 April.  That's the first phase.  

I can make out four major phases in the fighting in Kigali.  Four phases:  The first phase from 7 to 9 April; a major turning point on 11 April; another turning point on 5 or 6 May; and the last phase, between the 1st and 3rd of July.  So let us look at each of these phases.  

The APR operation was perfectly well prepared.  From the tactical standpoint it was a model.  From the CND headquarters there were two movements that started:  One was targeted towards the Presidential Guard, and the other advanced towards the UNAMIR barracks at the Amahoro stadium, towards the airport.  And this is happening early in the morning.  It's hard to place the exact time, but the movement is over by the afternoon.  And, at the same time, from the north, two columns are advancing.  The first column moves very fast with a specific mission, reinforce the APR contingent, which in the first phase seeks to expand the CND perimeter.  And that column advances directly towards the CND in a two-pronged movement:  One moves toward the gendarmerie camp, which on my map is on point 1; and the other one moves toward the gendarmerie command post in Kimihurura, point 2 on my map.  And, in the morning of the 8th, we are still in phase 1, the major column coming from the north takes a turn towards Remera and towards the UNAMIR barracks.  

From that moment on, the situation is very clear.  The FAR are cut in two, split in two, because the airport road is no longer safe and that presents a double advantage to the attackers.  The first is that they have weakened any possibility of help or support from the airport.  And the second major advantage is that the best contingent of the FAR, that is, the paracommando battalion, or a part thereof that is available, is based in Kanombe so that paracommando battalion, for the rest of the whole battle, is -- it will be trying to defend Kanombe airport and not Kigali.  So that was a major advantage for the RPF.  

The second phase -
BY MR. CANTIER: 
Q.	Mr. Expert, do you say that the first phase ends on the 8th of April?  
A.	Up until 9th of April. 
Q.	So what is it that you have marked on the map?  Have you indicated secteurs that fell under control of the RPF and the front line?  
A.	Yes.  If I can show you my map, I will show you the front line.  The front line from the CND will not change much until the end of the fighting.  The front line would shift.  In other words, the RPF is faced by the gendarmerie.  Because the gendarmerie is fighting against the RPF, they will not be in the streets maintaining order.  So, the RPF has in front of it the gendarmerie and the Presidential Guard and some other units.  So the RPA will seek to go around and finally surround.  So when you look at the map you will see some kind of encircling movement.  
MR. CANTIER:
Mr. President, at this time, having this explanation without seeing the document, could we not try something with the presentation of the map on the overhead projector, otherwise the explanations without the map will be lengthy and not very comprehensive?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's try that now.

Mr. Matemanga, can you make everything ready?  Let's see now whether the camera there can zoom in or whether the measurements on the map are too small.  We will see.  

Please move over, Professor.  Okay.  Yes.

Now, do you want to point on the things here?  Then you have to move over there and point?  Will you do that, please?  Professor, if you want -- you see, it doesn't help that you point on your screen, you must point over there, if there is anything you want to indicate to us.  
THE WITNESS:
Well, to make it simple, there are three phases.  The first phase in red, there; the initial phase, during which the RPA obtains two outcomes, it expands its perimeter; second outcome, it obtains reinforcements; and the third one, it threatens freedom of movement towards Kanombe.  That phase ends on 9 April.  

And the situation as at 11 April, I will not describe it to you.  I will not describe the period from 9 to 11 to you because I don't have enough documents.  But I will describe the situation from the 11th.  

From the 11th is the orange colour position of the RPA.  The RPA has isolated Camp Kami there, which is very important because the military police was based in Camp Kami -- the military police that was responsible for law and order in case of mutiny within the troops.  And the RPA takes control of the entire zone there, the zone that faces the city of Kigali, marked in orange colour.  

And between 11 April and 6 May, there is permanent shelling because the FAR front line; they would resist.  And, then, the RPA goes around the positions there and completely encircles the city of Kigali, in blue.  And what demonstrates the great mastery of the RPF strategies, their professionalism, is that they do not attack directly those defending Kigali, they leave a small passage for exit that will be used on 2 and 3 July.  So as not to embark on a major military discussion, I will just mention the major thesis.  The result is that Kigali city is subjected to various forms of military operations, permanent bombing and shelling.
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Professor, for your precision, for describing the decisive military situation over the four or five days.  

Now, Professor, our objective there is to discuss the security situation in the city of Kigali.  According to your observations and research, what was the impact of that fighting on the security situation in the city of Kigali?  
A.	One can see clearly that in all the zones under control of the RPF, the RPF kills and massacres, and often with the use of lists, because in the Rwandan tragedy there were lists.  But not on the side -- but not used by the side that people tend to place them.  There were massacres, so the population fled.  Urban dwellers moved towards the Nyarugenge plateau. 

But, in addition to that, there is a nightmarish situation.  You shouldn't forget that we are at war.  For years, and as I said yesterday, each of the RPF's offensives pushed towards Kigali hundreds of thousands of refugees.  So, Counsel, you have to see one thing:  The population of Kigali is about 100,000 persons and then it moved up to about 300,000 or more persons.  So this city with that population received hundreds of thousands of refugees.  And the worst part is that from the 8th or the 9th or thereabouts, the RPF, which is advancing from the north, actually empties the major refugee camps that are found a few kilometres to the north of Kigali, and refugees moved into the bottleneck of Kigali.  Unlike what has been told to us, not all of them came to Kigali, some went towards Gitarama, but the bulk of them came to Kigali.  So you have a double mass of refugees in Kigali  and Kigali dwellers in the zone under control of the RPF,  and the refugees that are seeking shelter in Kigali.  So it is an unmanageable, unbelievable situation, and all of that is happening in a context of war.  
Q.	Thank you, Expert, for that clarification on displaced persons and refugees.  

Mr. Expert Witness, what do you know about the infiltrations carried out by the RPF behind the lines, as you have pointed out also on the map?  
A.	Counsel, let us be clear on this.  I did not work directly on that topic, so I will have to rely on a number of factors, notably, what my excellent colleague Reyntjens told me, as well as the writings of Alison Des Forges and Guichaoua, and, of course, the detailed account of Ruzibiza.  So it is on the basis of these four sources that I do confirm that since I didn't carry out specific research on that topic, and I will mention that there is a near obsession in our presence, because when one listens to the radio programmes of the RPF and when one observes its propaganda measures, one realises that the RPF seeks to demoralise the enemy by saying "We know everything, completely everything about what you are doing, so we are in there, everywhere."  So there is a bit of fantasy, too, and all of that is linked up.  
Q.	Mr. Expert, in your opinion, was that situation likely to foster the emergence or the magnifying of this whole issue of a fifth column within the city of Kigali, the city that Mr. Renzaho as a responsible person was in charge of?
A.	We are actually facing a situation of a fifth column.
Q.	So, from what you know, can you explain to us how this process could be manifested in the minds and in the gestures of the Kigali city inhabitants? 
A.	Essentially, it is seen through the phenomenon of the infiltrated persons.  The idea is that the RPF had its men in civilian dress within the defence perimeter of the FAR.  And these infiltrated persons, who do their work, manipulation and misinformation and all that -- and the problem was even more urgent and real in a besieged capital.  So if you look at it from a fundamental and psychological standpoint, there is the context of the heavy historical context that was coming back.  That had been kind of shifted in the time of President Habyarimana, but it resurfaced at this time.  
Q.	Therefore, Professor, with respect to interethnic relations, the projection of this psychology, how did it manifest?  
A.	I did not study the psychology of the killers.  I believe we have good documents, some research work, notably the book of Jean Hatzfeld.  But, to the historian, what is important and essential is to realise that, clearly, within the mass of refugees, the people who have lost everything, the mountain dwellers of Bakiga, who since 1991 have been living in makeshift dwellings on the sides of the roads, the Hutu peasant who is so attached to his territory, firmly established in his area and who is forced to abandon everything, to him, it is the unthinkable that is happening.  He has to flee.  He is uprooted from his origins.  And it is obvious that among these refugees, there are persons who go mad, mad with hatred.  So, well, we are not going to make value judgements, but these are observations.  And this context in which we find banditry -- and we will come back on banditry by and by because it also explains a number of things.  It explains what Préfet Renzaho would say on what was happening.  So it led to an explosion. So it is not possible to look at this tragedy from a calm and clinical manner; we have to see what the situation actually represents.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we agree that Bakiga, which you referred to, is spelt B-A-K-I-G-A?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And now we need the spelling of the author, his first name was Jean.  Please spell his surname for us?  
THE WITNESS:
Hatzfeld, H-A-Z-F-E-L-D (sic).  He has written a number of books on the mentality of the killers.  He notably wrote a successful book in France.  I don't know the title of the translation in English, it is known in the French as Une saison de machetes -- The Season of Machetes.  I am not talking about Hatzfeld's judgements, I am talking about the psychological work he has done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember our gentleman's agreement yesterday?  When I ask you for spelling, please give us the spelling, not the additional information.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. CANTIER: 
I am laughing because of the translation, Mr. President, Your Honours.  It was kind of amusing, "gentleman's agreement" -- the translation of gentleman's agreement.

1000H
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, you've just indicated the context in which Préfet Renzaho found himself with this mission of maintaining public order and security at that time with the use of the mutual forces, that is the gendarmerie, could he have access to those forces? 
A.	In times of peace if there was a riot or unrest in Kigali, which would not be a city at war, which would not be under attack from foreign forces, what would Préfet Renzaho do in such a case?  Well, he would requisition the law enforcement agencies.  And who was in charge of law and order?  The gendarmerie.  But in that case it was not possible.  There was no gendarmerie to speak of.  The gendarmerie was fighting at the front and could not take men from the front in order to come and restore law and order in Kigali.  The gendarmerie intervention unit was isolated from the town of Kigali because of the attack by the Rwandan patriotic front. 
Q.	To which unit are you referring to? 
A.	I'm referring to the police unit, which was at the Kami camp, which is the military police unit, which is not in a position to intervene.  And in Kigali, only the territorial brigades were left. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are spinning out of control now.  Please remember the pause.  Please remember the speed.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I shall do my utmost.  And in order not to waste the Trial Chamber's time, I shall be brief.  

It was no longer possible to requisition the gendarmerie, but there were a number of gendarmes that were left in Kigali.  They were the gendarmes from the territorial neighbourhood brigades.  They were very few, some ten men.  So that the maintenance and restoration of public order, MROP, maintenance, restoration, public order, which was the duty of the gendarmerie, was not able -- was not possible, because there was no gendarmerie forces left. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert, at the stage of your examination we have now reached, could you tell the Trial Chamber what, to your mind, were the prerequisites for the restoration of order and security in the city of Kigali, after the resumption of hostilities, after the 7th of April, of course?  
A.	There is only one, the ceasefire -- the cessation of hostilities.  Why?  So that the gendarmerie units that were at the front could be brought back to tasks of maintenance of law and order in Kigali.  But as long as the expert -- the gendarmes, sorry, were at the front fighting, they could not desert the front lines in order to go and restore order in Kigali.  The first priority was to avoid having the enemy pass the governmental lines. 
Q.	Mr. Witness Expert, if there was such a ceasefire, who was for it and who was against it, who refused it or accepted it? 
A.	Well, this ceasefire was proposed a number of times.  On every single occasion it was refused or violated by the Rwandan patriotic army.  In order to save time, I wish to refer you to page 52 of my report where I give the list of the eight episodes regarding refusals of ceasefire or violations thereof.  

Mr. President, am I following your instructions?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, to perfection.  At the end there, there are seven dashes I think, so there are seven episodes, is that so?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, seven events, Mr. President.  I go up to the 15th of June in Tunis. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, Mr. Expert Witness, in your opinion, why were there such refusals from the Rwandan patriotic army, if we understood you correctly? 
A.	Counsel, the Rwandan patriotic army's going to win the war.  At the time when the war is about to be won, the Rwandan patriotic army is not going to hand the victory over to its enemy.  Because if there was a reversal in the Arusha Accords, at the end of the process there should be elections and at the end of the elections the 20 per cent Tutsis will not weigh as much as the 80 per cent of Hutus.  

Let me speak at a slower place for the stenographers.  

The APR has victory in sight.  Its strategy is being successful, so the Rwandan patriotic army cannot accept the ceasefire.  Because if there was a ceasefire the international forces would be positioned as buffer forces and we would go back to the situation that prevailed before the Arusha Accords at the end of which there will be elections and the 80 per cent of Hutus, even if they are divided, will prevail over the 20 per cent of Tutsis, even if they are united.  It is as simple as that. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, earlier on when I was asking you whether those who had launched the holocaust were aware of the impact and of the consequences of their actions, you provided an answer that was not clear cut.  But from the 8th or 9th of April, are the leaders of the Rwandan patriotic army, and its members, aware of the situation prevailing in Kigali town; that is to say, the killings and the beginning of the genocide? 
A.	Counsel, your question enables me to be more specific about a point regarding what you said; you said that my answer was not clear cut.  Well, that is because I am logical.  As far as I am concerned, there was no planned genocide.  So the Rwandan patriotic army when it -- by assassinating 
	President Habyarimana could not have launched a genocide that had not been planned, or it would mean that the RPA is entirely responsible for the events.  That is quite logical and simple.  

Subsequently, what happened, and this is a new element in my research, and something I would not have referred to, or upheld, a few months ago.  But after having interviewed, a number of military -- of Rwandan survivors who were soldiers, I realised that the few units of the governmental forces did fight with almost nothing at their disposal, practically no ammunition.  From the 8th, in the morning, there was no longer any artillery that went back to Ruhengeri.  

So the Rwandan armed forces fought on their front line, which I showed on the map earlier on, on the CND, Faisal and Gitarama road access will not move.  Why?  Because the Rwandan patriotic forces were not able to cross that line; all their attacks were stopped.  

As for the attack on Kanombe and the paracommando battalion, it is going to staunchly resist.  It will lose almost all of its supervisory forces, as well as a large part of its troops.  With the few resources available to the Rwandan armed forces, they will still try to resist. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, thank you.  The president was asking you to slow your pace once again for our friends, the interpreters and the stenographers. 
A.	I am not amongst those who see everything in black and white.  I do not have a religious vision of history, but rather a realistic vision of history.  And it is not because I am stating that there was no planned genocide by those that have been dubbed Hutu extremists that I'm authorised to say that the RPF let the genocide happen without doing anything.  So, indeed, I accept this definition you gave of my response which was not clear cut, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, we're now going to move to a matter which has retained our attention in this case in an extensive manner, which is the matter of the roadblocks in the city of Kigali.  

Mr. Expert Witness, first of all, this phenomenon of the appearance of roadblocks, in the recent history of Rwanda, that is before 1994, had you already observed this phenomenon? 
A.	Not only did I observe it, but I also witnessed it.  I was in Rwanda in February of 1973 when a number of events took place and I was present and I witnessed this phenomenon.  So I know what a roadblock is.  But at the time there were no massacres and we were not in a war situation.  The phenomenon was recurrent. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Really it should be possible to speak more slowly.  Everyone else is able to do so.  Please do.  

Now, we have two versions in the two languages now.  As to when your visit took place in February in a given country, was it in 1973 that you went to Rwanda, or was it in 1993 that you went to Rwanda?  What did you say?  
THE WITNESS:
I was a professor in Rwanda in 1973 and events broke out in February.  And during the course of these events, I was able to witness the setting up of roadblocks.  There were such roadblocks erected throughout history and I discussed the matter at length with a French officer, Colonel Robardey.  I referred to in my report, R-O-B-A-R-D-E-Y, R-O-B-A-R-D-E-Y.  

Colonel Robardey, who re-organised the Rwandan gendarmerie and who participated in the setting up in 1992, if my memory serves me right, of a defence plan for the city of Kigali.  And in the mind of Colonel Robardey and of the Rwandan general staff, one had to do the utmost in order to avoid a situation whereby the population would be forced to set up roadblocks.  

And it is for that reason, as I refer to in my report, that the defence plan for the city of Kigali provided for checkpoints around Kigali in order to avoid any unrest in the city of Kigali.  But this plan exploded, so to speak, during the night of the 6th April, since the unrest started within the city of Kigali and the war broke out also within Kigali.  Was I clear enough?  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Expert Witness.  This phenomenon of the roadblocks, as you were able to observe before the 6th of April, would it come about following decisions from the government?  Were there orders given to the population to set up roadblocks? 
A.	In the present state of my knowledge and given the grey areas of this case, it seems that these roadblocks were referring to the roadblocks in Kigali during the period after the 6th April; do we agree, Counsel?  
Q.	No, sorry.  I was putting to you a general question, since you referred to the existence of roadblocks throughout the history of Rwanda.  I was asking you whether the setting up of these roadblocks during previous events were the result of decisions made by the authorities; yes or no?  So we are dealing with the period prior to the 6th April.  
A.	Counsel, I am unable to answer your question.  I can tell you I saw roadblocks, but I did not study the matter.  So I do not know. 
Q.	Very well, this brings us now to the period after the 6th of April.  We all agree on the fact that roadblocks mushroomed throughout the city.  So, to your mind, was there any decision on the part of the government or on the part of the préfet on the setting up of such roadblocks? 
A.	On what date, Counsel?  What is your time frame?  
Q.	We are talking about the period from the 7th April.  I put the question to you on the situation before -- 
A.	Because from the 6th of April the situation is going to evolve. 
Q.	7th of April.  
A.	7th of April, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You must stop these exchanges; interrupting each other at the same time.  It makes the situation impossible for our friends in the courtroom.  Pause.  It's all written in the nine rules you have in front of you.  Now, follow them.  
What is the answer?  
THE WITNESS:
It seems that the roadblocks were set up in a spontaneous manner, in a very peculiar context, which is that of a city in chaos.  There is no maintenance of law and order.  UNAMIR has disappeared into thin air.  The disciplined or organised units are at the front and the city is being looted.  We have extensive evidence regarding these events.  The roadblocks, or the setting thereof, should be interpreted as a sign of despair on the part of the population.  The population was distraught and was left to its own devices and was not expecting any assistance from anybody.  And that is the main reason for this fact. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, in the course of your research were you able to determine whether RPF infiltrators had been able to man these roadblocks or be in Interahamwe militia groups? 
A.	Ruzibiza provides extensive details on this phenomenon, and I wish to refer you to his testimony, or rather to his book.  This book is a wealth of details and provides very important names. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, are you referring to the part of your report on pages 30 to 31? 
A.	Partly, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, did you see the communiqué of Préfet Renzaho on the matter dated 
	10th of April of 1994, or do you recall -- or do you remember the contents of this communiqué regarding roadblocks? 
A.	Could I be given a copy of the communiqué, if you please?  
Q.	Just one moment, I shall do that.  

Very well, we shall continue with another matter and I shall come back to this point subsequently, so as not to delay the proceedings.  

Still on the matter of the situation prevailing in the city of Kigali, especially with regard to law and order and security, during the course of your research were you able to determine whether there were any deserters from the army or the gendarmerie or possibly the communal police within the city of Kigali? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Were you able to look into the number of people involved in this phenomenon? 
A.	Counsel, by definition one does not know how many deserters or mutineers there are.  Let us say that the phenomenon was amplified after the 6th of April, but that it was already present before the events.  And we note, and that will be a constant concern of the PVK, we note the desire to put an end to the criminal acts perpetrated by those who could be called, and that would be an euphemism, unruly soldiers.  They were everywhere.  They killed, they raped, they looted.  But I should say that this is not a new phenomenon.  If you so wish, we shall refer to it later on with the report of the person in charge of security under the government of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana. 
Q.	To come back to the phenomenon of roadblocks, are you able, in view of your research, past and present, to give us a clear idea of the people who might have manned such roadblocks?  
Mr. Expert Witness, the Trial Chamber has seen -- we have seen pictures, we've seen photographs, which I'm not showing to you, but I'm asking you whether you can describe this "population" and its origins.  
A.	This is an impossible task because there were many roadblocks.  The roadblocks could be manned by people who had things in common but who were different.  I want to not mix up the military roadblocks, that were official and legal, with the roadblocks -- of which there were two types, either roadblocks set up by populations in neighbourhoods who were trying to defend themselves against bandits; and roadblocks that were set up by the bandits in order to hold the population to ransom.  And this is the reason for which I cannot go any further than what I have just stated.  If you -- Counsel, if you are looking for the communiqué, could you please refer to my memory and give me its salient points?  
Q.	From what I am being told it is Exhibit P. 49, which is a communiqué in which on the 10th of April -- we discussed it, but we are experiencing some difficulty in locating it.  So it's a communiqué in which the préfet makes an appeal with regard to the roadblocks.  
MR. CANTIER:
So it is Exhibit P. 49, Mr. President, Your Honours, which we have analysed at length.  And in its 
third paragraph the préfet says, and I quote, "The roadblocks set up and manned by the population in the different neighbourhoods of the city are prohibited during the day.  They can be erected during nighttime under the direct supervision of the security committee set up in the neighbourhood under the authority of the local officials. "  
BY MR.CANTIER:
Q.	Do you recall this communiqué? 
A.	I do, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Expert, do you know if that request made by the préfet to the population was actually heeded?  If not, why? 
A.	Not all the roadblocks were dismantled, far from it.  Simply because in Kigali at the time there was a state of complete anarchy and law and order had broken down.  

So one who had administrative authority, Préfet Renzaho, who did his best with the puny resources at his disposal to intervene.  And what was the only means he had?  Since he had no physical means, the only means, therefore, was to speak, to try to carry on two tasks at the same time.  The first was to avoid the spread of demoralisation that could lead to a military defeat, so that means the population should not panic more.  And, secondly, try to check or limit the disaster, and try also to curb the uncontrolled nature of the groups that were carrying out atrocities in Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, we have examined, notably, when the Prosecution was cross-examining 
	Mr. Renzaho, a speech, or precisely an interview, granted by Mr. Renzaho two days after, 12th April 1994, in which he called on the population to be vigilant at the roadblocks and also to erect others.  So this is on 12th April.  So do you see any contradiction with the communiqué of 10 April 1994? 
A.	I would like to make a small comment, which is important from the standpoint of methodology.  
	Mr. President, I gave in this report, in the month of June, because I was made to understand that we were into the completion strategy and that we had to move fast.  I was wrong because, for the first time, I'm given a report before the cross-examination.  Of course, I am going to answer all those questions, but that procedure does not facilitate the work of the expert.  Because this far, I used to interfere infine with all the documents. 

Having said that, we have here two elements.  And if I can put it that way, there is a mix up.  There is a mix up between two things that are completely different.  Two legal notions that are radically different.  There's a confusion between the defence of the territory and the maintenance and restoration of public order.  

Now, we are talking -- we are in Kigali, and we're facing a double situation which plays on these 
two elements.  First, the conventional defence of the territory against an enemy that is attacking, and at the same time a complete breakdown of the law and order structures leaning towards anarchy. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There is an objection. 
MR. MOSES:
Your Honour, I'm objecting because I do not think it is appropriate for this witness to comment on an explanation.  The Accused has provided an explanation as to why he said what he did on the 
12th of April.  It's not for anyone else to second guess the Accused as to why he said such things.  
Your Honours have heard directly from the Accused and, with the greatest of respect, it's not a matter which this witness can assist Your Honour in respect of.  Your Honour has heard an explanation from the Accused directly. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to comment on your submission of the report.  It follows from Rule 94 bis that you have to submit your report 21 days prior to the date on which an expert is expected to testify, so everything is absolutely normal.

Now, what is it you can tell us about what the Accused meant by what he said?  What is your basis for that?  Do you, Maitre Cantier, need this expert to interpret statements by the Accused?  That is the objection by the Prosecution.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, that was not the objective of my question at all.  I am not here as a history expert to comment on the statements that may have been made by Mr. Renzaho, notably during his cross-examination.  
There is a document that has been presented to the Chamber, the radio interview granted by 
Mr. Renzaho, and it is on the situation of 12th April that my question is based.  Could the expert have an opinion on the meaning of such a statement, but it is not a comment on the commentary.  I mean it is not that at all. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which part of the document are you referring to now?  What are we discussing?  It's a document containing many pages.  Which page are you in?  On which page are you?  
MR. CANTIER: 
There is a document we have, Exhibit P. 50, Mr. President.  There is no French version to that document.  And at the request of the Prosecution we analysed that exhibit, which is a transcription of a statement made by Mr. Renzaho on the radio.  And in his statement he calls on the population to be vigilant at the roadblocks.  Well, from what we understood -- I don't want to mention that because it will give the witness a clue.  

But my question is:  How does he explain the préfet's call for vigilance at the roadblocks and the ban that he mentioned two days before in his communiqué?  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Witness, all the Defence counsel asked was:  What can you say about the apparent contradiction between Renzaho's formal communiqué, saying that there should be no roadblocks during the day except at night?  And then this other one, where he's saying that the population should be vigilant and should install roadblocks.  That's all that we want to hear. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  That question is very clear.  I understand it now.  Very simply because the military situation changed on 11 April, and we are into the second phase.  I did not understand the question before, now I do.  Because on 11 April, phase two of my plan of attack on Kigali, the RPF expanded it's perimeter and really tried to invade the south of Kigali. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And what direct consequences could that have on the situation in the city of Kigali with respect to security?  That is our concern. 
A.	First consequence, which is a military one, and which further brought in more refugees into the zone still under control of the legal authorities, and with the added concern of seeing infiltrators coming in, and then we come back to this issue of the fifth column.  

So, Counsel, I will apologise because I did not quite understand your question.  But it is clear that there is a situation that keeps evolving constantly depending on the outcome of the fighting and the strategy applied on the ground by Rwandan patriotic army. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in our system I cannot ask you leading questions.  You give so many indications that I just have to rephrase and target my questions.  

Witness, on 12 April something happened within the government since we are talking about that date? 
A.	Counsel, undoubtedly, you are referring to the departure of the government. 
Q.	Yes, that is the question.  We are on that date and we are talking about that particular event.  
A.	The date of 12 April is important.  Why?  Because ultimately Préfet Renzaho, who was all alone with no resources, he no longer even had the moral support that was given to him by the presence of the government.  So we are looking at a situation of complete abandonment.  And it is obvious that, in the face of all this, Préfet Renzaho had to face a very simple choice, either he took the easy way out and left, and in that case he would not have been here today.  Or, as a man of duty, a soldier and a civil servant of the republic, then he would assume his responsibility even when he had nothing, greatness and service of the military function and the administrative function.  Am I clear, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes, and to conclude on the departure of the government and the situation in which it left Mr. Renzaho, the reasons for that departure, for that flight of the government on the 12th of April? 
A.	We know them very well.  The government was afraid of being captured by the encircling offensive around Kigali and that clearly demonstrates that we were in a constantly shifting military situation.  The military situation that explains everything.  I will come back to what I've said a few times before.  The key to everything is the war. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Expert Witness, we are now going to talk about the issue of civil defence.  Could you tell the Chamber briefly the origin of that concept?  Is it of Rwandan origin, or does it come from elsewhere?  
A.	I have written at length on this in my report and I would not waste the time of the Court.  I'll simply say in all armies in the world - or, most armies of the world, I'm sorry, there is that phenomenon that exists.  To go back in history, all the Yugoslavian armies were organised on that basis.  The Swiss army operates largely on that basis.  And for us, in France, we have -- we have the principle of the operational defence of the territory, DOT.  

What was the philosophy behind it?  And I'm sorry, I have to digress a bit to explain the principle.  If I am going too far, Mr. President, then you can stop me, but I think it is important to explain it. 
Q.	Yes, what is of interest to us is to understand the principle of this system which you claim to be universal; you could summarise it. 
A.	The principle is simple.  It is based on the idea that the front line forces may not be able to stop an invasion for various possible reasons.  So the army organises a system that would serve as some kind of second line whose intention is to kind of absorb, or snare, the attacker.  It's a military system.  Do you want me to continue to explain further?  
Q.	I believe your summary helps us to understand.  
A.	In the case of Rwanda, where we have a great difference in numbers of the attackers and the defenders, because we know that the RPA had very few troops and they were tactically well used, but there were very few of them.  And they had to face a Rwandan army that was in greater numbers, but not as well tactically managed.  So the numbers all over the country that were military supervised had to survive, thanks to the front line troops.  That is simple and well understood. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, how is this concept, that is simple and well-known -- how did it enter Rwanda?  At what time? 
A.	To be clear, that principle was never really applied, and that is partly why the government forces lost the war.  Nonetheless, a nucleus of civil defence was set up in the north of Rwanda and specifically in the Mutara region.  But civil defence was never really set up, even though some major declarations or statements were made. 
Q.	Witness, I will ask you a specific question on what you are talking about:  Witness, 1993-1994, on the eve of the events that are of concern to us, were there -- within the Rwandan government was there a civil defence plan to be organised at the national level? 
A.	Some reflection was carried out, sometimes in a very in-depth manner and with some initial application here and there.  But there was really no setting up of the civil defence. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, you are aware of the exchange of correspondence at the end of March 1994 between the préfet of the city of Kigali and the ministry of defence; do you recall that exchange of correspondence?  
MR. CANTIER:
	Mr. President, Your Honours, these are documents that are familiar to us, notably 
	P. 24 and P. 25.  
WITNESS: 
	Counsel, I know these documents very well because I mentioned them in my report, at length I must add. 
MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, I am referring to Exhibit P. 25.
A.	Sorry, can I have the document, please?  Because I don't have P. 24.  Sorry, I do have it.  I am sorry.  I have the document. 
Q.	Witness, does that document outline the civil defence plan, or not, as it came from the army chief of staff, Déogratias Nsabimana, because that letter is addressed by the army chief of his minister of defence on 30 March 1994?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  That document falls in line, or fits into the military hierarchy that we are talking about.  Would you like me to comment on it?  
Q.	Could you give us a summary of the type of organisation that is mentioned in that letter with respect to the military situation? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have this as an exhibit in the case.  It is more or less self-explanatory.  Please now do not repeat what is in this letter, but simply comment briefly on it.  Will you do that?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  I will make a brief quotation and then I'll withdraw, "Popular defence whose structure is made up of soldiers who live out of the camps."  And, of course, I will not add to that.  So, a military structure. 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	And without limiting that document to a single sentence, what, from the geographical standpoint, was the structure of that organisation? 
A.	Counsel, it was clearly military.  Since the section became a cellule and the cellule become a section from the military standpoint, it was completely dependent on the army. 
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, are you aware of the correspondence sent on 31 March 1994 by the préfet of the city of Kigali to the army chief of staff?  I believe I gave you that document.  It is P. 25 of the Prosecution's evidence. 
A.	I have it here before me, Counsel. 
Q.	What is the meaning of the document?  Not there, but within the context of things.  
A.	It is a letter that has three lines accompanied by lists of names of persons, and I think the document too is self-explanatory.  It needs no comment.  It says, "I am sending you a list of reservists chosen for civil defence." 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will then have the 11 o'clock break.  Based on the progress I assume you will have finished before lunch, approximately?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, just so.  I believe another half hour will enable us to get to the end of our examination and will relieve all of us. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And you, Mr. Moses, you have approximately for your cross-examination an estimation of --
MR. MOSES:
Perhaps an hour.  I have taken out a lot of questions.  Last night I went through again and revised -- it may be slightly more than an hour, but I hope not. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's fine.  Then we know we have control, and that was simply the purpose of these questions.  We will then resume at 11:25.  
(Court recessed at 1102H)

(Court resumed at 1129H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maître Cantier.  
MR. CANTIER:
Obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, we were dealing with the matter of civil defence.  According to you, are there any elements or clues enabling one to believe that in the minds of the designers of this civil defence -- the one we referred to a moment ago -- provisions were made for it to be the instrument of the genocide? 
A.	My answer is clearly in the negative.  
Q.	Could you briefly and specifically tell us why you have reached such a conclusion, since we have heard here in this courtroom the Prosecution expert witness who claimed the contrary? 
A.	Once again, I do not wish to waste the Trial Chamber's time.  I wish for you to refer to my report; there's a whole chapter in my report devoted to that subject.  
Q.	But, right now, Mr. Expert Witness, could you summarise for the benefit of the Trial Chamber your conclusions so that we might be informed? 
A.	We are, with civil defence, faced with a military concept, making it possible to avoid a defeat.  It is a military-war structure, which is set up to fight against a well-identified enemy, and I wish to refer you to chapter 1B of my report.  
Q.	But, Mr. Expert Witness, in that specific regard, when you are referring to the enemy, are you including, as claimed by the Prosecution, in this concept of the enemy, the population of Tutsi origin? 
A.	In the civil defence concept, and on the basis of its definitions in the documents you have submitted to my attention this morning, it is obvious that we are referring to a competent enemy with the possibility, thanks to civil defence, to strengthen the army so to speak.  

But let us go further -- let us go further.  The Arusha Accords had been signed.  The theoretical disarmament was observed by the Rwandan armed forces for the most part, but the intelligence services of the Rwandan army noted that there were preparations going on on the side of the 
Rwandan patriotic army.  The government armed forces complied with the accords, and launched a demobilisation process and accepted to consign their weapons, and were not supplied in ammunition or equipment.  

So, the Rwandan military authorities were in an untenable situation on the eve of the 6th of April, and this is the meaning of the document we referred to this morning.  They are aware -- and this is confirmed by Colonel Marchal -- that this attack from the RPA is in the air.  And the authorities are aware of the fact that the Rwandan armed forces will not be able to face such an offensive.  So -- so, an attempt will be made, an attempt which will not be successful, to set up this process of operational defence of the territory.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, you have already partly answered that question.  But, let me put the specific question to you at this moment:  The civil-defence system, as we have just looked at it, had it been set up as at the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	No, because if it had been in place, the military situation would have been quite different.  
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber, in what way it would have been different? 
A.	If civil defence had been set up in Rwanda, the long columns -- and we are at the heart of military strategy, and at the very heart of the definition of territorial operational defence, what would the groups organised militarily have done?  Those that were behind the enemy lines -- well, they would have cut off the major communication lines of the APR towards Kigali, and counter-guerrillas would then have been effective.  So that the Rwandan patriotic army would have been cut off from its bases, and this would have enabled the Rwandan government forces to attack.  The general chief of staff was wrong in not setting up a civil defence throughout the territory in order for the enemy forces to end up in a quagmire and to be attacked from the south.  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, to your knowledge did the authorities and the PVK, in particular, in the town of Kigali try on one occasion or several occasions to organise the population for it to be able to defend itself? 
A.	Counsel, we're still within the framework of civil defence.  You are asking me whether in PVK -- or, taking into account the specific case of the préfet of Kigali there was any attempts to organise civil defence because this is, indeed, what we're talking about.  Is it clear?  
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, to tell you the truth, in this Trial Chamber we have heard about different concepts and it is sometimes difficult for us to have a clear idea of the picture, of the different concepts that were dealt with were civil defence, popular defence, self defence, civilian-self defence, and my question is whether, to your knowledge, there was any attempt to organise or set up one of the three concepts?  
If, indeed, we're dealing with concepts that can be specifically identified. 
A.	Yes, I fully understand your question.  We are all faced with a problem on the matter, because indeed, there are semantical differences, so that any superficial observer or a biased observer will try to hide the true picture in order to make this phenomenon ambiguous.  

So, in order to try and be as objective as possible, let us refer to the only existing definition, which is contained in the documents we were referring to earlier on -- that is to say, military civil defence, and I will be quite clear on the matter.  There was no implementation of any civil-defence system based on that definition.  Besides, the préfet of Kigali was not in a position to implement such a scheme since resources were necessary -- resources that would have been provided by the ministry of defence, but that was not the case.  

It was also necessary to apply the military structure to the cellule level.  It was also necessary for the operational commander of Kigali to provide weapons, ammunition, rations to the men who would be involved in the process.  And, none of these elements I referred to were met.  So there was no civil defence in Kigali; no territorial defence structure was ever set up.  

Let me come back to the two definitions of maintenance of order I gave earlier on, and I can understand some observers and their confusion, because it is no easy task.  For us French people, it is quite easy because we are born, so to speak, in this system of maintenance of law and order, with the gendarmerie in charge of public order, and operational -- territorial operational defence systems.  
But I can understand that it can be difficult for people who are not used to the system.  

So two things are being mixed up here:  The territorial defence, civil defence are being mixed up with the more or less covert or structured -- or fought against improvisations aimed at maintaining and restoring public order in a specific context.  That is to say that the forces entrusted with such a mission no longer exist.  I don't think I can go beyond what I have just explained in my answer.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Expert Witness, in so doing I was referring to a document, and there are a number of them, but I was referring to one document in particular, Exhibit P. 53, which is a transcription of a radio intervention by Mr. Renzaho.  And to be more specific, the references of this exhibit are K0145896, K0145897.  In the French version -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have it in front of us, the French version. 
MR. CANTIER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. MOSES:
Sorry, could we have the English? 
MR. CANTIER:
Naturally, my learned colleague, we are looking for such references, my apologies.  I would not like to take bad habits here.  

In order to make your task easier regarding the English references, perhaps we could refer to the minutes since this radio programme has references in terms of minutes.  The short excerpts I wish to use can be found at 3 minutes and 3 seconds.  As well as the following -- on the following page at 
6 minutes and 9 seconds, so I believe we no longer have the language barrier here.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Yes, Professor, let me refer to two excerpts, so as not to take too much time, two excerpts in which 
Mr. Renzaho refers to activities that are called self defence or civil defence activities.  So, under reference -- under the reference of 3 minutes and 3 seconds, it is indicated in the second paragraph, and I quote:  
"That is why it is necessary for the security committees to be set up in specific locations.  These committees shall bear the name of crisis committee, and those are the committees that will supervise the patrols."

Mr. Expert Witness, what do you know about the committees, which apparently have two names:  
Crisis committee, security committee?  
A.	May I answer?  Well, I do know the document quite well, of course, since I referred to it in my report, and it is true that it is the principle of interpretation of the text and also of this semantical drift.  It is obvious that one can use such elements artificially, but I could mention others to say that civil defence was set up.  But what I'm saying is that it was not the case.  It was not civil defence that was implemented.  

In this indescribable chaos, it was an attempt -- at least, when reading the inventions on the radio of Préfet Renzaho, which were quite interesting.  The double idea that appears -- or, of the two concerns that are obvious are as follows:  Try to control what is -- what can still be controlled; and the other idea, and I have no order of priority for both of them, they both come at the same level, the other one being:  How to ensure a minimum level of security in the face of the looters, deserters, bandits -- let us call them however we please.  Some of which might also, in addition, be infiltrators trying to make things even worse.  

So this is a war method that is quite well known.  One tries to disorganise the enemy so as -- so that it will take away from the front soldiers in order to protect their hinterland, and leave the front without defence.  So, Préfet Renzaho was in an extremely uncomfortable situation; he was faced with an unmanageable situation.  He cannot abandon; he has to give the impression that there's a minimum level of order, when we know that it's no longer the case, and this is why he makes such statements that are aimed at boosting the morale of the troops.  Well, I'm rather referring to the population that is distraught; that is being shelled because we have not referred to it, but -- but during that same period, there were bombs falling on Kigali.  So that is the explanation which, to my mind, is quite simple.  

Let us not to attempt to interpret the tragic circumstances on the basis of assumptions or conclusions.  Let us try to be realistic; let us look at things as they happened on the ground.  Let us look at the situation, and let us not attempt to come up with -- I don't know which mechanism hiding in the background and plotting because this plot is imaginary.  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Expert Witness, and this will be my last question on the matter, in the same interview on the next page, K015 -- 145897, and for the benefit of the Judges and the Prosecution, the excerpt starts at 5 minutes and 2 seconds.  There's a 2nd lieutenant who takes the floor, and Mr. Renzaho, since both of them are speaking on the radio -- so, at 6 minutes and 9 seconds, the second paragraph, Mr. Renzaho says what follows, and I quote:  

"I was referring earlier on to this issue of the committees.  The committees are -- are entrusted with the task of assisting the conseiller in the maintenance of law and of security within the population.  

"I would like the committees to work correctly and to select trustworthy people."

And let me go on the next paragraph, and I quote:  

"These committees will be in charge of the control of these people that we will put in patrols.  These people we will put in..."  

And this is a word in Kinyarwanda, but we understand it, "bariyeri"-- that is to say, the roadblocks, "these people who are to protect the population." 

Mr. Expert Witness, how do you understand these two excerpts? 
A.	The first excerpt, if we look at the date of the verbal intervention of the préfet, Renzaho, such structures do not exist.  So, if one were to claim that reference was being made to civil defence, which is something I question, this would mean that on that date they had not yet been set up -- the first element.  

The second element, Counsel, I go further than the paragraph you have quoted, I can mention other paragraphs.  There is one underlying idea that can be found throughout the interventions of Préfet Renzaho:  Fight against banditry, control of those who are raping women and children.  I'm quoting from the text, and I wish to refer you to page K0145898.  K0145898, where there is one sentence -- 
Q.	Yes, Expert Witness, since you're quoting from the French version, for the benefit of our English-speaking friends, it would be more indicative for you to refer to the minutes as I did earlier on, and in that way we can all know where we are.  
A.	Between 9 minutes and 6 seconds, and 11 minutes and 1 second.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we look at the French version, 145898, there are four paragraphs on that page.  Which paragraph do you want to quote from? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wish to quote two excerpts from the last two paragraphs of the French version.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
And I quote:  

"These committees are not being set up in order to chase the Inyenzi.  The purpose of these committees is not to chase the Inyenzis, but they must be set up in order to monitor" -- and let me interrupt my quote and take it up further down, and I quote:  

"The people who are coming to rape the children and the women..." -- we are, end of quote, we are not in that framework of defence of the territories, as I referred to on several occasions, but, rather, in the context of maintenance of law and order.  So, we are referring to two different things, and it is that point that is very difficult to understand.  

Effectively, I see the difficulty.  It is a -- a fleeting passage, but which singularly explains in the light of the two definitions that I gave since yesterday.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Mr. Expert Witness, since you are on that paragraph, may I ask you whether the quotation I'm going to read out strengthens the opinion that you made -- or, would make you change your opinion?  
MR. CANTIER:
So, it is the same document, Mr. President, third paragraph in the French, and the minutes are 
9.3 seconds -- 9 minutes and 6 seconds, I'm sorry, and here is the quote: 

"So, you see that we cannot wait.  Whereas we would like everything to go on transparently; that everything should happen with discipline.  Without discipline one can understand that we cannot win the war.  

"You understand.  So, we would like that everybody be united.  Where the population notices such bad practices, the first thing they should do is to defend themselves; those committees are not there to see the Inyenzis -- to chase away the Inyenzis, but they have to exist to discover these people who get into houses to commit these acts." 
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	So, here is my question:  Does this passage go to strengthen the opinion you've just expressed or it prompts you to bring out another analysis? 
A.	That passage falls in line with my reflection that led to the answer I gave you previously. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is not surprising, since that passage included the second quote he read out to us a couple of minutes ago.  

All right, the next question? 
MR. CANTIER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I -- I expanded on that on the basis of that document, not artificially.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Expert Witness, we are moving to the end of your direct examination, and I'd like to ask you a question which is of a more general and historical character.  Here it is:  Now, the responsibility of 
Mr. Renzaho as presented by the -- by the Prosecution is induced by a certain interpretation of history?  If your answer is in the positive, can you tell us why?  
A.	My answer is positive, and I'll tell you why.  Because the Prosecution is following a particular strategy, which is respectable, and I think intellectually seductive for the western and Cartesian mindset.  
The Prosecution is a lot more seductive than the improvisation that we're trying to bring in in this Rwandan situation.  That Cartesian view of a clandestine organiser that could do everything -- such as, the Wannsee conference that prepared the genocide of the Jews; that prepared everything -- all the machinery and so on, that is very comfortable for a western mind.  So we rely on facts of reason that are ours.  

Unfortunately, we are elsewhere, in Africa, and in Rwanda, specifically.  Because there are several Africans that don't have the same methods of reasoning -- we are in Rwanda -- and in the official history of the genocide, given that the Prosecution poses that the genocide was organised by a structure at the summit of the Rwandan state that planned everything, it is obvious then to take the organisation chart and look at the persons who are at the top.  And before doing any kind of investigation, we have the culprits already made.  Because the -- the -- the position is that the genocide was planned by the highest state authorities, and in that connection, as Molière would say, that is why your daughter is deaf and dumb.  

Everything is logical when you work from the -- postulate that the -- the official structure explains it, in my opinion, and it explains why Préfet Renzaho is here before us.  It is obvious that another interpretation of history would lead to different indictments, but this is a standpoint of the history and I will not venture into the legal one.  
JUDGE ARREY:
I have a question, Professor:  What do you mean by saying that the Africans don't have the same methods of reasoning?  Can you expand on that for us?  
THE WITNESS:
I did not say so.  Maybe I explained myself wrongly.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain further.  In the heat of the -- my explanation, I may have jumped over the concepts.  Actually, what I mean is that the African situation are not -- or, the European situation, just as the American situation are not ancient ones.  
We are in Rwanda, in a particular period of history and you, the Tribunal, have had multiple explanations.  You've seen that the situation in Rwanda is totally different from that of Senegal.  
For instance, the ethnic relations are not the same.  We have a very exceptional situation; a unique case.  And to impose on a unique system, a European approach where everything is clear, and where everything is obvious and comfortable, does not tie into the reality.  Am I clear there? 

In other words, the context explains a lot of things.  And the transposition of analysis may lead to an intellectual resource, but in my opinion, it would not lead to a deep understanding of the phenomenon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you just referred to the "Wannsee" conference, didn't you?  
THE WITNESS:
Oui, oui.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, with other words W-A-N-N-S-E-E, that was your reference, wasn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
That is right.  Well, at the end of my cross-examination, I'm getting tired as the Honourable Judge's comment brought out, and you too, sir.  

What I meant simply is that in the case of Rwanda, we have not been able to explain and make clear what was done as in the case of the Jewish genocide.  
BY MR. CANTIER:
Q.	That is why I wanted to ask you a question on the references that you are using, Mr. Expert Witness.  

My last question, Mr. Expert Witness, which is on Mr. Renzaho, in your opinion was it possible for him, in the context you've just described, to control the city of Kigali? 
A.	With what means, Counsel?  Since yesterday afternoon, I've been trying to explain that he had no means with his 30 communal police and with old rifles.  No, he did not have the means.  He was completely unarmed, and what I find extraordinary in this whole thing is that Préfet Renzaho did not run away from his responsibilities.  

How many men in his place would have left?  They would have said, "Okay, I'll behave like the government.  I'll going to Murambi; I'll take the first plane out to Nairobi, and I'll leave this hellhole."  

He would not be here today.  This man assumed his duty, but with what means?  Almost none.  
Q.	Thank you.  That was my last question, Mr. Expert Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
You want to tender the expert report now as the next Defence exhibit? 
MR. CANTIER:
Yes, that is what I was going to propose to the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a partial English translation of the end of the report.  You will have no objection that it becomes the second part of the exhibit, even if it's a non-official translation? 
MR. CANTIER:
No objection, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Can I ask you a question, Mr. President?  I was not given a copy of the English version of my report.  I just wanted to check.  I could do that later, but even in previous trials, I've not had my report in English, which is fundamental because there are more English speakers than French speakers, and I would not like my thoughts to be distorted in the translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document will probably be subject to an official translation later, and I'm sure that you will be able to get it at some point in time.  

Mrs. Ben Salimo, the next exhibit number is then, for the Defence? 
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Number D. 109, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't the CV 109?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
I am sorry.  It is D. 110, A and B -- if there's a French and English version.  
(Exhibit No. D. 110A and D. 110B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Lugan, you've given an interpretation of the events in Rwanda.  My first question to you is:  Do you accept that an historian's interpretation of events is governed, at least, in part, by their own world view? 
A.	It is obvious, Counsel, that history is not like chemistry or physics.  In chemistry, we know that this or this addition will give this.  Here, we are dealing with people whose facts and gestures are interpreted by a human being.  So, it is obvious that some element of subjectivity or subjectiveness will exist.  And the entire work of the historian is precisely not to avoid, because it is unavoidable, to limit as much as possible that which, in his own background, could lead him to a wrong interpretation.  The essential concern being -- and I think I'm working within that methodology, to constantly review one's approach in the light of sources that may appear.  
Q.	In terms of your own world view, Mr. Lugan, do you agree that in the course of your testimony in the Ndindabahizi trial, you described yourself as a right-wing anarchist? 
A.	I think that suits me very well, with some aspect of a mousquetaire, if you like.  
Q.	Can you help the Trial Chamber and me understand how does a right-wing anarchist - or, does it -- differ and, if so, how does it differ from a fascist? 
A.	Counsel, you could have asked me, too, if I prefer Bourgogne to Bordeaux, and tell me how the testimony of a lover of Bordeaux helped the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we avoid the general issues of the witness's political point of view, and move towards the case.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You told the Trial Chamber yesterday, Mr. Lugan, that you -- the last time you were in Rwanda was in 1983, correct? 
A.	Yes, in Rwanda -- before, yes -- inside Rwanda, yes.  Because as I said, without giving further clarification, I came to the periphery of Rwanda, notably where a number of refugees were found because I worked on that topic, but I didn't go inside Rwanda.  
Q.	So, any Rwandans who you have spoken to, who would form the basis of your knowledge, are those who had left Rwanda; correct? 
A.	You are not lucky with me, Counsel, because, as you see, I was known in the French academic circles of being a defender of RPF views.  And up until 1997-1998, and given all my errors of analysis, I'm approached with RPF witnesses, rather than witnesses from the other side.  And it was bit by bit that my thinking changed; notably here at the ICTR, following my various appearances.  And then I noticed that there was a gap.  
Q.	I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Lugan, but my question was a simple one, and didn't require a lengthy answer, and I'll repeat my question which was:  The Rwandans you have spoken to, to form the basis of your knowledge -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel speak into the microphone?
MR. PRESIDENT:
While we are waiting for Mr. Moses to speak into the microphone, there is a little problem in one sentence, just a few sentences back.  

Do we have the record correct now that you arrived in Rwanda in 1973, you stayed there for 11 years and that you left in '83?  Is that the evidence?  
You see, we have now Mr. Moses saying that the last time you were in Rwanda was in 1983.  And what you explained to the Trial Chamber was that you arrived in Rwanda in 1973.  Can you just explain that, please, very briefly?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I didn't say that.  I got to Rwanda on 7 September 1972, and I assumed duty on 20th September 1972 at the university.  And I left Rwanda -- I don't have the precise date, but in August 1983 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you arrived on the 7th of September 1972, and you assumed duty on...?  Now, please repeat slowly the date?  
THE WITNESS:
16 September 1972 -- the 16th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you left? 
THE WITNESS:
In the month of August 1983.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	My question again, Mr. Lugan, if you could listen, is that the Rwandans you had spoken to who formed the basis of your knowledge are those who have left Rwanda.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, but the Rwandans belonged to two categories.  You have the Hutus, and this you probably know -- obviously know, a number of Tutsi officials, who are notably in France.  I will not cite their names, of course, but who left Rwanda a number of years ago and with whom I've discussed. 
Q.	Thank you.  You refer to -- as one of your sources on page 10 of your report -- a Vincent Ntezimana, N-T-E-Z-I-M-A-N-A, as someone you've relied upon.  Do you know where Mr. Ntezimana is now? 
A.	Yes, I think he's in the hands of the Belgian courts.  
Q.	He's been convicted of genocide, hasn't he, Mr. Lugan, in Belgium? 
A.	However, Counsel, I did not -- I focussed on issues that were of interest to my analysis, because if you follow your reasoning, an analysis cannot be based on examination and cross-examination of people who are here in Arusha.  History requires the approach of the infinity -- of sources and elements.  But, I expected that question because a counsel in a previous trial asked me that question.  Of course, your file is empty and you have to -- you have to fill it, even artificially.  
Q.	Well, how many of the people, who you have relied upon in making your report and your opinions, have themselves been charged of genocide or accused of genocide, Mr. Lugan? 
A.	None of them, none of them -- those that I interviewed in France, and they were all Tutsis - or, the majority of them, and I do not think that your Tribunal has undertaken investigations in that direction.  
Q.	Well, in your report you quoted -- in support of your proposition that there was little the Accused could do -- a document by the Accused himself; testimony about the tragedy that bathed the Kigali population in blood from 6th April 1994; correct? 
A.	Please, could you kindly point out the page to me? 
Q.	Do you not remember relying on something the Accused wrote?  A simple question; if you don't remember I'll try to locate it for you.  
A.	Please find it, please find it, it will be of service to me.  
MR. MOSES:
In the English, Your Honours, it's on page 16.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	It will be, perhaps, the second-to-last page in your report, Mr. Lugan. 
A.	Counsel, are you -- are you talking about the last-but-one page of my report? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will find this reference in your report on page 63, the third paragraph of the French version in brackets.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, a prior question:  Should I understand that counsel for the Prosecution worked only on part of my report?  In that case, the issue is closed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All that is happening now, is whether you agree that on page 63 there is a reference to Mr. Renzaho's document, dated 1997, just on the middle of the page.  Do we agree that it is there? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, I do not agree, because I understand -- except I am making a mistake, or have omitted -- and this is important for a logical view -- I may be wrong.  

I understand that the Prosecution has only a part of my report.  
(Pages 27 to 38 by Jean Baigent)











1230H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please listen.  Your report has been disclosed to everyone in this courtroom well in advance of the deadline according to Rule 94 bis.  You wrote it in French.  Everyone has it.  But, as a working tool, the Prosecutor translated the last part into English in order to assist him in his own preparations.  But this is immaterial.  What matters now is your original.  You will, on page 63, find that reference.  Now, will you please confirm that it's there?  

And the mike, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Am I to consider that counsel for the Prosecution has read the totality of my report?  Because if you have not read my whole report, I'm wasting my time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can be convinced that everyone in this courtroom has read the totality of your report.  But now we are asking questions about parts of it, just like Defence counsel did the last three hours.  

Now, shall we agree that the reference is there?  
THE WITNESS: 
Page 63 of my report.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We all note the reference.  

What's your next question, Mr. Moses?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Are you satisfied, Mr. Lugan, as a matter of principle and of academic rigor, to accept the word of the Accused on whose behalf you are testifying?  
A.	I fail to understand your question. 
Q.	In terms of your sources and the reliability of them, are you happy to rely upon the word of the Accused as the basis of your opinion? 
A.	I now understand your question better, thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Let us be clear:  I used this excerpt from the document by Préfet Renzaho, which I quote.  I am exposing myself; I am not hiding anything.  It comes from Renzaho, and I quote him.  Why?  Well, because I could have done as others could have done, and did not do, of course, and put information X or Y.  And I'm quoting Renzaho for which information?  Is this of fundamental importance?  I did find this reference in Renzaho's writings saying that there were only two magistrates left in Kigali.  So I quote, and then I provide the source.  So this is perfectly correct work from the historical standpoint.  
Q.	So, from the -- your interpretation of the historical standpoint, it wouldn't matter that someone themselves is accused of genocide?  
A.	If Mr. Renzaho, who is here, is telling us that right now it is noon and not 3 in the morning, should I not believe him just because he's being charged with genocide?  
Q.	Now, you refer, in the course of your report, to interviews you've had with French officers.  Correct?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Now, you quote extensively from a French officer, Maurin, M-A-U-R-I-N, and Robardey, who you have also quoted.  Were either of those gentlemen in Rwanda for the duration of the period of the genocide?  
A.	First I wish to put a question to you.  What do you mean by "comprehensive"?  Because if what you mean by that -- if you're talking about extensiveness, I could have referred to the reports of the officers, which is not the case.  What do you mean by that?  You are a -- can you tell me I mentioned part of their reports but not the reports in their totality?  
Q.	No, no.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Professor Lugan, we realise that sometimes, if a question is unclear, the witness may ask for clarification.  But it is not the task of a witness to ask the Prosecutor or the Defence questions; it is for the witness to answer the questions.  Now, don't you consider the question reasonably clear so that you are able to answer it?  
THE WITNESS: 
No, the question is not clear, because it is true that I made use of the statements of these two officers, but these statements were not extensively quoted.  In French there are words that have a specific meaning.  So, Mr. President, yes, I made use of the reports of these officers which were reports on the situation.  One was in Rwanda, and it is Colonel Maurin, who was the French military attaché, who was present in Rwanda for a number of years and who, in addition, was the deputy of the general chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces.  So he was someone who knew everything about the Rwandan armed forces.  And this is why I'm saying that this is not extensive, because clearly I have not referred to most of the sources that were given to me by Colonel Maurin, because some of them pertain to other works.  So I'm not nit-picking, I'm trying to be specific, contrarily to your indictment, which is not.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now you have answered the question.  What is the next question?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	When did Mr. Maurin -- was Mr. Maurin in Rwanda on the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	Of course, since he was there in his capacity as person in charge, as I said.  But I'm mentioning it in my report, but you're aware about that, Mr. -- Counsel for the Prosecution, since you read my report.  I gave the dates on which Colonel Maurin was in Kigali.  If my memory serves me right, he left Kigali on the last French plane on the 11th of April, I believe.  
Q.	And Mr. Robardey, was he there on the 6th of April?  
A.	Colonel Robardey left Rwanda a few months beforehand when France withdrew part of its forces to only leave in Rwanda the technical assistance, as compared to those who were there on the 1st of October of 1990.  
Q.	You do not have any footnotes indicating where you get a good deal of your material from in your report, but I'm in particular interested in the numbers for the gendarmerie.  Who provided you with the numbers that you say were in the gendarmerie in Kigali during the period of the genocide?  
A.	Could you be so kind as to give me the page of my report dealing with this matter?  

Page 56 of my report.  We are there.  
Q.	Yes, and you'll note, in terms of the numbers during the genocide on -- which you referred to on page 57, there's no -- no footnote.  So where did you obtain those numbers from, Mr. Lugan?  
A.	Well, the numbers come from the reports on the manning of the gendarmerie, which were communicated to me by General Robardey for the previous period.  And the figures -- or, the numbers that were the official numbers of the Rwandan armed forces, which I did not mention, but since I quote them in other reports and in other books -- do you wish for us to engage into a polemic to know whether there are more -- there are 100 or more gendarmes, or less?  
Q.	No, Mr. Lugan, I'm not concerned at all about the numbers in the gendarmes prior to April 1994, but you are quoting, on page 57 of your report, things about the gendarmerie capability.  And you don't provide any source for that information, do you?  
A.	On page 58 I say the following thing, and I quote:  "In total the gendarmerie in Kigali, all services included, had a maximum number of 1,200 to 1,500 people."  So those are the results I arrived at when I added the different positions.  In this type of report, I was not going to provide you with the numbers for each brigade.  This is what I do if I am requested to conduct a military study.  I gave -- I don't think it would have led us anywhere to provide specific details on the numbers of soldiers in each brigade.  Is it useful, yes or no -- can we agree on the fact that there were between 1,200 and 1,500 soldiers in the gendarmerie?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And when you used that number, where did you get it from?  That's the point.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, indeed, from the tables on the manning strength of the Rwandan armed forces which I had at my disposal, since I have been commissioned in the trials of General Bizimungu as well as Mr. Sagahutu.  So I can imagine that I have all the documents at my disposal.  I have the postings of the officers.  For the Renzaho report I was not going to go into extensive quotations regarding the gendarmerie.  The expert is supposed to carry out a specific task, which is to provide a summary of the situation.  I'm not writing a detailed report for the gendarmerie.  And this is why I have an approximate figure of around 1,200 to around 1,500, because figures vary according to estimates.  The UNAMIR figures are different for the Rwandan armed forces, and in order to be more flexible, I spoke about 1,200 to 1,500 to give an order of the number of people.  And I might be mistaken, there might be a variation of 100 soldiers or so, plus or minus.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Now, let us remember speed and brevity.  

Here comes the next question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	In the trial of Colonel Bagosora and others, you had provided a questionnaire for Colonel Bagosora to prepare.  Did you do the same in respect of the Accused in this trial?  
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution, and I wish to make the same observation as I made earlier on.  I'm quite frustrated to have had to write a report without having had cognisance beforehand of the examination and cross-examination.  The only document from Préfet Renzaho is this document from which I took a quotation referring to the two magistrates, because it appeared to me to be quite telling and to describe the state in which the judicial system in Rwanda was.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let us repeat that the spelling of Robardey is R-O-B-A-R-D-E-Y.  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Now, in terms of your sources, Mr. Lugan, do they include some of those persons at the UN detention facility here in Arusha?  
A.	I must mention a book by Ferdinand Nahimana which dates back to 1998.  I don't know whether I mentioned it in this report or another.  Off the cuff, no, unless I'm mistaken.  
Q.	Have you spoken in person to some of the Accused at the UN detention facility to gather information?  
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I simply requested from the President the authorisation to meet with Colonel Bagosora after the trial, and I met Mr. Nahimana in the corridors.  He was one of my colleagues and one of my students, then he was my dean.  And we shook hands.  And I didn't even know Colonel Renzaho.  Earlier on I asked a policeman who was here, who was that gentleman there?  I didn't even know he was Mr. Renzaho.  So, no, I don't know him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We were so good at speed half an hour ago.  Let's continue with this peaceful way of answering.  Shall we do that?  Here comes the question.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	What documentary material did the Defence for Renzaho provide to you to assist you in preparing your report?  
A.	Well, Mr. -- Counsel for the Prosecution, we are now dealing with extensive matters, and I must say that my memory is not as extensive.  
Q.	I'll rephrase it to try and assist you.  Were you provided with copies of all exhibits tendered in this trial?  
A.	Since I don't have a comprehensive view of the situation, I cannot answer you either in the affirmative or in the negative.  The representatives of the registry should give me the list of exhibits, and then I can put a mark on -- in front of those I received.  But I believe this would -- that the patience of the Trial Chamber would be wearing thin.  I told you that I did not get the cross-examination transcripts, as well as the testimonies, and this is regrettable, because apparently there were very interesting testimonies last week.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Did you receive many exhibits?  Yes or no.  
THE WITNESS: 
I received adequate documentation, yes.  I received documentation.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Well, for example, how many radio interviews of the Accused did you receive?  
A.	It was one of the most painful aspects to deal with, because there were so many.  I have here a few pages.  I had large quantities of them, which enabled me, by the way, to make progress in my work.  I have them here; I can show them to you if you so wish.  
Q.	Were you provided copies of, presumably, the open trial session of all Prosecution and Defence witnesses?  Do you know, or not?  
A.	I was given a number of documents, but since I'm not involved in the cases, I cannot know whether I received all the documents or not.  In my humble capacity as a university professor, I'm not in a position to answer your question.  
Q.	All right.  And in the course of your research, have you read the interviews with the prime minister, Mr. Kambanda?  All of them?  
A.	So, a comprehensive view?  No, I don't think so.  Perhaps -- I don't know.  As far as this case is concerned, I don't know.  How can I answer your question?  In order for me to be able to answer -- in the vast information available to me in CD-ROM form or as hard copy, if I were to answer yes or no, I would not be speaking the truth, as I stated when I took the oath.  The truth of the matter is that I don't know.  
Q.	All right.  And I don't want to spend long on this issue, Mr. Lugan, but you will agree with me that in your report in the Ndindabahizi trial, you concluded in respect of the genocide that:  

"During the hours after the death of President Habyarimana, the massacres started in Rwanda according to a plan which was well prepared, aimed at physically eliminating Hutu senior officials of the opposition who did not support the Hutu Power.  The genocide of the Tutsis took place at the same time."  

That was your conclusion in 2003, wasn't it?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I truly wonder whether you have really read my report.  Because what do I say on page 2 of my report as a caveat and underscored?  I referred to the Ndindabahizi case.  I am sorry to have to repeat what I have already said on so many occasions, and I quote:  

"It is imperative" -- "It is imperative from the methodological and ethical point of view for an historian to revise his analysis, his interpretations, and conclusions if new elements are made available to him.  Thus, since my expert report before the ICTR in 2003 in the Ndindabahizi case..." and so on and so forth "new sources have led me to reconsider some of my previous positions, and this sometimes in a radical manner."  

So we should not place ourselves on the same field as your learned friend.  We lost three-quarters of an hour to come to the same conclusion.  I have said that because of new sources, my opinion has changed.  So let us refer to my present conclusions.  
Q.	No, I don't want to spend 45 minutes on it, Mr. Lugan.  And, yes, I had read your retraction.  I just wanted to confirm that, up until 2003, you had published both expert reports and books which came to the conclusion, and your published opinion, that the genocide was planned, well prepared.  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, you are making one first mistake that I'm going to correct.  It is not a number of expert reports, but one expert report.  Because in my second expert report concerning Colonel Bagosora, I had already reviewed my position.  What happened -- in fact, the question is how come you had such a radical turnover?  That is your question, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	No, it's not -- no, it's not my question, Mr. Lugan.  All I was wanting you to confirm is that that was the situation up until 2003.  
A.	The situation for whom?  Where?  Which situation?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
This is not dramatic.  All the Prosecutor wants on record -- and it actually more or less follows from your preface to your report -- is that you have changed or developed your view, we can use those words, since 2002 to 3, and previously you were of the view that the genocide was planned.  Isn't that simply the situation?  
THE WITNESS: 
Quite clearly, but I say so in such simple words that I'm wondering why questions are put to me on the matter, since I stated so.  And I even have references that are obsolete.  

I would have been interested, on the other hand, to have started with a discussion with you, Counsel for the Prosecution, on the reasons that brought about such a change.  That would be interesting.  Because then we would be involved in the scientific discussion, and you're not dealing with that aspect at all.  You're refusing it, just as your colleagues.  You're not dealing with me with the fundamental scientific aspect of things.  Let us deal with it.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Can we take it, therefore, Mr. Lugan, that your position might change again in another four years on the basis of new information received, and you may return to your original position that the genocide was planned?  That's possible?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, as I stated here before, my position evolved since my report was submitted because we have more and more evidence which tends to confirm that the genocide was not planned.  So my thought process is evolving, ever evolving.  So if tomorrow -- let us be clear, Counsel for the Prosecution.  If, in the future, we have a scientific debate and you are able to demonstrate that the genocide was planned, that you're able to demonstrate that the definition of the enemy is part of it, that you demonstrate that there were such things as death squadrons, you show that the Jean Pierre case is not a fabrication, and so on and so forth, if you're able to demonstrate all this, and if you can demonstrate that the so-called Hutu extremists killed President Habyarimana, then, Counsel for the Prosecution, you will have before you a very respectful scientist who will have to bow to what you have been able to demonstrate.  But that is not the case.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honour, I'm about to move on to a new matter.  I'm halfway through my -- if not more than halfway through my cross-examination.  So if that gives you some indication.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  Thank you.  There is one minute left until the lunch break.  

Has Witness TOA arrived?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, as far as I know, right now, no.  On the basis of the information provided to us by the section, he should arrive in the evening.  And I do not know at precisely what time, but we will require sufficient time to meet with the witness.  We shall keep you informed and convey the information to you as soon as it's available.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just wanted to make clear that there is no other witness after the end of your cross-examination of the expert this afternoon.  

So then we know how this day will develop, and we will resume at 3 o'clock.  
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1502H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Moses?  

MR. MOSES: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Lugan, in the course of your evidence-in-chief, you referred in passing to Professor Reyntjens as -- in positive terms.  And I believe you've referred to Professor Reyntjens also in your report, you've quoted from some of his work.  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And without going in any more detail, whilst you may not agree with every conclusion that he has made, he's someone that you have a professional respect for.  
A.	Even friendship for him.  We were together at the national university of Rwanda, and I have respect for him, so -- which does not mean I accept all his conclusions -- quite the contrary.  We are in fact very much in disagreement on fundamental points.  
Q.	Now, in the course of your testimony in the -- the Bagosora trial, you had said in -- in the course of your testimony that you had been following the trials here in Arusha, and it involved hours and hours of reading.  Is that a fair summary of something you said?  
A.	As I recall, yes -- from my memory I would say yes. 
Q.	And did that reading of evidence include reading the evidence of Professor Reyntjens in the Rutaganda trial?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Do you know who Mr. Rutaganda was, what position he held?  
A.	I did not look into the matter of Mr. Rutaganda.  I worked on testimonies that dealt with the main things that interested me, the military for -- inter alia -- in particular.  But I would not be capable at all of speaking in detail of Mr. Rutaganda.  I just didn't look into it.  
Q.	Has your research involved consideration of the role of the Interahamwe in the conducting and carrying out of the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda?  
A.	It is only very tardily that I looked into the matter of the Interahamwe, and I must say and only secondarily, to the extent that what I know about the Interahamwe essentially is -- comes from the interviews from Jean Hatzfeld undertook -- we discussed that this morning, I don't need to repeat his name.  And also what interested me in respect of the matter of the Interahamwe was the problem there is to know in how the organisation was created and how the organisation could take upon itself the role that it played.  And the important aspect that concerned me was the very controversial aspect as to possibilities of infiltration among the Interahamwe.  But I must say I did not undertake any investigation directly, or research directly into the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Are you in agreement with the proposition that the militia were involved in the killings of the Tutsi in Rwanda, and in particular in Kigali?  
A.	As to the -- the overall principle, yes.  But killers came from everywhere -- militias, army deserters, et cetera.  But, in detail, no, because I didn't work on it.  
Q.	As you have expressed an interest to -- that the process is a learning process, and your knowledge has developed and continues to develop, to perhaps assist you in that, I'd ask that the -- there's a transcript from the Rutaganda trial of Professor Reyntjens be placed before you.  And I'll read a quote from that.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, there's the English followed by the French.  On the English, unfortunately under the old transcripts they're not -- the pages don't seem to be numbered, though there are lines.  I'm looking on the third page of the English, and commencing with a question two lines from the bottom.  There was a question put by Judge Pillay to Professor Reyntjens.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	And in the French, Mr. Lugan -- it is numbered in the French, it's on page 146.  About two thirds of the way down there is a question from Judge Pillay.  And there was a discussion with Mr. -- Professor Reyntjens about the Interahamwe.  And Judge Pillay had asked Professor Reyntjens, "What about your assessment of direction by the leadership?  Did that reach this wider group?"  What I'm interested in, in particular, Professor Reyntjens -- sorry, Mr. Lugan, is a little bit further after -- two or three sentences down there in the reply.  This is what Professor Reyntjens says:  

"One of the people who was clearly involved in -- I suppose I should say in killings -- was in contact with people like Colonel Bagosora and Colonel Renzaho, who was then préfet of Kigali.  There is absolutely no doubt that Renzaho was in touch with the Interahamwe.  He had been using the Interahamwe before, for instance, just to give you one example, to try and destabilise the MDR congress, end of July 1 -- end of July; I mentioned earlier this morning.  So, in other words, who was running the show becomes increasingly blurred.  It may well be that it was Renzaho.  It was maybe Bagosora.  This is sheer hypothesis; I don't know.  But it may well be Bagosora giving an order to Renzaho, who would then relay that to the Interahamwe, you see.  So, the command structure became, I would say, more blurred."  

Were -- now, Professor, were you aware of -- that that was an opinion held by your colleague, Professor Reyntjens, regarding the role of this Accused, or not?  Is this the first time you have been made aware of it?  
A.	This is a very interesting question, Mr. Prosecutor -- very interesting, because the trial was held in 1997.  So we're right at the beginning.  It is -- that is the correct date, 13th of October 1997.  So we are at the beginning of the Tribunal's labours.  We're in a very particular historical phase.  It's a phase of construction -- edification, I would say, of the Prosecution, of the official history of the genocide.  And Professor Reyntjens shows considerable caution.  I think it is difficult to draw an argument from this document to put a haphazard theory, as pointed out by Professor Reyntjens, that cannot be taken for certainty.  Were I to make a critical reading of this, in the French sense, it would seem that it is a hypothesis.  He says it is well known but does not support that.  So we are here dealing with an opinion that does not, I think, allow for concrete development.  

On the other hand, you won't -- it will not have escaped you, Mr. Prosecutor, that Filip Reyntjens also has profoundly evolved in many spheres.  The Filip Reyntjens of '97 -- '95 -- 1995 (sic) is not the Filip Reyntjens of today.  And when we read his books, his writing, it is evident that he is evolving.  It should be interesting to ask him what he has to say about it today after his studies and the development in the meantime.  I, as an historian, would not found an argument on the basis of what is theoretical.  I cannot say more than that, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer, Mr. Lugan, but just very briefly if you could answer my -- do I take it from your answer that you haven't discussed the role of this Accused with Mr. Reyntjens, in particular, his role in relationship with the Interahamwe?  Yes or no.  
A.	No, what interested me in Rutaganda was the motion raised by his lawyers in respect of the extension of the ICTR's jurisdiction. 
Q.	All right.  Now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You meant that the Filip Reyntjens of '97 is not the Filip Reyntjens of today; wasn't that what you said?  I just want to get the year correctly.  
THE WITNESS: 
Oui, oui.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And just help me with that clarification; no additions.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President, 1997.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And even though we had the author earlier today, can you give us Jean's last name once more, with spelling, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
You mean Reyntjens, Mr. President --Hatzfeld, sorry, sorry.  Jean Hatzfeld:  H-A-T-Z -- Hatzfeld -- F-E-L-D.  H-A-T-Z-F-E-L-D.  Hatzfeld.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Lugan, have you read what the former prime minister, Mr. Kambanda, had to say about civil defence, and in particular that civil defence was, in effect, another word for killings.  Were you aware that he'd said that?  
A.	I am aware.  I am also aware of he -- that that person retracted, and I know very well under the conditions which he said some things in the judicial process of which we know before this Tribunal.  But what would interest me -- what interests me is that he casts doubt on what he had written under -- and stated under particular conditions.  
Q.	So you weren't aware in the Military I trial when he testified that he was not retracting what he said, but he was concerned about the -- as you say, the circumstances of his sentencing?  He didn't retract; he indicated that he was not retracting what he'd said earlier.  
A.	Was that a question?  
Q.	Were you -- have you read his testimony in the Military I trial?  
A.	Yes, because I took part in that trial, so I don't agree with your interpretation.  He changed his mind about what he'd said, but he wasn't given the chance to explain himself.  So he was not exhaustive.  He had to be elliptical.  
Q.	All right.  Would you agree with me, Mr. Lugan, that one of the problems that arose at roadblocks where -- and even throughout Kigali during the period of the genocide -- was that civilians thought they could be judge, jury, and executioner in respect of those they considered to be accomplices of the enemy?  
A.	I'm very sorry, but I did not fully grasp your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	I'll rephrase it.  I may have used a particular expression which may not have translated very well.  

Would you agree with me that one of the -- one of the problems during the period of the genocide was that civilians were taking the law into their own hands and killing innocent Tutsi civilians without there being any trial for those who -- who were killed?  
A.	I fully agree with you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	At the end of your report, on the last page, page 64 in the French, and page 17 of the English, you refer to the Accused Renzaho's statement on Radio Rwanda on the 24th of April.  And the -- the translation I have, Mr. Lugan, is that you say:  "In which he appealed for resistance and asked that deserters be -- deserters be disarmed and punished".  Is that what you have written?  Is that a fair translation of what you have in your report?  It's on the third -- oh.  
A.	Yes.  I don't have the document before me, at least the original, but if my memory serves me right, and unless I am mistaken or forgotten, I was translating Préfet Renzaho's thoughts as they appeared to me from the Radio Rwanda transcript, the transcript of the Radio Rwanda broadcast.  And here I am launching into a debate with Alison Des Forges.  I'm debating the point with Alison Des Forges.  
Q.	Yes.  And do you recall, in that speech that was recorded -- or, that there is -- that you have referred to, that the Accused was addressing a meeting of the youth of the parties that formed the present government?  Do you remember that was the context?  
A.	I don't remember that specifically, but thank you for reminding me, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And do you remember that in fact it is recorded that the Accused encouraged the youth to arrest all the deserting soldiers, to disarm them, and kill them?  
A.	Yes, I speak of that.  Punish, disarm.  Are you asking me to explain, or merely say yes or no?  
Q.	I'll -- at the moment just yes or no.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	All right.  So where you have recorded "punish", that was your encapsulation of the word "kill", where the Accused used the word "kill them".  
A.	Deserters, in any army in the world, in any country in the world, when you're in a state of war and you have deserters, not only soldiers who've deserted and therefore failed in their duty, but those deserters loot, are in fact allies of the enemy, martial law is applicable, and martial law is death.  In the context of traditional judicial proceedings, we know of such examples throughout the world.  The problem -- Mr. Prosecutor, the problem is that in the instance, there were no military courts because there was no more organisation; there was nothing.  So what -- what can you do with deserters who -- who loot, who rape women, who pillage?  What, do you want to sing them a serenade?  
Q.	I think you answered -- my next question was that you referred to what martial law happened in democracies, and you'll agree with me that in democracies military courts will try those who are accused of desertion; is that correct?  
A.	Do you want an example, Mr. Prosecutor?  I can -- 
Q.	No.  Do you agree with me, in principle, that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We don't hear you; can you repeat your question, please?  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	You'll agree that in democracies that you have referred to in your report, they don't hand over the decision as to who is a deserter and who deserves to die to a bunch of young people.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, let us not enter this debate that would be interminable.  I will give you an example, because when a country that -- where there are -- there was a martial law structure that existed in 1917.  In the French army there was desertion or mutiny.  Hundreds of mutineers were shot, with at least an appearance of justice.  They weren't, of course, handed over, they were killed.  But they were killed.  

In Rwanda we face a problem where you can't speak of legality at all.  There are abominable massacres, genocide, people are tortured.  And among those who committed those abominable acts, you have armed people who were the deserters.  You couldn't imprison them, there were no more prisons.  There are measures that are well beyond us, we are comfortably seated here.  But let us remember the context of war.  And I'll stop there; it's pointless going any further.
(Pages 39 to 50 by Kirstin McLean)






1530H
MR. PRESIDENT:
The present exchange is a bit unfocussed.  Let us try to increase our efficiency.  
MR. MOSES: 
Yes.  
BY MR. MOSES:
Q.	Mr. Lugan, these very same youth of the political parties who the Accused is telling on the radio that they can be judge and executioner for -- without trial, are the same people, aren't they, who are being judge and executioner in respect of the Tutsi civilians? 
A.	We are at the very heart of the genocide reality. 
Q.	And bearing in mind what happened at the roadblocks in Kigali from the 7th of April 1994, do you still find it was a strange interpretation from Dr. Des Forges to call that a call to violence? 
A.	To combat violence, there are not many other means other than violence in a society where violence is at the service of law.  In a case -- a nightmarish situation like Rwanda, the law had disappeared.  But I come back to my present earlier notion.  I am not denying the massacres, the genocide, the killing.  What I deny is the planning.  It is obvious that I am not denying what happened at the roadblocks, because I have read Jean Hatzfeld.  I have read all his books.  No, don't take me down that road where I cannot go.  I don't agree with you.  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, I have no further questions of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Any re-examination?  
MR. CANTIER: 
I thank you, Mr. President; there is no re-examination.  

If you allow me, Mr. President, I made an omission a moment ago when you asked me about the exhibits.  So in addition to the report, I would like to tender the map, the map that Professor Lugan gave us this morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Sorry, a copy, but not my map, I need it for my research.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Professor, if you promise that we will not have to pay copyright, I think we will do it.  
THE WITNESS:
It's my working document.  

MR. CANTIER:
Yes, we will see to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is something the Defence and the expert witness can discuss.  Usually it's possible to make photocopies with colours under certain technical conditions or to draw an alternative drawing.  And if that is being done, then a request can be made at a later stage.  But we note that the witness doesn't want to lose his original until that has been done.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
 Professor, you left Rwanda in 1983?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
So the sources that you used to get information for your publications were all based outside Rwanda?  
THE WITNESS:
Not quite, because those sources are entirely involved in Rwanda.  For instance, when I work on a document of the French gendarmerie, which are documents which are reports that were drawn up at the request of the Rwandan authorities, these are documents that were prepared in Rwanda before 1994.  The sources on which one can work are also Rwandan sources.  

I am not into journalism.  I am not following current events to describe things that are happening, like a journalist.  The historian, by definition, cannot be in the historic event.  If I have to give you a description of the Battle of Waterloo, will you reproach me for not participating in the battle?  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  So we will go to the next question now.  From your own evidence, it is clear that you did a lot of research before you published your books and the report that you wrote.  Am I right in that assumption?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  I have published a lot.  In my CV I have not given the entire list of my publications but I have published a lot in scientific journals. I did not cite all of them, because that would have expended judicial time.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
So how do you explain that after writing books that are published and making reports, you come back two or three years later to retract them after you had done a lot of research before publishing?  
THE WITNESS:
Well, that is precisely the question I was expecting from the beginning of this examination, and at last we are getting into the scientific domain.  Why have I changed my opinion?  I changed my opinion -- and thank you, Your Honour, for giving me the opportunity at last to enter into that debate. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
(Microphones overlapping)...I want you to give me a reason why you changed, not a debate.  
THE WITNESS:
Because new sources came to my attention.  If I don't visit new sources, then I can't write a new document.  Briefly, it is because new elements appeared in the issue. 
JUDGE ARREY: 
So my next question is, what is the guarantee that what you have told us today won't have new elements that will change the opinion of what you have given us in court today; this report that you have presented?  What is the guarantee?  
THE WITNESS:
None, none at all.  If tomorrow, Madam Des Forges or the Prosecution actually demonstrate that I was wrong, then I will be the first to say I was wrong.  I am a scientist; I am not dogmatic.  History is written here before the ICTR.  
JUDGE ARREY: 
Thank you.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, did I understand you correctly that in 1990 some Tutsi soldiers deserted Uganda -- from the Ugandan army?  
THE WITNESS:
Honourable Judge, I use the word "deserted", but that term can be discussed.  I am not going to get into a debate to waste the Court -- the Chamber's time, but there is a fundamental discussion.  Did they desert or not?  Because if they really deserted, then you cannot say these are deserters.  But if it was a sham desertion -- I mean, we are in the context of an international context, so I perfectly understand your question.  So I can't answer; special investigations have to be conducted.  According to some major opinions -- I don't have an opinion; when I am not sure about something, I don't say it.  So I cite opinions.  For convenience I use "deserter" but the use of that term can be debated.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Are you in a position to provide us with the sources where you obtained this evidence, information, from?  Some publications or books where this particular issue is being discussed in more detail?  Just an indication.  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, that is right.  There is a reference behind which I take cover.  And I shield behind Prunier and Ruzibiza.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Is that your only source?  
THE WITNESS:
We have sources that are difficult to interpret:  French military sources, French military intelligence sources.  I don't want to go down that road.  I know them very well.  To put it clearly -- to put it clearly, French sources speak of an aggression from Uganda.  And I don't know from what level of reliability those sources should be treated with.  That is why I mentioned it.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
Do you have any idea of the legal position of those people who were armed, who carried weapons and crossed the Rwandan border in 1990?  I am interested, in particular, about their citizenship.  
THE WITNESS:
Those who were members of constituted units of the Ugandan army were, by definition, Ugandan citizens or held Ugandan passports.  But I have not studied the internal workings of the Ugandan army, but it would be strange indeed if general staff officers of the Ugandan army of Tutsi origin did not have a legal status or at least double nationality.  I have not seen General Kagame's passport or those of the officers that were with him, but you have senior officers of the Ugandan army, you have officers and rank and file.  By definition, if they are members of an army it means that, legally speaking, they are members of that country.  I cannot go beyond that.  But it's interesting because it's a source of debate.  It's something that could be explored further, and I think Prunier is working on that.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
You mentioned that the military conflict in Rwanda was at the same time an international military conflict and an internal or non-international military conflict.  Do you think -- or do you mean that this conflict was of that nature throughout the whole period of military activity -- struggle, that is, from October 1990 to July 1994 or there were some stages?  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Precisely.  My answer is going to be very clear and concise: Yes.  I'll give you two examples, one at the beginning and one at the end.  The offensive of 1 October 1990 undoubtedly from Uganda or with Ugandan equipment -- the assassination of President Habyarimana with equipment from the Ugandan army stock, and we have come full cycle.  
JUDGE EGOROV:
So, should I take it that both Geneva Conventions -- not both -- Geneva Conventions and both additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions may be applied to this particular military conflict at the same time?  
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, I am incapable of answering you on that.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have your report in front of you, haven't you?  Can you look at page 51 of the French version, please, the original version?  

On the middle of the page, the fourth paragraph, there is a reference to the interim government, and what is stated there is:  "In fact, the interim government was unable to restore law and order, despite two speeches broadcast on 10th April, one by Augustin Bizimana, minister of defence, and the second by Prime Minister Kambanda; however, they were clear, calling for an end to violence, massacres and the need for the unity of all Rwandans for compliance with the Arusha Accords and punishment of criminals."  So, is it your view that these two persons, on the 10th of April, representing the government, tried to avoid violence?  
THE WITNESS:
If we base ourselves exclusively on the facts, I cannot place myself in the minds of these senior personalities.  We observed that, effectively, all their statements are -- tend to make peace.  And all the statements also appeal to the Arusha Accords -- as if these personalities wanted by all means to persuade the other side and international powers and to convince them of their good faith.  I know very well -- I know the debate on interpretation and double language, but the facts are there, and the texts are clear; the rest is an interpretation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As we all know, Prime Minister Kambanda pleaded guilty to genocide.  Would that play a role in your interpretation of his speech on the 10th?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, don't take what I am going to say badly.  I am deeply mistrustful of the procedure of pleading guilty because it is so strange to my own legal philosophy, where it is called kicking out of touch in football -- in rugby.  I am sorry to say this, but pressure was brought to bear on the accused.  So, we see it to avoid (unintelligible) certainties of the procedure, and then it is everybody for himself, so I don't see how that that improves the situation, of course.  I respect every person's legal choice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have indicated that there can be no doubt that there was a genocide between April and July '94.  But, in your view, were any government representatives involved in that process or was the genocide simply a result of private groups going amok?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, all what I can say is that in the present state of my knowledge, nothing permits me to say that the genocide was planned.  But it does not say -- it does mean that it didn't take place.  I cannot go beyond that.  That is another topic.  I have not carried out specific research on that topic.  But I discover a number of aspects right now, depending on the requests that are made to me by Defence teams.  For instance, I went into the MDR affair for the Bicamumpaka defence and that has made me progress and in a number of years I will make a summary.  But, for now, as far as I am concerned, I have the scientific conviction that the genocide was not planned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not so interested in the planning.  That was not behind the question I just asked.  I am thinking of the role of the various actors between the 7th of April and July 1994.  

Now, your present research, does that enable you to draw any conclusion as to whether governmental authorities were involved in the genocide?  
THE WITNESS:
I have not researched into that specific issue, neither have I researched into the Butare region.  So, if you will, I have a solid approach on the period between 1990 and about end of April with regard to the fighting; but I depend entirely on sources and that is the area that is known to me.  And I humbly admit that I can't know everything.  So I am open to any new interpretation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just to allow clear communication, I interpret your answer to mean that you cannot form a clear opinion as to whether persons representing governmental authorities participated in the genocide.  
THE WITNESS:
Now I understand your question better, Mr. President.  Let us be clear on this, and I am going to say this clearly.  To me, the genocide was not planned.  It happened, and it was obvious that it had to happen.  

I have not worked from the period of the beginning of genocide, you know, covering all the provinces of Rwanda.  I mentioned the Butare affair because it is being discussed a lot at this time, but I rely on the work of my colleague Guichaoua who has worked on it.  I have worked more on the military aspect and the political parties, but I didn't work on that issue.  So my answer to you would be unsatisfactory.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is your answer:  Yes, no, or I have to rely on other research sources, I haven't formed a proper opinion myself?  
THE WITNESS:
To say I don't have any opinion may be going too far.  For instance, there is a study on Butare with the Guichaoua report.  And Guichaoua uses an interesting term.  He speaks of the lack of preparation in Butare.  It means that Guichaoua, who conducted almost all his research in -- on Butare préfecture, was in no position to say whether there was premeditation in Butare or not.  So I cannot go beyond that.  Maybe I will be commissioned to do a study on Butare, then I'll work on it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Now, the word "governmental" can be ambiguous.  Let me now move a bit forward and ask you:  Were authorities involved, not necessarily authorities representing the government proper, with other words, the government as cabinet, but government in the sense of at préfectoral level?  Were such entities involved in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994?  
THE WITNESS:
The only detailed example is Guichaoua's research on Butare.  I am coming back to it.  If you read Guichaoua, it is clear that some elements of the hierarchy still to be defined intervened.  It is Guichaoua who is saying it, but I trust him.  I have not researched on that issue and, by definition, I trust other colleagues, even when I have not verified what they say.  

But, Mr. President, don't ask me to go beyond this.  I was commissioned to talk on the Renzaho affair in Kigali, and I don't know what may have happened in Cyangugu in any detail -- or, in Butare.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but you are an expert on Rwanda.  
THE WITNESS:
But the expert on Rwandan affairs humbly confesses that if he knows everything, then he will be fake.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it play a role in your considerations that there are quite a few judgements finding representatives at the bourgmestre level or préfectoral level guilty of genocide?  So far you haven't referred to that.  Does that play a role in your reflection process?  

You see, that's my query.  Isn't this of relevance when you are to answer the question whether authorities may have played a role?  So far you have just said that you haven't done research on it.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can tell you that I worked on the Kigali affair for which I was commissioned, and as far as that affair is concerned, I answer in the affirmative.  Préfet Renzaho is not a suspect in that kind of charge.  I have not studied the other secteurs or other regions of the country.  I have never conducted research on those issues.  And, of course, the enlightenment that I am supposed to give as a specialist on Rwanda is based on the work of other colleagues that have carried out pinpoint research on the issues, as I have done on the military issue.  

That is it, Mr. President.  I don't have universal knowledge, but I know the judgements that have been delivered by the Tribunal.  I know that there have been substantive decisions that have convicted this or that person, but I have not delved into the judgements handed down in a manner that I can discuss them with you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And my questions were of a general nature, not any particular préfecture.  

Now, that was the end of your examination.  We would like to thank you for having come to Arusha again to testify, and wish you a very safe journey home.  Thank you very much indeed.  

Yes?  

THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Can I make a request to you, please, if that is possible?  I would like to have a conversation for a few minutes with Préfet Renzaho, if possible here because I may not have time to visit him in prison?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will be arranged by the witness protection unit.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would the registry kindly accompany Mr. Lugan?  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Prosecution counsel. 
(Witness excused)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned that Witness TOA would probably arrive in the evening and said that you would have need for some time in order to meet with him before the testimony.  That's what we heard earlier today.  
MR. CANTIER: 
Yes, Mr. President, he is supposed to arrive late this evening.  I have not received confirmation of his arrival.  I think it would be wise to programme him for Thursday morning.  That is not a witness who would take too much of our time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it be possible to start tomorrow afternoon, and should he not arrive this evening, then you could simply send out a mail informing us that it is impossible to start in the afternoon, and as a subsidiary solution, we will then start Thursday morning?  But could it be our goal to start in the afternoon on Wednesday?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we will keep you informed, because we have had a lot of ups and downs with delays in planes and all that, but we will keep you informed.  We will face all kinds of situations.  But, for now, I can't tell you more, but we note the desire of the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any view on this, Prosecution?  
MR. MOSES: 
Your Honours, informal discussions -- and they were just that and no one can be held to them -- was that the evidence in chief would take approximately one hour.  I can indicate that the cross-examination would take half an hour on the questions I have prepared.  It -- I am not wanting to bind my learned friends to being one hour, I must say that because it may -- I know how these things can develop. Clearly, it would be my preference for the matter to be dealt with, if it can be, tomorrow afternoon.  
The only other issue, which I am not asking necessarily to be dealt with now, Your Honours, but at some point, we need to look at some sort of scheduling.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course.  It would be the Chamber's preference to start tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, provided that the witness arrives tonight.  If the witness does not provide -- arrive tonight, then we will receive a notification from Defence telling us that he hasn't arrived, and then we will have to postpone him to Thursday morning.  Will that be all right with you, Maître Cantier?  
MR. CANTIER: 
Mr. President, we will know tonight.  So if he does, we will commence tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 p.m.  And if he doesn't arrive tonight, I will advise the Chamber thereof.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for agreeing with that procedure.  We understand that that doesn't cause any problems.  And if we do not hear anything, we will then meet here in this courtroom, 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.  And once we have heard the witness in this examination by both parties, we will have a brief status conference to discuss the scheduling of the written closing arguments and the oral hearing.  

The Court is then adjourned until tomorrow afternoon.
(Court adjourned at 1608H)
