 25   THE PRESIDING JUDGE [In translation]:  So we are going to resume our 

  1   hearing.  First, I would like to make sure that everything is working, 
  2   that you can hear the interpretation.  Everyone can hear me?  The 
  3   prosecuting counsel, the people in the visitors' gallery?  I would 
  4   like to hope that the interpreters have recovered from all the strain 
  5   deployed yesterday, and we are going to try to catch up the time we 
  6   lost yesterday.  The Judges will be doing everything they can to see 
  7   that we move ahead briskly.  I suggest that we leave it like that and 
  8   move right on to the substance of the matter.  We are going to hear, 
  9   prosecuting counsel, I am quite confident, our witness Professor Garde 
 10   this morning.
 11   MR. BOWERS:  That is correct, your Honour.  We would like to resume with 
 12   Professor Garde.
 13   		       PROFESSOR GARDE, recalled.
 14   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, Professor.  You are in tip-top shape, I 
 15   trust?  Great.  So the prosecuting counsel is going to go on putting 
 16   questions to you.  You have the floor, prosecuting counsel.
 17   		            Examined by MR. BOWERS
 18   MR. BOWERS:  Good morning, Professor Garde.
 19   THE WITNESS [In translation]:  Good morning.
 20   Q.   Yesterday we ended with your description of the rise of nationalism 
 21   in the 1980s and a brief review of how the media reacted to that and 
 22   influenced that.  We would like to continue the chronology today.  If 
 23   you could pick up with where you left off and begin describing some of 
 24   the events in the late 1980s and early 1990s that led up to the actual 
 25   dissolution of the former Yugoslavia. 

  1   A.   Well, as far as the events in Serbia go, in the regions inhabited by 
  2   Serbs, at the same time, that is, the second half of the 1980s, there 
  3   was also the waning of communism in the north west Republics, and as 
  4   of '86 little by little there was the appearance, it was 
  5   anti-constitutional, but it was more or less tolerated, that there 
  6   were parties emerging in Slovenia and there was a certain amount of 
  7   democracy in that Republic.
  8   		There was, of course, opposition with what was happening in 
  9   Serbia because the Slovenes gave their backing to the Kosovo Albanians 
 10   who were subjected to attacks from the Serbs.  So, the conflict 
 11   between these two Republics, Slovenia and Serbia, became quite acute, 
 12   and particularly when the Slovenes banned a Serb rally that was to 
 13   take place and the Serbians retaliated with an economic blockade 
 14   against Slovenia, and a bit later the same movement of diversification 
 15   on the political front, the fact that there were opposition parties 
 16   that were tolerated, that also occurred in Croatia. Consequently, 
 17   these two Republics were at odds with Serbia.
 18   		Now, at that point in time, in 1989, there was the fall of 
 19   communism in all the neighbouring countries, that is to say, the 
 20   Berlin Wall came down and communism collapsed in Hungary, Bulgaria, 
 21   etc, Rumania as well at one point or another, and the movement toward 
 22   pluralism becomes a lot stronger, and the Yugoslav Republics could not 
 23   disregard this general movement of liberalization.
 24   		At that point in time there are various events that occurred. 
 25    First, in early 1990 there is the break up of the communist party, 

  1   the Yugoslav Communist League.  The Slovenes and the Croats on the one 
  2   hand and the Serbs on the other had taken opposite stances.  At the 
  3   party meeting in early 90, there  was the dissolution and Slovenia 
  4   left the congress followed by the Croats.  That was it.  That as end 
  5   of the Yugoslav communist party.
  6   		Subsequently, in the course of 1990, there were elections that 
  7   took place first in the north west Republics, Slovenia Croatia, in the 
  8   spring, in March/April 1990; whereas in the other Republics they took 
  9   place in December.
 10   		Now, in March in Slovenia and in Croatia those elections 
 11   brought to power forces that were opposed to communism.  In Croatia, 
 12   in addition to that, the elections were won by a party that was quite 
 13   nationalist, the HDZ of President Tudjman.
 14   		Immediately, this coming to power of the nationalists in 
 15   Croatia aggravated the tensions, because Croatia had a population of 
 16   12 per cent and they had already been affected by the campaigns, 
 17   demonstrations, the threats, etc..  So they had this feeling and to an 
 18   even greater extent was strengthened by propaganda.  So, there was 
 19   matter to feed such a campaign on the Croat side.  One of the slogans 
 20   was that the Serbs had too many important positions in the 
 21   administration; so there was a dismissal of certain civil servants who 
 22   were Serbian which, of course, reinforced their fears and their 
 23   conviction that they were threatened.
 24   		Similarly, there was a new constitution for Croatia that was 
 25   adopted and, unlike the previous constitution which stated that 

  1   Croatia was the state of both the Croat people and the Serbian Croat 
  2   people, the new constitution said that Croatia was the state of the 
  3   Croatian people, and of the other nationalities who lived there such 
  4   as Serbs, Italians, Hungarians, etc. 
  5   		In other words, the Serbs in this new arrangement were moved 
  6   out of the first category into the second category.  So, they are 
  7   second class citizens, as it were, even though the constitution 
  8   granted to them all rights, at least in theory. But, in practice, they 
  9   did not always actually possess those rights.
 10   		Now, propaganda from Belgrade and the propaganda disseminated 
 11   there among the Serbs of Croatia at that time, in particular that 
 12   propaganda, as I already said yesterday, was constantly stressing the 
 13   genocide of 1941, and in people's minds the idea is conveyed that 
 14   genocide is going to happen again, and that this new Croatian 
 15   government is picking up where the Ustasha left off.
 16   		So, as of the summer of 1990, in the Serbian parts of Croatia 
 17   there is some uprising.  It starts off with roadblocks, and Croatian 
 18   policemen were disarmed by Serbian insurgents. Then in the course of 
 19   the following winter and spring, almost outright rebellion, the first 
 20   deaths took place on 31st March 1991 at Plitvice.  The first massacre 
 21   that takes place on 2nd May 1991, that is, of Croatian policemen by 
 22   Serbs, that is, on 2nd May 1991, Borovo Selo, 2nd May 1991, so two 
 23   months practically before Croatia declared independence.
 24   		The conflict was also deteriorating because Serbia had 
 25   embezzled funds that were meant for Croatia.  Then Serbia refused the 

  1   right of the Croatian representative to be elected President.  That 
  2   was on 15th May 1991.  There was the rotating Presidency.  On 15th May 
  3   1991 the previous Serbian President's term came to an end.  Normally, 
  4   it was the Croatian who was the party of the nationalist Croatian 
  5   party who was to succeed him. The representatives of the Serb block 
  6   hindered that election.  So there was no longer a Federal President, 
  7   and the federal institutions were deadlocked.
  8   		During that period the Slovenes and the Croatians were 
  9   preparing their independence.  There were referendums in December 1990 
 10   in Slovenia and then I believe it was in April or May '91, April or 
 11   May 91, in May, in Croatia and people were very much in favour of 
 12   independence.  Those two countries on 25th June 1991 declared their 
 13   independence and that was at that point in time that the federal army 
 14   reacted, and that is when the military phase of the conflict begins, 
 15   that is to say, with the federal army's intervention in Slovenia.  
 16   That lasted just 10 days.
 17   		The federal army's intervention and the war in Croatia lasted 
 18   some six months, and later on in 1992 there would be the military 
 19   intervention in Bosnia which has lasted until quite recently.
 20   Q.   Thank you, Professor Garde.  How did the declarations of independence 
 21   in Slovenia and Croatia affect the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina?
 22   A.   Bosnia and Herzegovina, as we saw, is at the heart of the former 
 23   Yugoslavia, and the people there, besides the Muslim Bosnians, you 
 24   have Serbs and Croats there.  Now, as a result, the setup in 
 25   Yugoslavia suited the people in Bosnia, and survey showed that just 

  1   before the war they were in favour of keeping their Yugoslav 
  2   federation but on the condition that the federation be balanced, that 
  3   is to say, that it included Serbia and Croatia as well.  Bosnia was 
  4   right in the middle and there was this desire of seeing this balance 
  5   maintained, but once the federation no longer included Slovenia and 
  6   Croatia, Bosnia ended up face to face, as it were, with Serbia and was 
  7   on unequal  terms because there was a lot more Serbs and they have a 
  8   lot more power.
  9   		So that solution whereby Bosnia would stay within the new 
 10   Yugoslav federation that was dominated by the Serbs, well, alone 
 11   amongst the people of Bosnia was the Serbs who were in favour of that 
 12   and the Croats.  The Muslims of Bosnia were very much against that.  
 13   So, once the federation fell apart, the majority of the Bosnian 
 14   population, since Muslims and Croats in Bosnia account for two-thirds 
 15   of the population, so the majority of the population of Bosnia wanted 
 16   at that point in time independence to be declared.
 17   		In Bosnia at that time the elections in December 1990 had been 
 18   won by the three nationalist parties, the SDS, Radovan Karadzic, that 
 19   is, the Serbs; SDA of Alija Izetbegovic, that is the Muslim Bosnians 
 20   and then the HDZ, the Croat party.  So the three nationalist parties 
 21   formed a coalition and ruled.  They split up the authority, but that 
 22   coalition did not last very long precisely because the various members 
 23   of that coalition had conflicting interests.
 24   		Two of the parties in question were for the independence of 
 25   Bosnia; whereas as the third party, the SDS, the Serb party, was 

  1   totally opposed to that.  This is why the conflict came about in no 
  2   time at all during the second half of 1991, that is to say, while the 
  3   war was being waged in Croatia, the terrible war, in the course of 
  4   which the Serbs army, the federal army with the help of the Yugoslav 
  5   militia, occupied a third of Croatian territory, drove out the 
  6   Croatians living there and already at the time there was ethnic 
  7   cleansing going on.
  8   		So whilst those events were occurring, Bosnia and  Herzegovina 
  9   remained outside of the conflict and, in principle, it was neutral, 
 10   but President Izetbegovic was careful about that, but the federal army 
 11   occupied the territory and it was used as a real base against Croatia. 
 12    The internal tension was quite considerable; everyone felt that the 
 13   conflict, a conflict was going to break out, and during that second 
 14   half of 1991 that the conflict was being prepared and that the 
 15   instruments were set up with a view to the conflict, with a view to 
 16   ethnic cleansing.
 17   Q.   Professor Garde, how did the Serbian nationalism manifest itself in 
 18   the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina?
 19   A.   Well, in respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina, so at the time the first 
 20   pluralist elections were getting underway, those of December 1990, 
 21   among other parties, there was a nationalist Serb party that was 
 22   established, the SDS, that is, the Serb Democratic Party.  From the 
 23   outset its head was Radovan Karadzic.  Now, this party, unlike the 
 24   party in power in Serbia, was not a communist party.  It was 
 25   anti-communist, in fact, and it was supported by the Orthodox Church 

  1   and the Orthodox Church played an important role in the establishment 
  2   of this party, the SDS.
  3   		So this nationalist party, the SDS, had as its official aims 
  4   to defend the interests of the Serbian people in Bosnia and it got 
  5   involved in the elections and participated in the coalition that won 
  6   the elections, but subsequently it participated in the government and 
  7   in the administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The Presidency of 
  8   the Presidency went to the main Bosnian Muslim leader, Alija 
  9   Izetbegovic.  The Presidency of the Council, that is to say, Prime 
 10   Ministership, went to a Croat and the President of the Assembly went 
 11   to a  member of the SDS, a Serb.
 12   		Radovan Karadzic did not take on an official position, but 
 13   remained leader of the SDS party.  He also acted as President of the 
 14   national Serb Council which is a non-official body, but which was 
 15   supposed to be representing the interests of the Serb people in 
 16   Bosnia.
 17   		At the same time, the Serb party, just like the other 
 18   nationalist parties, made sure that it had power in the opstina, in 
 19   the municipalities, where it had a majority.
 20   MR. BOWERS:  Your Honours, at this time we would like to start referring 
 21   to some of the exhibits that are in your binder.  They have not been 
 22   scanned into the computer, but in your binder there will be the 
 23   Cyrillic version initially.  Then there are French and English 
 24   translations that follow the Cyrillic versions of these exhibits so 
 25   you will be able to follow them in your binders.

  1   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Mr. Bowers, now since you have done with a certain 
  2   area with Professor Garde, we might see if our fellow Judges have any 
  3   questions.  I just have one question.  I am not sure you addressed the 
  4   matter, but it might be useful:  the declaration of independence, did 
  5   that give rise to any reaction on the part of the international 
  6   community, and what do you think the significance of those reactions 
  7   might have been subsequently?
  8   A.   Yes, the declarations of independence as such did not immediately 
  9   give rise to any reactions on the part of the international community, 
 10   but in Slovenia and in Croatia when the conflict broke out that gave 
 11   rise to some reactions, that is to say, there was a war that was being 
 12   waged.  The international community and particularly the European 
 13   Union could not put an  end to it.  In Slovenia, it was easy enough 
 14   precisely because there was no Serb minority in Slovenia, so the Serbs 
 15   did not see much point in conquering Slovenia.  After a few days they 
 16   had no trouble accepting to withdraw.
 17   		In Croatia, things were more difficult because the conflict 
 18   lasted six months.  It was bloody.  It was dreadful. The efforts of 
 19   the European Community to put an end to it were initially in vain, and 
 20   at that point in time some countries, in particular Germany, but other 
 21   countries as well, thought that the best solution would be to 
 22   recognise the independence of Slovenia and Croatia, so that the 
 23   conflict would be officially recognised as an international conflict, 
 24   and that would allow for outside intervention and intervention by the 
 25   United Nations that would be legitimate with the view to ending the 

  1   conflict.
  2   		Other countries in contrast, for example, France and the UK, 
  3   thought that it would be best not to recognise the independence of 
  4   those Republics which would entail recognising the borders.  They 
  5   thought it would be best to wait and to get concessions from those 
  6   Republics in return for recognising that independence.  In particular, 
  7   what they had in mind was concessions from Croatia in respect of its 
  8   borders.
  9   		So there were two opposing ways of viewing the problem.  On 
 10   account of this opposition of views, for six months no decision was 
 11   taken.  During those six months all of the efforts deployed by the 
 12   international community to put an end to the conflict remained in 
 13   vain.  After six months, finally, that is to say, in December of 1991 
 14   the decision was taken to recognise the independence of those 
 15   Republics.
 16   		Now, that decision of a condition of recognition was taken on 
 17   17th December.  The recognition came into effect as of  15th January 
 18   and Germany jumped the gun -- I do not remember the exact date -- but 
 19   they went ahead with recognition on their part earlier.  At all 
 20   events, once the recognition did take place it was immediately after 
 21   that that the fighting in Croatia stopped.  They stopped it on 2nd 
 22   January 1992.
 23   		You asked me for my opinion, your Honour, it is often said 
 24   that recognition was premature, that it was one of the causes of the 
 25   conflict.  I read somewhere that that recognition was the actual cause 

  1   of the war.  I think rather the opposite, that the recognition came 
  2   very late.  It was also on account of that recognition that the 
  3   conflict ended in Croatia.
  4   		When you say that that is the cause of the war, what you have 
  5   to know is that that recognition, that decision in December 1991 was 
  6   taken after some six months of war, rather, there were tens of 
  7   thousands dead in Croatia.  There had already been massacres around 
  8   Vukovar.  There had been dreadful mass murders, mass graves.  The war 
  9   had been lasting for some six months.  So to say that it was the 
 10   recognition that caused the war, it is a bit much because the war had 
 11   already been going on for six months.
 12   		Now, recognition, no doubt, did entail recognition of the 
 13   borders.  It crystallised, as it were, the fact that the federation 
 14   had broken up and, as I said earlier on, this put Bosnia in a very 
 15   difficult situation.  But that is not due to recognition.  It is a 
 16   fact that the federation broke up and I explained the reasons for the 
 17   breakup earlier on, so it is not by refusing to recognise that breakup 
 18   by going on and have the federation exist as a fiction when it did not 
 19   have any further basis in reality that one could have improved things. 
 20    That is my opinion at all events. 
 21   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  Let me ask fellow Judges whether they 
 22   have any questions.
 23   JUDGE RIAD [In translation]:  Professor, earlier on you said that the 
 24   Yugoslav Army when it attacked Croatia had the support of the militia. 
 25    Did the militia report to the army?  What was their status?

  1   A.   No, the militia was not under the orders of the army. There were two 
  2   things that were involved, in fact.  There were the local militia, 
  3   that was made up of the local population of Croatia who played a role 
  4   in the initial events, the roadblocks, etc. and the initial clashes, 
  5   but there were also paramilitary groups that came from Serbia which 
  6   had been recruited by some Serbian extremists, extremists, the Arkan 
  7   Tigers, the White Eagles, and other groupings recruited in Serbia who 
  8   came and got involved in these operations in Croatia and played a very 
  9   active role indeed.
 10   		But, it can be said that even if officially the two types of 
 11   militia were not under the army's orders, in actual fact, they 
 12   operated in a co-ordinated fashion, that is to say, that initially the 
 13   militia, particularly the local militia, would provoke a conflict with 
 14   the Croats and then, in the second stage, the army would intervene, 
 15   that is to say, in actual fact it would occupy territory and see to it 
 16   that there was no possibility for the Croats to reoccupy that 
 17   territory.
 18   		Then later on when war really got going as of July/August 
 19   1991, then the army attacked such and such a position with shelling 
 20   and then would occupy the territory, drive out the Croats and then the 
 21   militia, in particular the militia from Serbia, would come afterwards 
 22   and proceed with the massacres, pillage etc..  So there were two 
 23   distinct forces, in  fact, three distinction forces, but they acted 
 24   during this whole period in close co-operation.
 25   Q.   A question I have had on my mind since yesterday when you talked 

  1   about ethnic cleansing:  you said that ethnic cleansing existed since 
  2   the time of the Austrian Empire; also that it took place during the 
  3   Nazi period.  Could you maybe tell us really when that policy 
  4   initiated in the former Yugoslavia and where it came from?
  5   A.   Well, what happened, for instance, in the 18th century under Austrian 
  6   rule and in the 19th century in Serbian and Montenegrin territory, the 
  7   Muslims were driven out. Subsequently, what happened then in Croatia 
  8   and Bosnia in 1941 for the first time it was ethnic cleansing that was 
  9   practised by representatives of a Christian people on another 
 10   Christian people, that is to say, by Croats on Serbs.  So that was the 
 11   first time that ethnic cleansing was taking place without for once the 
 12   Muslims being the victims.  That was also the first time where the 
 13   proportions were as vast, as systematic, as they were.  Of course, 
 14   this was in tune with the fascist Nazi ideology at the time.  It is 
 15   fair to say that ethnic cleansing, such as practised in Croatia during 
 16   the second half of 1991 and then in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995, that 
 17   that was also a follow-up to the same kind of operation.  But this 
 18   time it was carried out in a more systematic fashion and a better 
 19   organised fashion than had ever seen before.
 20   Q.   Who practised in the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs this time?
 21   A.   The Serbs against the Croats and against the Croats in Croatia, and I 
 22   am talking about Croats and non-Serbs, that included the Hungarians 
 23   who were also victims and in Bosnia it  was practised against Croats 
 24   and, essentially, against the Muslim Bosnians who were in terms of 
 25   number the main victims.

  1   		This does not preclude the fact that in Bosnia you also had 
  2   ethnic cleansing practised by Croats against Bosnian Muslims and vice 
  3   versa in 1993.  But in terms of numbers or statistics, if you like, 
  4   ethnic cleansing was practised, essentially, by the Serbs.  In the 
  5   course of the 90s, the Serbs took that initiative.  They practised 
  6   ethnic cleansing in a systematic manner.  So, from a statistical point 
  7   of view, it was in very large, considerable numbers.
  8   JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Professor.
  9   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecutor, if you please, I have just one question 
 10   in the wake of my fellow Judge's question.  How do you define "ethnic 
 11   cleansing" in terms of its principle and in terms of its method?  Then 
 12   I would have a question on the army, please, Professor.
 13   A.   Well, ethnic cleansing is a practice which means that you act in such 
 14   a way that in a given territory the members of a given ethnic group 
 15   are eliminated.  It means a practice that aims at such and such a 
 16   territory be, as they meant, ethnically pure.  So, in other words, 
 17   that that territory would no longer contain only members of the ethnic 
 18   group that took the initiative of cleansing the territory.
 19   		So, in other words, the members of the other groups are 
 20   eliminated by different ways, by different methods.  You have 
 21   massacres.  Everybody is not massacred, but I mean in terms of 
 22   numbers, you have massacres in order to scare these populations.  
 23   Sometimes these massacres are selective, and they aim at eliminating 
 24   the elite of a given population, but they are massacres.  I mean, that 
 25   is the point.  So whenever you have  massacres, naturally the other 

  1   people are driven away.  They are afraid.  They try to run away and 
  2   you find yourself with a high number of a given people that have been 
  3   massacred, persecuted and, of course, in the end these people simply 
  4   want to leave. They also submitted to such pressures that they go 
  5   away.  They are driven away either on their own initiative or they are 
  6   deported.  But the basic point is for them to be out of that territory 
  7   and some of them are sometimes locked up in camps. Some women are 
  8   raped and, furthermore, often times what you have is the destruction 
  9   of the monuments which marked the presence of a given population in a 
 10   given territory, for instance, religious places, Catholic churches or 
 11   mosques are destroyed.
 12   		So, basically, this is how ethnic cleansing is practised in 
 13   the course of this war.
 14   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  In this connection of ethnic cleansing, Professor 
 15   Garde, when you speak of "Muslims" are you talking about a religious 
 16   or an ethnic group?
 17   A.   All right.  When I talk about Muslims, when I told you about the 18th 
 18   and 19th century, of course, I was dealing with a religious group, but 
 19   now when we talk about the Muslims in the course of the 20th century 
 20   and, more specifically, in Bosnia, we no longer deal with a religious 
 21   group.
 22   		As I indicated yesterday, in these particular regions and, 
 23   more specifically, in Bosnia where the different populations all speak 
 24   the same language, the difference was based on a confessional 
 25   criteria, i.e. belonging to a given confessional group.  Croats are 

  1   those that by tradition were Catholics.  The Serbs by tradition are 
  2   orthodox.  The Muslim Bosnians are Muslims with a capital "M" belong 
  3   to the muslim tradition, Muslim this time time spelt with a low case 
  4   "m". 
  5   		That does not mean that these people had a personal faith in 
  6   that religion, that they practised that religion.  It simply means 
  7   that by tradition they came from families that are Muslim, that their 
  8   ancestors also belonged to the Muslim community, but it does not mean 
  9   at all that they themselves practised the Islam religion or that they 
 10   believed in what Muslims believe in.  The same applies to the 
 11   Catholics or the orthodox.
 12   		It simply means that these people belong to that particular 
 13   community by tradition and they considered a sort of heritage in 
 14   belonging to that community, and by the other people they were 
 15   considered as belonging to that community too.  But it did not imply 
 16   anything in terms of their personal creed or their religious practice.
 17   		Of course, even among the Serbs and even those that claimed 
 18   that they belonged to the orthodoxy, and though they defended the 
 19   Orthodox Church, still there are many Serbs that are agnostic or did 
 20   not believe or anything with no creed.  The same applied to Croats and 
 21   to Muslims, spelt with a capital "M".  So again it is not a question 
 22   of personal faith or creed.  It is more a question of belonging to a 
 23   given group, to a given nation.
 24   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Thank you.
 25   JUDGE RIAD:  If you please, Professor, in your presentation about ethnic 

  1   cleansing you have referred to deportation and massacre and you also 
  2   alluded to rape.  Can rape be used as a weapon for ethnic cleansing 
  3   purposes?  Has it been used as a weapon?
  4   A.   Yes, yes, it has.  It was used for that purpose because, you know, 
  5   rape, rape is humiliation, humiliation felt by the  woman who is raped 
  6   and by her whole family and the whole group to which she belongs.  
  7   Rape is something that makes it even more difficult, even more 
  8   intolerable, to live together amongst the different groups.  Returning 
  9   in the region where rape takes place, it is even more difficult.  So, 
 10   undoubtedly, that weapon has been used systematically.  This being 
 11   said, in answer to your question, there are certainly better placed 
 12   experts than me, so I am only repeating here what has been written on 
 13   this subject.
 14   Q.   Thank you.  You used the word "systematic" when referring to ethnic 
 15   cleansing.  Who promoted this idea or this policy at the beginning in 
 16   the present conflict?
 17   A.   In the present conflict, I mean, this had already been promoted by 
 18   Serb theoricians before.  I mean, there was a text dating back to '37 
 19   that clearly explained how we should do away with the Albanians from 
 20   Kosovo.  There were orders given by General Mihajlovic in the Second 
 21   World War that indicated we need to proceed to ethnic cleansing, 
 22   probably apocryphal orders but that probably emanated anyway from 
 23   these Chetnik circles.
 24   		But the point is that the whole idea was floating in the air 
 25   and this practise had already existed.  So in the present conflict, it 

  1   is difficult to find or, at least, I for one do not know of any text 
  2   in which it was expressively said that such populations had to be 
  3   deported.  But, however, it is said expressis verbis everywhere that 
  4   "we cannot live together any more, we must not live together any more. 
  5    We must not live with the Muslims under the same roofs".  The same 
  6   idea was found, well, I do not have the text in mind, but anyway, I 
  7   mean, this whole idea had been expressed before and repeatedly and 
  8   quite frequently.  So the practice was extremely systematic and  so 
  9   clearly enough the idea was present.
 10   JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
 11   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  I am not sure that we fully addressed the role of 
 12   the army at the beginning in the federal structure and then gradually 
 13   the role of the army that developed.  Could you briefly give us some 
 14   clarification about the JNA?
 15   A.   All right.  The army was basically the only federal institution that 
 16   survived.  Gradually, at the time when authority was given to the 
 17   Republics and when the federal Presidency disappeared, all that was 
 18   left was one single federation institution, i.e. the army.  The army 
 19   has several characteristics.  On the one hand, the Serbs for 
 20   historical reasons, from the origin, the Serbs had always occupied 
 21   dominating positions.  I think there were about 60 per cent of Serb 
 22   officers while the Serbs only represented 36 per cent of the 
 23   population in Yugoslavia.  If you include the Montenegrins, it 
 24   increases the proportion.
 25   		So the Serbs had the dominating positions or posts in the 

  1   army, and then the army was an institution, a federal institution, as 
  2   I indicated, but lived on the federation, on the communist regimes 
  3   since in any communist regime the military were privileged.  So the 
  4   army, the army as a whole, wanted to maintain the federation and, as 
  5   far as most of the officers are concerned, they wanted to maintain the 
  6   federation which was directly connected with defending the Serb 
  7   people.
  8   		You have General Kadijevic who was the Commander-in-Chief of 
  9   the army during the crucial times all the way until January '92 who 
 10   wrote that, when you read him actually you realise that, as far as he 
 11   was concerned, both objectives were merging into one single objective, 
 12   i.e. defending the  federal institutions and defending the Serbs or 
 13   defending the rights of the Serbs against all the other peoples.
 14   		So, when the federal authority disappeared, and it disappeared 
 15   when the federal Presidency no longer operated on 15th May '91, so at 
 16   that given point in time you find yourself in front of this rather 
 17   strange position where you have an army without any Commander, an army 
 18   that becomes fairly autonomous.
 19   		So, thanks to the European mediation in July '91, Europe 
 20   managed to impose the elections of Mesic who is a Croat as a President 
 21   of the federation.  So, theoretically, he was the Commander-in-Chief 
 22   of the army, but the army never obeyed to him.  Mesic, although 
 23   theoretically the Commander-in-Chief of the army was considered by 
 24   that army as its No. 1 enemy.  So the army did not have any 
 25   Commander-in-Chief, no superior authority.  So the army behaved as an 

  1   autonomous body and that autonomous body sided with the Serbs and 
  2   acted in close co-operation with the Serb authorities, that of 
  3   Milosevic.
  4   		At that time a Party was created, a Party for Yugoslavia, a 
  5   Party whose leadership was by Milosevic's wife, Mrs. Markovic, and a 
  6   few of the commanders of the army.  So you see that from that time on 
  7   the army operates in full autonomy but in close co-operation with the 
  8   Serb authority.
  9   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  Prosecutor, now how do you want to 
 10   organise the rest of the day?  I think that this morning we started 
 11   earlier on, we are going to work until 1 o'clock, we are going to take 
 12   a break, and you also have some exhibits to tender, so what do you 
 13   suggest, Prosecutor?
 14   MR. BOWERS:  Your Honour, I think going through these additional documents 
 15   should take half an hour to 45 minutes possibly.  If it is 
 16   appropriate, we would like to just continue depending  on the staff 
 17   and the court's wishes.  We can take a break, your Honour, if this is 
 18   an appropriate point.
 19   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  All right.  I hope everybody will be agreeable, but 
 20   we are going to continue with this witness until the end and then we 
 21   will take a break.  Then we will hear the second testimony.  So 
 22   Prosecutor, please continue.
 23   MR. BOWERS:  Thank you, your Honour.  Professor Garde and your Honours, if 
 24   you could turn to Exhibit 4, please?  Professor Garde, would you 
 25   explain to the court what Exhibit 4 is?

  1   A.   Exhibit No. 4 is a letter sent by Radovan Karadzic to Slobodan 
  2   Milosevic to congratulate him on his election as a President of the 
  3   Republic of Serbia.  There is no date on this exhibit but I probably 
  4   think that it dates back to December '90 because this is exactly when 
  5   the election took place, and which are the basis for these 
  6   congratulations.
  7   		The interesting thing in this letter is the signature; the 
  8   fact that Radovan Karadzic signs as the President of the SDS, and at 
  9   the same time as the President of the national Serb Council of 
 10   Bosnia-Herzegovina which is an informal, non-constitutional body which 
 11   was supposed to represent the interests of the Serb people in 
 12   Bosnia-Herzegovina.  So, clearly, here it shows on this exhibit, 
 13   because of the signature and because of the fact that he congratulates 
 14   the President of Serbia, he appears as the leader of the Serbs in 
 15   Bosnia.
 16   Q.   Thank you.  Now if we could move to Exhibit 5, please, if you could 
 17   explain that exhibit for the court?
 18   A.   Right, now, Exhibit No. 5 dates August '91.  It is a circular sent by 
 19   Karadzic as the President of SDS and it is sent to all committees, 
 20   regional committees and municipal committees, of SDS in Bosnia.  This 
 21   document indicates how the  communications should be organised between 
 22   the different bodies of SDS, and how they would ensure the 
 23   confidentiality of such communications.
 24   		So you see here even at the time in August '91 and at the time 
 25   the war was raging in Croatia, but had not started in Bosnia yet, so 

  1   these were the preparations for not a clandestine action but a secret 
  2   or military action and to protect and secure communications of the 
  3   party without being intercepted by the official authorities in Bosnia.
  4   Q.   Professor Garde, if you could move to Exhibit 6, please, and also 
  5   explain to the court what that Exhibit is?
  6   A.   OK, Exhibit No. 6 dates back to March '92.  It is sent to the 
  7   President of the municipality and those that are Serb, since it dates 
  8   back to March 92, the Serb territories or territories considered as 
  9   being Serb, contrary to the previous period, had been split up into 
 10   separate territories.  So here Radovan Karadzic signs as the President 
 11   of SDS.  He no longer writes to the committees of the SDS, as in the 
 12   previous exhibit, he is sending this to the Presidents of the 
 13   municipalities, those municipalities that were placed under his 
 14   authority at the time when this country had already been split up.  So 
 15   here again the point is to organise communications between the 
 16   different municipalities.
 17   Q.   Professor Garde, would you move to Exhibit 7, please, and explain 
 18   that Exhibit to the court?
 19   A.   Yes, Exhibit 7 is a decision, it is a decision in order to maintain 
 20   the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina within the common state of 
 21   Yugoslavia.  The interesting thing is, well, No. 1, this exhibit is 
 22   not signed by Karadzic but by Krajisnik, Krajisnik who -- in actual 
 23   fact, I think the interesting thing  would be to look at the previous 
 24   exhibit which is on the same photocopy.  It is a decision aiming at 
 25   creating an assembly of the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina; a 

  1   decision of the same date of 24th October '91.
  2   		So on 24th October '91 it was decided in a first stage, and 
  3   that is the first exhibit, the one before, the one about which you are 
  4   asking me questions.  So in this previous exhibit, the decision is 
  5   made to create a National Assembly or, rather, an Assembly of the Serb 
  6   people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a sort of higher degree as 
  7   opposed to the Council that previously existed.  So now you have an 
  8   Assembly which is supposed to rule over the Serb people in 
  9   Bosnia-Herzegovina.  So from now on, the Serb people or the Serbs from 
 10   Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer recognised the authority of the 
 11   government of Bosnia Herzegovina, the common government, but they set 
 12   themselves up as a separate entity.
 13   		That Assembly of the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina is made 
 14   up of the deputies from SDS and SPO which is another Serb party which 
 15   were part of the Assembly.  So it is a part of the Assembly of 
 16   Bosnia-Herzegovina, a section of the Assembly, representing these two 
 17   Serb parties that set themselves up as a separate body.  This is why 
 18   the President of that Assembly is the man, a member of SDS, who 
 19   previously was a President of the whole Assembly of 
 20   Bosnia-Herzegovina, Momcilo Krajisnik, and this is why he signs that 
 21   particular exhibit.
 22   		So, in the first stage, that Assembly is created. This is the 
 23   first exhibit.  Then the second exhibit, No. 7, means that the 
 24   Assembly which has just been created on that very day decides that the 
 25   Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina will stay in the common state of 

  1   Yugoslavia. 
  2   		The interesting point is that mention is made that the people 
  3   will stay part of the common state of Yugoslavia.  So, they do not 
  4   state expressively that it is a member of the Federal Socialist 
  5   Republic of Yugoslavia that existed at the time and no mention is made 
  6   of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which will be created only a 
  7   couple of months later; they are simply using a word or wording that 
  8   does not have any constitutional meaning, the common state of 
  9   Yugoslavia.  That means that whatever the form that the state of 
 10   Yugoslavia will take, the Serbs intend to stay within that state.  So 
 11   it means, it is an act that means that they want to secede secession 
 12   as from the state of Bosnia.
 13   		Now, one could wonder why this act is dated 24th October '91. 
 14    Obviously, this had been prepared for a long time, since before that. 
 15    You had the autonomous regions, the Serb autonomous regions, so 
 16   everything had been planned for that particular secession, but what 
 17   triggered it is the vote that took place on 14th or, rather, 15th 
 18   October '91, a week before the vote in the parliament of 
 19   Bosnia-Herzegovina that voted for the sovereignty of 
 20   Bosnia-Herzegovina; a vote that was won thanks to the votes of the 
 21   Croat and Muslim Bosnians' votes but which was rejected, violently 
 22   rejected, by the Serb representatives.
 23   		In the course of that particular hearing of 15th October '91 
 24   in the parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is when Radovan Karadzic 
 25   voiced very threatening words concerning what could happen if that 

  1   vote took place.  If you please, I am going it read out what he said 
  2   at the time.  I apologise, but I am going to read this out in English 
  3   because I do not have the Serb origin nor a French translation; what I 
  4   have here before me is an English translation published in the book of 
  5   Laura Silber,   "The Death of Yugoslavia" on page 237.  So Karadzic 
  6   said before the parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina:
  7   		"You want to take Bosnia-Herzegovina down the same highway of 
  8   hell and suffering that Slovenia and Croatia are travelling.  Do 
  9   nothing that you will not lead Bosnia into hell, and do nothing that 
 10   you will not, perhaps, lead the Muslim people into an annihilation 
 11   because the Muslims cannot defend themselves if there is war.  How 
 12   will you prevent everyone from being killed in Bosnia?"
 13   		 So that is what Karadzic said on 14th and 15th October 1991. 
 14    This exhibit, Exhibit 7, is, as it were, the implementation of that 
 15   policy.  It is the first step of it, that is to say, the determination 
 16   on the part of the Serbs to secede from Bosnia.
 17   Q.   Professor Garde, both the creation of the Assembly and the 
 18   affirmation of the Serbian people remaining in whatever Yugoslavia 
 19   turns out to be, appears on this document known as a gazette.  Would 
 20   you explain to the court what this publication is and its 
 21   significance, please?
 22   A.   Now, the publication, the organ in which that is published, this 
 23   text?
 24   Q.   Yes.
 25   A.   Well, this is published -- it is the official gazette, as it were, of 

  1   the Serb people in Bosnia Herzegovina.  So, the fact that the Serb 
  2   people publish an official gazette, that is one of the acts in the 
  3   course of this process of secession, that is to say, the Serb people 
  4   have set themselves up as a separate entity and they have their own 
  5   official gazette.  But it is worth pointing out that it did not start 
  6   coming out officially until 15th January 1992, so a bit later. 
  7   		What I was just referring to, 24th October 1991, they were 
  8   subsequently two or three months later brought together and then 
  9   published; because in the text itself, in the decision, it says that 
 10   this decision, this is Article 3, shall be published in the gazette of 
 11   the people, Serb people, Glasnik.  This is a paper that still comes 
 12   out today.  It is a weekly, I believe. It is a normal newspaper.
 13   		So, initially, once a decision is taken, it is decided that it 
 14   would be published in the press.  Then, subsequently, later on they 
 15   thought that it would be appropriate to publish it as an official 
 16   gazette.  So a couple of months later they came out with an official 
 17   gazette and they included all the previous decisions in it.
 18   Q.   Thank you, Professor Garde.  Could we now move to Exhibit 8, please? 
 19    If you could explain what that document is?
 20   A.   Exhibit 8, this is a decision giving authority to represent and 
 21   defend the interests of the Serb people in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  So, in 
 22   this exhibit there are five people who are given full powers, who are 
 23   empowered by the Assembly of the Serb people that has just been set 
 24   up, because all of this is happening on one and the same day, 24th 
 25   October, so the Assembly gives full agency to five people to represent 

  1   it on such and such affairs.
  2   		So it is worth looking more closely at how the responsibility 
  3   is broken down, because there are two people who are in charge of 
  4   international affairs, Nikola Koljevic and another person, the two 
  5   representatives of the Serbs to the Bosnian Presidency.  Then there 
  6   are three other people who are in charge of relations with the federal 
  7   authorities of Yugoslavia. 
  8   		Now as the previous decision was based on the Serb aim of 
  9   staying in the common Yugoslav state, so the relations with the 
 10   federal Yugoslav authorities were what was most important, actually in 
 11   terms of the functions of the stay of the people that are going to be 
 12   working in that capacity; Najdanovic who is in charge of relations 
 13   with the Assembly, the legislative branch; Miodrag Simovic is in 
 14   charge of relations with the government, federal government: and 
 15   Radovan Karadzic is in charge of relations with the federal 
 16   Presidency.  That is to say, he is in charge of relations with the 
 17   supreme authority of the federation.
 18   		So at this stage, where the aim of the Serbs in Bosnia is to 
 19   remain within the Yugoslav federation, Karadzic is in charge of the 
 20   functions which at that point in time are the most important, that is 
 21   to say, links with the federal Presidency. He cannot be made a member 
 22   of the federal Presidency officially, but he is in charge of the 
 23   relations with it, which is just about the same thing.
 24   Q.   If we could move to Exhibit 9, please?  If you could explain what 
 25   that document is and its significance?

  1   A.   Exhibit 9 is a decision on the territories of the municipalities of 
  2   the local communities and places in Bosnia and Herzegovina which 
  3   regard themselves as part of the federal state of Yugoslavia.  So it 
  4   is still an ambiguous wording there, the federal state of Yugoslavia.
  5   		Now, secession on the part of the Serb entity was pronounced 
  6   in the previous decisions.  Here, this is a month later, this is 21st 
  7   November we are talking about, so secession was proclaimed in 
  8   principle, but the territory has not been specified.  So here it is a 
  9   matter of specifying what that  territory is.  It is specified as 
 10   being the territory in which, when the plebiscite was held a little 
 11   earlier in November -- one second here -- yes, in the course of the 
 12   plebiscites, more than 50 per cent of the citizens of Serb nationality 
 13   came out in favour of remaining within Yugoslavia.
 14   		So, all of these regions where there is more than 50 per cent 
 15   of the Serb citizens came out in favour of remaining in Yugoslavia are 
 16   regarded as part of Yugoslavia.  So, quite clearly, that is a very 
 17   elastic definition, because that referendum had been organised 
 18   throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and throughout there the majority of 
 19   Serbs had come out in favour of staying within Yugoslavia.  So, I said 
 20   this was a very elastic formulation that allowed for all kinds of 
 21   conclusions.
 22   		There is something else here worth mentioning.  It says at the 
 23   end of Article 4 that the Serbs cannot oppose the decisions taken by 
 24   the Croats and the Muslims to set up their own entities, which is 
 25   something totally arbitrary because at that time the Croat and Muslim 

  1   people had not indicated they wanted to set up their own entities.  
  2   There had simply been a decision taken by a majority of the Bosnia and 
  3   Herzegovina Assembly which was mean to represent all of the people of 
  4   Bosnia and Herzegovina.  So there was no desire to secede that had 
  5   been expressed by the Croat or Muslim communities.  In fact, at that 
  6   point in time, they did not and were not meant to have any separate 
  7   existence which was quite different from what the Serbs were doing at 
  8   the time.
  9   Q.   Could we move to Exhibit 10 now, please, if you could explain the 
 10   significance of that Exhibit?
 11   A.   Now, Exhibit 10, 21st November '91 still, this is a decision on 
 12   verifying the autonomous Serb territory proclaimed  in Bosnia and 
 13   Herzegovina.  This is a further step, another act, down the road to 
 14   secession of the Serb territory.  It is again a matter of defining 
 15   that territory.
 16   		Before the acts we have mentioned here, there had been the 
 17   setup by the Serbs, by the SDS, of autonomous Serb regions and 
 18   autonomous Serb districts.  That is to say, certain regions had set 
 19   themselves up as autonomous territories.  In other words, they had 
 20   subtracted themselves from the authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
 21   Here you have a list of the communities in question.
 22   		So, it is a matter of delineating the territory of the various 
 23   regions involved.  So, there is one that is somewhat bigger, that is 
 24   the first one, Krajina, and that is quite widespread.  That is why it 
 25   is called the region, the region of Krajina.  Then you have the 

  1   autonomous districts of eastern Herzegovina, Romanija, Semberija, 
  2   northern Bosnia.
  3   		So, this is a list here of the territories that had set 
  4   themselves up as autonomous Serb territories, and had thereby broken 
  5   away from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Here they are uniting, they are 
  6   declaring themselves part of Yugoslavia and part of the Serb entity 
  7   that was being established.
  8   		So there is this definition of the territory here.  It is 
  9   worth note noting that this decision does not yet lay down any 
 10   specific borderlines, because the rights, well, since the -- there are 
 11   some regions, some municipalities where it is indicated that the 
 12   territory includes only part of it.  So, the delineation is not yet as 
 13   specific as it might be.  The previous decision made room for going 
 14   further, that other territories could be included.
 15   Q.   Professor Garde, does this creation of the autonomous  regions and 
 16   districts fit into some broader Serbian strategy, in your opinion?
 17   A.   Yes, what is involved here is a longer term strategy, because the aim 
 18   is to have these territories, which in the first stage have set 
 19   themselves up as autonomous regions, to have them unite and then they 
 20   are supposed to unite with Yugoslavia.  This is the same process that 
 21   had been followed in Croatia, because in Croatia as well the Serbs had 
 22   first set up two autonomous regions.  Then those two autonomous 
 23   regions are joined, united, and the plan was for them to stay within 
 24   Yugoslavia.
 25   Q.   Thank you.  Now if we could have Exhibit 11 which is also R12 shown 

  1   on the computer screen, please?
  2   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We do not hear the interpretation.  There seems to 
  3   be a problem with the interpretation for the witness. We will 
  4   straighten that out.
  5   THE WITNESS:  Yes, now I hear fine.  Thank you.
  6   MR. BOWERS:  Exhibit 11.  Professor Garde, would you take a moment and 
  7   explain to the court what this map represents?
  8   A.   Yes, that is Exhibit 11, the map.  This is the delineation that we 
  9   were touching on earlier on, that is to say, this was what was spelled 
 10   out in the previous act, that is to say, these are all the communities 
 11   which were supposed to be part of the Serb entity which were going to 
 12   stay in the common Yugoslav state.  So you have the geographical 
 13   delineation that stems or flows from the previous acts.
 14   MR. BOWERS:  Your Honours, just for accuracy and clarification, I would 
 15   like to make two observations with regard to this map, one is the 
 16   municipalities of Bosanska Dubica, Bosanski Gradiska and Bosanski Novi 
 17   are actually not included in a decision that appears in the gazette.  
 18   We have included them on the map though  because, based on our 
 19   research and investigation, we have the original minutes of the 
 20   decision actually made by the Assembly. In those minutes, there is an 
 21   indication that these three municipalities are to be included.  So 
 22   they are included on the map, but I wanted to make that clear to the 
 23   court.
 24   		Additionally, the red line that goes through the 
 25   municipalities of Bosanska Krupa, Gornji Vakuf, Rogatica and Sarajevo 

  1   are only approximate delineations because the text of the decision, as 
  2   Professor Garde says, is somewhat flexible and only gives limited 
  3   guidance on those areas where the territory is only described as 
  4   including part of that municipality.  So those are two clarifications 
  5   for that particular map.
  6   		If we could move to Exhibit 12, please, which is R13? 
  7   Professor Garde, when that comes on the screen, if you could explain 
  8   that to the court, please?
  9   A.   The map now on the screen is a map showing the military situation on 
 10   10th November 1992, that is to say, about a year after the previous 
 11   map.  You can see that it corresponds to a significant extent with the 
 12   previous map since, roughly speaking, you are talking about the same 
 13   territories.  So, as I said, roughly speaking, it is one and the same 
 14   territory.  So the Serbs occupied militarily something that was very 
 15   much in line with what they had planned a year earlier.
 16   		I would point out that there is a mistake here actually on 
 17   this map, because the Bihac region and these three regions in the 
 18   north west, in fact, were not occupied by the Serbs at that time.  
 19   They should not be in red.  In fact, they were never taken by the 
 20   Serbs, so those three north western most regions.  But the two maps, I 
 21   said, are quite close.  They do not overlap to 100 per cent, because 
 22   in some cases the Serbs  conquered more territory than they had 
 23   planned.  You can see, for instance, that the whole valley of the 
 24   Drina to the north east, that is to say, the communities of Visegrad, 
 25   Srebrenica, Bratunac, Zvornik, Gorazde, all of those regions were 

  1   conquered by the Serbs but they were not included in what we saw 
  2   previously.
  3   		These regions happened to be those where some of the most 
  4   horrible things took place in connection with ethnic cleansing.  There 
  5   are other areas that were conquered that were not planned for, Jajce, 
  6   that region, or Brcko to the north, north east -- you can see Brcko 
  7   which was in white on the previous map and now it is in red, Brcko -- 
  8   was also the theatre of absolutely dreadful fighting.  That was one of 
  9   the places where ethnic cleansing was carried out in a horrible way.
 10   		So there are regions where the Serbs met with more resistance 
 11   than they expected.  That is where you have Muslim Bosnian majority, 
 12   and they had included that in the northern Bosnian region on the 
 13   previous map, that is, in the north, as you can see here.  On this No. 
 14   12 around Tuzla, the part going up, that was not planned for on the 
 15   previous map, that is to say, the Bosnian Muslims put up more 
 16   resistance than expected.
 17   		So, in military terms, the situation in November of 1992 was 
 18   based on what was scheduled a year earlier, but a little bit more 
 19   territory was taken in some parts and then, of course, there is a 
 20   little less territory elsewhere and it all very bloody, needless to 
 21   say.
 22   MR. BOWERS:  Additional clarification on this particular map, your 
 23   Honours:  this line that was drawn was taken from the situation 
 24   frontline map as developed by the headquarters of the combined British 
 25   forces of UNPROFOR.  In addition to the north  western section that 

  1   Professor Garde mentioned, you may notice that the map does not 
  2   include the enclaves of Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa.  It was not 
  3   until February'93 that those areas started to show up on the situation 
  4   maps, so that is just a clarification with regard to this particular 
  5   map.
  6   		If we could have Exhibit 13, R1-4, just briefly shown?  For 
  7   the court's benefit, this is just the two lines superimposed on each 
  8   other to show the similarity.  I think Professor Garde has already 
  9   explained the significance of that, so we will move on to Exhibit 14, 
 10   please.  (To the witness): Professor Garde, if you could explain the 
 11   significance of Exhibit 14 and what the document is.
 12   A.   Exhibit 14 is dated 11th November 1991 -- December 1991. This is an 
 13   appeal from the Assembly of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
 14   signed by Momcilo Krajisnik, the President. That was calling on the 
 15   National Yugoslav Army to defend the territories by whatever means, 
 16   the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part and parcel of the 
 17   Yugoslav state, and places where there have been the referendum where 
 18   the Serbs in a majority had indicated that they wanted to stay in a 
 19   Serb state.
 20   		Things had not been spelt out very clearly, but it was now a 
 21   matter of turning to the Yugoslav Army to have them provide defence.  
 22   So it is a matter of reiterating the same process that had unfolded in 
 23   Croatia, that is to say, to have the Yugoslav Army involved in 
 24   defending the Serb territories as defined.
 25   Q.   Do you know how the JNA responded to this request?

  1   A.   The JNA, of course, responded favourably to this request. What 
  2   happened subsequently went to show that it was the units of the 
  3   Yugoslav Army which were rebaptised, as it were, to become  the Serb 
  4   Bosnian Army and it was they who were the spearhead of this war in 
  5   Bosnia.
  6   Q.   Professor Garde, when you use the term "rebaptised" are you referring 
  7   to the point in time when the JNA made an official proclamation that 
  8   it would be withdrawing from Bosnia-Herzegovina; if so, would you 
  9   explain that and perhaps contrast the so-called withdrawal in 
 10   Bosnia-Herzegovina with the withdrawals of the JNA in Slovenia and 
 11   Croatia before?
 12   A.   Well, in Slovenia the federal army had accepted to withdraw on the 
 13   basis of the agreements entered into with the European Community and 
 14   it did, in fact, withdraw with all its men, its weaponry, its 
 15   materiel.  As far as Croatia goes, the federal army after the 
 16   cease-fire signed on 2nd January 1992 and the agreement signed 
 17   subsequently, the federal army withdrew from Croatia and left in the 
 18   territories of Croatia, they left the forces there but they were 
 19   rebaptised police forces, but these were the local forces.  The 
 20   federal army did not have to stay there to defend these territories 
 21   since that task had been taken on by the United Nations.
 22   		So the federal army did, in fact, withdraw from Croatia, but 
 23   when it comes to Bosnia, the federal army did not withdraw because 
 24   what happened was in April and May 1992 the withdrawal was proclaimed 
 25   but, in fact, all of the units of the federal army, including all 

  1   their materiel, stayed in Bosnia.
  2   		Simply what happened was there was a reorganisation of troops 
  3   so that these units would be made up exclusively, or practically 
  4   exclusively, of Serbian soldiers from Bosnia so that there was a 
  5   transfer of men.  Soldiers from Bosnia were assigned to units in 
  6   Bosnia.  Those who men who were not from Bosnia were assigned to units 
  7   in Serbia, Montenegro.  Those troops were  still called "federal" 
  8   troops.
  9   		The troops in Bosnia became the Bosnian-Serb army.  So they 
 10   were meant to be an army of their own, but they kept all their 
 11   materiel, all their equipment, and they were, in fact, still paid from 
 12   the federal budget.  So while the withdrawal from Slovenia and Croatia 
 13   did actually take place, when it comes to Bosnia, this was something 
 14   that was done only theoretically in paper terms.  It was just the 
 15   change of names.  That is all that happened and that is why I used the 
 16   term "rebaptised" earlier on.
 17   Q.   Thank you.  Professor Garde, if we could move to Exhibit 15 now, 
 18   please, and explain that particular exhibit to the court.
 19   A.   All right, Exhibit 15, dated 21st December '91.  This is a decision 
 20   with the aim to creating the Serb Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
 21   Article 1 you have this strange wording, it says:  "Preparation is 
 22   underway with a view to creating the Serb Republic of 
 23   Bosnia-Herzegovina".  So, basically, what it means is that Republic is 
 24   not yet created and the text here provides for preparation with a view 
 25   to that creation and the Republic should be proclaimed before the new 

  1   year, the Serb new year, which is 14th January '92.
  2   		So you see, the time span is rather short.  It is about a 
  3   month or three weeks, rather, which means it is a further step in the 
  4   constitution of a Serb entity in Bosnia.  In the previous text, it was 
  5   simply indicated that it was to remain part of Yugoslavia, whilst here 
  6   they decided they are going to make a separate Republic, that of the 
  7   Serb Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
  8   		Now one could wonder why that decision was made at the time.  
  9   Well, that is the time when the European Community has  just decided 
 10   to consider recognising the Republics that would ask for such 
 11   recognition, a certain time is given for these Republics -- I think it 
 12   was until 27th December -- to table their application for 
 13   independence.
 14   		So, in parallel, the Serbs from Bosnia decide that they could 
 15   set themselves up in a Republic.  They allot themselves a certain time 
 16   to start this Republic.  So again it is the same process of secession 
 17   and creation of separate entities, which is meant to proceed in 
 18   parallel with the decisions taken by the other party.
 19   		So, here it says that such a Republic should be created before 
 20   14th January.
 21   Q.   Thank you.  If you could move to Exhibit 16, please, and explain that 
 22   Exhibit to the court.
 23   A.   Yes, Exhibit 16 is a decision with the aim of creating a Council of 
 24   Ministers of the Assembly of the Serb people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
 25   the same date, 21st December.  So it means that that particular 

  1   Assembly which had been created previously and which operates as a 
  2   state, which is going to publish its official journal and which is 
  3   going to be the basis for a Republic, so before it is actually created 
  4   we see that the Republic already has a government and that government 
  5   is described in this Exhibit.
  6   Q.   Professor Garde, one notices that the accused Radovan Karadzic does 
  7   not appear as one of the ministers in this particular document.  Do 
  8   you have an opinion, could you explain as to why his name would not 
  9   appear in this formation and selection of the Council of Ministers?
 10   A.   Yes.  Yes, it is easy to explain.  Well, Karadzic is not part of that 
 11   government because he reserves himself for the  function of the 
 12   President of the Republic.  The constitution voted by these Yugoslav 
 13   Republics all provide for a sort of system based on the 5th Republic 
 14   of the French system with a clear distinction between the President of 
 15   the Republic having superior authority and the government, on the 
 16   other hand.  We see that Karadzic is always kept away from the 
 17   government functions, and we have seen previously that he was in 
 18   charge of the relationship with the federal authorities, not at the 
 19   level of the government, but at the level of the Presidency.  Here 
 20   again we see that he is leaving such government positions with other 
 21   people.  He reserves himself for the supreme position which he will 
 22   occupy later on.
 23   Q.   Thank you.  Now if we could move to move to Exhibit 17, please, and 
 24   if you could explain this Exhibit to the court, taking particular note 
 25   of Article 1 and Article 2, please?

  1   A.   This text, we see the constitution given to the so-called Serb 
  2   Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina.  This dates back to -- wait a second 
  3   -- I am sorry, I am sorry.  I think I am a bit confused.  This exhibit 
  4   is a declaration about the proclamation of the Serb Republic of the 
  5   people in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  So, in other words, this is the 
  6   implementation of the previous act. It was provided for to create a 
  7   Republic for the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina by 14th January.  Now 
  8   this is 9th January and we see that this Republic is indeed 
  9   proclaimed.
 10   		One can see here that in the preamble mention is made of the 
 11   territorial delineation and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina which 
 12   existed so far.  This is what they say.  So it means here that for the 
 13   Bosnian Serbs, this is the act of death of the former Republic of 
 14   Bosnia-Herzegovina as it existed before.  In the future, in Serb media 
 15   you always refer  to the former Bosnia Herzegovina.
 16   		You have asked me to look at Article 1.  Something is the 
 17   matter with my earphones.
 18   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecutor, I think we have overrun the time 
 19   allotted and I am thinking of a break.  I think that we may need to 
 20   take a short break.  I wonder whether on the basis of our agreement we 
 21   could possibly take a break until quarter to 12 and then we will 
 22   resume with Professor Garde.  His explanations have to be provided to 
 23   the Tribunal, we do not want to cut him short, but we also have to 
 24   keep in mind the staff working for this hearing.  So, we will stand in 
 25   recess and we will resume at 11.50.

  1   (11.25 a.m.)
  2   		(The court adjourned for a short time)
  3   (11.50 a.m.)
  4   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will resume the hearing.  Prosecutor, you have 
  5   the floor.
  6   MR. BOWERS:  Thank you, your Honour.  Professor Garde, we were discussing 
  7   Exhibit 17, in particular Article 1, if you could describe that for 
  8   the court and explain its significance, please?
  9   A.   Something is the matter with the microphone.
 10   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes.  We were having problems before the break, I am 
 11   afraid.  I had hoped that the problem had been solved.  Is this any 
 12   better?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear the Prosecutor?  Can you hear 
 13   the interpreter?  This sort of whistling sound has not disappeared, I 
 14   am afraid.  Turning to the technicians, can they do something about 
 15   it?
 16   THE WITNESS:  OK.  You were asking me about Article 1 where the 
 17   territories are defined, territories that are part of the Serb  
 18   Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Mention is made, an interesting 
 19   mention is made, they talk about autonomous regions and autonomous 
 20   districts, and the other ethnic Serbian entities in Bosnia Herzegovina 
 21   which is something extremely vague.  Other Serbian ethnic entities, 
 22   including the including the regions in which the Serbian people 
 23   remained in minority due to the genocide conducted against it in World 
 24   War II.  So here mention is made of the genocide.
 25   		I think that that particular wording is extremely vague, so it 

  1   could be interpreted in any way and could explain any extension of the 
  2   territory.  It is purposeless, since however bloody the genocide might 
  3   have been against the Serbs in the course of World War II, demographic 
  4   studies that were carried out later on demonstrated that it did not 
  5   significantly change the ethnic makeup of the population.  It is one 
  6   of the major Serb myth.  According to it, Serbs might have lost the 
  7   majority in the Bosnia because of that genocide perpetrated between 
  8   '41 and '45, whilst in actual fact censuses have demonstrated the 
  9   majority changed not at the time but 30 years later with the first 
 10   census that shows that the Serbs no longer have the majority which is 
 11   that of '71.
 12   		Consequently, it is not true to say that the Serbs lost the 
 13   majority because of the genocide.  I cannot state that in no region 
 14   there was no change.  If you look at the different regions and the 
 15   different communes, I cannot state, of course, that there was not any 
 16   change in one particular region or district because of the genocide; 
 17   and if there were such cases, there were not that many.  So this is a 
 18   wording that really is meaningless, and which will no longer be used 
 19   in subsequent text. 
 20   		But, anyway, the purpose here is to make that definition as 
 21   vague as possible, lending itself to any possible extension and, 
 22   secondly, they refer to a myth which was extremely powerful in the 
 23   Serb opinion.
 24   Q.   Professor Garde, if you could now direct your attention to Article 2 
 25   and explain its significance?

  1   A.   All right.  Article 2 says that the Republic, the new Republic, shall 
  2   remain within the Yugoslav federal state as its federal unit.  So once 
  3   again we talk here about the Yugoslav federal state.  So here again 
  4   this is not an official term which could apply to any form of 
  5   Yugoslavia and this new Republic is no longer part of 
  6   Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it claims to be part of one of the federal 
  7   units making up Yugoslavia, as was the case for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
  8   before.
  9   Q.   If we could move to Exhibit 18 which is a combined set of documents 
 10   involving the constitution?  If you would explain to the court what 
 11   this Exhibit is and tell them if there is anything significant about 
 12   the date of the implementation of the constitution?
 13   A.   Right, the constitution referred to here is proclaimed on 28th 
 14   February '92.  Why 28th February?  Because the 29th, the following 
 15   day, the referendum was planned, referendum which meant that 
 16   Bosnia-Herzegovina was to proclaim its independence. So, in the eyes 
 17   of the Bosnian Serbs at the time when Bosnia-Herzegovina was to 
 18   proclaim its independence, at that particular time, the new, newly 
 19   formed Republic that seceded from Bosnia-Herzegovina should have its 
 20   own constitution.
 21   Q.   Would you direct your attention to Article 2 and explain its 
 22   significance to the court, please?
 23   A.   Yes, Article 2 is quoting part of the Article that we  looked at 
 24   before as refers to the definition of the territory. So once again 
 25   reference is made to the territory of the autonomous regions, and the 

  1   other Serb ethnic entities and then afterwards, it says, including the 
  2   regions in which genocide was committed against the Serb people in the 
  3   Second World War. Well, apparently, it repeats exactly the same as in 
  4   the former Article when in actual fact it is different.
  5   		Earlier on, we discussed about the regions in which the Serb 
  6   people found themselves as a minority because of the genocide, whilst 
  7   here they talk about regions where genocide was committed, which is 
  8   entirely different.  One could think that the authors of that text 
  9   realised what I said earlier on, which is that the majority had not 
 10   changed.  The demographic majority had not changed because of the 
 11   genocide.
 12   		Consequently, the previous text was meaningless.  This is my 
 13   assumption, but the point is that the text here is even more general. 
 14    There are hardly any regions where the genocide changed the majority. 
 15    However, the genocide was committed practically everywhere.  So when 
 16   you talk about regions in which genocide was committed, that applies 
 17   to practically any region in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  So, as you can see 
 18   here, the definition of the territory remains extremely imprecise, 
 19   flexible, lending itself to all sorts of interpretations and 
 20   conquests.
 21   Q.   Professor Garde, again in the constitution in Article 3 we have 
 22   another expression of how this new entity views itself with regard to 
 23   the federal state or federal entity of Yugoslavia. Would you again 
 24   review that for the court, please?
 25   A.   Yes.  Article 3 says that the Republic is a part of the federal state 

  1   of Yugoslavia.  It is again the same wording as before.  This is again 
  2   the federal state of Yugoslavia, whatever  it is.
  3   Q.   Professor Garde, if  you could move towards the end of this 
  4   collective set of documents and look at the constitutional law for 
  5   implementing the constitution and, in particular, take a look at 
  6   Article 5 and explain to the court what that Article provides?
  7   A.   What number, please?  What page, possibly?  What exhibit? I cannot 
  8   find this reference.
  9   Q.   This is still Exhibit 18.  It will be the last part of the gazette 
 10   for constitutional -----
 11   A.   Well, the constitutional law, that is what you are referring to?  OK, 
 12   yes, I see now.  Article 5, it says:  "The first President of the 
 13   Republic shall be elected by the Assembly of the Serb people in 
 14   Bosnia-Herzegovina under a proposal submitted by at least 20 
 15   representatives", and then they talk about 18th November '90.
 16   		Until then the constitution which we refer to provides for 
 17   universal suffrage election for the President.  Here they say that 
 18   until the election of the President of the Republic, the function of 
 19   the President shall be carried out by the members of the Presidency 
 20   elected previously.  These members of the Presidency will be Nikola 
 21   Koljevic and Biljana Plavsic. These two people were to carry out the 
 22   collective Presidency for that particular time -- at that particular 
 23   time Radovan Karadzic was not on the forefront and was not the 
 24   President.  His functions were, of course, being the President of the 
 25   SDS and representing the new Federal Republic within the federal 

  1   institutions.
  2   Q.   Professor Garde, Article 5 provides for, in essence, a general 
  3   election.  To your knowledge, has there ever been this  sort of 
  4   general election for President in the territory that eventually became 
  5   known as Republika Srpska?
  6   A.   Wait a second, no, no, no.  There was no general election. The 
  7   general election was provided for by the constitution, but I forgot -- 
  8   yes, I refer to the second paragraph of Article 5, but I did not refer 
  9   to the first paragraph of Article 5 in which it says that the 
 10   President of the Republic shall be elected by the Assembly of the Serb 
 11   people.
 12   Q.   To your knowledge, no such election has ever occurred?
 13   A.   Can you hear me?  Yes.  The election, this general election, never 
 14   actually took place, but there was an election which is a general 
 15   election provided for by the constitution itself did not take place.  
 16   However, there was an election by the Assembly which is covered by the 
 17   first paragraph in Article 5 of the constitutional law which we are 
 18   looking at now.  That particular election did take place several 
 19   months later and Radovan Karadzic was elected.
 20   Q.   Thank you, Professor Garde.  Now if we could move to Exhibit 19, 
 21   please?  Would you explain what this Exhibit is and its significance?
 22   A.   This Exhibit dates from 12th May 1992 and it proclaims the 
 23   mobilization of the Territorial Defence over the whole territory of 
 24   the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  So, this is 12th May 
 25   1992.  For a few weeks now the war has started, the siege of Sarajevo 

  1   had started, the massacres had started and it is really a matter of 
  2   legalising the general mobilization of the Serb forces, the local Serb 
  3   forces, for these operations.
  4   		It is a matter of mobilizing the Territorial Defence, that is 
  5   to say, that in the former Yugoslavia you had the army, but you also 
  6   had this Territorial Defence.  The army is already  at work and the 
  7   Territorial Defence is being mobilized as well, which means that there 
  8   is general mobilization of the Serb people to participate in the war.
  9   Q.   Thank you.  Now if we could move to Exhibit 20, and again if you 
 10   would explain its significance to the court, please?
 11   A.   Exhibit 20 is -- in fact, there are several amendments here to the 
 12   constitution of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 
 13   document we were just looking at.  This also dates from 12th May 1992, 
 14   that is to say, a few weeks after the war actually started and the 
 15   amendment -- well, the one that is worth mentioning amongst the 
 16   several amendments is Amendment 3, Article 1.11:  "The President of 
 17   the Republic is henceforth the Commander-in-Chief of the armed 
 18   forces", and that was soon to be Radovan Karadzic.
 19   Q.   Thank you.  Now let us move to Exhibit 21 and again explain what 
 20   Exhibit 21 is and its significance, please?
 21   A.   Exhibit 21 is a law, an act, supplementing the constitutional law for 
 22   implementing the constitution of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and 
 23   Herzegovina.  In it you will find Article 1 there that provides for a 
 24   new way to appoint, a new way in which the Presidency of the Republic 
 25   is going to be working. This is the third text really that deals with 

  1   this matter, because in the constitution of what was planned was 
  2   universal suffrage.  Then in the constitutional law we saw, what was 
  3   planned was the election by the Assembly.  Here there is a third, a 
  4   provisional way of going about this business on account of 
  5   circumstances, of course, and here what it says is that the Presidency 
  6   will be performed by a three-member Presidency elected by the 
  7   Assembly, and that that Presidency will from within itself choose a 
  8   President. 
  9   		So, it is a formula similar to what existed in the former 
 10   Yugoslavia.  The Assembly names a Presidency and then the Presidency 
 11   chooses the President, as it were.  So, first, I said there had been 
 12   talk of universal suffrage, then via the Assembly, and now we have 
 13   moved up a level.
 14   Q.   For continuity sake, we will now move instead of to Exhibit 22 to 
 15   Exhibit 23.  We will skip Exhibit 22 and come back to it. Professor 
 16   Garde, if you could have a look at Exhibit 23 and explain what that 
 17   particular exhibit does?
 18   A.   Yes, well this flows from the previous exhibit.  There was to be a 
 19   Presidency that would be elected and then the President would be 
 20   elected from them.  I said, you have three members in the Presidency, 
 21   that is, Biljana Plavsic, Nikola Koljevic, who already made up the 
 22   Presidency before that, who were the Serb representatives to the 
 23   Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Then we have seen on a previous 
 24   document that they made up the Presidency of the Serb Republic, but 
 25   now we are adding Radovan Karadzic here as the third member, but he is 

  1   mentioned first in the document.  So this means that this is the 
  2   preparatory stage for Radovan Karadzic to become President of the 
  3   Republic.
  4   Q.   What, in fact, happens?  What does the Presidency do?
  5   A.   Well, the Presidency, the three-member Presidency, has elected 
  6   Karadzic as its President.
  7   Q.   Thank you.  Now we will move back to Exhibit 22.  Professor Garde, if 
  8   you could explain the significance of Exhibit 22, please?
  9   A.   Exhibit 22 has the same date as the previous documents, 12th May 
 10   1992, a few weeks after the outbreak of the war.  What it provides for 
 11   is the formation of the army of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and 
 12   Herzegovina, that is to say, the Republic  now has an army as of this. 
 13    What is it that we are talking about?  It is made up, in fact, of the 
 14   units of the federal army which was stationed on the territory of 
 15   Bosnia and Herzegovina. In other words, it is a parcel of the federal 
 16   army that is given a new title on account of the circumstances.  Also 
 17   this army, Article 3, appoints a Commander-in-Chief and that 
 18   Command-in-Chief is General Ratko Mladic.
 19   Q.   So then the official proclamation that makes Ratko Mladic the 
 20   Commander of the main staff of the army and the official proclamation 
 21   that makes Karadzic the President of the Presidency, the head of the 
 22   so-called State at that time, those proclamations are on the same 
 23   date, May 12th 1992; is that correct?
 24   A.   The same day, yes, with the difference, as it were, that in the case 
 25   of Ratko Mladic, it is a matter of him acceding to that position, 

  1   whereas as far as Radovan Karadzic goes, even though he formally was 
  2   not the President of the Republic for quite some time, he had already 
  3   been the unchallenged leader.
  4   Q.   All right.  Now if we could move to Exhibit 24, please? Professor 
  5   Garde, if you could explain what this document is and then again 
  6   explain the significance?
  7   A.   Exhibit 24 is also dated 12th May 1992, like the others. This is a 
  8   document that dismisses from their function the judiciary.  These are 
  9   people who have been appointed in the former Republic of Bosnia and 
 10   Herzegovina, that is to say, that these magistrates will be 
 11   reappointed in the context of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and 
 12   Herzegovina.
 13   		What is really worth mentioning here is that this is the first 
 14   document which is signed by Radovan Karadzic in his capacity as 
 15   President of the Presidency of the Serb Republic of  Bosnia and 
 16   Herzegovina.  So this is the first document that he signs in that 
 17   capacity as President.
 18   Q.   Thank you.  Now if we could move to Exhibit 25?  Again please explain 
 19   the significance of this particular exhibit.
 20   A.   Exhibit 25 is a decision signed also by Radovan Karadzic in his 
 21   capacity as President of the Presidency of the Republic.  It dates 
 22   13th May 1992.  This document provides for implementing the rules of 
 23   international law in the army of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and 
 24   Herzegovina.  So, to a certain extent what is involved is the fact 
 25   that Radovan Karadzic has subscribed to the international norms here.

  1   Q.   Thank you.  Now Exhibit 26, please.
  2   A.   Exhibit 26 is significantly later, that is from 17th December 1992.  
  3   This is a decision.  It is a proclamation of the election of the 
  4   President of the Serb Republic, Srpske.  The Serb Republic has become 
  5   the Republika Srpska.  This is the proclamation of the election of 
  6   Radovan Karadzic as President of the Republic.  So far he had been the 
  7   President of the Presidency, that is the third tier I referred to 
  8   earlier on, and now he is just simply the President elected at a lower 
  9   level, that is to say, by the Assembly in accordance with one of the 
 10   documents we looked at earlier on.
 11   Q.   Your Honours, with regard to Exhibit 26 we will later provide you 
 12   with the French and English translations.
 13   		Professor Garde, we have reviewed these various proclamations 
 14   and decisions as they appear in the official gazette, but setting 
 15   aside these formal pronouncements, would you just provide your general 
 16   analysis of what was occurring here for the court's benefit, please?
 17   A.   These documents, despite the formal diversity of the  decisions 
 18   taken, which on the face of it look inconsistent because in one 
 19   document the elections are going to take place, in another document a 
 20   different way, people in different offices, etc., but if you look at 
 21   this chronologically and you look at the logic behind it, these 
 22   documents would tend to show that Radovan Karadzic was always the key 
 23   player, the unchallenged leader of the Serbs in Bosnia.  
 24   Chronologically, you can distinguish three phases.  Up until October 
 25   1991 officially you have the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina operating 

  1   with three constituent peoples, and you have a coalition of the three 
  2   national parties in power.  They distributed power amongst themselves, 
  3   as we have seen.  The Muslims had the Presidency, a Croat was in 
  4   charge of the government and a Serb was in charge of the Presidency of 
  5   the Assembly.  So the Serbs left the executive branch in the hands of 
  6   the two others, and satisfied themselves with the legislative 
  7   authority, that is to say, the Presidency of the legislative branch, 
  8   which is to say that they did not want to get too heavily involved in 
  9   the workings of that Republic because they are already thinking of 
 10   breaking away from it.  The person they have appointed to act as 
 11   President of the Assembly, it is not the leader, their leader, the 
 12   leader of their party, Radovan Karadzic, it is a different character 
 13   who is not without importance or responsibility, but he was not the 
 14   boss, as it were, Krajisnik.  But Radovan Karadzic holds the key 
 15   position as leader of the party, that is to say, the leader of one of 
 16   the three parties in the coalition.  He is the leader of the dominant 
 17   Serb party and at the same time he is in charge of the Serb Council, 
 18   the National Serb Council, which is the formal body of the Serbs in 
 19   Bosnia.
 20   		So up until October 1991, that is to say, up until the  
 21   Bosnian parliament in that memorable session I referred to earlier on 
 22   when Karadzic said those threatening words I quoted for you, there is 
 23   the sovereignty of Bosnia that is adopted and then the plan for 
 24   succession, for the breaking away of the Serb entity that is already 
 25   getting under way.  During this period the decision is taken by the 

  1   Serbs that, despite the decision that has been taken by the 
  2   parliament, their territory, which they start delineating at that 
  3   point in time will stay part of Yugoslavia as an entity.
  4   		So what is the main position then?  It is the relations with 
  5   the federal authority, and that is the position that Radovan Karadzic 
  6   takes on.  We saw that in one of the documents we looked at.  Later 
  7   when it comes to the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
  8   secession of the Serb territories to establish a Serb Republic of 
  9   Bosnia and Herzegovina, when that actually takes place, then Radovan 
 10   Karadzic has himself elected by various procedures to the office that 
 11   he set aside for himself from the outset, that is say, the office of 
 12   President of the Republic.  So there is some continuity through these 
 13   events.  They look inconsistent on the face of it, but there is this 
 14   continuity that is quite logical that runs throughout them and goes to 
 15   show that at no point in time Radovan Karadzic was not the boss.
 16   		I would also like to draw your attention to something else.  
 17   These decisions on the face of it would seem not to have any 
 18   implications when it comes to the conduct of military operations and 
 19   ethnic cleansing that start taking place as of March 1992, but what 
 20   you have to bear in mind is something of quite some significance, that 
 21   is the Croatian precedent, because the process unfolding here that you 
 22   can see through these  documents is exactly the same process that had 
 23   been carried out by the Croatian Serbs a few months earlier, roughly 
 24   speaking a year earlier.  That is to say, first the territories with 
 25   Serb majorities are claiming such, establishing themselves as a 

  1   separate entity, as an autonomous region, then they unite to form a 
  2   Republic.  It is the Krajina Republic that was set up in Croatia and 
  3   you have the Serb Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnia and 
  4   Herzegovina, later on Republika Srpska there.  So they established 
  5   themselves on that basis.  They planned to stay in Yugoslavia, and 
  6   then at the end they go ahead with cleansing their territory, with the 
  7   ethnic cleansing of their territory, in that very bloody fashion.  So 
  8   the process unfolded in Croatia. It started in Croatia in mid-1990 and 
  9   the bloody period of ethnic cleansing in Croatia took place in the 
 10   second half of 1991.
 11   		So, at the time when the Bosnian Serbs go ahead with the first 
 12   stages of this process, that is to say in October 1991, it is already 
 13   known on the basis of the Croatian precedent where it is going to all 
 14   end up.  It is going to end up in a lot of blood and ethnic cleansing. 
 15    It is exactly the same itinerary that was to be followed a little 
 16   later by the Bosnian Serbs under the leadership of Radovan Karadzic.
 17   		With regard to these documents we have pursued, on the face of 
 18   it they are quite innocent, even though they point to something very 
 19   serious, that is to say, the delineation of the territory, but they do 
 20   not say that the delineation of the territory must entail the 
 21   deportation of the non-Serbs living there.  That is not on paper 
 22   anyway, but we know on the basis of the Croatian precedent that that 
 23   is how things happened.
 24   		I would add in regard to ethnic cleansing, that is not a 
 25   necessary logical consequence to the delineation of the territory.  

  1   That is to say, you have to set up a Serb state, you have to set up a 
  2   state dominated by the Serbs, all the Serbs will be there, etc.  In 
  3   logical terms that does not necessarily mean that there should only be 
  4   Serbs living in that territory. So, conceivably, there could be a 
  5   greater Serbia or a Serb state that would have been established but 
  6   which would have tolerated within it the presence of minorities.  That 
  7   is what you have in other Balkan countries.  I do not know, take 
  8   Romania, Bulgaria or even Serbia itself, there are people there who 
  9   are dominating, but there are also minorities which are tolerated. In 
 10   addition, in Serbia itself there are people who are in favour of a 
 11   greater Serbia but who are also in favour of co-existence within that 
 12   greater Serbia of various peoples.  You can think of the Serb leader 
 13   Vuk Draskovic and his party, the Serb Renewal Movement, which as of 
 14   the 80s was one of the main exponents of having all the Serbs in one 
 15   state, in a greater Serbia, but at one and the same time always 
 16   affirmed that in that state the Serbs should live alongside with the 
 17   Muslims and the Croats. So, in other words, was always opposed to 
 18   ethnic cleansing, and little by little went into opposition, even 
 19   violent opposition, with the other victors of Serbian nationalism as 
 20   ethnic cleansing went ahead.
 21   		So a greater Serbia does not necessarily in logical terms mean 
 22   that there is going to be ethnic cleansing, but the Croatian example 
 23   went to show that, de facto, that is what it would mean.  At the time 
 24   the Bosnian Serbs started up the process that we have just been 
 25   running through on the basis of the documents, they already knew that 

  1   that process would lead to ethnic cleansing, and they also made use of 
  2   the same people who  had been involved in ethnic cleansing in Croatia. 
  3    So, behind the strictly legal and apparently innocent documents, 
  4   there is this process that is very logical, that is very methodical 
  5   and which would lead to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and which began a 
  6   few weeks before the last documents we have looked at, since it began, 
  7   roughly speaking, in March 1992 and the last documents we have 
  8   reviewed date from May 1992.
  9   MR. BORROWS:  Thank you, Professor Garde.  That concludes the questions 
 10   from the Prosecutor.  We would tender all of these exhibits to the 
 11   Court as evidence for the Rule 61 hearing.
 12   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, prosecuting counsel.  Fellow judges, 
 13   Judge Odio Benito, do you have a question?  You have the floor, madam.
 14   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Professor, I would like to know if you could give us 
 15   your opinion about the administrative personnel or political links, if 
 16   any, between Radovan Karadzic and Slobodan Milosevic?
 17   A.   Well, I think that at the time we are talking about those links were 
 18   very close indeed.  The whole process which we have surveyed, that is 
 19   to say, the process of secession on the part of the Serb territories 
 20   from Bosnia and Herzegovina, their desire to stay part and parcel of 
 21   Yugoslavia, that was done in close co-operation with the Serb 
 22   authority.  That is proven best by the fact that this division, this 
 23   nominal division splitting of the army with the assent and the 
 24   participation of both parties, that is to say the Serb authority of 
 25   Milosevic and then of the Bosnian Serb authority on the other.  So 

  1   there was this friendly separating of the ways between these two 
  2   fragments which were in fact closely linked, the fact that the army 
  3   went on being paid by Belgrade.  It is quite clear that at that time  
  4   there were extremely close links.  Subordination was practically 
  5   entire between the Bosnian Serb authority and Serbian authority.  
  6   Later on, much later, there were some differences of view and a bit of 
  7   friction, but at the time we are talking about here, that is to say 
  8   when the war started, I think the subordination was entire.
  9   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Thank you.  No further questions.
 10   JUDGE RIAD:  Professor, I understand there was a sort of inconsistency 
 11   between two documents, No. 20 and No. 22, regarding the 
 12   Commander-in-Chief of the army in Exhibit 20. According to your 
 13   translation it says that the President will soon become the chief of 
 14   the army.  This is what you said I think.  Then you said that that 
 15   particular President was Mr. Karadzic.  Then later on in Exhibit 22 it 
 16   states that Mladic is the Commander-in-Chief of the army.  So, I 
 17   wonder whether there is a commander and a chief of the army.  The army 
 18   was under the authority of whom?
 19   A.   Well, I suppose that like in most countries in the world you have a 
 20   military commander of the army.  However, the head of state in its 
 21   capacity is also the commander of the army.  It is the same in France. 
 22    It is the same in many countries in the world.  So in the Serb 
 23   Republic of Bosnia they applied exactly the same principle.  You have 
 24   a military commander who has to report to the President of the 
 25   Republic.

  1   Q.   In this case then, in practical terms, in concrete terms, where did 
  2   the orders come from in this particular instance and according to your 
  3   knowledge?
  4   A.   I believe, well, you know, I am not a military expert, but I suppose 
  5   that as in many similar cases the general orders come from the 
  6   Presidency of the Republic, and as far as implementing  orders they 
  7   are taken by the military Commander.
  8   Q.   So there is a sort of hierarchy in the different orders?
  9   A.   Yes, indeed.  Yes indeed.  So the great strategy is designed by the 
 10   President.
 11   Q.   Now if you please, you have demonstrated that this was a logical 
 12   process in terms of ethnic cleansing and a plan that was implemented 
 13   in Croatia was also implemented in Bosnia in a systematic manner.  
 14   Since we are dealing with a strategy here, who was the master mind 
 15   behind this strategy?
 16   A.   I think that as regards Bosnia the main responsibilities were 
 17   incumbent upon Karadzic in general terms, but at the same time I 
 18   believe there was a very close tight team.  There were people, well, 
 19   as far as we can judge of course, there was a unity of view between 
 20   the main leaders whose names are known and we have seen them before 
 21   like Radovan Karadzic, Biljana Plavsic, Nikola Koljevic, Momcilo 
 22   Krajisnik, and many others.  All these people made up a very close 
 23   tie, General Mladic of course as well.  In general terms, all the 
 24   operations, and I include here what took place in Bosnia but also what 
 25   had taken place before in Croatia, I think that one of the master 

  1   minds, one of the main people, is Slobodan Milosevic.
  2   JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Professor.
  3   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Professor, we are not going to keep you much longer, 
  4   longer than is necessary, but before the end of your testimony we have 
  5   referred to the military role taken by Mr. Radovan Karadzic.  
  6   According to you, was there a political role played by General Mladic, 
  7   or was General Mladic only a military subordinate, at a very high 
  8   level of course, but did he have any political agenda?  Was there a 
  9   political career as regards Mr. Mladic which could explain a certain 
 10   number of  things.  I would like to get your view on that?
 11   A.   In the case of General Mladic, I think that he had his own strong 
 12   political convictions.  General Mladic for one before he was the 
 13   commander in Bosnia was a Commander in Croatia.  He in '91 was 
 14   Commander in Knin in Croatia, in this region where Serbs inhabited 
 15   that part of Croatia.  So General Mladic participated in the first 
 16   phase of the war and of ethnic cleansing that took place in Croatia in 
 17   '92, but also participated in the second stage in Bosnia from '92 
 18   through '95.  So he fulfilled, if you like, the same functions, 
 19   probably at a lower level of authority in Croatia, still he was 
 20   commanding. So undoubtedly he -- well, honestly, I do not know whether 
 21   we can make any difference between a military responsibility and a 
 22   political responsibility.  The two are closely tied.
 23   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Professor, I think the time has come to end your 
 24   testimony.  I have just one last question, if you please.  Have you 
 25   got the feeling that you were able to express your complete view 

  1   before this Tribunal?  I would have liked to ask you if there was 
  2   something you wanted to add beyond or outside the questions, or 
  3   something that was not covered by the Prosecutor's questions or our 
  4   questions?
  5   A.   No, your Honour, I have the feeling I was able to express myself 
  6   fully.  Sometimes some of the questions I am afraid I was not able to 
  7   completely answer.  I think I was in a position to answer some of the 
  8   questions expressing my own views, but I am afraid I am not sure if I 
  9   was able to sufficiently answer the questions, but sometimes I had the 
 10   sufficient documents to support my views.
 11   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you very much, Professor.  We are very 
 12   grateful for your long testimony, probably very tiring for  you.  Now 
 13   that we have completed your testimony we would like to thank you very 
 14   much.  Prosecutor, I think that we can usher out Professor Garde and 
 15   we could possibly introduce the following witness.  Thank you.
 16   		     (The witness withdrew).
 17   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecutor, it is 10 to 1.  We are going to try to 
 18   stick to our timetable.  So we are now going to introduce the 
 19   following witness and, if you please, we are going to start only with 
 20   preliminary questions with the witness at this stage.
 21   MR. HARMON:  That will be fine your Honour.  Your Honour, before we bring 
 22   in the next witness we have prepared three binders with exhibits for 
 23   the convenience of the court, so that it can follow the testimony of 
 24   Mr. Ralston who will be our next witness. Perhaps they can be sent up 
 25   to the court.

  1   		Mr. John Ralston, called.
  2   		Examined by Mr. Harmon.
  3   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, I will introduce the next witness in just a 
  4   moment.
  5   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes, Prosecutor.  We were just receiving the binder. 
  6    I think we are ready to listen.  We are going to turn to the witness. 
  7    Can he be given a head set, yes?  Can you hear yes?
  8   THE WITNESS:  Yes.
  9   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Very good.  Mr. Ralston, I think you are now going 
 10   to take your oath, as is the case for any witness.
 11   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, 
 12   the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
 13   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, please be seated.
 14   MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, before Mr. Ralston starts his  testimony, as 
 15   you are aware the Office of the Prosecutor has been conducting a 
 16   wide-ranging criminal investigation into the events in Bosnia and 
 17   Herzegovina.  In the course of these investigations we have collected 
 18   an enormous amount of evidence.  Mr. Ralston has been called to 
 19   testify today to describe some ----
 20   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:   Sorry.
 21   MR. HARMON:  Mr. Ralston has been called as a summary witness to describe 
 22   some but not all of the findings of the Office of the Prosecutor.  
 23   Obviously, this is an immense task in the short amount of time that 
 24   Mr. Ralston has to testify before this Court.  In order to provide the 
 25   Court with the most comprehensive answers on a wide-ranging 

  1   examination of subjects, Mr. Ralston has prepared written answers to 
  2   many of my questions.  He will be reading into the record some of his 
  3   answers to those questions.  I would propose, your Honours, that I 
  4   start the examination of Mr. Ralston by asking him questions about his 
  5   background and then we break, because I am going to go straight on 
  6   from there into a fairly large examination of the Serbian Democratic 
  7   Party.
  8   		So, if I could start by asking you, Mr. Ralston, to state your 
  9   name please and spell your last name for the record?
 10   A.   My full name is John Hunter Ralston, R-A-L-S-T-O-N.
 11   Q.   Are you employed by the Office of the Prosecutor?
 12   A.   Yes, I am.
 13   Q.   Before being employed by the Office of the Prosecutor, where were you 
 14   employed and what did you do?
 15   A.   I commenced in employment in 1972 as a Police Officer in Australia.  
 16   I worked as a Detective with the New South Wales police with the 
 17   Homicide Squad.  I then worked as a Senior  Project Officer with the 
 18   New South Wales Department of Consumer Affairs.  Later I worked for 
 19   the Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department as a senior investigator 
 20   in that Department's Nazi War Crimes Investigation Unit.  Following 
 21   that I worked with the National Crime Authority in Australia which is 
 22   the body responsible for investigating organised crime.  From that 
 23   position I came to the Office of the Prosecutor here in The Hague.
 24   Q.   How long have you been employed at the Office of the Prosecutor?
 25   A.   I have been employed with the Office of the Prosecutor since 16th 

  1   June 1994.
  2   Q.   What are your duties and responsibilities at the Office of the 
  3   Prosecutor?
  4   A.   I am an Investigations Commander with the Office of the Prosecutor.  
  5   Initially my duties were to lead an investigation team within the 
  6   Office, and from November 1995 I have held the position of 
  7   Investigating Commander.  My duties have involved the responsibility 
  8   for overall co-ordination of investigations in relation to Dr. Radovan 
  9   Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic.
 10   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, if the court wishes me to continue with my 
 11   examination I am prepared to do so.  Otherwise I will leave it to your 
 12   Honour's discretion.
 13   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, Prosecutor.  I think we are going to 
 14   stand in recess now until 2.30.
 15   (1.00 p.m.)
 16   (LuncheonAdjournment)       
 17   (2.30 p.m.) 
 18   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecuting counsel?
 19   MR. HARMON:  Thank you very much, your Honour.  The first subject that Mr. 
 20   Ralston will be testifying about is the Serbian Democratic Party, its 
 21   structure and evolution.  He will also describe for you Dr. Karadzic's 
 22   role in the party.  In the course of my examining Mr. Ralston, I will 
 23   be referring to the Serbian Democratic Party as the SDS.  So, Mr. 
 24   Ralston, let me turn to you and begin by asking you what is the SDS?
 25   A.   The SDS, a political party.  As a result of the November 1990 

  1   elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbian Democratic Party of 
  2   Bosnia-Herzegovina emerged as the dominant political force among the 
  3   Bosnian Serbs.
  4   		Of the 240 seats in the two chambers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
  5   Assembly, after the 1990 elections, the SDS won 72 or 30 per cent of 
  6   the seats, with the most of the rest of the seats going to the Muslim 
  7   SDA or the Croatian HDZ parties. Only about 15 per cent of the Serbian 
  8   members of the New Assembly were not members of the SDS (13 in total).
  9   Q.   Why is the SDS important in the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina?
 10   A.   The SDS is important because it became the political vehicle through 
 11   which Karadzic emerged as the paramount leader in the Bosnian Serb 
 12   administration.  Before the conflict started, it was the political 
 13   entity through which the majority Bosnian Serb political will was 
 14   exercised, and it remains so today.
 15   Q.   When was it established, Mr. Ralston?
 16   A.   The SDS was established at a conference in Sarajevo in July 1990. 
 17   Q.   Can you tell the court how it was established?
 18   A.   As I said, it was formed at a conference (attended by all prospective 
 19   members).  The conference adopted a "democratically inspired" 
 20   approach, and Karadzic welcomed into the ranks of the SDS all those, 
 21   including "democratically" oriented members of the League of 
 22   Communists, who accepted it.  The party was organised on the republic, 
 23   regional, sub-regional, municipal and local commune levels.  
 24   Committees at the regional level and below were to be autonomous in 
 25   regard to local political evaluations and personnel decisions.

  1   Q.   Was the SDS active throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina?
  2   A.   Yes, it was.  The party was established in eight regions, Bosanska 
  3   Krajina, Central Bosnia, Eastern Bosnia, Eastern Herzegovina, Northern 
  4   Bosnia, Western Bosnia, South-eastern Bosnia and Western Herzegovina. 
  5    The regions were divided into sub-regions, municipalities and local 
  6   areas.
  7   Q.   Could you please identify the leaders of the SDS before the conflict 
  8   started?
  9   A.   Leaders of the SDS included Dr. Radovan Karadzic, the President, 
 10   Aleksa Buha and Momcilo Krajisnik.
 11   Q.   Can you please explain if the SDS was well organised throughout 
 12   Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout -- I am sorry, before the war?
 13   A.   Our research indicates it was a well organised political body.
 14   Q.   Mr. Ralston, I think we lost you on the audio.
 15   A.   Our research indicates it was a well organised political party.
 16   Q.   Mr. Ralston, would you please refer to Exhibit No. 27 in your binder 
 17   as well as Exhibit No. 28?  I would ask you to  identify each of those 
 18   exhibits and explain the significance to the court.
 19   A.   Firstly, this document dated 15th August 1991 sets out operating 
 20   instructions.
 21   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Excuse me, prosecuting counsel, these documents have 
 22   not been translated into French, is that the case?
 23   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, they have not been, apparently.
 24   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  I would simply like to point out that the presiding 
 25   Judge happens to be French and I would just point out that French is 

  1   an official language of our Tribunal. I understand, in so far as 
  2   possible, the difficulties and we do have a limited number of 
  3   interpreters and I know that a lot of work has been done on this 
  4   score.  But, as far as the documents go that we received this morning, 
  5   along with Mr. Garde's documents this morning, they had been 
  6   translated, but I would just like to remind you that this is one of 
  7   the official languages of the Tribunal that we are talking about.  So 
  8   I would like this to be recorded in the transcript.  I would to ask 
  9   that, in so far as possible, we abide by this fundamental principle of 
 10   the Tribunal, that is to say, we have two official languages, English 
 11   and French.  Please continue, sir.
 12   MR. HARMON:  We apologise to your Honour for any convenience in not having 
 13   this document in French, but due to the translators working on the 
 14   previous documents, we were unable to complete all of the 
 15   translations.  (To the witness):  Mr. Ralston, would you please 
 16   continue with your testimony, please?
 17   A.   Yes.  As I was pointing out, this document dated 15th August 1991 to 
 18   all SDS municipal board sets out operating instructions for the 
 19   municipal boards. 
 20   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you also refer to Exhibit No. 28, please, and 
 21   explain to the court its significance?
 22   A.   I refer to this document again later in my testimony, but the 
 23   significance of the document, again it is addressed to all Presidents 
 24   of the municipalities.  It is dated 23rd March 1992. The main effect 
 25   of this document is setting out how the communications system would 

  1   operate, and setting out the organisation of communications systems 
  2   between the various municipalities, the SDS representatives there.
  3   Q.   Mr. Ralston, let me ask you, what were the goals of the SDS and what 
  4   was the position the SDS in the event of the SFRY disintegrated?
  5   A.   In his report to the founding conference, the party's new President, 
  6   Dr. Radovan Karadzic, decried what he saw as the unfavourable 
  7   economic, demographic and political position of the Serbian nation.  
  8   Recalling the genocide to which the Serbs had been subjected during 
  9   World War II, he claimed that they had continued genocide against 
 10   themselves when peace came, destroying their own national and cultural 
 11   identity by devoting themselves, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to 
 12   a system which seemed to have been created specifically for the 
 13   purpose of their national destruction.
 14   		The important part:  under these conditions Dr. Karadzic 
 15   stated the SDS was being created with its main goal as the complete 
 16   and unconditional civil, national, cultural, religious and economic 
 17   equality of the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Its most important 
 18   political goal was a federal Yugoslavia and within it a federal 
 19   Bosnia-Herzegovina. In case this should not be possible, Karadzic said 
 20   the goal of the SDS would be the enablement of democratic methods as 
 21   the  response of the Serbian people to any new situation.
 22   Q.   Mr. Ralston, did Dr. Karadzic ever express what would happen if 
 23   Bosnia declared independence and withdraw from the SFRY?
 24   A.   Yes, he did in a public statement to the Assembly of 
 25   Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Around midnight on 14/15th October 1991, he made 

  1   a speech from the podium during an address regarding moves towards 
  2   independence by the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
  3   This address provided an insight into probable SDS reaction to 
  4   independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
  5   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, a portion of this was described this morning in 
  6   the testimony of Professor Garde.  We have a film clip of that speech, 
  7   or a portion of that speech, which we would now like to present to the 
  8   court, so if we could please play Exhibit No. 29, clip 1?
  9   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecuting counsel -- well, the technician has 
 10   answered the Judge's question about this matter.
 11   MR. HARMON:  OK.
 12   		(Exhibit 29 was played)
 13   		Mr. Ralston, were non-Serbs allowed to join the SDS?
 14   A.   In theory, yes.  According to the party statutes, adopted on 12th 
 15   July 1990, membership in the party was open to all adult citizens of 
 16   Serbian nationality as well as members of other nationalities who 
 17   voluntarily accepted its programmes and statutes.  However, it must be 
 18   noted that the main point of the programme of the SDS at this time was 
 19   to remain in the SFRY, at a time when it was becoming increasingly 
 20   unattractive for other nationalities to do so.  This was at the time 
 21   Croatia and Slovenia were well on the road to independence.
 22   Q.   In the areas where the Bosnian Serbs did take control, were  
 23   non-Serbs required to pledge allegiance to the newly formed Bosnian 
 24   Serb state?
 25   A.   Yes.  In the areas where Serbs took control, non-Serbs were asked to 

  1   sign a pledge of allegiance to the Serbian authorities. Often this was 
  2   necessary to remain in their former positions. However, as our 
  3   investigations have shown, this pledge did not allow them to remain in 
  4   their positions for long.  Our research has shown that after a few 
  5   months they would have been summarily dismissed.
  6   Q.   Mr. Ralston, at the time the conflict started in Bosnia and 
  7   Herzegovina, was there any significant participation of non-Serbs in 
  8   the SDS?
  9   A.   No, judging by the names of these people, all the leading members 
 10   were either Serbs or Montenegrins.
 11   Q.   I would like to turn to a series of questions related to how the SDS 
 12   was structured.  Can you, please, inform the court how the SDS was 
 13   structured, Mr. Ralston?
 14   A.   The 1990 Statutes created the following central party organs:  the 
 15   Party Assembly, the Party President, the Main Board, the Executive 
 16   Board, the Supervisory Board and the Court of Honour.  In 1991, these 
 17   organs were all redesignated as the Assembly etc., of the SDS 
 18   Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Court of Honour was eliminated and a Statutes 
 19   Council and other Councils of the SDS Bosnia-Herzegovina were 
 20   simultaneously added. Radovan Karadzic was the Party President.
 21   Q.   Could you please explain to the court the purpose and functions of 
 22   the Assembly?
 23   A.   The Assembly was the highest party organ.  It was originally to 
 24   consist of all party members until their number exceeded a thousand, 
 25   after which the Main Board would devise a  principle of 

  1   representation.  The 1991 Draft Statutes supplied such a principle by 
  2   providing that the assemblies of municipal and city organisations 
  3   would send representatives, the total number of which was not to 
  4   exceed 300.
  5   Q.   How often was this Assembly supposed to meet?
  6   A.   The Assembly was to meet once a year.  Originally, only more frequent 
  7   meetings were to take place at the decision of the Main Board, but in 
  8   1991 it was stipulated that any decision on convening the Assembly was 
  9   to be made by the Main Board at the President's proposal.  At the same 
 10   time, the President was obligated to convene the Assembly at the 
 11   request of at least one third of all the representatives or 15 
 12   municipal organisations. The Assembly had to be convened by the 
 13   President or someone authorised by him.
 14   Q.   What were the functions of the Assembly?
 15   A.   The Assembly was responsible for adopting and amending the party 
 16   Programme and Statutes.  The other functions of the Assembly were of a 
 17   strictly organisational character.  The most important of these were 
 18   the election and recall of the President and the members of the Main 
 19   Board, Supervisory Board and Statutes Council.
 20   		It also had the final say in financial matters, including 
 21   fixing the amount of dues and the manner of their distribution.  The 
 22   Assembly thus only had an indirect influence on the party's policy and 
 23   day-to-day operations.  It was even empowered to transfer part of its 
 24   business to the President or the Main Board.
 25   		The Assembly which convened in July 1991 was the second and 

  1   last SDS Assembly before the outbreak of hostilities in 
  2   Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  3   Q.   Mr. Ralston, you mentioned earlier that the SDS created party 
  4   Presidency and that Dr. Karadzic was its President.  What was his 
  5   role?
  6   A.   The President, Karadzic, represented the SDS.  He could also 
  7   designate someone else to perform this function, although the 1991 
  8   Draft Statutes specified that this must be a member of the Main Board. 
  9    The President was in addition ex-officio chairman of the Main Board. 
 10    The term of office was originally set at two years but later extended 
 11   to four, with the right of re-election in either case.
 12   Q.   What were his responsibilities as the President of the SDS?
 13   A.   His responsibilities, or his most important responsibilities, were to 
 14   co-ordinate the work of the party organs, to see to the realisation of 
 15   the programmatic tasks and goals of the party and to represent the 
 16   party.
 17   Q.   Were his duties as President of the SDS ever expanded?
 18   A.   Yes.  In 1991 this list of rights was expanded to include making 
 19   political and other decisions in the name of the SDS 
 20   Bosnia-Herzegovina in so far as they are not within the competence of 
 21   other organs and bodies of the SDS Bosnia-Herzegovina, and performing 
 22   other matters which the Assembly of the SDS or the Main Board of the 
 23   SDS places within his competence and having, in extraordinary 
 24   situations within society, extraordinary powers within the competence 
 25   of the Assembly and the Main Board.

  1   		The President was responsible for his work to the membership, 
  2   to the Assembly and to the Main Board of the SDS.
  3   		His powers were accordingly considerable.  They were 
  4   susceptible of such broad extension in "extraordinary situations" as 
  5   to be practically open-ended, and in normal times  they were limited 
  6   only to the accession of authority in "other matters".  The President 
  7   had more than enough scope for initiative and independent action to 
  8   make him far and away the leading figure in the party.  His actual 
  9   power was thus likely to be a function of his only personality and 
 10   standing within the organisation.
 11   Q.   Mr. Ralston, did Dr. Karadzic insist on strong central control of the 
 12   SDS?
 13   A.   Yes, he did.  The need for their actions to be well planned and 
 14   controlled is apparent from his address to the Presidents of the SDS 
 15   controlled municipalities in a speech in November 1991 during the 
 16   campaign for the "Plebiscite of the Serbian People".
 17   Q.   Do you have a transcript of that speech, Mr. Ralston?
 18   A.   Yes, I do.
 19   MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, I would like to refer you to Exhibit No. 30 in 
 20   the binders.  Mr. Ralston, could you please read from that exhibit 
 21   relevant portions of the speech?
 22   A.   This is a lengthy document, but I will go to a paragraph towards the 
 23   end, part of the penultimate paragraph on page 10. In his speech, 
 24   among others things, Dr. Karadzic said:  "I am asking you to be 
 25   energetic and strict; to get ready and establish your authority in 

  1   your territories; in municipalities; regions, local communities, and 
  2   to prepare yourselves for restructuring and regionalising the 
  3   municipalities.  But I am begging you here, that you should in no 
  4   situation think that someone else has to do the job and that you leave 
  5   a job unfinished, but to control it to the very last moment.  To 
  6   control it to the very end, not to be sloppy and careless".
  7   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you also please to refer to Exhibit No. 28?  Can 
  8   you identify that document, please? 
  9   A.   Yes, this is the Exhibit I spoke about previously.  It is a document 
 10   addressed to the Presidents of the municipalities dated 23rd March 
 11   1992.
 12   Q.   Whose signature appears on that document?
 13   A.   Dr. Karadzic.
 14   Q.   Could you read to the court the relevant portions of that document?
 15   A.   Yes.  I will start midway, I will start with the second paragraph of 
 16   the document:  "Taking into consideration that one of the essential 
 17   conditions for the protection of Serbian people in the situation that 
 18   has been created requires rapid and timely transfer of data and 
 19   information relevant to defence and security, as well as transfer of 
 20   decisions, directions and instructions by the government bodies.  We 
 21   have established a Republic operation centre and decided that, in 
 22   addition to the regional centre in Banja Luka, the municipal centres 
 23   take over the function of regional centres; Sekovici for the 
 24   autonomous region of Bihac; Trebinje for the autonomous region of East 
 25   Herzegovina; Sokolac for Autonomous Region Romanija; Bijeljina, 

  1   Autonomous Region Semberija; also, a municipal centre ought to be 
  2   formed in the municipality of Petrovo which would take over the 
  3   function of the regional centre for the Autonomous Region North 
  4   Bosnia.  Regional centres in Banja Luka, Trebinje, Sokolac and 
  5   Bijeljina are already connected with the Republic centre of TT", I am 
  6   advised that that means telegraph and telephone,  "and radio 
  7   communications, while the regional centres of Sekovici and Petrovo 
  8   will be connected until March 26th 1992".
  9   		Taking that a bit further, the municipalities now face an 
 10   obligation to urgently connect their own information centres with the 
 11   regional centres, if it has not been done so far, and  provide for the 
 12   personnel and other requirements in order to monitor the situation in 
 13   the field.
 14   		Keeping in mind the current situation of the Republic, it is 
 15   necessary to co-operate with the SJB, which is the Public Security 
 16   Service, by providing the centres with a duty shift and ability to 
 17   convey and receive information 24 hours a day non-stop Saturdays and 
 18   Sundays".
 19   		Later in the same document he says:  "With regard to the 
 20   above, it would be useful if you personally inform yourself on the 
 21   state -- in the information centres in your municipality as well as on 
 22   their performance capability".
 23   Q.   What is the significance of that document, in your opinion, Mr. 
 24   Ralston?
 25   A.   The significance of that document, in my opinion, is it shows 

  1   planning, it shows co-ordination and provision for information to flow 
  2   both up and down from the highest levels of the SDS to the lowest 
  3   levels.
  4   Q.   OK.  Mr. Ralston, now let me turn to the Main Board.  You have 
  5   testified earlier that the SDS also established a Main Board.  Could 
  6   you please tell the court what that is?
  7   A.   The Main Board was the highest organ of the party between sessions of 
  8   the Assembly.  It was originally to have 57 members, including at 
  9   least two from each of the regions and one from each sub-region and 
 10   members were to be elected for two years with the right of 
 11   re-election.  However, in 1991 the size was reduced to 45 members, 
 12   elected from among the Assembly's representatives with account being 
 13   taken of territorial representation.  The term was increased to four 
 14   years with one third of members being eligible for re-election.
 15   Q.   What were the functions of the Main Board? 
 16   A.   According to the 1990 Statutes, the Main Board had numerous 
 17   functions, including the following:  electing the members of the 
 18   Executive Board of the Party; preparing drafts of all acts and 
 19   decisions which the Assembly adopts; adopting decisions which the 
 20   Assembly gives its authorisation for; seeing to the correct execution 
 21   of the Assembly decisions; electing members of temporary or 
 22   provisional Party bodies and preparing the electoral programme of the 
 23   Party.
 24   Q.   Were those functions ever expanded?
 25   A.   Yes.  In 1991 the Main Board was entrusted with "especially handling" 

  1   several matters including electing the chairman and two thirds of the 
  2   members of the Executive Board of the SDS Bosnia-Herzegovina; 
  3   preparing drafts of all acts, documents and decisions which the 
  4   Assembly of the SDS adopted; deciding on the territorial organisation 
  5   of the SDS; electing temporary and permanent working bodies and 
  6   commissions and establishing their competence; executing decisions of 
  7   the Assembly of the SDS; examining and adopting reports on the work of 
  8   the municipal and city boards; setting out guidelines and adopting 
  9   decisions for the work of the municipality and, as necessary, the 
 10   local boards of the SDS; to examine, as necessary, reports on the work 
 11   of organs and bodies of the SDS Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 12   Q.   Mr. Ralston, now I would like to turn your attention to another 
 13   component of the SDS, that is, the SDS Crisis Staff. Can you please 
 14   explain to the court what they were and what was their significance?
 15   A.   The Crisis Staff was an organ which was supposed to be established on 
 16   all levels of society in the SFRY in times of war or other serious 
 17   emergency in order to coordinate the security activities on that level 
 18   of society.  The SDS established  Serbian-controlled crisis staffs 
 19   outside the jurisdiction of the legitimate republic, municipal and 
 20   local commune authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 21   		This dramatically reduced the control of legitimate republic 
 22   authorities in Sarajevo, and significantly contributed to the 
 23   effective abolishment of legitimate government control altogether in a 
 24   high number of municipalities with a Serbian demographic and political 
 25   majority.

  1   Q.   Did the SDS establish Crisis Staffs in the areas that were taken 
  2   over?
  3   A.   Yes, Crisis Staffs were more or less established openly several 
  4   months before the war started in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the 
  5   headquarters of the SDS and in municipalities with Bosnian-Serb 
  6   political majority and control.  In Bosnian municipalities with a 
  7   non-Serbian majority, Crisis Staffs were normally established 
  8   underground by the SDS long before the armed conflict in 
  9   Bosnia-Herzegovina started, and when the Bosnian Serbs took power in 
 10   such municipalities the Crisis Staff surfaced as the supreme 
 11   co-ordinating organ of the municipality.  This happened, for example, 
 12   in Prijedor on 30th April 1992 and Kotor Varos on 11th June 1992.
 13   Q.   Can you, please, provide to the court some examples of how the SDS 
 14   operated in practice?
 15   A.   Yes, I will provide examples from Foca and Prijedor.  In Foca, when 
 16   the new national parties were formed, both the SDA, the predominantly 
 17   Muslim party, and the SDS held large rallies. The SDA rally was held 
 18   in August 1990 with the SDS rally coming two weeks later in September 
 19   1990.  Several persons who would later become key personnel in the 
 20   Bosnian Serb leadership attended the SDS rally.  Dr. Radovan Karadzic 
 21   and Biljana  Plavsic both attended, along with Vojislav Maksimovic, 
 22   Velibor Ostojic, Miro Stanic and Peko Cancar.
 23   		Maksimovic had been a teacher in Foca, later he became a 
 24   professor of literature at the University of Sarajevo, before becoming 
 25   the first president of the SDS Club of Deputies in the 

  1   Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly.  Velibor Ostojic, the current Minister of 
  2   Education and Information of "Republika Srpska" and the President of 
  3   the Executive Board of the SDS, was formerly Minister of Information 
  4   and an SDS Deputy from Foca.  Before the war he worked at the Sarajevo 
  5   radio and television station. Peko Cancar, a local attorney, was also 
  6   in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly.
  7   Q.   What was the local SDS's role in the Foca Municipal Assembly?
  8   A.   In the local Municipal Assembly in Foca, the SDS held about 30 seats 
  9   of a total of 70.  Prior to the takeover, the Serb members of the 
 10   local Assembly started boycotting assembly meetings in order to delay 
 11   decisions that had to be made on the municipal level.  Soon 
 12   thereafter, the SDS started to separate from all aspects of municipal 
 13   life and establish their own institutions.  Simultaneously, the Serbs 
 14   started to arm themselves with the support of the JNA.
 15   		After the parties were formed in 1990, Ostojic and Maksimovic 
 16   moved to Sarajevo, while Cancar remained in Foca.  As leading members 
 17   of the SDS, all three visited Foca several times to organise meetings 
 18   and make speeches.  In the beginning of April 1992, the three men 
 19   reportedly established a Serbian Crisis Staff and a Serbian Police 
 20   Force.  The head of the Crisis Staff, Miro Stanisic, was the President 
 21   of the SDS in Foca. Following the takeover, Karadzic was seen meeting 
 22   with  representatives of the Serbian Crisis Staff.
 23   		On 6th April 1992, Ostojic and Maksimovic reportedly held a 
 24   meeting of the SDS staff in the Orthodox Church in Foca; a meeting 
 25   which was also attended by a group of JNA officers. After that 

  1   meeting, an ultimatum was issued to the SDA district committee 
  2   representatives for the entire Muslim population of Foca to hand over 
  3   their weapons, gather under the escort of the Serbian army and police 
  4   and leave town.
  5   		After the takeover, Maksimovic and Ostojic were responsible 
  6   for arming the Serbian population in and around Foca, holding meetings 
  7   were local Serbian leaders and organising military training for 
  8   volunteers.  Speeches by Maksimovic and Ostojic were broadcast on the 
  9   local radio station. Coincidentally, a weeks before the attack on 
 10   Foca, one witness read a letter by Ostojic addressed to the SDS, 
 11   entitled:  "What to do in case of war".  The letter stated that the 
 12   radio station and then the police station should be taken over.
 13   Q.   How did the SDS operate in Prijedor, Mr. Ralston?
 14   A.   In the 1990 elections in Prijedor, the Muslim SDA won a plurality of 
 15   seats in the Prijedor municipal assembly. Nevertheless, during the 
 16   succeeding months, Bosnian Serb officials who had previously dominated 
 17   key positions in the municipality, resisted a reallocation of power 
 18   consistent with the electoral results.
 19   		In the spring of 1991, Serbian politicians in Banja Luka, the 
 20   regional centre approximately 45 kilometres from Prijedor, proclaimed 
 21   a separate Serbian regional community of municipalities which was 
 22   transformed into the autonomous region of Krajina in September 1991.  
 23   The municipalities in north western Bosnia, with the exception of 
 24   Prijedor, Sanski Most and  Kotor Varos, gradually decided to join the 
 25   community.  Late in 1991, Serbs in Prijedor and elsewhere in Bosnia 

  1   were directed by the central SDS leadership to assemble a shadow 
  2   government. Local Bosnian Serbs leaders were instructed to ensure 
  3   their ability to control all levels of municipal life, including 
  4   police, finance and communications and to ensure co-operation with the 
  5   JNA.
  6   Q.   When did the Bosnian Serbs seize power in Prijedor?
  7   A.   On 30th April 1992, the Serbs seized power in Prijedor and the Crisis 
  8   Staff of the municipality of Prijedor became the supreme power in the 
  9   municipality.  The Crisis Staff was made up of persons from the 
 10   military, the police, as well as the civil administration.  The most 
 11   powerful positions in the Crisis Staff were held by the SDS 
 12   leadership, the military and the police.
 13   Q.   Can you identify some of those members of the Prijedor SDS Crisis 
 14   Staff?
 15   A.   Yes.  Simo Miskovic was President of the SDS and head of the Crisis 
 16   Staff in Prijedor.  He was seen by a number of witnesses in the 
 17   detention camp, Omarska and Keraterm, during their operations.
 18   		Colonel (now General) Vladimir Arsic, a JNA officer before the 
 19   conflict in Prijedor, was appointed commander of the Prijedor 
 20   barracks.
 21   		Major Radmilo Zeljaja became the field commander for Colonel 
 22   Arsic and led many of the operations relating to ethnic cleansing in 
 23   the villages.  Zeljaja directed the attack against Kozarac, 
 24   participating in negotiations leading up to the attack and played a 
 25   leading role in the surrender of civilians from that town.  The name 

  1   of the town of Kozarac was later changed to Radmilovo, in honour of 
  2   Zeljaja's conquest.  Later, Zeljaja  visited the Omarska came with a 
  3   delegation of Serbs from Banja Luka and Prijedor in July 1992.
  4   		Major Slobodan Kuruzovic, a former school teacher, was a 
  5   member of the Crisis Staff and the Commander of the Trnopolje camp.  
  6   He also took part in rounding up of civilians living in villages on 
  7   the left bank of the Sana River in July 1992.
  8   		Simo Drljaca, another significant figure, became the Chief of 
  9   Police of the Prijedor municipality after the takeover.  Following the 
 10   takeover and arrest and detention of thousands of non-Serbs -- sorry, 
 11   became the Chief of Police following the takeover and arrest and 
 12   detention of thousands of non-Serb civilians.
 13   		Drljaca played a key role in the administration of the 
 14   detention camps and was repeatedly seen in all three detention camps 
 15   in the area, Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.  Since co-ordinating the 
 16   takeover of Prijedor, Drljaca was promoted to Deputy Minister of 
 17   Interior of the Bosnian Serb Republic.
 18   		Dr. Milomir Stakic unlawfully replaced Muhamed Cehajic as the 
 19   President of the municipality Prijedor after the take-over by Serbian 
 20   forces on 30th April 1992.  In interviews with the media, Stakic 
 21   acknowledged the existence of the camps at Omarska, Keraterm and 
 22   Trnopolje.  A number of persons saw Stakic visiting these camps during 
 23   their operations.
 24   		Srdo Srdic was an SDS Deputy in the Assembly of 
 25   Bosnia-Herzegovina and later in the "Republika Srpska" Assembly.  He 

  1   was also seen in the Omarska and Keraterm camps.
  2   MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, Mr. Ralston will now testify about the Bosnian 
  3   Serb administration and describe Dr. Karadzic's role and authority in 
  4   it.  (To the witness):  Mr. Ralston, when did the Bosnian Serb 
  5   administration come into existence? 
  6   A.   The Bosnian Serb entity has gone through different phases in its 
  7   evolution, culminating with the establishment of Republika Srpska.  
  8   Already on 21st December 1991, the Assembly of the Serbian people in 
  9   Bosnia-Herzegovina decided conditionally to establish the Republic of 
 10   Serbian Bosnia and Herzegovina before 14th January 1992.
 11   		On 9th January 1992, that Assembly adopted a declaration on 
 12   the proclamation of the Republic of the Serbian people of Bosnia and 
 13   Herzegovina.  The 28th February 1992 constitution adopted by the same 
 14   Assembly referred to the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
 15   and stated in its Article 3 that the entity was "a part of the federal 
 16   state of Yugoslavia".
 17   		The constitution entered into force on day of its adoption 
 18   according to its own implementation legislation.  Key legislation on 
 19   government, defence and internal affairs was also adopted on 28th 
 20   February 1992.  So by that date the foundation of the Bosnian Serb 
 21   legal infrastructure was in place, and during the following two to 
 22   three months the central administration entity was set up.
 23   		Vice Presidents, Biljana Plavsic and Nikola Koljevic 
 24   functioned as President of the entity between 28th February and the 
 25   time Karadzic became President.  On 12th August 1992 the entity change 

  1   its name to "Republika Srpska" or "the Republic of Srpska" which it 
  2   has gradually become known as.
  3   Q.   Mr. Ralston, has the investigation shown any relationship between the 
  4   leadership of the SDS and the leadership of the Bosnian Serb 
  5   administration?
  6   A.   Yes, it has.
  7   Q.   Would you please refer to Exhibit No. 31 and explain the  
  8   significance of Exhibit 31 to the court?
  9   A.   If you look at this Exhibit, we have on one side the structure of the 
 10   SDS and on the other side the structure of the administration of 
 11   Republika Srpska.  You will see in common, Radovan Karadzic is both 
 12   President of the SDS and also the President in the Presidency.  The 
 13   Main Board, you will see Aleksa Buha, member of the Main Board.  He 
 14   was also the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Assembly.  There is a 
 15   list of names of members of the Assembly; 14 of the members of the 
 16   Assembly were members of the Main Board.  I think from that you will 
 17   see it is a significant mirroring of power between the SDS leadership 
 18   and the leadership of the Bosnian Serb administration.
 19   Q.   Thank you, Mr. Ralston.  What was the role of Dr. Karadzic in the 
 20   newly formed Bosnian Serb administration?
 21   A.   Dr. Karadzic was the President.
 22   Q.   Did he retain his leadership role in the SDS after becoming the 
 23   President of the Bosnian Serb administration?
 24   A.   Yes, he did.
 25   Q.   When he became president of the Bosnian Serb administration, he was 

  1   vested with a number of powers.  Do you have some exhibits, Mr. 
  2   Ralston, that describe those powers? Specifically, let me refer you to 
  3   Exhibits No. 18 and 20, Exhibit 32 and Exhibit 33.
  4   A.   Yes.  I do not have 18 and 20 but I am familiar with those documents. 
  5    I have Exhibit 32.  I might add that Dr. Karadzic's position as the 
  6   leader gave him authority and control over both the civilian and 
  7   military administration.  This, in effect, gave him supreme authority 
  8   over the police, the Territorial Defence and the Bosnian Serb army.
  9   		In Exhibit No. 32, which is the law on National  Defence, if 
 10   you go to Article 6 of that Exhibit, it sets out, amongst other 
 11   things:  "The President of the Republic shall ensure unity and 
 12   indivisibility of the national defence system in the republic; 
 13   supervise the Territorial Defence both in peace and wartime".  It goes 
 14   on further to say:  "He shall issue orders for the utilization of the 
 15   police in the case of war".
 16   		If we go later to Article 39, I think it is, Article 39 sets 
 17   out:  "The President of the Republic shall order deployment of 
 18   Territorial Defence units for the maintenance of law and order in 
 19   cases of immediate peril of war and other emergency situations".
 20            If I now go to Exhibit 33, which is the law on internal affairs, 
 21   if you go to Article 25, Article 25 sets out, amongst others things:  
 22   "The President of the Republic shall evaluate the execution of the 
 23   work programme of the national security service on the basis of a 
 24   report by the Minister and shall inform the National Assembly 
 25   thereof".

  1   		Later in the same document, Article 33, it sets out that, "The 
  2   Ministry of Internal Affairs shall activate the reserve police in 
  3   emergency cases as ordered by the President of the Republic".
  4   Q.   Mr. Ralston, what was the effect of these legal documents that you 
  5   have just testified about?
  6   A.   The effect of these documents is that it gave Dr. Karadzic de jure 
  7   authority and control over all the official Serb forces in time of 
  8   war.
  9   Q.   In respect of those powers that you have described, can you provide 
 10   the court with some examples of his exercise of those powers?
 11   A.   Yes, I can.  He exercised those powers throughout the  conflict, an 
 12   example as late as July 1995, as reported in the media, Bosnian Serb 
 13   television prime news, set out:  "The President of the Republika 
 14   Srpska and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Dr. Radovan 
 15   Karadzic, has extraordinarily promoted Major General Milenko 
 16   Zivanovic, who until recently was the commander of the Drina Corps, 
 17   into the rank of Lieutenant General.  The Republika Srpska Bureau for 
 18   Press Contacts announced that General Zivanovic has been promoted due 
 19   to his retirement from active military service".
 20   		According to the announcement, President Karadzic has 
 21   appointed the recent Chief of Staff, Major General Radislav Krstic, as 
 22   the new commander of the Drina Corps who, together with General 
 23   Zivanovic, was a main architect of the Serbian victories in Srebrenica 
 24   and Zepa.  President Karadzic congratulated the VRS General Staff, the 
 25   Drina Corps command and the police staff within the armed forces on 

  1   their brilliant victories in Srebrenica and Zepa, as well as their 
  2   breaking down of the Muslim offensive on Serbian Sarajevo.
  3   Q.   Did Dr. Karadzic put the police and army under unified command?
  4   A.   Yes, he did.  He stated publicly that the army and the police were 
  5   put under a unified command.
  6   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, I would like to show the court now a film that 
  7   has been prepared in respect of the answer that Mr. Ralston just 
  8   provided.  If we could please play Exhibit No. 29, clip 2, please?
  9   		(Exhibit 29, clip 2, was played).
 10   		Mr. Ralston, as the Commander-in-Chief, had Dr. Karadzic 
 11   repeatedly backed the actions of his military commanders? 
 12   A.   Yes, he had.  I give you a June 1995 example:  Dr. Karadzic was 
 13   interviewed by the BBC in relation to the taking of UN peace keepers 
 14   as hostages earlier that month.  Dr. Karadzic said to the BBC that he 
 15   was wrong to approve the hostage taking of the UN peace keepers, but 
 16   he said it was a reasonable reaction to NATO air strikes.  "We had to 
 17   do something very drastic to prevent further strikes and to show the 
 18   international community that we are cornered and ready to defend 
 19   ourselves by all means. We function as a state, and I am 
 20   Commander-in-Chief, supreme Commander, and everything my army do, I do 
 21   back".
 22   Q.   Throughout the war, Mr. Ralston, has Dr. Karadzic been dealt with as 
 23   the leader of the Republika Srpska?
 24   A.   Yes, he has.  In the course of investigations conducted by the Office 
 25   of the Prosecutor, investigators and researchers have interviewed 

  1   various officials who have dealt with Dr. Karadzic since the beginning 
  2   of the conflict.  In addition, there has been extensive research of 
  3   documents and public statements made by Dr. Karadzic.  From the outset 
  4   he has repeated asserted his position as President of the Serbian 
  5   Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, or the leader of the 
  6   Bosnian Serb people.
  7   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, I would turn the court's attention to Exhibit 
  8   No. 34 which is an affidavit signed by Dr. Karadzic.  It is an 
  9   affidavit that was filed in a civil law suit in the United States, 
 10   Federal District Court.  In that particular exhibit you can see THAT 
 11   Dr. Karadzic asserts his position as President of the Republika 
 12   Srpska.
 13   		(To the witness):  Mr. Ralston, let me ask you then -- were 
 14   you going to show that document?
 15   A.   I was going to show that document.
 16    Q.   Please do.
 17   A.   I will read the relevant portion to the court.  "I, Radovan Karadzic, 
 18   state as follows:  I am the President of the Republic of Srpska".  It 
 19   goes on to describe when he was born.  In the third, the last sentence 
 20   of the third paragraph:  "I had not visited the United States for any 
 21   purpose since 1975 until after I became President of Republika Srpska 
 22   on May 13, 1992".
 23   Q.   Mr. Ralston, since the beginning of the conflict, Dr. Karadzic, as 
 24   the paramount leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has he been involved in 
 25   negotiations with the other parties to the conflict?

  1   A.   Yes, he has.  It must be recognised that many of these negotiations 
  2   were conducted by means of shuttle diplomacy, but I can provide some 
  3   examples of this.  On 24th January 1992, he attended a debate on a 
  4   referendum of independence.  The main people in the debate were Mr. 
  5   Izetbegovic for the SDA, Dr. Karadzic for the SDS and Mr. Kljuic for 
  6   the HDZ.
  7   		On 12th April 1992, he was involved in negotiations on a cease 
  8   fire in Sarajevo.  He agreed to the cease fire.  On 2nd June 1992, 
  9   Karadzic was involved in negotiations over the opening of Sarajevo 
 10   airport.  During 1992 and 1993, Dr. Karadzic participated in 
 11   negotiations conducted under the auspices of the national conference 
 12   for former Yugoslavia.
 13   		On 18th November 1993, he signed a joint declaration on 
 14   humanitarian assistance along with Mr. H. Silajdzic and Mr. M. Boban. 
 15    On 6th March 1994, he had a meeting with UNPROFOR officials 
 16   concerning an overall cease fire.  From 2nd to 6th June 1994, he was 
 17   involved in Geneva talks on the cessation of hostilities.  An 
 18   agreement was reached in those talks.
 19   		In December 1994, he was involved in negotiations on  cease 
 20   fire and cessation of hostilities with former US President, Jimmy 
 21   Carter.  An agreement was reached.
 22   Q.   Mr. Ralston, I would like to refer you to Exhibits 35, 36, 37, 38 and 
 23   39.  I will give you a moment just to get those exhibits.  Let me ask 
 24   you if you can identify each of those exhibits and explain to the 
 25   court the significance of those exhibits.

  1   A.   Exhibit 35 is a document signed by Mr. D. Kalinic,  "Representative 
  2   of Dr. Karadzic, President of the Serbian Democratic Party".  The 
  3   group of people mentioned in the document, a representative of the 
  4   Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a representative -- a further 
  5   representative of the SDS, a representative of the SDA and a 
  6   representative of the HDZ met in Geneva on 22nd May 1992 on 
  7   application or dealing with the "application and implementation of 
  8   international humanitarian law within the context of the conflict in 
  9   Bosnia and Herzegovina".  They reached an agreement in relation to 
 10   those topics.
 11   		Exhibit 36 is an agreement reached on 5th June 1992 on the 
 12   reopening of Sarajevo airport for humanitarian purposes. This exhibit 
 13   was signed by Dr. Karadzic.
 14   		Exhibit 37 is an instruction issued to Serbian forces around 
 15   the town of Gorazde to begin an immediate unilateral cease fire, again 
 16   signed by Dr. Karadzic on 16th July 1992.
 17   		Exhibit 38 is a joint declaration for humanitarian assistance 
 18   signed by Dr. Karadzic, Mr. Silajdzic, Mr. Boban.
 19   		Finally, Exhibit 39 is a cessation of hostilities agreement 
 20   which followed the negotiations with US President Carter -- US former 
 21   President Carter.
 22   Q.   You have described, Mr. Ralston, a broad range of  agreements that 
 23   were signed by Dr. Karadzic as the leader of the Republika Srpska; 
 24   were these agreements implemented, in fact?
 25   A.   Yes.  For example, the agreement on the reopening of Sarajevo airport 

  1   and the cessation of hostility agreement following the Carter 
  2   negotiations and also the agreement for one month's suspension of 
  3   military offensives following the Geneva conference in June 1994.
  4   Q.   Mr. Ralston, thank you for your testimony in regards to Dr. Karadzic. 
  5    I would now like to turn for a few minutes to the other person named 
  6   in the two indictments, General Mladic. Could you please tell the 
  7   court who he is and give a description of his background?
  8   A.   Yes.  General Mladic received his training at the military academy in 
  9   the former Yugoslavia and was a career JNA officer before he became 
 10   the commander of the Bosnian Serb army.  His first assignment as an 
 11   officer in November 1965 was as a platoon commander in Skopje, 
 12   Macedonia.
 13   		Between 1989 and 1991, Mladic served as the head of the 
 14   Education Department of the Third Military District.  From January 
 15   through June 1991, he was the Deputy Commander of the Pristina Corps 
 16   in Kosovo.
 17   		In June 1991, the JNA General Staff sent Mladic to Knin as 
 18   commander of the Knin Corps.  At the time the JNA was fighting various 
 19   Croatian forces.  Approximately two months after Mladic arrived in 
 20   Knin, the JNA promoted him to Brigadier General because of his combat 
 21   exploits.
 22   Q.   When did he leave the JNA and become the commander of the Bosnian 
 23   Serb army?
 24   A.   This occurred in the second half of April 1992.  General Mladic and 
 25   others were formed of this decision by the SFRY  Presidency. They were 

  1   told that they were reassigned from their present posts to new posts 
  2   at the command of the Second Military District, the Second Military 
  3   District centred in Sarajevo.
  4   		The new posts were as follows:  Major General Ratko Mladic was 
  5   appointed Chief of Staff of the Second Military District; Major 
  6   General Milan Gvero, assistant commander for morale and information; 
  7   Colonel Gruber, assistant commander for organisational and 
  8   mobilization and personnel issues, and the late General Djorde Dukic, 
  9   assistant commander for logistics. Shortly after these posts were 
 10   transferred to the Bosnian Serb army.
 11   		This information was confirmed by General Djorde Dukic in 
 12   interviews with representatives of the Ministry of Interior of 
 13   Bosnia-Herzegovina.  He stated to the authorities:  "I know that the 
 14   SFRY Government made a decision in May or June 1992 for all federal 
 15   reserves on the territory of Republika Srpska to be transferred to the 
 16   jurisdiction of the Government of Republika Srpska which was then 
 17   called Serbian Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 18   		"As regards the consolidation of units and the creation of the 
 19   Army of the Republika Srpska, I can state that almost all units of the 
 20   JNA had withdrawn from the territory of Republika Srpska by 19th May 
 21   1992, and by the end of June even the smallest groups had withdrawn.  
 22   These did not include individuals of Serbian nationality born on the 
 23   territory Bosnia and Herzegovina".
 24   Q.   That is a direct quote from General Dukic; is that correct?
 25   A.   That is correct.  At the time Mladic became the Commander of the 

  1   District, the commanding JNA Generals, Stankovic and Kukanjac, were 
  2   returned to Belgrade.
  3   Q.   What did General Mladic do when he received notice that the  JNA was 
  4   officially going to withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina?
  5   A.   Mladic in interview with a Knin magazine in Belgrade indicated that 
  6   he had received advance warning that the JNA was going to withdraw 
  7   officially from Bosnia-Herzegovina.  He immediately started to 
  8   establish his own command structure.  In the Knin magazine Mladic 
  9   described his efforts as follows:
 10   		"As soon as I took over duty in the Second Military District, 
 11   I set my aim at gathering people and establishing the Command and the 
 12   Main Staff, some from people of the Second Military District and some 
 13   from the people who had come with me from Knin and other areas, who 
 14   were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 15   		"As soon as the decision was made on 19th May 1992 for the JNA 
 16   to retreat from the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, we met at the highest 
 17   military and political levels and decided to establish the Serb Army 
 18   and the Main Staff.  The Army was founded at the Bosnian Serb Assembly 
 19   session in Banja Luka on 11th and 12th May.  I went to Banja Luka and 
 20   met with President Dr. Radovan Karadzic and his representatives.  They 
 21   told me that a decision was made for me to take over the duty of 
 22   Commander".
 23   Q.   Mr. Ralston, can you briefly describe to the court how the BSA was 
 24   structured and identify the relevant persons in it?
 25   A.   Yes.  I refer to Exhibit 40.  If you look at the structure, the 

  1   highest position in the army is General Ratko Mladic; immediately down 
  2   to him is his Deputy, Major Gvero.  Underneath General Mladic is his 
  3   main staff; Major General Milanovic is the Chief of Staff; Major 
  4   General Martic, the assistant commander for air defence; Lieutenant 
  5   General Dukic, assistant commander for logistics; Major General 
  6   Skrbic, assistant commander for mobilization and personnel and Major 
  7   General Zdravko Tolimir who is assistant commander for intelligence. 
  8   		Immediately also directly under General Mladic were the Corps 
  9   commands First Krajina Corps led by General Talic; Second Krajina 
 10   Corps led initially by General Boric and later General Tomanic; the 
 11   Third Krajina Corps, Colonel Lisica; the East Bosnia Corps, General 
 12   Simic; the Drina Corps, initially, General Zivanovic and then General 
 13   Krstic; the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps was initially commanded by General 
 14   Sipcic, later General Galic and then General Milosevic and the 
 15   Herzegovina Corps commanded by General Grubac.
 16   Q.   Mr. Ralston, let me ask you in respect of these Corps that you have 
 17   described, did they operate in specific geographic regions in 
 18   Bosnia-Herzegovina?
 19   A.   Yes, I refer you to the second part of this Exhibit.  You will see 
 20   here that the three Krajina Corps, the first, second and third, 
 21   operated in these districts; the East Bosnian Corps in this district, 
 22   the Drina Corps in this area here; the Herzegovina Corps here and 
 23   Sarajevo-Romanija Corps in this area here.
 24   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you explain the relationship between Dr. Karadzic, 
 25   the President of the Bosnian Serb administration, and General Mladic 

  1   who was the Commander of the Bosnian Serb army?
  2   A.   Dr. Karadzic was his supreme commander.  From interviews with former 
  3   UNPROFOR officials who, at various stages of the conflict were based 
  4   in Sarajevo, it is clear that from the outset Dr. Karadzic was the 
  5   political leader of the Bosnian Serbs and had control over the 
  6   military.  It is also clear that from as early as 14th May 1992, 
  7   General Ratko Mladic was in effective control of the military.  
  8   Although Mladic acted and thought independently and demonstrated 
  9   absolute control over his  troops, he would defer to Karadzic as the 
 10   overall leader.
 11   Q.   In addition to being the military commander, did he also represent 
 12   the Bosnian Serb administration in the negotiations?
 13   A.   Yes, he did.  He participated in negotiations and made agreements 
 14   principally in relation to military matters on issues such as 
 15   demilitarisation, cease fires and cessation of combat activities and 
 16   cessation of hostilities.
 17   Q.   Can you provide the court with some information about the types of 
 18   agreements he negotiated?
 19   A.   Yes, I can.  On 2nd June 1992, with Dr. Karadzic, he was involved in 
 20   negotiations on the agreement to open Sarajevo airport.  Bosnian Serb 
 21   forces under his control held the area around the airport.  This 
 22   agreement was subsequently signed and implemented.  On 5th June, Dr. 
 23   Karadzic and General Mladic were involved in negotiations with the 
 24   Bosnian Serb Presidency over the airport being placed under UN 
 25   control.

  1   		On 30th July 1993, Mladic was involved in negotiations with 
  2   General Briquemont, Generals Delic and Petkovic and defined an 
  3   agreement -- signed an agreement to define safe areas.  On 11th August 
  4   1993, Mladic signed an agreement with General -- sorry, on 14th 
  5   August, Mladic reached an agreement with General Briquemont concerning 
  6   Mount Igman and the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces.
  7   		On 8th February 1994, General Milovanovic, a representative of 
  8   General Mladic, met with General Sir Michael Rose in Lukavica to 
  9   discuss cease fire, withdrawal of heavy weapons and the subsequent 
 10   demilitarisation of Sarajevo. Milovanovic said that he had the full 
 11   authority from Karadzic and Mladic to agree to the principles of the 
 12   cease fire.  The following day, General Sir Michael Rose met with 
 13   Milovanovic who  agreed to a cease fire.  There was no document signed 
 14   but the cease fire held.
 15   		On 15th April 1994, negotiations between Rose and General 
 16   Mladic were held regarding Gorazde.  On 22nd April, General 
 17   Milovanovic signed an agreement on Gorazde.  The agreement was a 
 18   general cease fire.
 19   		There were also numerous meetings where his representatives 
 20   met with others and reached agreement on various issues, including 
 21   humanitarian convoys and anti-sniping.
 22   MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, we have provided in your binders Exhibits 41, 
 23   42, 43, 44 and 39.  I will not ask Mr. Ralston any questions about 
 24   these agreements, but these are examples of agreements that were 
 25   negotiated and signed by General Mladic.

  1   		Lastly, Mr. Ralston, let me ask you if the agreements which 
  2   were negotiated and signed by General Mladic were, in fact, 
  3   implemented?
  4   A.   Yes, they were.  The best example are the Sarajevo airport agreements 
  5   and the agreements following the Carter negotiations.
  6   Q.   Thank you for your description and your testimony about General 
  7   Mladic.  I would like to turn to another subject now, Mr. Ralston.  I 
  8   would like to turn your attention to the conflict in Bosnia and 
  9   Herzegovina starting in 1992.
 10   		Was the occupation and control of the territory of the 
 11   Republic of Bosnia by the Bosnian Serbs well planned and executed, in 
 12   your opinion?
 13   A.   Yes, it was.  The occupation and control of territory of the Republic 
 14   of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the self-styled "Republika Srpska" was 
 15   well-planned and co-ordinated.  The planning by the Bosnian Serb 
 16   political leaders of the SDS and others was executed in coordination 
 17   with the military and  paramilitary forces, the police and local 
 18   Bosnian Serbs.  The goal was to secure complete control over the 
 19   territory which they considered to be Serbian in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 20   Q.   Mr. Ralston, has the investigation revealed any patterns of 
 21   pre-takeover and post-takeover conduct by the Bosnian Serb forces 
 22   under the direction and control of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic?
 23   A.   Yes.  In those portions of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
 24   controlled by the Bosnian Serbs, a consistent pattern of pre- takeover 
 25   and post-takeover conduct emerged. This pattern reflect a high degree 

  1   of central control and planning by those responsible for the 
  2   take-over.
  3   		In areas where the Bosnian Serbs represented a large majority 
  4   of the population, control was achieved quickly and with limited use 
  5   of force.  In other areas, where Bosnian Serbs did not have such a 
  6   majority, it was achieved by the use of substantial force, including 
  7   heavy shelling of villages and towns follow by infantry attack.
  8   		In either case, what followed for the non-Serb population was 
  9   brutal and swift repression and persecution on discriminatory grounds. 
 10    Thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats were rounded up, 
 11   detained in internment facilities run by the Bosnian Serb military, 
 12   the police or both.
 13   		The conditions in these facilities were brutal -- detainees 
 14   were murdered, tortured, physically abused, raped and sexually 
 15   assaulted.  Daily food rations and hygienic conditions were grossly 
 16   inadequate.  For those non-Serbs who did not end up in the detention 
 17   facilities, life in their communities included systematic dismissal 
 18   from employment, restraint on freedom of movement, appropriation of 
 19   property, destruction of their homes  and businesses, physical abuse, 
 20   including murder, rape, and torture, arbitrary arrest, deportation and 
 21   other conditions that made remaining in their homes precarious at 
 22   best.  Muslim and catholic places of worship have been damaged or 
 23   destroyed in significant numbers throughout the occupied territories 
 24   as well.
 25   		These patterns I have described have been substantiated by 

  1   in-depth investigations conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor in 
  2   regard to the Bosnian Serb takeovers that occurred in the 
  3   municipalities of Sarajevo, Foca, Bosanski Samac, Vlasenica, Brcko and 
  4   Prijedor.  The patterns are further supported by information provided 
  5   to the OTP in relation to events that occurred in Kotor Varos, 
  6   Bijeljina, Zvornik and other areas.
  7   		Throughout the conflict, tactics used by the Bosnian Serb 
  8   military have included both indiscriminate and direct targeting of 
  9   civilians.  The siege of Sarajevo typifies these tactics.  Since the 
 10   beginning of the siege, civilians in that city were subjected to 
 11   indiscriminate fire by weapons such as mortars, rockets and artillery 
 12   as well as a systematic sniper campaign that has resulted in a high 
 13   number of casualities".
 14   Q.   Mr. Ralston, before the war started in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in 
 15   the territory that is now occupied by the Bosnian Serbs, were there 
 16   municipalities where the Bosnian Serbs represented a minority of the 
 17   population?
 18   A.   Yes, as is well known, the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
 19   before the conflict consisted largely of five national groups, 
 20   Serbians, Croatians, Muslims, Yugoslavs and others.  Whilst over half 
 21   of the municipalities in the area claimed by the Bosnian Serbs had a 
 22   Serbian majority, many did  not.
 23   MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, Exhibit No. 45 in your binders is a summary of 
 24   the 1991 census, and it will substantiate what Mr. Ralston has just 
 25   testified about.

  1   		Mr. Ralston, I would like you to please turn to Exhibit No. 46 
  2   and ask you to identify and explain to the court what it represents?
  3   A.   This map shows you, firstly, confrontation line as at July 1995.  
  4   Behind that confrontation line is largely the area which was 
  5   controlled by the Bosnian Serbs.  The areas in pink are the areas 
  6   which had -----
  7   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:   I am very sorry.  Maybe we could turn down the 
  8   lights just a little bit because it is hard really to see what is on 
  9   the map, so if that were possible?  If we could just dim the light a 
 10   little bit?  We all have the same problem indeed.
 11   THE WITNESS:   I will repeat what I have just said.
 12   MR. HARMON:  Wait just a minute until the lights are dimmed, Mr. Ralston. 
 13    All right.  Mr. Ralston, please proceed with your explanation.
 14   A.   As I say, the green line roughly marks the confrontation line as of 
 15   July 1995.  The areas in behind that line are the areas which are 
 16   controlled by the Bosnian Serbs.  Now, the areas shaded in pink are 
 17   the areas that as in the 1991 census showed a non-Serb majority 
 18   population.
 19   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you now turn to Exhibit No. 47, identify it and 
 20   explain its significance to the court?
 21   A.   Exhibit 47 is a document which is headed "Serbian Democratic Party 
 22   Bosnia-Herzegovina, Main Committee, strictly confidential".  It is 
 23   instructions for the organisation and  activities of the organs of the 
 24   Serb people in Bosnia-Herzegovina in a state of emergency.
 25   		The significance of this document is on 19th December 1991 a 

  1   special Crisis Staff of the SDS issued these "strictly confidential" 
  2   instructions.  Noting that certain forces were working to take 
  3   Bosnia-Herzegovina out of Yugoslavia by force, the Crisis Staff saw 
  4   the necessity for working out "unified tasks, measures and other 
  5   activities" for the purposes of carrying out the decision of the 
  6   Bosnian Serb plebiscite as well as in other circumstances which might 
  7   arise in the development of the political and security situation.
  8   		The instructions provided for the conduct of specified in all 
  9   municipalities in which Serbs lived.  This was to occur in two 
 10   variants depending on whether Serbs formed majority (Variant A) or not 
 11   (Variant B).  In both variants, the municipal committee of the SDS was 
 12   to admittedly form a Crisis Staff composed of all members of the 
 13   secretariat of the communal committee of the SDS, leading communal 
 14   officials or SDS candidates for those positions (chairman of the 
 15   Assembly or of the Executive Committee, chief of the public security 
 16   or militia station, Commander of the Territorial Defence staff, 
 17   secretary of the secretariat of National Defence), deputies to the 
 18   Assembly of the Serbian people and local members of the Main Committee 
 19   of the SDS.
 20   		The commander of the Crisis Staff was to be the chairman of 
 21   the communal assembly/executive committee (Variant A) or the chairman 
 22   of the communal committee of the SDS (Variant B).  The Crisis Staffs 
 23   were responsible for monitoring the political situation in the 
 24   municipality and making preparations to take over all governmental 
 25   functions, including the gathering  of supplies in secret depots and 

  1   mobilisation of men into the police, Territorial Defence and the JNA.
  2   Q.   The significance of this document, Mr. Ralston?
  3   A.   This document contains a number of instructions on the organisation 
  4   and activities of Bosnian Serbs and the municipal and Local Commune 
  5   levels.  The instructions were given by the Crisis Staff of the SDS.  
  6   The instructions would basically prepare the Bosnian Serbs for war on 
  7   the municipal and commune levels.
  8   Q.   Mr. Ralston, you mentioned earlier that the Office of the Prosecutor 
  9   has conducted in-depth investigations in certain municipalities.  Can 
 10   you identify those municipalities?
 11   A.   Yes.  Sarajevo, Foca, Bosanski Samac, Vlasenica, Brcko and Prijedor.
 12   Q.   Can you inform the court what the strategic significance of those 
 13   municipalities is?
 14   A.   Yes, I can.
 15   MR. HARMON:  Perhaps we need the lights dimmed once again, your Honour?
 16   A.   Firstly, the municipalities of Foca, Bosanski Samac, Vlasenica, Brcko 
 17   and Prijedor all had substantial non-Serb majority population.  If you 
 18   look at the map of Bosnia-Herzegovina, firstly, you will notice that 
 19   the terrain is extremely rugged.  Because of the ruggedness of this 
 20   terrain, the transport thoroughfares were particularly significant.
 21   		If you look at Foca, you will see that it stands at the 
 22   junction of the major highway which connects between Montenegro and 
 23   Belgrade, Herzegovina and the coast.  If you go to Brcko, sorry, to 
 24   Vlasenica, you will see that Vlasenica is the main road and rail link 
 25   between Serbia and Sarajevo.  The  rail link comes to the border and 

  1   then there is the road link through Vlasenica to Sarajevo.
  2   		Brcko stands in probably the most critical area for the 
  3   Bosnian Serbs.  This area, as I said, was a non-Serb majority area, 
  4   but it was through this road network here that Serbs in Eastern Bosnia 
  5   and Serbia could connect with Serbs in Western Bosnia and the parts of 
  6   Croatian Krajina which at that stage were controlled by the Serbs.  So 
  7   it is a complete -- it is a very significant military objective.
  8   		If you come across just a little bit further to Bosanski Samac 
  9   which is about here, it also stood on the edge of the Posavina 
 10   corridor, which is the area through Brcko, and the same road and rail 
 11   links.  If you come across to Prijedor, you will notice that the rail 
 12   link between the east Serbia and the western areas go straight through 
 13   Prijedor, as does the major highway.
 14   		So, for each of these municipalities, in addition to being 
 15   predominantly non-Serbs surrounded by Serb controlled areas, they were 
 16   also particularly important because of the transport thoroughfares 
 17   that went through them.
 18   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you turn to Exhibit No. 49 as well and put that on 
 19   the screen?  Mr. Ralston, after the war started, can you tell me what 
 20   happened in the municipality that you have just described?
 21   A.   As I said, these were particularly significant municipalities, and 
 22   you can see that each of these municipalities was taken over by the 
 23   Serbs very early in the conflict, Foca on 6th April, Bosanski Samac on 
 24   17th April, Brcko  -- sorry, then Vlasenica on 21st April and then, 
 25   finally, Prijedor on 25th May. 

  1   Q.   You have mentioned that the Office of the Prosecutor has conducted 
  2   in-depth investigations in many of those municipalities.  Could you 
  3   please describe to the court what happened in Sarajevo?
  4   A.   Yes, I can.  Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Before 
  5   the conflict, Sarajevo had developed as a flourishing multi-ethnic 
  6   city.  On 5th April, following demonstrations and peace marches, 
  7   fighting broke out with gun fire and explosions heard throughout the 
  8   city.  On 6th April, sniper fire was reported originating from the 
  9   Holiday Inn near the centre of the city.  The Holiday Inn at that time 
 10   was the headquarters of the SDS party and was occupied -----
 11   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:   I am sorry to interrupt you, but perhaps before 
 12   discussing Sarajevo, we could proceed to a recess, unless there is a 
 13   very short answer, but I have the feeling that we are being to be 
 14   talking about this for sometime so maybe we could have a recess first. 
 15    As it is 4 o'clock, it would be a good time.  I am very sorry, Mr. 
 16   Ralston, to interrupt you.  So the session is adjourned until 4.15.
 17   (4.00 p.m.)
 18   		(The court adjourned for a short time)
 19   (4.20 p.m.)
 20   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  First, I would like to turn to the Prosecutor and I 
 21   would like to inform him that the Chamber accepts the documents you 
 22   tendered so far as exhibits.  We will make sure that we do the same 
 23   for the forthcoming exhibits.
 24   		Still dealing with some concrete or material problems, I was 
 25   told by the interpreters that they find it difficult hearing the 

  1   Prosecutor because he stands up far away from the microphone.  These 
  2   may be sound like a small problem, and yet  they make the 
  3   interpreters' work more difficult.  So when the presiding Judge makes 
  4   the interpreters' job difficult, he apologises, he does whatever he 
  5   can.  Now it turns out that the Judges have nothing to do with that.
  6   		Apparently, these problems have been mentioned since the 
  7   opening of the Tadic case.  It is probably a technical thing that can 
  8   probably easily be fixed, but it appears that if you have to bend over 
  9   it will be very difficult for you, Prosecutor.  But, anyway, we simply 
 10   wanted to point out that we should make sure to have the appropriate 
 11   working conditions for everybody.  As far as the Judges are concerned, 
 12   all conditions are very good, but that should apply to everybody.
 13   		So I will ask the representatives of the Registry to make sure 
 14   that if it does not involve too much work, could that be fixed as soon 
 15   as possible?  I am speaking here on behalf of Mrs. MacDonald who is 
 16   the Presiding Judge for the Tadic case and on our behalf.  So, 
 17   Prosecutor, I think we can resume now.
 18   MR. HARMON:  Thank you very much, your Honour.  (To the witness): When we 
 19   had left off, Mr. Ralston, I had asked you whether or not the Office 
 20   of the Prosecutor had conducted in-depth investigations in certain 
 21   municipalities and you answered that they had and you had identified 
 22   those municipalities.  My next question was to ask you what had 
 23   happened in those municipalities.  You started out with a description 
 24   and a brief summary of what occurred in Sarajevo. Could you please 
 25   continue your answer as to what occurred in Sarajevo?

  1   A.   Yes, I will, I will repeat the last couple of sentences that I said. 
  2    Before the conflict, Sarajevo had developed as a flourishing 
  3   multi-ethnic city.  On 6th April 1992, sniper fire  was reported 
  4   originating from the Holiday Inn near the centre of the city.  The 
  5   Holiday Inn at that time was the headquarters of the SDS party, and 
  6   was occupied by party officials and body guards, as well as a number 
  7   of international journalists and UNPROFOR members.
  8   		A number of people were killed and injured by this initial 
  9   fire.  The following day, 7th April 1992, the Republic of Bosnia and 
 10   Herzegovina was recognised as an independent state by the European 
 11   Community and the United States.  From May 1992 until the end of the 
 12   conflict, Sarajevo was subjected to a siege by the Bosnian Serb 
 13   forces.
 14   		During the siege, the civilian population suffered greatly 
 15   from the continued and systematic sniper attacks by Bosnian Serb 
 16   forces and from the indiscriminate and intensive use of mortar and 
 17   artillery fire.  As a result, thousands of civilians, regardless of 
 18   age or gender, have been killed or injured.  Shelling attacks have 
 19   directly targeted civilians engaged in clearly non-combat activities. 
 20    Hospitals, cemeteries and cultural buildings have regularly been 
 21   targeted, as have the personnel and property of humanitarian aid and 
 22   peacekeeping bodies.
 23   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you please summarise what our investigations have 
 24   shown in relation to the municipality of Foca?
 25   A.   Yes, Foca municipality, as I indicated previously, was an area which 

  1   had a majority non-Serb population.  According to the 1991 census, of 
  2   the population of 40,513, 51.6 per cent were Muslim, 45.3 per cent 
  3   Serb and 3.1 per cent classified as "others".
  4   		The political and military takeover of Foca started in  early 
  5   April.  The first military actions in the town were reported on 6th 
  6   April 1992 when Serbian military units took over Foca section by 
  7   section.  The occupation of the town of Foca was complete by 16th or 
  8   17th April.  The surrounding villages were under siege until some time 
  9   in July 1992 before they were also overtaken.
 10   		During an after the takeover, a number of the non-Serb 
 11   population were detained, interrogated, beaten and held in inhumane 
 12   conditions in detention facilities run by the Serbian authorities.  
 13   Women were separated from the men and were held in different detention 
 14   centres where rapes were frequently committed by guards and other 
 15   Serbs.  Later, many of the non-Serbs were taken from these facilities 
 16   and exchanged in so-called "prisoner exchanges" or deported, mainly to 
 17   Montenegro.  Many non-Serbian residents were murdered.
 18   		During the months after the takeover, the living conditions, 
 19   including the fear of being killed, became so unbearable that many 
 20   non-Serbs, who had managed to avoid detention, decided to leave the 
 21   area.  Those people who left were forced to sign papers saying they 
 22   were leaving Foca of their own volition and that they were voluntarily 
 23   handing over all their possessions to the Serb authorities.  By 
 24   admission of the Serbian authorities, as of August 1993, there were 
 25   only nine Muslims left in Foca.

  1   Q.   Mr. Ralston, would you please describe what the Office of the 
  2   Prosecutor's investigations have shown in Bosanski Samac?
  3   A.   Yes.  Bosanski Samac, as you will recall, was at the edge of the 
  4   Posavina corridor.  Before the war, the population of Bosanski Samac 
  5   was made up almost evenly divided between Croats and Serbs, with 
  6   Muslims making up a small minority.  According  to the 1991 census, 
  7   the municipality had a total population of 32,835 people, of whom 45 
  8   per cent were Croats, 41 per cent Serbs, 7 per cent Muslims and 7 per 
  9   cent "others".
 10   		Before the war, most of the Croatian residents lived in 
 11   several predominantly Croatian outlying villages.  Muslims constituted 
 12   the majority in the town of Bosanski Samac, and there were some 
 13   villages with ethnically mixed populations.
 14   		Early on the morning of 17th April 1992, Serbian military 
 15   forces seized control of Bosanski Samac.  Shortly after the attack 
 16   members of these units went from house to house with lists of 
 17   non-Serbian residents and ordered all non-Serbs to turn in their 
 18   weapons.  Irregular forces swept through the town looting homes.  Some 
 19   homes, community buildings and villages were destroyed.  Many 
 20   non-Serbs were immediately arrested and detained in detention 
 21   facilities set up in several different locations around the town of 
 22   Bosanski Samac, including one in the local police station.
 23   		In those detention facilities, beatings and mistreatment were 
 24   a daily occurrence.  Some of the detainees were killed, others were 
 25   subjected to humiliating sexual assaults.

  1   		Overnight, Bosnian Serbs took control of all businesses and 
  2   government offices, and assumed all positions of authority.  As it 
  3   occurred hundreds of kilometres away in Foca, the Serbian authorities 
  4   proceeded to reduce the civilian non-Serbian population by imposing 
  5   brutal conditions.  Non-Serbs were arrested, detained, beaten, 
  6   tortured, murdered and humiliated.  Those not arrested or detained 
  7   lived in fear, under such oppressive conditions, that many chose to 
  8   leave the area to escape the intolerable situation. 
  9   		Many civilians were used in "prisoner exchanges".  By March 
 10   1995 it was estimated that about 10 Croats and 250 Muslims remained in 
 11   the municipality.  As of July 1995, 98 per cent of the non-Serb 
 12   population had either left or been deported.
 13   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you summarise for the court what the Prosecutor's 
 14   investigations have shown in relation to the municipality of 
 15   Vlasenica?
 16   A.   Yes.  With regard to Vlasenica, again non-Serbs were the majority 
 17   population.  The municipality had approximately 33,817 citizens, of 
 18   whom approximately 55 per cent were Muslim, 43 per cent Serb and 2 per 
 19   cent described as "other".  The town of Vlasenica is located in the 
 20   municipality of the same name.  In 1991, the town of Vlasenica had 
 21   approximately 7,500 citizens, of whom approximately 4,800 or 64 per 
 22   cent were Muslim.
 23   		In the months leading up to the takeover of the municipality 
 24   of Vlasenica, there was considerable tension between Bosnian Serb and 
 25   non-Serbian officials.  The tension related primarily to SDS demands 

  1   for various forms of political control.  Ultimately, the SDS demanded 
  2   that Vlasenica be divided into Serbian and non-Serbian areas.  
  3   Significantly, just before the takeover, Serbs had begun to set up a 
  4   separate administration and police force.  Serbian paramilitary groups 
  5   moved into the area and the Muslim population was ordered to hand over 
  6   their weapons.
  7   		On 21st April 1992, the Bosnian Serb takeover of Vlasenica was 
  8   effected by members of the Novi Sad Corps of the JNA assisted by 
  9   paramilitary units.  Following the takeover of the town of Vlasenica, 
 10   the remaining Muslim villages in the municipality were also captured 
 11   and civilians were arrested, mistreated, detained in camps or 
 12   deported.  Many of the  civilians' homes were destroyed.
 13   		After the takeover, detention warrants and criminal charges 
 14   were drawn up against the Muslim leaders and SDS members of the area 
 15   -- SDA members of the area, I am sorry , but by that time 95 per cent 
 16   of the Muslim officials had fled.  On the day of the takeover of the 
 17   town of Vlasenica, Serbs in a police car forced a Muslim religious 
 18   leader to give an ultimatum to the non-Serb population in which they 
 19   were instructed to hand over all weapons.
 20   		During and after the takeover, non-Serbian villages were 
 21   attacked and the Muslim residents rounded up and detained. In 
 22   addition, the Serbian forces destroyed and looted much of the Muslim 
 23   property.
 24   		Once the civilians were detained, the men and women were 
 25   separated.  The women were deported and the men were detained for 

  1   extended periods of time in inhumane conditions. The men were 
  2   interrogated and beaten for no apparent reason. After being released 
  3   from detention, some of the men were used for "prisoners exchanges".  
  4   Many of the civilians detained were subsequently sent to the Batkovic 
  5   camp in north east Bosnia where they were detained for lengthy 
  6   periods.
  7   		Most of Muslim women, driven by fear, were compelled to sign 
  8   documents stating they were leaving the area of their own free will.  
  9   Prior to leaving, however, the people had to obtain permission to 
 10   leave from the Serbian run Crisis Staff and had to sign over all their 
 11   property to the Serbs.
 12   Q.   Mr. Ralston, did similar events occur in Brcko?
 13   A.   Yes, they did.  In Brcko, the population was approximately 87,000 
 14   with 43,000 inhabitants residing in the town of Brcko itself.  The 
 15   population of the municipality was 45 per cent  Muslim; 20.7 per cent 
 16   Serb; 25.9 per cent Croat; 5.5 per cent Yugoslav and 3 per cent 
 17   "other".  So it can be seen that the Serbian population was the 
 18   significant minority in this area. However, as I have previously 
 19   stated, control of this area was vital to the Bosnian Serb programme.
 20   		The war in Brcko began in the early morning of 30th April 
 21   1992, when powerful explosions destroyed the two bridges across the 
 22   Sava River.  Immediately thereafter, the SDS Crisis Staff assumed 
 23   power in the municipality.  On 1st May 1992, the post office, radio 
 24   and television stations and the police station were taken over by 
 25   soldiers wearing the uniform of the JNA.  Residents who tried to leave 

  1   the town were turned back at checkpoints manned by Serbian soldiers 
  2   and paramilitary soldiers known as Arkanovci or Seseljevci, which were 
  3   controlled by Zeljko Raznjatovic "Arkan" and Vojislav Seselj 
  4   respectively.
  5   		On 2nd May 1992, shooting began in the predominantly Muslim 
  6   neighbourhoods of Dizdarusa, Kolobara and Klanac as Muslim fighters 
  7   organised a resistance to the Serbian soldiers in the town.  An 
  8   artillery bombardment began in the Muslim neighbourhoods and residents 
  9   sought shelter in the basements of their homes.  Houses were damaged 
 10   severely as a result of the shelling.
 11   		On 3rd May 1992, Serbian soldiers began moving through the 
 12   city, forcing residents to leave their homes and to "evacuate to safe 
 13   areas".  Muslim and Croat residents were separated from Serbs and 
 14   taken to collection centres.  Women, children and the elderly were 
 15   separated from the men and bused out of Brcko to Brezevo Polje, a 
 16   village a few kilometres east of the town of Brcko.  While at the 
 17   collection centres, Muslims and Croats were subjected to verbal 
 18   harassment, physical  beatings and some were killed.
 19   		A large percentage of the non-Serbian male population was 
 20   detained at the Luka camp in the town of Brcko where beatings, torture 
 21   and murder were common place.  The camp authorities executed detainees 
 22   on a systematic basis during the first weeks of Luka's operation.  In 
 23   July, all male detainees were bused to the nearby Batkovic detention 
 24   camp.  Other non-Serbian males, who had previously been detained and 
 25   released, were later re-arrested and also taken to Batkovic.  As a 

  1   result of the climate of fear and terror created by the Serbian 
  2   actions, the overwhelming majority of non-Serbian residents who were 
  3   not killed or detained left the area by any means possible.
  4   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you describe what the Prosecutor's investigations 
  5   have shown in relation to Prijedor?
  6   A.   Yes.  The Prosecutor's office has conducted extensive investigations 
  7   in relation to events in the Prijedor area. Prijedor, before May 1991, 
  8   was almost evenly divided between Muslims and Serbs.  According to the 
  9   1991 census, the municipality had a total population of 112,470 
 10   people, of whom 44 per cent were Muslim, 42.5 per cent Serb, 5.6 per 
 11   cent Croats, 5.7 per cent Yugoslav and 2.2 per cent described as 
 12   "others".  I am told the "others" are often made up of Ukrainians, 
 13   Russians and Italians.
 14   		On 30th April 1992, Bosnian Serb forces seized power in the 
 15   town of Prijedor.  There was no meaningful resistance, as non-Serb 
 16   police surrendered their arms to their Serbian colleagues.  The 
 17   following morning, Serbian flags flew from all official buildings and 
 18   Radio Prijedor broadcast that Serbs had taken over the municipality, 
 19   which was henceforth to be called  "Serbian Municipality Prijedor".
 20   		Over the next three weeks, Radio Prijedor repeatedly broadcast 
 21   demands that non-Serbs surrender all remaining arms, even licensed 
 22   hunting weapons.  Muslim officials met with Bosnian Serb authorities 
 23   to negotiate a peaceful co-existence. During this time, travel for 
 24   non-Serbs was increasingly curtailed and communication lines from 
 25   predominantly Muslim villages to the outside world were cut.

  1   		Before and after the Bosnian Serbs seized power, they supplied 
  2   arms and weapons to the Serbian villages in the municipality.  Heavy 
  3   weapons were also introduced into the area.
  4   		Military attacks in the Prijedor municipality began on 23rd 
  5   May 1992, after an incident at a checkpoint near the village of 
  6   Hambarine.  Military attacks on Hambarine and Ljubija were followed by 
  7   attacks on Kozarac and Prijedor town. Beginning on 20th July 1992, 
  8   villages on the left bank of the Sana River were attacked by Serbian 
  9   forces.  As in most of the other attacks, the left bank villages were 
 10   subjected to heavy shelling, followed by a mass round up and killings 
 11   of non-Serbian civilians.  Many homes and villages were destroyed 
 12   during and after the attacks, making it impossible for people to 
 13   return to the villages.
 14   		Those who were arrested and detained endured long term 
 15   detention in facilities marked by the cruel and inhumane treatment of 
 16   inmates.  Many thousands of non-Serbian civilians suffered in the 
 17   infamous detention camps of Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.  From 
 18   these centres the detainees were later either transferred to the 
 19   Manjaca camp and from there to either Batkovic camp or to other areas 
 20   outside Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 21   		Those who were not detained lived under such  oppressive 
 22   conditions and in such a state of fear that most eventually left 
 23   Prijedor.  By June 1993, 88 per cent of the Muslim population of 
 24   approximately 49,000 had been killed or forced to leave the area.  
 25   Today the majority of the previous non-Serbian population in the 

  1   Prijedor municipality has been expelled.
  2   Q.   Mr. Ralston, you have testified that as a result of the events that 
  3   took place in those respective municipalities, the ethnic composition 
  4   of each of those municipalities changed. Would you please refer to 
  5   Exhibit No. 50?  I would ask you, once it is put on the elmo, to 
  6   please identify and explain its relevance to the court.
  7   A.   Yes.
  8   Q.   Perhaps we could have the lights down at this point?
  9   A.   In the municipalities of Prijedor, Foca, Vlasenica, Brcko and 
 10   Bosanski Samac, of which I have just spoken, the population changed 
 11   from being a Serbian minority to being almost totally Serbian.  A 
 12   research indicates that this occurred in other areas taken over as 
 13   well, for example, Kotor Varos, Sanski Most, Doboj, Visegrad and 
 14   several of the areas along here.  I will also indicate that Bosnian 
 15   Serbs also took control of these areas in here.
 16   Q.   Mr. Ralston, you have described a number of the methods that were 
 17   used by the forces that took over these particular municipalities.  
 18   Could you please explain what common features you found, what patterns 
 19   you found, in terms of those methods?
 20   A.   The common features include initially ultimatums, to hand over 
 21   weapons, to swear allegiance to the Bosnian Serb administration and 
 22   the surrender of certain individuals.  There were military attacks 
 23   followed by wholesale destruction of  villages.  It was indiscriminate 
 24   murder, separation of men from the women, children and the elderly, 
 25   incarceration in various forms of detention facilities.  These 

  1   detention facilities were either run by the police, military 
  2   authorities or both.  At these facilities interrogations, beatings, 
  3   murder, sexual assault were commonplace, as was torture.  Many of the 
  4   those incarcerated were later subjected to deportation, as were 
  5   civilians who were not detained.
  6   Q.   Those methods, Mr. Ralston, before we turn to them specifically, 
  7   occurred in municipalities that were located all throughout the 
  8   territory occupied by the Bosnian Serbs; is that correct?
  9   A.   That is correct.
 10   Q.   You mentioned one of the patterns that has emerged in the course of 
 11   the Prosecutor's investigations is that ultimatums were a common 
 12   feature in takeovers; could you please explain to the court what you 
 13   mean by that and give the court some examples?
 14   A.   Ultimatums were frequently issued by the SDS, the members of the 
 15   Bosnian Serb army, or the police, to representatives of the Muslim 
 16   villages to surrender their arms.  To illustrate this, I will provide 
 17   you with an example from Prijedor:  on 22nd May 1992, a car with five 
 18   men, four Serbs and a Croat, were stopped at a checkpoint in the 
 19   village of Hambarine near Prijedor.  When the Serbs were asked to 
 20   surrender their weapons, one of the Serbs opened fire with his machine 
 21   gun.  The commander at the checkpoint was wounded and later died of 
 22   his wounds.  The other non-Serbs at the checkpoint returned fire and 
 23   killed two of the Serbs.  The Serbs then asked the non-Serbs to 
 24   surrender themselves and the checkpoint. 
 25   		After the shooting incident, the SDS Crisis Staff in Prijedor 

  1   delivered an ultimatum over Radio Prijedor in which they demanded that 
  2   the men who they held responsible for the shooting at the checkpoint 
  3   be handed over to them, and that all weapons in Hambarine be 
  4   surrendered to the Serbs.  If the ultimatum was not met by noon the 
  5   following day, the Serbs said they would attack Hambarine.
  6   		When the ultimatum was not met, the Serbs commenced an 
  7   artillery bombardment of Hambarine.  When the artillery fire ceased, 
  8   the village was attacked by tanks and infantry and houses were set on 
  9   fire.  When the attack on Hambarine started, large numbers of 
 10   villagers fled to other nearby Muslim or Croatian villages.  Others 
 11   took to the woods and remained there until they thought the immediate 
 12   danger was over.
 13   Q.   After the ultimatum was issued by the Prijedor Crisis Staff, what 
 14   happened to the village of Hambarine and other nearby villages?
 15   A.   Well, as in the above example, ultimatums were delivered both by the 
 16   SDS run Crisis Staff, civil officials and members of the military 
 17   forces.
 18   		In relation to Hambarine, later that day negotiations between 
 19   Major Radmilo Zeljaja and Becir Medunjanin, a representative of the 
 20   Muslim community of Kozarac, were monitored on the police radio in 
 21   Kozarac.  Zeljaja issued an ultimatum that the people of Kozarac 
 22   either sign a pledge of loyalty to the Bosnian Serb Republic and hand 
 23   over all weapons or Kozarac would be attacked.  Zeljaja informed 
 24   Medunjanin that he had until noon for the ultimatum to be reached.
 25   		About noon on 24th May 1992, Becir Medunjanin asked for more 

  1   time, but Zeljaja told him that time had run out.  Shortly thereafter, 
  2   Kozarac was attacked by local Serbs from Lamovita and Omarska and 
  3   troops from the Banja Luka Corps under the command of Colonel Vladimir 
  4   Arsic and Major Zeljaja, the commander in the field.  Kozarac town and 
  5   the villages of Kamicani, Jakupovici and Kozarusa were subjected to 
  6   heavy bombardment by artillery, and from tanks and smaller weapons.
  7   		On 27th May 1992, Bosnian-Serb army tanks and infantry moved 
  8   into Kozarac and, as the local population had not organised any real 
  9   resistance to the attack, the Serbs moved in virtually unimpeded.  
 10   Many of the inhabitants of the area fled to the nearby forests of the 
 11   Kozara Mountain.
 12   Q.   What happened to those individuals, Mr. Ralston, who fled into the 
 13   woods?
 14   A.   After the shelling stopped, the surrender of thousands of the 
 15   inhabitants of the Kozarac area was negotiated by a number of the 
 16   former Muslim police and Major Zeljaja.  Many people, men women and 
 17   children, took advantage of this surrender, formed columns and moved 
 18   towards Prijedor town under the guard of the Serbian forces.  As the 
 19   column was moving along the road many of the men were taken from the 
 20   column and killed on the spot.  The Muslim commander of the police in 
 21   Kozarac and a number of his officers were killed after they were 
 22   surrendered.  At a checkpoint along the road the column was met by 
 23   Bosnian Serb forces and the men were separated from the women and 
 24   children. The majority of the men were then placed on buses and taken 
 25   to the Omarska and Keraterm camps.  The majority of the women and 

  1   children were taken to Trnopolje camp.
  2   Q.   Mr. Ralston, you mentioned that one of the patterns that the 
  3   investigations have revealed is a pattern of murder of civilians by 
  4   the police and military personnel.  Can you please  expand on this?
  5   A.   In the municipalities mentioned, summary execution of civilians both 
  6   inside and outside of the detention facilities was commonplace.  
  7   Perhaps the best or most graphic examples of this occurred in Brcko 
  8   where a photographer happened to be on the scene and captured 
  9   photographs of the murder of two apparently civilian people.  These 
 10   photographs were later published in international media.
 11   Q.   Could we have the lights dimmed.  Your Honour, we are going to refer 
 12   now to Exhibits 51A, B and C.  If they could be shown now.  Could you 
 13   explain, Mr. Ralston, please what is shown in this Exhibit as soon as 
 14   we get a focus on it?
 15   A.   You see here two civilians being escorted by an armed man in what 
 16   appears to be a police uniform and another armed man in what appears 
 17   to be a military uniform.  If we move to the next photograph ----
 18   Q.   Let me ask you, those photographs were taken in Brcko?
 19   A.   Those photographs were taken in Brcko.
 20   Q.   All right.  Could you move to the next photograph, please.
 21   A.   You will see in this photograph that the gentleman in the apparently 
 22   police uniform has raised his weapon.  What has occurred here is he 
 23   has fired into the back of the civilian in front of him.
 24   Q.   Will you please show the next exhibit.
 25   A.   This photo graphically depicts what happened to the civilian.  I 

  1   might also add that the other gentleman who is shown, the other 
  2   civilian shown in the first photograph was murdered at the same time.
  3   Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Ralston.  If we could have the lights back 
  4   up. 
  5   A.   I think there is the next.
  6   Q.   In that case we will not have them up.  Let me now turn to the next 
  7   pattern that has been revealed, and that is the destruction of Muslim 
  8   villages.  Is there another photograph?
  9   A.   Yes, there is another.
 10   Q.   I am sorry.  Let me go back then to one more photograph in that 
 11   series.
 12   A.   On the same day that that last series of photographs were taken, this 
 13   photograph of a mass grave near Brcko was taken. You can see that 
 14   bodies in the grave are all wearing civilian clothes.  It is Exhibit 
 15   No. 52.
 16   Q.   All right.  Now we can have the lights up.  Mr. Ralston, let me turn 
 17   your attention to another feature in the patterns that the 
 18   Prosecutor's investigations have revealed, and that is the destruction 
 19   of Muslim villages.  Can you please explain to the court what you mean 
 20   by that and we will turn to some exhibits in just a minute?
 21   A.   Yes.  In general as the Muslim population had been removed from 
 22   villages, Bosnian Serb forces would come through and destroy their 
 23   houses to prevent their return.  In Vlasenica the attack started, as I 
 24   said, on 22nd April.  Following the official departure of the JNA 
 25   troops and their replacement by Bosnian Serb troops, Bosnian Serb army 

  1   troops, Muslim villages continue to be destroyed.  The attacks on 
  2   these villages met with little or no resistance.  In many cases people 
  3   had turned in their weapons.  In the Prijedor municipality the 
  4   following villages suffered from bombardment or total or partial 
  5   destruction by Serbian military, paramilitary and police units: 
  6   Hambarine and Ljubija on 22nd May, Kozarac, Alici, Brdjani, Donji 
  7   Forici, Gornja Forici, Hrnici, Jakupovic, Kamicani,  Kevljani, 
  8   Kenjari, Kozarusa and others, and Prijedor, Tukovi and Stari Grad on 
  9   30th May.  In a further wave of attacks on 20th July the following 
 10   villages suffered widespread destruction: Biscani, Karakovo, 
 11   Rizvanovici, Sredice, Zidovi, Brisevo, Donji Ljubija, Gornji Ljubija, 
 12   Raljas and Lisina.
 13   Q.   Mr. Ralston, let me ask you to refer to Exhibits 53, 54 and 55, and 
 14   please expand on your testimony using those exhibits, if you would.  
 15   Before you start, Mr. Ralston, we need to get it on the video screen. 
 16    Perhaps the lights could be dimmed on this as well.  No, they had 
 17   better stay as bright as they can.  Go ahead.
 18   A.   I will refer you firstly to the colour coding on the map. The blue 
 19   indicates populated areas, the yellow destruction from shelling, and 
 20   the red destruction from fire or explosives.  You will see here heavy 
 21   concentration of red.  This red correlates with the Muslims villages 
 22   of Prijedor which I have just spoken about.  You will see in this area 
 23   here there is also a heavy concentration of red showing large numbers 
 24   of homes have been destroyed.  Our evidence shows that the majority of 
 25   these houses which have been destroyed from either fires or explosives 

  1   are on areas which were previously predominantly Muslim.
  2   		If we move to the next exhibit, if I can show that more 
  3   graphically in relation to this area here and later this area here.  
  4   Now this map is a portion of eastern and central Bosnia.  The areas in 
  5   green are the areas which are shown in the 1991 census has been a 
  6   predominantly Muslim population.  You will see in those areas you have 
  7   indicated by red again where the houses have been destroyed from 
  8   either fires or explosives. You will see the concentration of 
  9   destruction of houses by fire and explosives is extremely high in the 
 10   predominantly Muslim  areas.  If we move to the next exhibit it will 
 11   show us something similar which occurred in the Prijedor area.
 12   Q.   For this we need the lights dimmed.  If we could have them dimmed.
 13   A.   OK.  This map here is the area in north western Bosnia and it 
 14   encompasses the Prijedor area which I have previously given evidence 
 15   about, part of Banja Luka and Sanski Most.  What these concentrations 
 16   here show are what are called ethnically cleansed towns.  The blue 
 17   occurred from mid-April to mid-May.  You will see here, here and 
 18   Prijedor town.  In May you see the concentration of villages outside 
 19   of Prijedor I spoke to.  From late May to early June you will see that 
 20   these villages in this area here suffered from ethnic cleansing, and 
 21   from late July you will see the concentration in these areas here.
 22   Q.   Mr. Ralston, in many of these villages there were Serbian people who 
 23   lived, Bosnian Serbian people who lived next to Bosnian Muslim people. 
 24    Did it frequently occur that portions of the Muslim community were 
 25   essentially obliterated and portions of the community that were 

  1   Bosnian-Serb remained intact?
  2   A.   That is correct.
  3   Q.   In that regard, Mr. Ralston, I would like to show you, please, 
  4   Exhibit 56A and B.  I would ask you once it gets put on the elmo to 
  5   explain what this is an example of.
  6   A.   OK.  This is an aerial photograph.  What it shows you, and this is in 
  7   the city of the Foca which I have previously given testimony about, 
  8   this area here is described as the Serb section of Foca.  A short 
  9   distance away you have a Muslim section.  It is not quite so clear 
 10   from this photograph, but I will show you in a moment.  There is no 
 11   destruction in this area whilst all the buildings in this area have 
 12   been destroyed.  I have two  further photographs which show, sorry, a 
 13   further photograph which shows a focus on these two areas.  So in the 
 14   main this photograph shows their proximity.  On this photograph you 
 15   can see that the Muslim homes are totally destroyed and the mosque has 
 16   been damaged.  In the Serb section a short distance away you see the 
 17   Orthodox Church totally intact and all the buildings totally intact.
 18   Q.   Mr. Ralston, would you now refer to Exhibit 56C.  Your Honours, we 
 19   will be asking the usher to pass to your Honours copies of these 
 20   photographs which you do not have in your collection.  That, your 
 21   Honours, is 56C.
 22   		Mr. Ralston would you explain what 56C represents?
 23   A.   Yes.  This is a photograph of a village near Crska.  You will see in 
 24   this photograph the signs of houses which have been totally destroyed. 
 25    I am advised that these houses were Muslim houses.  Nestled in the 

  1   middle of them here and here are two Serbian style homes which have 
  2   suffered no damage at all.
  3   Q.   Mr. Ralston, I would now like to turn your attention to Exhibit No. 
  4   57, and ask you to identify what Exhibit 57 is?
  5   A.   Exhibit 57 depicts for us the fate of many of the Muslim mosques 
  6   throughout the Serb controlled areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In Brcko 
  7   in this site in early July 1992 we see a mosque.
  8   Q.   That is a graphic depiction of the mosque, is that correct?
  9   A.   That is correct, of the mosque and the accompanying minaret.  By May 
 10   1994 that area had been levelled completely. Not only had the mosque 
 11   been destroyed, but any of the remnants of the mosque had been totally 
 12   removed.  I think the next exhibit will show that a little more 
 13   graphically.  This is the same area as I was pointing to in the 
 14   previous exhibit, and this  is the area where the mosque had stood.  
 15   All traces have been removed.
 16   Q.   Mr. Ralston, was there systematic destruction of religious sites in 
 17   some of the locations that you have testified about?
 18   A.   Yes, there was.
 19   Q.   Let me refer your Honours to Exhibit No. 58.  We will display that on 
 20   the elmo in just a minute.  I will ask you, Mr. Ralston, to identify 
 21   it and explain what it is once it comes up on the screen?
 22   A.   This exhibit is a graphic representation of the Banja Luka area.  It 
 23   is significant in that Banja Luka was a Serbian majority population 
 24   and, as such, there was no armed conflict in the area.  Despite the 
 25   fact there was no armed conflict in the area, many of the Muslim 

  1   mosques were destroyed.  This graphic plots the Muslim mosque 
  2   locations and showed the ones that had been destroyed by September 
  3   1993.  There are 14 depicted here in total, and since that graphic was 
  4   prepared I am told that three further mosques have been destroyed and 
  5   I am also told that that means the sum total of mosques in the Banja 
  6   Luka area have been destroyed.
  7   Q.   Mr. Ralston, I would like now to turn to another feature of the 
  8   pattern that you have identified in the municipalities where the 
  9   Prosecutor's Office has conducted investigations, and that is the 
 10   separation of men from women.  Can you please explain that feature?
 11   A.   Yes.  I have mentioned before in my testimony that men were separated 
 12   from women.  The men once they were separated were taken to detention 
 13   facilities where they were held for weeks, months and even years.  
 14   Some were then either deported to moved to other facilities or used in 
 15   prisoner exchanges.  The women  were also often placed in detention 
 16   facilities for various periods of time.  In these facilities they were 
 17   often subjected to persistent rape and sexual assault by camp 
 18   officials and guards and soldiers, and on occasions civilians who came 
 19   into the facilities.  On other occasions people came into the 
 20   facility, took women out, took them to various homes and locations 
 21   where they were raped also.  Other women were allowed to return to 
 22   their homes.  These women were often in an extremely vulnerable 
 23   position.  They were alone or with small children and no other 
 24   support.  They were at the peril of individuals and groups of soldiers 
 25   who would visit unannounced and subject them to rape and sexual 

  1   assault.  They were also subjected to other types of threats and 
  2   harassment which led many of them to take all the steps they could to 
  3   escape from the area and the constant harassment.
  4   Q.   Did this pattern or this method of separating men from women occur 
  5   only in 1992?
  6   A.   No, it did not, and this pattern repeated itself to certain extent as 
  7   late as July 1995 when the Bosnian Serbs captured the Srebrenica safe 
  8   area.  After the fall of Srebrenica male refugees were separated from 
  9   women and children.  The women were then transported towards Tuzla.  
 10   The males were taken to other locations and thousands of them were 
 11   murdered.
 12   Q.   Mr. Ralston, would you please refer to Exhibit No. 59, identify it 
 13   and explain its significance to the court?
 14   A.   OK.  This exhibit depicts in yellow the municipalities I have given 
 15   testimony about.  It shows the also the takeovers of the areas of 
 16   Srebrenica and Zepa which were as late as July 1995.  These 
 17   municipalities, together with control of these municipalities which I 
 18   have not give testimony about, or control  of these municipalities, 
 19   meant that the Bosnian Serbs controlled the area behind the 
 20   confrontation line, and not only did they control it, they had a 
 21   considerable ethnic majority in each of the municipalities.
 22   Q.   You testified, Mr. Ralston, that many of the men and the women who 
 23   were collected by the people who had taken over these communities were 
 24   placed in detention facilities.  Is that correct?
 25   A.   Yes, that is correct.

  1   Q.   Would you please refer to Exhibit No. 60 and I will ask you to 
  2   identify that and explain what it represents.
  3   A.   This exhibit shows the location of some of the detention facilities 
  4   that were set up in the areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs.  In the 
  5   Prijedor area we have the Keraterm, Trnopolje, Omarska camps.  There 
  6   are also facilities in Sanski Most, Kljuc, Jajce, Kotor Varos.  These 
  7   camps tended to run by the civilian authorities and the police, 
  8   although there was some involvement of the military.  Manjaca was a 
  9   totally military run camp.  In this area again you have camps run by 
 10   either the police or the military, and you have the Batkovic camp 
 11   which is run strictly by the military.  The arrows depict the movement 
 12   of prisoners.  Following the public outcry on the discovery of these 
 13   camps, individuals were moved to the Manjaca camp.  In relation to 
 14   camps in this areas, as they closed down the detainees were moved to 
 15   the Batkovic camp.
 16   		Finally when Manjaca closed down in December 1992 some of the 
 17   prisoners, I think about 500, from Manjaca were transferred to 
 18   Batkovic.  What this indicates is that the camps were not run in 
 19   isolation.  They were interconnected and people moved between each 
 20   other.  It also shows that detainees from the  camps were moved from 
 21   different areas of military control, from the area of the Drina Corps 
 22   to the area of the Eastern Bosnia Corps, from the Krajina Corps to the 
 23   Eastern Bosnia Corps.
 24   Q.   Now are these camps still in existence, Mr. Ralston?
 25   A.   To my knowledge these camps have now been closed.

  1   Q.   I would like you now to focus your attention on those camps and ask 
  2   you to describe the general conditions of the camps and what happened 
  3   to the detainees who were inside them?
  4   A.   The detainees in the camps, some were tortured, others were killed.  
  5   Some were beaten during the takeover and held as human shields against 
  6   possible resistance by armed Muslim groups. Women and men were 
  7   separated in the camps, as I have testified. In Foca many of the women 
  8   were being held around the partisan hall in various motels and 
  9   apartments where they were subjected to rape an sexual assault.  Our 
 10   evidence shows that every evening the younger women and girls were 
 11   taken out of the partisan sports hall in Foca, in the Foca high 
 12   school, and were raped or ganged raped in rooms or apartments in 
 13   neighbouring buildings.
 14   Q.   You have just described, Mr. Ralston, camps that were in the Foca 
 15   municipality, is that correct?
 16   A.   That is correct.
 17   Q.   And that is what happened to the detainees in those camps?
 18   A.   Yes.
 19   Q.   I would like to turn your attention, please, to the camps that were 
 20   located in the Vlasenica municipality and ask you the same question.  
 21   Please describe the conditions of those camps and what occurred to the 
 22   detainees in those camps?
 23   A.   Yes, in Vlasenica people started to be detained between 2nd and 13th 
 24   June.  The main centre of detention was Susica camp.  At Susica 
 25   detainees were tortured, interrogated and beaten at random.  Some died 

  1   as a result of their beatings.  The camp was located at the site of a 
  2   former Territorial Defence storage centre.  It ran from June 1992 to 
  3   September 1992.  There were so-called specialists who came in the camp 
  4   and participated in the torturing of the detainees.  When people 
  5   arrived at the camp they were beaten, some so severely they died.  
  6   Food was insufficient and most of the time inedible.  As I have said 
  7   before, the detainees in this camp were later transferred to Batkovic. 
  8    I am told that in September 1992 when Susica camp closed about 200 
  9   detainees who remained there were killed.
 10   Q.   Mr. Ralston, could you please also describe to the Court what the 
 11   conditions were like in the Prijedor camps?
 12   A.   Detention of civilians in Prijedor commenced shortly after the 
 13   various military attacks.  Civilians were rounded up the police, the 
 14   military and the paramilitary forces.  Detention facilities were run 
 15   by the civil authorities staffed by police with some military guards. 
 16    As I have said before, there were three main detention facilities: 
 17   Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje. The conditions at the first two were 
 18   particularly brutal.
 19   		The Omarska camp opened at the end of May after the first 
 20   attacks.  It is a site of an iron ore mine.  The camp was extremely 
 21   crowded.  Detainees were not permitted to move around freely.  There 
 22   was little water and what water there was often contaminated.  The 
 23   detention occurred in the summer.  It was often very hot and the 
 24   cramped the conditions and the heat compounded the human misery.  
 25   There was no bedding provided for the inmates and there were few 

  1   sanitary provisions.  Those who ventured to use the sanitary 
  2   provisions were beaten in the  course of the attempt.  Hygiene 
  3   deteriorated and lice, diarrhoea and dysentery became prevalent.  For 
  4   the first three or four days in the camp there was little or no food. 
  5    A small piece of bread and a small amount of a soup-like fluid are 
  6   described as the main fare.  All the detainees in Omarska lost a great 
  7   deal of weight while at the camp.
  8   		On arriving at the camp there were they were normally 
  9   searched, their private possessions taken from them and not returned. 
 10    They would then have to run the gauntlet of a cordon of guards who 
 11   beat them with batons, clubs, rifle butts, kicking and punching them. 
 12    Periodically guards demanded money and other valuable items from the 
 13   prisoners.  If they could not provide them beatings followed swiftly.
 14   		There were a small number of women incarcerated at Omarska.  
 15   With the exception of one, they were required to clean the 
 16   interrogation rooms after inspectors had left for the day. They report 
 17   that the rooms they were cleaning were often covered in blood and hair 
 18   and skin which would have to be cleaned from the floor and walls.  
 19   Weapons such as clubs electric cable, batons and similar instruments 
 20   were kicked in the rooms.  On an almost nightly basis some of these 
 21   women were called from those rooms by the camp commanders, supervisors 
 22   or guards, mistreated and sexually assaulted.
 23   		I am told that the interrogations that were conducted in 
 24   Omarska would involved somebody asking questions and at various stages 
 25   through the interrogations other men coming into the room and 

  1   inflicting brutal beatings on the person being interrogated.  There 
  2   were incidents of special terror which occurred.  For example, on the 
  3   eve the Petrovdan, a Serbian religious holiday in early July, to 
  4   celebrate this festival the  guards built a huge bonfire and engaged 
  5   in a drinking spree. The detainees were dragged from their rooms, some 
  6   were thrown alive into the fire, others were beaten severely.  The 
  7   screaming and crying of these victims created sheer terror for those 
  8   people who were detained but fortunate enough not to be called out.
  9   		In the latter part of July 1992 a large number of detainees 
 10   who had been captured in the area of the left bank of the Sana River 
 11   arrived in Omarska.  This area was the last significant pocket of 
 12   non-Serbs in the Prijedor municipality. After arrival in the camp they 
 13   were subjected to brutal beatings and many of them were killed.  As a 
 14   result of the investigation carried out in relation to the activities 
 15   of the guards in the Omarska camp two indictments have been issued by 
 16   this Tribunal.
 17   Q.   Mr. Ralston, can you describe the conditions in the Manjaca detention 
 18   facility?
 19   A.   Yes.  The Manjaca detention camp which was located 25 kilometres 
 20   south of Banja Luka was run by the military.  It was established in 
 21   the summer of 1991 as a prisoner of war camp for Croatian prisoners of 
 22   war of the war between Croatia and the FRY.  From April to May 1992 
 23   the camp was used to detain non-Serbian Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens.  
 24   The camp was allegedly closed on 18th December 1992 when the last 
 25   prisoners were moved to Batkovic or released to Karlovac in Croatia.  

  1   The military ran the camp.  The commanders were high ranked officers: 
  2   a Lieutenant Colonel nicknamed Spaga and his successors, Lieutenant 
  3   Colonel Bozidar Popovic, Lieutenant Colonel Petrovic and Lieutenant 
  4   Colonel Bojic.
  5   		Between June and August 1992 at least 3,600 people were 
  6   detained at Manjaca camp.  Almost all the detainees were  men aged 
  7   from their mid-teens to over 60.  In December 1992 when the camp was 
  8   closed approximately 2,500 people were released and 532 moved to other 
  9   camps.  From May to July the prisoners came from Doboj, Gornja Sanica, 
 10   Sitnica, Stara Gradiska, Kljuc, Sanski Most, amongst others.  After 
 11   Omarska was closed in August 1992 prisoners came from that camp to 
 12   Manjaca.  After Jajce and Kotor Varos fell people were brought from 
 13   those places to Manjaca.
 14   		After August 1992 as a result of international media exposure 
 15   and agreements concerning treatment of prisoners, many detainees were 
 16   released or exchanged.  On several occasions up to 1,000 people were 
 17   moved to or from Manjaca.  To move these large numbers of detainees 
 18   across regional and municipal boundaries required significant 
 19   organisation and co-ordination between police and military 
 20   authorities.  Many of the movements of detainees were as a direct 
 21   result of agreements made by Karadzic and show the extent of command 
 22   and control he exercised in relation to the detention facilities.
 23   Q.   Mr. Ralston, I have asked you to prepare selected film clips showing 
 24   the condition of detainees in Omarska and Trnopolje.  Is that correct?
 25   A.   Yes.

  1   Q.   Then if we could, please -- actually before we slow the clip, Mr. 
  2   Ralston, would you please inform the Court what they will see on the 
  3   film before it is shown?
  4   A.   Yes.  This film was taken at the beginning of August 1992 shortly 
  5   after the international community became aware of the existence of the 
  6   camps.  You will see clips taken at Trnopolje and Omarska.  The 
  7   footage taken at Omarska will depict emaciated detainees hungrily 
  8   attacking food which I have been told was in  access of that normally 
  9   provided to them.  You will observe them almost eat the enamel off the 
 10   plate they are eating from.  In contrast you will see an armed and 
 11   apparently well-fed guard overseeing the detainees while they eat.  
 12   From that clip we move to a clip of the Trnopolje detention facility. 
 13    The detainees depicted in this clip had recently been transferred 
 14   from Omarska and Keraterm.
 15   Q.   Now if we could show, please, film clip No. 3 Exhibit No. 29.  Can we 
 16   dim the lights as well.  Thank you.
 17   		(Exhibit 29 clip No. 3 was shown).
 18   		Your Honour, I notice it is a little past 5.30. I have one 
 19   more question to ask Mr. Ralston and then I will conclude my 
 20   examination for the day.
 21   		Mr. Ralston, did Dr. Karadzic ever comment about the images 
 22   that have been shown on these films?
 23   A.   Yes.  Dr. Karadzic has repeatedly been asked about these camps.  An 
 24   example of his response to such questions was published in the 
 25   Independent Magazine in London.  Karadzic said: "When they started 

  1   talking about the concentration camps I happened to be in London.  I 
  2   told them, 'I don't know what the condition are like in those camps.  
  3   We do keep prisoners.  We do not kill them.  We must keep them.  It is 
  4   war.  So, Penny Marshall, an ITN journalist, came to Ormaska and 
  5   picked out a few very skinny guys who will never look better.  When I 
  6   was 30 I too looked like them.  She presented that to the world."
  7   MR. HARMON:  We have no additional evidence for the day, your Honour.  We 
  8   have concluded our presentation.
  9   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Ralston.  Thank 
 10   you Prosecutor.  So we will stand in recess this Friday evening.  We 
 11   will resume Monday at 10 o'clock. 
 12   		(The court adjourned until Monday, 1st July 1996)
