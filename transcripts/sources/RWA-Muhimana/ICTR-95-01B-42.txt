(No translation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

May I hear the appearances now for the Prosecution?
MR. NSANZUWERA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  

The Office of the Prosecutor today is represented by Mr. James Stewart, head of the appeals section, Ms. Linda Bianchi, Mr. Abdoulaye Seye, and myself, François Xavier Nsanzuwera.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

For the Appellant?  
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  To my right is Mr. Kazadi Kabimba, co-counsel for Mr. Muhimana, and myself, Professor Songa, lead counsel, representing and defending Mr. Mikaeli Muhimana.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you.  So this is an appeal hearing in the case of Mikaeli Muhimana versus the Prosecutor.  The Appellant, Mr. Muhimana, appeals against the judgment and sentence rendered by Trial Chamber III on the 28th of April 2005, which convicted him of genocide and rape and murder as crimes against humanity.  

The Trial Chamber found that the Appellant instigated, committed and abetted in the commission of crimes between April and June '94 at various locations in the Bisesero region in Rwanda.  Specifically, the Trial Chamber determined that the Appellant participated in various attacks by shooting and throwing a grenade at Tutsi refugees and abducting and raping numerous women he believed to be Tutsi.  Additionally, the Trial Chamber found the Appellant disemboweled and killed a pregnant woman.  The Trial Chamber also found that the Appellant abetted others who raped women as well as instigated individuals to kill victims in his presence.  This instigation substantially contributed to the commissions of these murders.  

The appeal as set out in the Appellant's notice of appeal filed on 26th January 2006 and in his appeal brief filed on April 12, 2006 consists of legal and factual errors on the part of the Trial Chamber, falling into 16 grounds.  I will now briefly summarise these grounds.  

In Ground 1, the Appellant alleges that the Trial Chamber erred when it linked him to and conferred on him authority over the Interahamwe without defining the Interahamwe and his position in it.  

In Ground 2, he submits that the Trial Chamber erred in shifting the burden of proof from the Prosecution to the Defence.  

In Ground 3, the Appellant argues that the Trial Chamber erred in finding him responsible for ordering, without defining the powers of the conseiller de secteur.  

In Ground 4, the Appellant alleges errors relating to the Trial Chamber's assessment of his alibi.

In Ground 5, the Appellant alleges that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that he had the intent to commit genocide.  

In Ground 6, and also partly in Ground 8, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber failed to consider his arguments in relation to a plot against him.  

In Ground 7 through 15, the Appellant alleges that the Trial Chamber erred in making findings of fact and law in respect of attacks at Nyarutovu and Ngendombi hills and the neighbouring areas between the 8th and 11 April 1994, rapes of Languida Kamukina, Gorretti Mukashyaka, Espérance Mukagasana, Agnés Mukagatare, and ***********, events at Mubuga church between 11 and 15 April 1994, attacks, rapes and murders committed at the Mugonero complex on 16 April '94, attacks on Kanyinya Hill in May '94, and the murder of Pascasie Mukaremera.

Finally, Ground 16 concerns an appeal against the sentence.  

The parties may argue the grounds of appeal in any order they consider most suitable for their respective presentation.  However, I would urge counsel not to repeat verbatim or to summarise extensively the arguments presented in their briefs.  The Appeals Chamber is familiar with these arguments.  

I wish to draw the parties' attention to criteria applicable to alleged errors of fact and law on appeal.  The appeal process is not a trial de novo and the parties must refrain from repeating their case as presented at trial.  Argument must be limited to alleged errors of law which invalidate the trial judgment or alleged errors of fact which occasion a miscarriage of justice.  Furthermore, the parties are obliged to provide precise references to materials supporting their arguments.  

This hearing will proceed in accordance with the scheduling order issued on 14 November 2006.  From 9:15 to 11:15, we will hear the submissions of the Appellant.  We will then hear the Prosecution's response from 11:45 to 12:45 and from 3:00 to 4:00.  The Appellant will have then 30 minutes to reply, from 4:30 to 5:00.  And, finally, from 5:00 to 5:15, Mr. Muhimana will have the option of addressing personally the Appeal Chamber.  

It will be most helpful to the Appeals Chamber if the parties could present their submissions in a precise and clear manner.  The Judges may interrupt the parties at any time to ask questions or they may ask questions following each party's submissions.  

I would like now to invite counsel for the Appellant to present submissions in support of the appeal.  You have the floor, sir.  
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Mr. President.  

From the outset, I would like to immediately state that the present pleadings are not a repetition of arguments adduced at trial, nor a renunciation of the arguments elaborated on the Appellant's brief.  In view of the time allowed us and the volume of matters we have to deal with, I will immediately delve into the subject by dealing with Chapter 1.  

In Chapter 1, we dealt with errors of law and fact, errors related to what we described as matters of general import.  Here, in the main, we will be dealing with three questions.  The first concerns the definition of the Interahamwe, its structure, and the place or role played within this organisation by the Appellant.  The Prosecutor stated against all evidence and against objective -- all objective elements contained in the file that he never purported that the Appellant occupied a position in hierarchy of the Interahamwe or that he was a member of the Interahamwe, that is, Interahamwe, za MRND.  I am referring to paragraph 25 of the Respondent's brief.  The Appellant is of the opinion that the Prosecutor has suddenly decided to give up all the allegations based on the participation of the Appellant in the crimes committed by the Interahamwe.  He has also given up all allegations related to crimes committed by the Interahamwe on the orders, on the instructions, or on the instructions of the Appellant.  He has also dropped all allegations relating to crimes committed by the Appellant, together with the Interahamwe.  

The question arising is legal in nature.  It is legal in nature because without the definition of the Interahamwe, without a definition of the place and role of the Appellant in the Interahamwe organisation, we find ourselves in the face of an important question, namely, the criminal participation of the Appellant in the crimes alleged.  We consider this issue as being of crucial importance.  Just like the jurisprudence of the ICTR, particularly in the matter of Ntagerura, et al., in paragraph 31 of the judgment, where it is stated that the mode and scope of participation of the accused are always important facts, important facts that must be pleaded in the indictment.  

It is along the same lines that the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY stated its opinion in the Kupreskic matter by deciding or holding that the mode of criminal participation should be pleaded in detail.  We will refer you to paragraph 89 of that Appeal judgment.  

The Prosecutor himself in paragraph 26 of the Respondent's brief acknowledges that while a definition of the Interahamwe was not given by the Chamber, that is, the Trial Chamber, reference is made thereto on several occasions by the Appeals Chamber in its judgment.  Yet, this can only be done at the expense of the rights of the Appellant to the extent that such reference to the Interahamwe targeted the crimes with which the Appellant is charged.  In what respect the Appellant was involved in the crimes, what was the conduct for which he was being charged, these matters are important, the conduct for which he was being charged as a principal perpetrator or co-perpetrator or as an accomplice.  

Still, in paragraph 26 of the Respondent's brief, the Prosecutor states as follows:  "But that does not mean that the Chamber was not aware of what the Interahamwe were."  But the Prosecutor does not tell us how he knows that the Chamber knew who the Interahamwe were.  In the same passage, the Prosecutor concludes as follows:  "The Trial Chamber is not compelled to show in detail all the reasoning that it followed in order to arrive at any given conclusion or finding."  However, the problem is not to give details but rather to substantiate.  The Trial Chamber, by relying on the Appellant's relations with the Interahamwe, had the obligation to define, identify and to determine the place and role of the Appellant within the said organisation, namely, the Interahamwe.  Not having done so, the Chamber took a decision that was not substantiated and it did so in violation of Articles 22 of the Statute and 88(c) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

Paragraphs 27 and 28 of the Respondent's brief are not an appropriate answer to anyone who would want to know what the Interahamwe are.  The definition of the Interahamwe was necessary for the determination of the mode of participation, that is, criminal participation.  And so in accordance with established jurisprudence of your chamber, I am here thinking of the judgment in Vasiljevic in paragraph 28, the Furundzija judgment, paragraph 37 thereof, the Kunarac judgment, paragraph 39, and the Akayesu judgment, paragraph 178.  

Furthermore, it emerges from the Prosecutor's claims, particularly, in paragraph 33 and 34 of his brief, that the crimes for which the Appellant was convicted had been committed by the Appellant personally and not as a result of his role as the head of the Interahamwe.  The Appellant suggests a contrary or an opposite reasoning, and the Prosecutor should accept that whenever it is established that the Chamber, that is, the Trial Chamber, convicted the Accused on the basis of the role he played within the Interahamwe, this would be considered an error of fact or an error of law. 

We are going to give a few illustrations.  This is the case, in particular, of the presence of the Interahamwe at the purported site of the crime and the Judges considered this was an aggravating circumstance for the rape of Languida and Gorretti, Murekatete, Mukasine Kajongi, and Fudemosene (phonetic) Karera, Witness AU and Witness BJ, as can be seen in paragraph 608 of the judgment.  The same applies to the attack against the Tutsi on the Kiziba Hill, Nyarutovu Hill, as well as Ngendombi Hill, attacks perpetrated between the 8th and 11th of April 1994.  

The Appellant notes that the Prosecutor, in paragraph 35 of his brief, quotes paragraph 76 of the judgment.  According to that paragraph of the judgment, the Appellant was at the head of a group of Interahamwe during the said attacks.  This reference brings in a clear contradiction in the    Prosecutor's theory.  As a matter of fact, the Prosecutor has already denied the conviction of the Appellant on the basis of links between him, the Appellant and the Interahamwe.  Therefore, the Prosecutor could no longer quote a passage of the judgment, wherein or according to which the Appellant was at the head of a group of Interahamwe, without destroying or undermining the Prosecution's theory.  

By supporting a charge without evidence, we end up by distorting the usual meaning of words or making words seem meaningless.  Otherwise, anyone in doubt with normal reasoning ability could look at the Tadic judgment in paragraph 64, quoted by the Prosecutor himself in his brief.  Also he quoted that paragraph in paragraph 117.  We are therefore saying that anybody endowed with normal reasoning ability cannot but understand that to say on the one hand that the Appellant was at the head of a group of Interahamwe, that also means on the other hand that he had power; he had authority, over the said Interahamwe. 

In any case, the purpose of the Prosecutor's theory in paragraphs 35 through 37 of his brief is that the Prosecutor explicitly or expressly and formally acknowledges that the Appellant was neither an Interahamwe nor a leader of the said group of people.  But that being the case, in what capacity in the exercise -- in the exercise of what authority was the Appellant at the head of an Interahamwe group?  That is where the error of law and fact lies, an error of law, because without the finding, the capacity of the Appellant, his responsibility, individual responsibility, cannot be invoked as defined in Article 61 of the Statute.  He could not have given instructions or orders.  This error of law cannot but invalidate the decision because it was at the basis of a conviction of guilt, a conviction of guilt that was made without the mode of participation, criminal participation, having been defined.  Similarly, there was an error of fact, an error of fact which led to a judicial error.  

We for purposes of information and for the rest of our submissions would like to recall that the judicial error or a judicial error was thus defined by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY and ICTR, and I will quote that definition.  I'm quoting the Vasiljevic judgment, paragraph 8, Furundzija, paragraph 37, Kunarac, paragraph 39, Akayesu, paragraph 178.  These are the terms of that definition.  

The outcome of flagrant injustice of judicial procedure, for example, where the accused is found guilty, in spite of the absence of evidence relating to a material element of the crime and the mode of criminal participation is a material element.  

Still, as an example, we can quote the case of the rape of Witness BJ.  The Prosecutor himself acknowledges that Mugonero, the actual perpetrator of the rape, was an Interahamwe and that the Appellant enabled Mugonero to take Witness BJ to his house.  Allowing, as the Prosecutor says, or authorising, to use the terms of the judgment in paragraph 323, necessarily implies an authority that you have over the person that you allow, in this case the Interahamwe, that is, Mugonero.  Consequently, the Prosecutor's assertions in paragraph 53, 54 of his Respondent's brief should be dismissed. 

Lastly, as an illustration, we can quote the example of the killing of Kabanda, which we have phrased in our Appellant's brief in paragraph 22.  The Prosecutor, in his brief in paragraph 64, talks about the death of Kabanda and says that the Accused participated in the killing of that person, together with the Interahamwe.  The activity which the Prosecutor attributes to the Appellant in the company of the Interahamwe makes the Appellant to raise two questions which the Trial judge should have responded to.  These questions are, one, the scene of the crime and the mode of criminal participation.  The Interahamwe and the Appellant, where were they?  And what role did the Appellant play alongside the Interahamwe?  Who did what on Kabanda?  And with respect to his death, the site of the crime was not determined.  The indictment mentions the hills of Bisesero.  Witnesses mentioned sorghum fields on Runyangingo Hill.  With respect to this, I refer the Chamber to the transcript of 8 April 2004, page 48, French version, I suppose, line 33 to 37; page 49, lines 9 to 11; page 50, lines 34 to 37.  Regarding Witness BE, Kabanda was flushed out of the sorghum field on Gitwa Hill in Bisesero.  This is reflected in the transcript of 21 April 2004, page 8, lines 21 to 23.  

The judgment itself contents itself with mentioning only the Bisesero Hill as we see in paragraph 448.  Yet, Bisesero is a region, and the Prosecutor himself acknowledges that the Bisesero region covers two hills, the Gishyita Hill and Gisovu Hill, as we seen in the indictment, paragraph 5(d).  By mentioning the Bisesero hill as a site of the crime, the trial judge contradicted himself with established jurisprudence of the ICTR which was quoted by the Chamber in the present case.  And according to that jurisprudence, the fact of making general allegations tending to establish that attacks took place in Kibuye or Bisesero was not of a nature that would give the precise information on the site of the crime.  I refer you to the judgment in the matter of Mika Muhimana, paragraph 421.  

Regarding the mode of criminal participation and with respect to Witness BB, it is Mika who shot at Kabanda.  I refer you to the transcript of 16 April 2004, page 33, lines 13 and 19.  By so doing, Witness BB lied.  Because this witness himself testified that while he was fleeing, he was running, and since you cannot flee and at the same time look behind, BB was unable to see who shot at Kabanda.  Whatever be the case, the Prosecutor himself puts an end to the discussion when he avers, I quote, "Did he do it himself?  Did he encourage, did he instigate the assassination or murder of that person?  We do not know," unquote.  This is reflected in the Prosecution brief of 19 January 2005, page 35, lines 5 and 6.  This applies to Witness BB who alleges that he saw Mika shoot, even though that witness was fleeing and therefore could not look behind.  I'm referring to the transcript of 16 April 2004, page 31, lines 36 and 37, page 32, lines 1 and 2.  

Considering the foregoing, the Trial Judge should have taken into account all these elements and should have reached a finding to the effect that the site of the crime and the mode of criminal participation in the company of the Interahamwe had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, should have acquitted the Appellant of that charge, the charge mentioned in paragraph 7(d) (iii) of the indictment.  

On the contrary, what does paragraph 448 of the judgment tell us?  It shows us three things.  The first is the following:  The Accused, as well as other persons, shot at Kabanda and wounded him in his leg and following that wound Kabanda fell down.  Here, the wound is not yet the murder of Kabanda of which the Accused or with which the Accused is charged.  Secondly, the same Trial Chamber states that it is the assailants who killed Kabanda, even though the testimony or evidence adduced does not make it possible to determine with certainty the person amongst the assailants who dealt the deathly blow to the victim.  So far, the perpetrator of the murder remains unknown.  

The third thing, the Judges said that the version or the account given by Witness AT ascribes to the Appellant the decapitation of Kabanda.  Here, the murder has already taken place.  The decapitation of Kabanda is posterior or post facto to the murder and it cannot therefore be an act of participation in the murder -- in a murder which has already been consummated.  By not taking into account all these elements, the Trial Judge committed two errors of fact, two errors of fact and law, leading to a miscarriage of justice.  This is obvious because the Chamber convicted the Appellant for a crime, the site of which was not determined; in other words, a site which is inexistent, and in this regard the Appellant was not informed of the conduct with which he is being charged. 

With regard to the mode and site of participation, it would be unnecessary to continue proving that these are material elements of the crime and the omission thereof is both an error of fact, amounting to a miscarriage of justice, as well as an error of law invalidating the judgment, and all of these errors must be penalised by your Chamber.  

I will conclude on this point by suggesting -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the judge would like to ask you a question. 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Your Honour, go ahead.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

One central point of your defence, apparently, is the alleged role in the Interahamwe of your client.  You tried to give, in particular, two examples, that it would have been mandatory to be more explicit on the role of your client in the Interahamwe.  However, admittedly, I'm not yet convinced, and I would like to ask you to help me with this.  

You referred to Article 608.  There it reads that your client, according to the findings of the Trial Chamber, committed a crime while the Interahamwe were present.  What has this to do with the role of the Appellant in the Interahamwe?  

And, second, you referred to paragraph 323.  Once again, what is the meaning and why is it necessary to further describe the role of your client inside the Interahamwe?  
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Your Honour. 

I believe paragraph 608 of the judgment states as follows:  "The Chamber notes that other people, for example, Interahamwes were present at the time the Accused was raping the people listed above.  They helped or participated in the commission of the said acts of rape."  Then an enumeration follows.  "This circumstance which was considered as aggravating by the Trial Judge is thus considered -- is thus considered because of the presence of people who have never been defined."  Such persons not having ever been defined, one wonders whether the said Interahamwe at that time and in those circumstances were indeed present or whether this is something nebulous, as was stated in the Bagilishema matter, or is it just an attempt to associate the Interahamwe to my client in order to aggravate his case, taking into account the aura which surrounded those people.  

I am rather seeking to give an example.  In order to determine the responsibility of an accused before your Chamber, it was necessary to discuss the activities and objectives of the Interahamwe, their organisation chart, and even the position of the accused in the Interahamwe.  This was in the Rutaganda judgment, particularly in paragraph 286 and 430, as well as 455 thereof.  As regards the paragraphs, I crave the indulgence of the -- 

Could the Honourable Judge repeat the paragraph he mentioned?  Was it paragraph 326, if I understood you well, Your Honour?  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
You referred us to paragraph 323, if I'm correct.  
MR. SONGA:
Very well, Your Honour.  

Here again, Your Honour, I would like to point out that this paragraph of the judgment deals with the rape of BJ.  Now, and we will have the opportunity of coming back to that, the rape of BJ is ascribed to the Appellant on the pretext that the Appellant allegedly gave instructions or orders for an Interahamwe called Mugonero to rape BJ.  Under the circumstance, we would like to know what was the capacity, what was the status of the Appellant, which capacity or status would have enabled him to exercise such power or authority on the actual perpetrator of the rape.  That is what we mean, Your Honour.  

I am sorry if my answers do not give you any satisfaction.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Indeed, may I repeat:  Leaving aside the role of the Interahamwe, et al., if an accused permits another one to commit a crime, is it material, is it an element of crime that he acts as a member of a group, in particular in this case, is it -- and was it alleged at all that he acted in both cases in a particular role, in intra, Interahamwe?  
MR. SONGA:
I understand the question clearly.  Either he acted as a member of that structure and therefore as a member thereof, or in the absence of that quality or status, which I referred to as a legal status, he had a de facto -- a de jure authority?  Beating one case or the other, the Trial Judge should have established that he had the status or the quality de jure or de facto.  Otherwise, the term used would not be an appropriate one.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

With regard to the general issues, the Appellant was concerned about the burden of proof.  We start off from the Languida and Gorretti case, through paragraphs 25 of the judgment, we start off with the case of Espérance Mukagasana, from paragraph 104 of the judgment, and we also rely on the case of Agnés Mukagatare regarding the assessment of the evidence of Witness DAA, DC, DA and DL.  

Through these examples we came up with the impression that the burden of proof had been turned in favour of the Prosecutor.  For example, with regard to the rape of Gorretti and Languida, when the Chamber refers to the Defence witness by saying that that could only prove that a rape could not have been committed.  Further, that the Defence evidence does not carry with it a possibility that the acts being referred to could have been committed.  And, again, the Defence witness does not indicate that this rape took place.  And then in the rape of Mukagatare, this evidence does not show the possibility of this act occurring.  
When the Appellant considers these various statements -- sessions in the judgment, he understood that for the Judges for as long as these acts are not impossible, they then fall within the realm of possibility and that is a sufficient ground for conviction.  I do not know if this is due to the civil law system that I operate in, but with this kind of -- with such assertions one comes out with the impression that general principle of evidence which states that a person may be convicted on the basis of -- may not be convicted on the basis of what is possible but on the basis of what the Prosecutor has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that this principle had been reversed.  I even have the impression that with such assertions the standard of proof has been raised even higher when it comes to the defence of alibi.  Indeed, when we come to the defence of alibi, we realised the following in our jurisprudence, particularly in the Musema judgment on appeal in paragraph 108, Muhimana, paragraph 14, we observe the following:  "By referring to the defence of alibi, the Accused does not deny having committed the crimes that have been charged against him but asserts that at the time of the commission of the said crimes he was at a place other than the crime site."  And even still with regard to the defence of alibi, the defence does not demand the proof or the evidence of impossibility of the commission of the crime.  The defence of alibi does not create, it separates, the burden of proof.  If that were the case, if it is were possible then it has to be accepted.  But in the case that I have referred to, once a defence crime has not -- has brought about a situation of impossibility, the count has to be dismissed.  

The Appellant has established the impossibility of the crime that has been brought against him and the fact that he committed them, and this practice is incompatible with the principle of presumption of innocence.  

Since it is enough for an individual to get up and accuse another person, for the presumption of innocence be replaced by the presumption of guilt, and the accused will be found innocent only if he proves the impossibility of the crimes brought against him. 

Obviously, it is impossible for the Accused to bring the evidence of the impossibility, because all crimes, by definition, are possible, possible of being committed by any individual.  

The ICTR is requesting a probatio diabolica from the Accused, the proof of.  Since this has been erected to or has elevated to the level of principle, the ICTR has become a structure that makes people lose their innocence.  This is regrettable, and this reverses the burden of proof.  And the same situation occurred in the Kanyinya attack, judgment, paragraph 342 for Witness DY, DK, DL, and DF; the Muyira attack for Witnesses DY, DD and DF; paragraph 373 of the judgment and page 374, Mubuga attack, judgment, paragraph 161.  

Regarding the third general issue, we just want to refer to Pascal Nkusi's plot and the witnesses involved.  We brought before the Trial Chamber the fact that eight witnesses had appeared and had a particular relationship with the conseiller who took care of the Appellant's wife.  The Prosecutor claimed particularly in paragraph 88 that all this was a figment of the Appellant's imagination.  For now we shall limit ourselves to a reference to the Exhibit D. 28 for Witness DE, D. 5 for Witness AX, D. 3 for Witness AP, D. 16 for Witness AW, D. 19 for Witness AQ.  We consider that these are objective data which indicate that all these witnesses were either friends or relatives of Mr. Pascal Nkusi.  

We believe that a reasonable trial fact would have taken all of these facts into -- these situations into consideration for a lot of prudence, given the fact that this could have -- and also the fact that this could have been -- and also the fact that this could have led to the rejection of such evidence.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to move on to Chapter 2 relating to factual findings, and I shall deal with the attacks of -- which occurred on the dates of 7th, 8th, 9th of April 1994.  The Prosecutor's conclusions in paragraphs 114 to 130 of his brief do not faithfully reflect the evidence that was brought before the Chamber.  According to the Prosecution Witness W, on the 8th of April there was no attack at Kiziba, Nyarutovu or Ngendombi.  According to him, the attacks took place on the 11th of April.  On the 10th, nothing; he did not say anything about the date of the 10th.  And I refer to the 27th April 2004 transcripts, page 8, lines 14 to 18.  It was not until the 11th that the war became serious, he said; transcripts of 29th April 2004, page 39, lines 1 to 5. 

Contrary to the assertion of the Trial Chamber, particularly in paragraph 65 of the judgment, W never stated that there was an attack on the 9th of April 1994 on Nyarutovu.  Witness W -- his testimony before the Chamber confirmed that on the 9th of April, around 11 a.m., residents of Bisesero intervened to assist the people of Gishyita where some Tutsis and Hutus had taken refuge on a hill called Rubero in the Musenye secteur; transcript of 27th April 2004, pages -- page 39, lines 7 to 11.  In the same evidence before the Trial Chamber, Witness W talks about the day of 11th and stated that the Tutsi and Hutu population went back home; transcripts of 27th April 2004, page 39, lines 27 to 29.  Consequently, Witness W had, since the 9th of April, taken refuge on the Bisesero Hill.  He was no longer at Nyarutovu, Kiziba or Ngendombi, and could, therefore, not testify on events that occurred at those sites, not on the 11th of April, nor any other dates.  I refer to the transcript of the 27th April 2004, page 39.  Regarding the 8th of April 1994, Witness BC makes no reference to the attacks of Kiziba, nor the attacks of Nyarutovu, nor the attacks of Ngendombi.  From the 8th of April, DC had left his secteur and went to Bisesero, as indicated in the transcript of 20th April 2004, page 43, lines 10 to 15; page 41, lines 32 to 34.  Therefore, I'm saying this to say that BC cannot testify on the attacks of Nyarutovu and Ngendombi with regard to the events that the judge himself has situated between the 9th and 11th of April 1994, as indicated in paragraph 76 of the judgment. 
Further, the Appellant submits that the contradictions of Witness BC have taken all credibility from his evidence, particularly on the killing of his children, and the Appellant himself could not -- the Prosecutor could not go beyond this, because we find in his brief these two passages which cannot be true at the same time.  The first passage is paragraph 128 of his brief, and this is what it says.  "For example, some refugees were killed by a grenade thrown by the Appellant personally.  The same grenade also killed children, the children of Witness BC, during the attack on the Ngendombi Hill.  And then in paragraph 129 of the same brief, the Prosecutor, having forgotten what he just said, writes as follows:  "The Witness BC never said that his children were killed by the grenade thrown on the road by the Appellant."  Any reasonable trier of fact will find contraction and will draw the consequences with regard to the reliability of the evidence of Witness BC, who claims he was at the crime sites and never got to know who killed his children.  The Prosecutor believes this and the Appellant says no, that is not reasonable, regarding the participation of the Appellant in the killing of his children. 

With regard to Witness BB, on 8th April, he makes no reference to any attack as referred to in the transcript of 16th April 2004, page 4, lines 24 to 25. 

Now, on the 9th of April, BB does not say anything on Nyarutovu, and on the 9th of April he could not have testified about an attack on Kiziba and Ngendombi because all of the residents were on the Muyira Hill since the previous day, that is, the early morning on the 8th of April.  Please refer to transcripts of 14th April 2004, page 53, lines 28 to 31, Exhibit D. 17, E for English and F for French and K for the Kinyarwanda version.  

On the 9th of April, Witness AW and all the Tutsis of the Bisesero secteur went back to the Muyira Hill until the arrival of the French in June 1994.  That is in the transcript of 14th April 2004, page 62, lines 25 to 37.  Therefore, Witness AW could not -- who has been a witness to these events on Nyarutovu, Ngendombi and Kiziba for the good and simple reason that on the 8th of April, as well as the 9th of April 1994, he was not on any of these hills, but was rather on the Muyira Hill.  

It is, therefore, in error that the Trial Chamber ascribes to Witness AW that on the 8th of April he took refuge on the Nyarutovu Hill, and that is in paragraph 39 of the judgment.  And it is also in error that the same Chamber relied on the testimony of AW to find that he was credible on the attacks that took place on Nyarutovu.  Refer to the transcripts of 20th April 2004, page 41, lines 18 to 30.  AW was no longer there as of that date.  This absence of AW from Nyarutovu on the 8th of April is corroborated by the evidence of BC, according to which on the 7th of April, Mika allegedly found Hutus and Tutsis assembled on the hill of their village and asked them to sit down -- transcripts of 20th April 2004, line 18 to 30 -- and then the Hutus were separated -- the same transcript, page 42, line 27 to 30 -- and the latter fled and took refuge in Bisesero; the Tutsis fled and took refuge in Bisesero.  Transcripts of 20th April -- page 41, lines 32 to 34, and page 42, lines 27 to 30.  

Another passage of Witness BC's evidence indicates that the flight towards Bisesero took place on Friday, that is, on the 8th of April.  Reference to the transcripts of 20th April 2004, page 43, lines 10 to 15.  Even further still, according to Witness BC, before getting to Bisesero, they did not stop at any point.  Reference to transcript of 20th April 2004, page 43, lines 20 to 21. 

Now, regarding the 9th of April, there is no corroboration between Witness W and BC on the one hand, none of whom made reference to any attack in Kiziba, Nyarutovu and Ngendombi, and, on the other hand, BB who claims he witnessed these events. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, this takes me to the rape of Colette, Alphonsine and Agnés, perpetrated at the Mubuga cemetery, and this is on the 15th of April 1994.  Here, the Appellant regrets having defended himself because he was surprised -- because he was taken by surprise with regard to the charge on the rape of Agnés because this does not appear in the indictment.  

In any event, we would like to submit at this stage that the dismissal of the evidence of DF is not justified on account of the fact that he testified on events that were different from those referred to in the indictment and which were supported by Prosecution Witness AV.  

The indictment in its paragraph 6(b) should have indicated to a reasonable judge that the Prosecutor himself accused the Appellant as having participated in the crime, as indicated in Exhibit D. 79 and P.  64.  And this, according to the Prosecutor's conviction, DF was a co-perpetrator referred to in the indictment and was talking about -- was testifying about these events out of personal knowledge.  Witness DF occasioned a judicial error because, taken into account, demonstrated that the Appellant neither killed nor raped at the cemetery, at the Mubuga cemetery. 

That takes us to the rape of the -- the rapes (sic) of Gorretti.  We should like to deal with this by defining rape, by relying on the Kunarac case.  We have other comments to make, but, first of all, there are two (inaudible) of rape.  The Kunarac judgment or the Kunarac judgments on appeal, which was confirmed by a court in the ICTY, both define actus reus as sexual penetration, however little, of the vagina, the anus or the mouth by the penis or any other object used by the perpetrator.  This definition, to my knowledge, has not been changed thus far.  

The Prosecutor's argument in paragraphs 106 to 113 in his brief does not offer any relevance; the evidence of AP does not indicate whether the evidence was direct or indirect.  AP could not have been an indirect evidence -- an indirect witness of the rape because he did not say that someone else told him that the Appellant raped Languida and Gorretti.  He claims that he has direct evidence of the rape.  But from all of the explanations he gave on the rape, which he claims he witnessed, it is clear that he was not a witness to any of the constituent elements of the rape.  His testimony would have had a meaning if there were only one explanation of the presence -- of his presence in the house.  According to Witness AP, the attitude, the screaming of the girls, their state of nakedness, assuming that all those things took place, could have had any other explanation equally reasonable, such as threats of death or attempt -- attempt at their physical integrity, attempts to murder them.  Since all of these possibilities exist, no reasonable judge could have come out with one explanation to the exclusion of all the others without erring, an error which should have occasioned a miscarriage of justice and which would prejudice the Appellant, that the rape was maintained with aggravating circumstances, which weighed heavily in the determination of the sentence, as indicated in the judgment in its paragraph 611.  

I would like to point out instances where judges finding themselves in similar or comparable situations decided to acquit.  

In the instant case, I would like to refer to allegations in paragraph 65 of the indictment on the abduction of three Tutsi women at the Mugonero complex.  The reasons of the rejection of this by the first judge was that Witness BI was the only witness who testified on these allegations and that he did not personally witness this event as indicated in the judgment in paragraph 224.  

Let me give you a second example.  The Prosecutor charges the Accused of collective rape of Agnés Mukagatare and Josephine Mukankwaro, relying on the testimony of Witness AU, the Chamber rejected this on the grounds that he was not in a position to witness the rape perpetrated on the other girls in the corridor as indicated in the judgment, paragraph 333 -- 303 to 306.  

The third example, still in the present case:  Testimony of BB on the rape and killing of Mutabika (phonetic) was rejected for the same reason or similar grounds as indicated in the judgment, paragraph 467.  

This case is comparable to the one we are concerned with because Witness AP claimed to testify on the Gorretti and Languida rapes by making deductions in relation to the statements that were made:  The state of nakedness of the girls and the manner in which they were walking.  He was not able to say who did what to who inside a house in which there were several occupants, as indicated in the transcript of the 31st March, 2004, page 9, lines 11 to 14.  He was not able to say who did what to whom in a house whose gate was closed, as indicated in the transcript of 31st March 2004, page 8, page -- line -- page 9, line 5.  

Mr. President, there is a certain lightness in reading the Prosecutor's paragraph 108 on the testimony of Witness AP.  The Prosecutor stated that, "When he was about 15 metres of the house of the Appellant which was well lit by electricity, she heard the girls scream horribly, shouting the Accused's name," end of quote.  We believe that the electricity helps one better see than better hear.  But AP, despite the fact that everything was well lit by electricity, did not see anything and rather heard, thus making her testimony on Languida Kamukina and Gorretti Mukashyaka's rape.  In addition, the Prosecution witness AX stated that AP was no longer in Gishyita on the evening of the 7th of April 2004 because she had left since the morning to hide her cows in Bisesero, as is shown by the transcript of April 1st, 2004, page 4, line 25 to 28, page 5 and page 6, lines 9 to 11.  Once again, this is an error in fact when it is stated that AP was witness to a rape that was perpetrated on that same date at 7 p.m. in Gishyita and at Mika's residence.  The fact of retaining rape on the basis of such a testimony constitutes a miscarriage of justice, for the Appellant was convicted for an action that has not been established and the prejudice is all the more greater that it weighed heavily in the determination of the sentence. 

Regarding the rape of Espérance Mukagasana, the Appellant merely wishes to state that when we were dealing with the rapes of Languida and Gorretti, the judge in the Trial Chamber claimed that the Defence witness had not provided any explanation which would corroborate the statement whereby one should implicitly admit that if the Accused had committed rapes, they would have heard about it.  See paragraph 25 of the judgment.  

On the contrary, the Defence deems that if the Defence witness provides such an explanation, the Trial Chamber should have taken due account of it.  But in the specific case of the rape of Espérance Mukagasana, there is an abundance of such explanations on the basis of the testimony of TQ.  See the transcript of the 18th of August 2004, pages 37 and 38, relying on the testimony of Witness DR, transcript of 1st of September 2004, page 4, lines 23 to 30, and relying on the testimony of DI, transcript of the 1st of September 2004, page 45, and finally relying on the testimony of DJ regarding the rape of Mukasine Kajongi and Amos Karera's daughters.  Contrary to the contention of the Prosecutors, developed in paragraph 192 to 203 of its brief, the Trial Chamber committed errors of fact and law when convicting the Appellant for the rape and assassination of Mukasine Kajongi and when it stated that the Appellant had encouraged the rape and assassination of Amos Karera's daughters, relying on the testimony of Witness AT.  First of all, it was demonstrated at the first instance that Witness AT was an inveterate liar, and this can be checked or verified in the transcript of the 19th April 2004 on page 24, lines 10, 13 and lines 23 to 24.  This can also be proven in the transcripts of the 20th of April 2004, page 23, lines 34 to 37; page 24, lines 1 to 5.  The transcripts of the 19th of April 2004, I have just mentioned on page 24, lines 23, 24, was the transcript of a closed session.  But, most of all, the concerns of the Appellant have to do with the fact that the site of the above-mentioned crime was never determined by the Judges in the first instance.  The indictment places the offence at the Mugonero medical school.  Before the Trial Chamber, the Appellant was able to demonstrate that such a medical school does not exist.  Please refer to our Defence brief, pages 108, paragraph 289.  

The Trial Chamber never responded to such an argument by the Defence, merely stating that Mukasine Kajongi's rape and the rapes of Amos Karera's daughters took place in the basement of the Mugonero hospital as shown in the judgment in paragraph 274, which is a location which is entirely different from the one contained in the indictment and the existence of which cannot be deduced from the testimony of AT which is rife with contradictions as to the site of the crime.  If one states that the crime was perpetrated in the basement of the Mugonero hospital, it does not provide sufficient indications as to the crime of rape.  And when one knows how complex the configuration of this basement is, for the Prosecution witness Lucassen, the major buildings of the hospital were made up of two floors.  A picture was taken at the basement which shows the maternity ward, and, according to such a witness, Witness AT told him about it.  Then there was the entrance of the operating complex.  This complex has several surgeries and perhaps rooms for hospitalisation.  This is what Mr. Lucassen stated as contained in the transcript of the 29th of March 2004, page 32, line 7.  In answer to a question made -- put by the judge on the importance of the picture and whether it represented the site of the crime, the witness responded that, "It was a scene where Witness AT told me that I had seen the Accused, so yes -- my answer is yes, Madam President."  Please refer to the transcript of the 29th of March 2004, pages 32, lines 8 to 9.  Contrary to the allegations of Witness Lucassen, Witness AT stated that he had never entered the room of the hospital to show Lucassen the site where the crime was perpetrated.  Please refer to the transcript of the 19th of April 2004, page 45, lines 24 to 37, page 46, lines 1 to 37; that is to say, the whole page.

1030H
MR. SONGO: (continued)
The Trial Chamber, on the basis of such elements believed these were matters of no importance, but these are matters that have to do with the site where the crime was allegedly perpetrated.  And according to the Appeals judgement in the Kupreskic case, which we have already stated and it is paragraph 29, these are essential elements which need to be gone -- which need to be dealt with in details.  The contradictions in the testimony of Witness AT as to the location of the crime as well as the contradictions between the testimony of Witness Lucassen and those of Witness AT should have been sufficient for the two testimonies to be dismissed by the judges in the first instance.  But the 
Trial Chamber even went as far as resorting to vexation methods.  

Let's just listen to the Trial Chamber, and I quote:  "The Trial Chamber notes that Witness AT never stated that there were several rooms in the surgery ward, and that on the contrary, he merely indicated that there were more than two rooms in that surgery ward."  And this is the judgment in its 
paragraph 271.  And I believe that a reasonable judge should not reason in such a negative manner.  

The Defence believes that the decisions of the Chamber are contradictory and do not solve the matter of the location of the crime.  In order to better understand that no ruling was provided on this matter by the trial judge, let me refer to the following excerpt of the transcript of the 19th of April 2004, page 13, lines 1 to 8; page 43, lines 8 to 15.  All these are excerpts of transcripts which contribute to the confusion on the determination of the location of this crime, and the answer of the Prosecutor, according to which the rape of Mukasine Kajongi and the murder and the rape of Amos Karera's daughters took place, according to that statement of the Prosecutor, in a building located in the Mugonero complex.  This is how the Prosecutor understands the location of the crime in a 
paragraph 200 of its respondent's brief.  This is a description that does not provide satisfactory information.  For it had been established well beforehand that the rapes alleged in the indictment had been perpetrated at the Mugonero complex, where one finds a church, a hospital and a nursing school.  But an eyewitness cannot really say that the rape took place at the Mugonero complex.  At the church it is not important.  At the nurses' school it is not important.  At the hospital that is not important.  Is that possible that an accused be able to defend himself in front of the judges for a rape which has not had been specifically located in any site?  

Furthermore, Your Honours, if you look at all the excerpts of the transcripts which were devoted to the determination of the specific location, the specific room where the rape took place, you will understand that when one states that the rape took place at the Mugonero complex in one of its buildings does not provide any response to all the concerns expressed not only by the Judges but also by the parties.  In his respondent's brief in its paragraph 202, the Prosecutor dismisses the Defence's theory on the collusion of Witness AT with the woman who testified in that present case.  The reason being provided is that the rape perpetrated -- the rapes perpetrated by Mika Muhimana were known -- were generally known and were of public knowledge.  Perhaps the Prosecutor wishes to convince us that regarding the rapes for which Mika has been charged, there has been judicial notice thereof, which would be extraordinary.  Such a concept has never been invoked and neither has it been retained by the Trial Chamber.  

For all intents and purposes, if I were the Prosecutor or the trial judge, I would have been very modest when dealing with cases of rape for which no corroboration was possible despite the claims that such rapes were widely known and were of public knowledge.  If one is convicted of a rape which has taken place in an undefined location, indeterminate nation (sic), which has not established is an error of fact and law since the conviction is provided when one of the main elements of the crime is not provided. 

In addition to a miscarriage of justice in conformity with the jurisprudence of the international tribunals, there are enough reasons obviously to render this decision invalid so that the well established jurisprudence of your Trial Chamber will not become something without any meaning. 

If I may, Mr. President, I would like once again to refer to the rape of BJ.  The authority of Mika on Mugonero was never established either in fact or in law.  The Prosecutor's allegations as stated in its respondent's brief in paragraph 228 and 232 show the embarrassment of the Prosecutor on the matter.  The Prosecutor first tries to establish that the Appellant is responsible for this rape on the basis of having aided and abetted it; that's substituting himself to the trial judges who never made mention of such concept.  And the Prosecutor concludes his presentation on the matter still in the respondent's brief in paragraph 238, stating that it is a case where an eminent civil servant within society gave his tacit agreement for the perpetration of this crime and those are terms which are a figment of his imagination, which are not found either in the statutes or in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence or any jurisprudence of the tribunal to which he does not refer. 

The Appellant is aware that presence as aiding and abetting is possible but this presence must be determined to have been on the location or the site of the crime, but the Appellant was not present at that site.  

Identically, aiding and abetting cannot necessarily be provided on the location of the crime.  Aiding and abetting can take place even if the person involved is far from the location of the crime.  But support has to be expressed towards the perpetrator either through acts or words, but in spite of the questions put to the witnesses, no such statement has been made with regard to Appellant.  The Appellant thus states that no reasonable judge would have convicted the Appellant for a fact that has not been established without erring both in law occasioning a miscarriage of justice and rendering invalid the decision. 

A few words, Mr. President, Your Honours, on the Kanyinya attack.  The statement of Prosecutor Witness AW dated 9th of October 2002, which is contained in Exhibit D. 17, was acknowledged by the witness itself as shown in the transcript of April 14th, 2004, page 63, line 10.  This statement was shown to the witness and was summarised as is shown in the minutes of the proceedings of the 
14th of April 2004, page 63, lines 16 to 18.  

Here is this summary and I quote.  This is the 8th of April and we are on the Muyira hill.  "On that same day, Witness, you went back to the your cellule to look for food.  On that same day you spent the night in Rugona.  The following day you left for Muyira where you stayed until the 15th, until the arrival of the French troops." 

Following the questions put by the Defence, the witness did not deny such facts.  On the 
9th of April 1994 AW went to Muyira and stayed there until the French arrived.  So he was not able to be in Kanyinya or at any point in time during the events of 1994.  

One will refer to the transcript of the 14th of April 2004, page 20, lines 27 to 28.  What will remain regarding Kanyinya, AP's testimony, the witness who was denounced by us on more than one occasion, a witness who testified on the meetings on the Gishyita secteur; meetings which were denied by the trial judge; the witness who testified on the rape of Languida and Goretti, and I am convinced that this allegation will be dismissed in the face of the quality of AP's testimony.  The onus is on you, Your Honours and Mr. President to say whether Mika -- Michaeli will have to be convicted based on the testimony of such quality.  

As for the assassination and rape of Pascasie Mukarema, apart from the writings as they appear in the Appellant's brief, we would like to take note of the fact that we had denounced three basic elements and this at the level of the trial judges which stated that Mika had early provided instruction whereas the judgement states that Mika was the one who perpetrated the killing. 

The second element is that the instructions which were allegedly given according to the indictment had not been corroborated by any evidence. 

Third point, we had stated that Witness AW could not testify on Pascasie's death since from the 9th of April, he had gone to Muyira and was consequently no longer in either Nyakiyambo, which is contained in the indictment nor in Rugona, which appeared in AW's testimony.  
In the face of this last argument, the Trial Chamber's response appears to be totally unreasonable and, furthermore, arbitrary and excessive.  It goes far beyond the Trial Chamber's authority to make an assessment of the testimony. 

Mr. President, allow me to locate the paragraphs for 405, the judgement.  Here it is.  "The Defence further submits that Witness AW could not have been present at the events in question, given that that witness stayed in Muyira until the arrival of the French.  Following a consideration of the submissions of the parties and the testimony of Witness AW, the Trial Chamber is persuaded that the said witness was found in the Bisesero area at the time of the events in question, yet the Appellant is not asking or was not asking the Trial Chamber to give the details of its reasoning.  The Appellant merely requested the Chamber to substantiate its decision.  Furthermore, how could one think that the Trial Chamber was reasonable when that Chamber stated that it was convinced that the said witness was in the Bisesero area at the time of the events in question?  It is as if the Defence had argued a contrary or supported a contrary point of view.  What is in issue is the failure to determine the site of the crime, and the insubordination of the Trial Chamber to the Appeals Chamber's decision regarding the need to avoid this kind of imprecision or vagueness when dealing with the site of the crime.  

Still in relation to the murder of Pascasie, contrary to the Prosecutor's theory elaborated in its brief in paragraph 254, 265, the Trial Chamber committed errors of fact and the law.  We are talking about the site of the crime and we are surprised the Prosecutor telling us that the Appellant was informed in a general manner of the area wherein the crime was committed.  This is not an appropriate statement regarding the site of the crime.  And the trial judge referred to the area of Bisesero and we all know that area covers the Gishyita and Gisovu communes.  I refer you to the judgement, paragraph 346.  

By proceeding as the Trial Chamber did, the Trial Chamber was in contradiction with its own judgement which refers to the Niyitegeka case in paragraph 421.  The Trial Chamber committed an error of fact and the law, with all the legal consequences that we attach to such errors. 

Furthermore, the Trial Chamber held that in the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief, particularly regarding the summary of the points on which Witness BI had to testify, the Prosecutor provided the appellant sufficient information, sufficient and reliable information on these important points.  

However, the murder of Mukarema arises from the testimony of AW and not the testimony of BI.  Let us remind you of what everyone knows.  The pre-trial brief can never serve as a basis for amending an indictment.  The -- an indictment can only be amended under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  That was reminded in particular by the Trial Chamber in the Celebic judgement in 
paragraph 488. 
As regards the mode of participation, criminal participation, the Trial Chamber in its lucidity, asked the question as to why this difference, and this is where -- this is what the Prosecutor said.  That answer by the Prosecutor is given in the transcript of 19th January 2005, page 30, lines 31 to 37.  I read the transcript with all its strengths and witnesses.  I read the transcript.  "Once more -- " that is the Prosecution speaking.  "Once more, Madam President, we are saying that the Defence knew what to expect.  There was no prejudice in this case.  Paragraph 391 -- 321 of the brief, you will see that it is said that the Accused is said to be medically unfit.  The Accused has never been to school or -- rather, the Accused has never been to school and, therefore, he would never have been able to commit that act, therefore, that is disemboweling the woman and taking out the child.  Therefore, the Defence knew what to expect and, consequently, there is no prejudice in spite of this difference." 

Apart from the fact that this response by the Prosecutor -- by the Prosecutor is inconsistent and incoherent, it does not resolve the problem raised by the defect in the indictment regarding the mode of criminal participation by the Accused.  Contrary to what the Prosecutor avers in paragraph 264 of his respondent's brief, the perpetration of a crime is considered as more serious than any other form of participation.  Thus, in the matter of Mitar Vasiljevic, the Appeals Chamber after having found that the perpetrator of the crime was aided and that he was responsible as a co-author as was found by the trial judge, the Appeals Chamber was of the opinion that the sentence should be amended consequently.  I refer you to paragraph 182 of the Appeals Chamber judgement in Vasiljevic.  The same applies to Vasiljevic judgment, where for the same reasons, the sentence was reduced by 45 years of imprisonment.  That is why we are saying that the Prosecutor is confused on the mode of participation and the site of the crime.  And we are therefore requesting the Appeals Chamber to draw all appropriate consequences. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would now like to address the issue of sentence.  In general -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you deal with the issue of the sentence, I would like to ask you a question in order to have your assistance in understanding what you said on the issue of the rape of Languida and Goretti.  You said, if I understood you well, that the Trial Chamber drew consequences or bound on baseless conclusions from the testimony of Witness AP.  For the time being, let us leave aside the issue of the credibility of the witness.  Assuming that the witness was credible and that the Chamber could rely on that witness's testimony, what would have been the findings or conclusions that the Trial Chamber would have reached on the basis of the testimony of this witness?  

The Trial Chamber made a finding that the Accused committed the rape, but according to you, would the Trial Chamber have made a different finding regarding the rape itself and the participation of the Accused in the said rape?  I would like to have your point of view of that. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I clearly understand your question.  Therefore, assuming that the credibility of Witness AB is established, from the Appellant's point of view, it is obvious that the testimony of AP should have been dismissed because it is unlikely to establish the existence of rape and to be more precise, establishing the existence of rape as an actus reus and on the basis of the Kunarac judgement which was confirmed on appeal, the actus reus is the sexual penetration, no matter how slight it is, the sexual penetration of the vagina, the anus or on the mouth of the victim by the penis of the raper or any other instrument that the raper may have used without the consent of the victim.  

Witness AP, assuming that that witness is credible, unfortunately, the said witness did not see and could not even see what happened.  On the one hand, the house was closed.  There were several occupants in that house.  Furthermore, that witness was outside the house, behind the door, 15 metres away.  Who did what on Goretti?  Who did what on Languida?  Can a reasonable judge on the basis of that testimony understand that there was penetration of any of the organs mentioned in the Kunarac jurisprudence?  No.  And any trial or reasonable judge would say with certainty that the Prosecution has established this fact beyond any reasonable doubt.  Can the trial just say that it was Mika and not any other occupant of the house who did the penetration?  Can any judge say that a sexual penetration took place and that the said penetration took place in this or that organ?  These are the many questions that the testimony of AP does not make it possible to resolve. 

Therefore, in summary, I, if I were sitting as a trial judge, I would have come to a different finding.  I would have said that rape was not established.  This is what my answer is, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thank you, Defence Counsel.  You may continue.  Judge Shahabuddeen would like to ask you a question. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Counsel, I would like to take you back to the part of your submissions in which you were dealing with the decapitation, I think, of Mr. Kambanda. 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Your Honour. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Your thesis was that Mr. Kambanda was already dead before the decapitation and that, therefore, the decapitation could not be relied upon in proof of the Accused's participation in the murder of Mr. Kambanda.  Would you say whether you support or not the proposition that there is a distinction between saying that accused has committed a prior crime by perpetrating a subsequent act and saying that his perpetration or the subsequent act can support an inference that he committed the prior crime? 

MR. SONGA:
I could, if need be, subscribe to your analysis according to which a subsequent act taking note of could ultimately support the commission of the prior crime, but it is necessary not only for that to be established but also it should be said it is necessary for the Judges or the trial judge to say, "Yes, I have established the responsibility of the Appellant with regard to decapitation because that decapitation enables me to understand, to infer, to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused indeed committed the main crime.  I can subscribe to such an analysis, but, unfortunately, such an analysis does not appear in the judgment of the Trial Chamber. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
I thank you, Counsel. 
MR. SONGA:
I also thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You continue, Mr. Songa.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Mr. President. 

I had just stated or I had just announced my -- I had just made my submissions on sentence.  I will not repeat what is contained in the Appellant's brief.  Nevertheless, I would like to respond to some utterances of the Prosecutor, which, in general, refutes the Appellant's arguments regarding sentencing.  

The Prosecutor relies on the fact that the jurisprudence I mentioned related to different matters, which is obvious.  Each case is a case -- is an independent case, different from any other case, but the purpose of jurisprudence or case law is to make it possible to provide the same solution not to identical cases but to similar cases.  When, for example, I quote Warren Vasiljevic and the Prosecutor tells me that he was convicted for serious violations of the laws of wars and -- the rules and customs of war and not genocide, I say that is a flawed argument.  I say so because the statutes of the ICTR did not intend to create a hierarchy between various crime under its jurisdiction.  It is a subject matter jurisdictions.  

Furthermore, to say that in serious cases or matters the judge did not give any weight to serious matters, that is not true.  There is always some weight given even if the weight is not too much.  The Prosecutor accuses us of being of bad faith when we refer to ^Kupreskic case with regard to the absence of a prior conviction as a mitigating circumstance.  Once more, this criticism is unfounded to the extent that the absence of prior conviction has often been taken into consideration.  

With regard to the position of the Appellant, in my submissions, written submissions, I was saying that the Appellant was a subordinate.  The Prosecutor challenges that by saying that below the conseiller there was, in particular, the cellule.  And I add there was also Nyumba kumi.  Nyumba kumi is a Swahili term which refers to 10 houses.  There is no debate about this.  In fact, this is really a subordinate structure.  The cellule is also a subordinate structure, but why does the conseiller become important when he is the third person from the bottom?  In any case, it is important to bring to the attention of your Chamber that the position of the Accused has always been taken into account before international courts.  This was the case in Nuremburg where the judgement was not as severe with respect to persons who were implicated in persecution, in planning, persons who aided and abetted, who incited, who ordered the murder of Jews and other ethnic groups in Germany.  Besides, in your own case law jurisprudence, Honourable Members of the Chamber, in the Tadic case, in the Tadic judgement, particularly in the judgement of the 26th January 2000, paragraph 51, it was strongly recommended by the Appeals Chamber that it was always necessary to take into account the position of Accused in view of the general context of the conflict.  I am going to add that with respect to the completion strategy of the international criminal tribunals, the Security Council made two recommends, the first of which is that the new indictments should target the most senior leaders suspected of being responsible, suspected of bearing the greatest responsibility for crimes that come under the jurisdiction of those tribunals.  

The second recommendation is that those persons should be referred to competent -- or, rather, that matters involving junior suspects should be referred to national courts.  Here the Security Council, who is the legislator of the international tribunals, insists on the need to take into account the ranks or position of the Accused.  Well, if they are senior officials, then they become subject to the jurisdiction of international courts, or if they are junior officials, then indictments should not be issued against, such junior officials should be referred to national courts.  That means that even when it is a matter of determining the sentence, it is important for the spirit of the legislature to be taken into account and that the penalty or sentence should not be the same.  The sentence should vary depending on whether the Accused is a planner or a mastermind, or whether the Accused was a junior official. 

The second element, Mr. President, is the following:  We are told that the crimes of which the Accused has been convicted, that since such crimes are serious, the Accused does not deserve any mitigating circumstances.  Yet from the word go, the crimes that fall under the competence of the ICTR and the ICTY or even under the competence or jurisdiction of the international criminal court are crimes which are inherently serious crimes.  But in spite of this inherent gravity of the crimes, the legislature has, nevertheless, made provision for mitigating circumstances.  Why?  We are dealing with United Nations justice.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the persons that you are trying are and still remain human beings.  What does that mean?  That means they are entitled to dignity.  They are entitled to compassion.  They are entitled to rehabilitation. 

Thirdly, Mr. President, Your Honours, there is much talked about by the Prosecution and by the trial Judges in order to just define the most serious penalties, penalties that cannot or that are not subject to mitigation were established on the basis of the testimony of one witness.  I know that corroboration of evidence is not necessary, however the assess many of evidence is not necessary.  However, the assessment of evidence that has not been corroborated calls for caution and the moderation of a reasonable judge in determining sentence. 

Lastly, I would like to conclude, Mr. President, by saying the following:  The Appellant is of the opinion that an international criminal court which refuses to accept any mitigating circumstances is not acting in accordance with international law and is, therefore, committing an error of law.  As a matter of fact, Rule 101 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence requires that the ICTR should take into account many factors including mitigating circumstances.  The taking into account of mitigating circumstances is not optional but compulsory and, therefore, taking into account mitigating circumstances is not just a matter of examining them but, rather, including them in the determination of final sentence imposable on the convicted person.  To rely on the gravity of the crime and that systematically reject all mitigating circumstances is a violation of such a provision and undermines the mission of the ICTR, which is to give victory to international justice in an area which indeed needs such justice in order to quote the beautiful expression of Judge Shahabuddeen in the matter of ^Zoran Zigic decision dated 28th February 2005, I was saying that I was quoting Judge Shahabuddeen, paragraph 8 of that judgement.  I would get there very soon, Mr. President. 

And perhaps with regard to sentencing, I have not elaborated the errors of laws committed, but once more, in a number of your decisions, particularly in the judgement of Aleksovski, paragraph 186, in the Akayesu judgement, paragraph 48 and 49 and many other appeals, judgements like Celebic, Serushago and Tadic, you yourselves said that the sentence is the same.  That the sentence may be excessive, or if it is excessive or inadequate, it amounts to an error of law. 

I also quoted a Latin maxim from your judgments, Nuraruvic Courier (phonetic).  We do not claim to have given an exhaustive list of all the errors of law, and we count on the Appeals Chamber to expunge all the errors of law from the Trial Chamber judgement.  For all these reasons, Mr. President, 
Your Honours, the Appellant is requesting the Appeals Chamber to reverse the guilty plea pronounced by the Trial Chamber, to replace the guilty verdict with a verdict of not guilty for each count, to reverse sentence, to order the immediate release of the Appellant, or in the alternative, to order that the trial be conducted de novo, or once more in the alternative to reverse the sentence of life imprisonment and replace that sentence with an appropriate sentence of a definite duration.
Mr. President, the Honourable Judges of the Appeals Chamber, it is with great respect that I conclude all these submissions.  I would like to thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I also thank you. 

Oh, Sorry, sorry, Judge Shahabuddeen .
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
(Inaudible) ... when we come back.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's have a break of 30 minutes.  We reconvene at 11:45 for -- to continue our deliberations. 
(Court recessed from 1120H to 1151H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are continuing our hearing.  I give the floor to Judge Shahabuddeen, who would like to put a question to the Appellant. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Mr. Songa, I think I share the way of links of my distinguished friend and colleague Judge Schomburg when he asked you a question concerning the Interahamwe.  Now, I think your proposition was that it was necessary for the Prosecution to establish the definition of the Interahamwe.  Would you see a difference between two propositions, one, the Prosecution charges an accused with committing a crime through the Interahamwe, in that case it would be minded to give consideration to your submission that is necessary to prove the constitution of the Interahamwe, and it is because of this reason that the Accused is really being identified with the Interahamwe and, therefore, it is necessary to prove his membership of the Interahamwe or some other relevant relationship.  But is that proposition the same as is that which I think is before the Appeals Chamber today, that the Accused is alleged to have committed a crime through a group of persons who belonged to the Interahamwe.  In this case, is there any substance (inaudible) that the reference to the Interahamwe is only a reference by way of description?  You are describing the people who committed the crime.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  I believe that your approach may not be too far from that of the Appellant in the sense that the situation for which we are saying that a definition of the Interahamwe would be -- a definition of the Interahamwe would be made and its relationship to the Appellant is that on each occasion that the Prosecutor alleged that the Appellant exercised some authority or that the Appellant issued some orders or that the Appellant issued instructions, given that assumption, which I believe is the first one that you described, we say that in that case it is necessary for the Prosecutor to establish either the de jure authority or a de facto authority.  

Now, with regard to the second proposition, i.e., that the accused person committed a crime through the instrumentality of a group called Interahamwe, that second proposition leads me to a situation where I see that the indictment states that the Accused person committed a crime in the company of without ascribing any important role to the accused person.  Now then, each time that the Prosecutor talks about other instruction, authority, the need to establish de jure or de facto authority, however, in the other cases where the Interahamwe is presented as a group within others such as soldiers, civil society, gendarmerie, that is an assumption or a situation where the definition is no longer necessary. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Thank you, Mr. Songa. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I would now turn to the Prosecution for their response for -- first by their response this morning.
MR. NSANZUWERA:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Appellant has come with a lot of allegations of errors of law and errors of fact committed by the Trial Chamber.  Before I enter into the details of our submissions, we want to tell the Chamber that this Appellant had a fair trial.  None of the evidence brought before your Chamber by the Appellant demonstrate an error of law or error of fact which invalidates the findings of the Chamber under Article 24 of the Statute.  Further, the Appellant has not demonstrated any error of fact which occasions a miscarriage of justice within the limits -- within the meaning of Article 24 of the Statute.

Mr. President, Your Honour, the evidence brought before -- the Appellant has brought before this Chamber the same evidence that he brought before the Trial Chamber and which were thrown out within the time limits at our disposal.  We would like to say that our reference document is the respondent's appeal in the respondent's appeal brief submitted on the 22nd May 2006.  We are going to respond to all the allegations brought in the course of this -- our submission we will deal with a number of issues so as to qualify or confirm our position.  

We have divided our commission among three parties, and in our oral submissions we are going to adopt the following plan.  I would first of all deal with the allegations of the Appellant regarding the definition of Interahamwe and the position of the Appellant in relation to the Interahamwe group.  I shall respond to the submissions regarding the authority of the conseiller de secteur and the genocidal intent.  After that Mr. Seye will take the floor to talk about the fact that a standard of the burden of proof has been lowered for the Prosecutor.  And after Mr. Abdoulaye Seye, Madam Linda Bianchi, seated to my right will take the floor -- will address the Court to respond to the arguments of the Appellant in regard to his conviction for the crime of rape.  She will also deal with our submission -- pleading issues.  If the time allows us I shall take the floor to deal with the sentence that was imposed on this Appellant by the Trial Chamber. 

Mr. President, that is the plan that we shall be following, by your leave.  And if I may, I shall begin by dealing with the alleged errors with regard to the definition of the Interahamwe.  The Appellant alleges that the Trial Chamber committed an error in law and in fact by not responding to the argument of the Defence, to the effect that the Prosecutor did not define the Interahamwe, its structure and the role of the Appellant within the group of Interahamwe.  Neither the Prosecutor and much less the Trial Chamber said that the Appellant had a role within or occupied a position within the Interahamwe.  This is nowhere in the judgement. 

The Prosecutor brought evidence of crimes committed by the Appellant himself and those committed in the company of the Interahamwe.  It is in reliance on this evidence that the Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant and not on the basis of any possible affiliations.  The Appellant in person raped personally, physically the victim.  He participated in a number of killings referred to paragraph 570 of the judgement.  

With regard to the allegation that the Trial Chamber did not define what the Interahamwe is, this allegation is baseless.  It is true that the Trial Chamber did not define the Interahamwe, but that is not to say that the Judges of the Trial Chamber did not know what the Interahamwe were.  The Trial Chamber is not obligated to show all the information that -- to show everything that forms their finding.  The 
Trial Chamber based its findings on the evidence brought by the parties.  And each time there was need to make a distinction between the Interahamwe killers, civilians, soldiers and gendarmes, this was done on the basis of credible, reliable evidence so as to come to its findings. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, the Trial Chamber did not need to make -- to define to make such definitions as having called for by the Appellant.  The definition of the Interahamwe was not targeted in the indictment.  The nature of the Interahamwe or the definition being sought by the Appellant is not clear.  

Further, the Appellant himself made reference to the Interahamwe several times each time that he was denying the charges brought against him.  Let me give you some examples to illustrate this.  Referring to the rape in the Mubuga cemetery, the Appellant ascribes this to the Interahamwe and the bandits who came from Nyaruhanga; this is in the Muhimana judgement, paragraph 153 and 175.  

Similarly, Witness DI referring to the killings carried out at the Mugonero complex stated that they were perpetrated by the Interahamwe and the soldiers.  Your Honours, this is in paragraph 253 of the judgement. 

He further ascribes the rape of Esperance Gasana to the Interahamwe.  This is in paragraph 100 of the judgement.  Defence Witness TQ1, during the proceedings of 28th -- 24th August 2004, gave a clear definition of the Interahamwe and during the cross-examination conducted by the Prosecutor in relation -- on the political party of the Interahamwe, the Defence witness, TQ1 responded that it was the MRND party.  This is contained in transcripts of the 24th August, page 16, lines 9 and 10. 

During cross-examination of Prosecution Witness AP, counsel for the Appellant asked the witness how the Appellant trained the Interahamwe.  He never raised any question on the identity of the Interahamwe.  This is contained, Your Honours, in the transcripts of 30th March 2004, page 59, lines 24 to 28.  It should also be noted that other accused persons were duly convicted for crimes committed -- perpetrated in consent with the Interahamwe without the Chamber having to define the Interahamwe.  I would like to give you an example to illustration this situation.  In the Semanza judgement it is said as follows:  That the Accused assembled and mobilised the Interahamwe to get them -- for the purposes of killing hundreds of Tutsi refugees at the Musha church and ordered the Interahamwe and the soldiers to separate the Tutsi refugees from the Hutu refugees and kill them.  Semanza judgement, 
paragraph 525.  The Appeals Chamber noted in relation to the same events that the evidence brought indicated that the Appellant gave to the attackers, including the soldiers and the Interahamwe or made them to kill Tutsis who were separated from the Hutus in the Musha church, this is in the Musema -- in the Semanza judgement of 20th May 2005.  Neither the Chamber -- neither Trial Chamber nor the Appeals Chamber deemed it necessary to define the Interahamwe.  In the present case, the 
Trial Chamber did know that the Interahamwe was the militia of the MRND party, Mr. President, 
Your Honours.  

With regard to the allegations that the Trial Chamber committed an error in its factual findings with regard to the crimes committed by the Appellant in the company of the Interahamwe, we submit that the Chamber did not commit any error.  Indeed, the Appellant was found guilty in most cases for having committed crimes for reasons of his authority over the Interahamwe and other persons participated in the attack against the Tutsi and not for -- not for reasons of his authority of influence over the Interahamwe.  Obviously, the other persons including the Interahamwe were present and participated in the killings -- and the -- in the killings and the Appellant challenges the findings, the factual findings of the Appeals Chamber and attempting to have a trial de novo.  Let me also say, Your Honours, that for further details regarding the factual findings, which involves the Interahamwe, we shall respectfully refer the Chamber to the respondent's appeal brief in paragraphs 26 to 66 -- 29 to 66. 

Now, I would like to deal with allegations relating to the authority of a conseiller de secteur.  We would like to say that the Appeals Chamber did not commit any error regarding any errors in law or in fact.  The Appellant did not bring -- make any submission which shows that he was convicted exclusively on account of his position or that he used that position to commit the crimes that were charged against him.  The Appellant was found guilty for killings and murder that he committed personally.  You will find this in the judgement in paragraph 513, the rape that he committed himself and those that he instigated other persons to commit.  We refer you to the judgement in its paragraph 552 and 553.  Nowhere in its findings did the Trial Chamber state that the Appellant committed or ordered the commission of the crimes as a conseiller.  Further, the Trial Chamber had to reject the evidence of witnesses which are related to his position as a conseiller.  For example, the Trial Chamber rejected the evidence of Prosecution witnesses AV and AF on the role of the Appellant on the attack on the Mubuga church.  The Trial Chamber considered that the evidence of Witness AV and AF seem to show the personal opinion that they had of the Appellant in his position -- in the position that he occupied at the time.  We refer you to the judgement in its paragraph 157. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, in any event, the Appellant has not demonstrated to this Chamber in what manner the fact of not defining the authority or the powers of the conseiller could affect the judgement or in what manner that invalidates the findings of the Trial Chamber.  Over and above his position as conseiller, the Appellant was a respected personality known to everybody wielding clout in the Gishyita commune.  He committed and instigated the perpetration of rape using his social status and not as a result of any position that his official position of conseiller conferred on him.  

The Appellant personally, directly and physically participated in the atrocities that are referred to in this case.  These are set forth in detail in the respondent's brief in its paragraphs 71 to 76.  

Your Honours, before I give the floor to my colleague Abdoulaye Seye, I want to deal with the allegations on genocidal intentions. 

The Trial Chamber did not commit any error in law or in fact.  The specific intent of the Appellant to commit and that could be inferred from his actions and his statement.  It could also be inferred from the general context relating to the perpetration of the crime in relation to the planning the general environment.  That is the position of the Trial Chamber and that position is correct.  

In the Vasiljevic judgement on appeal, the Appeals Chamber ruled, and I quote:  "That with regard to the proof of specific intent, it could in the absence of direct and specific evidence be inferred from a number of facts and circumstances, which is the general context, the perpetration of other reprehensible acts systematically directed against the same group as well as other atrocities, and the fact of judging a number of people as belonging to a special group so as to bring against them destructive and discriminatory acts."  That is the end of my quotation from paragraph 47 of the Vasiljevic judgement on appeal.  

I also refer you to the Semanza judgement on appeal in its paragraph 262.  The Appellant killed civilians.  He participated in attacks directed against civilians to cast away Tutsis.  During his many acts of rape, the Appellant targeted Tutsi women such that after raping Witness BG, the Appellant -- BJ, the Appellant apologised and I refer you to paragraph 517 and 518 on the Muhimana judgement, that he served his wife's needs to which he referred to in his brief and killed another woman does not detract from the evidence brought by the Prosecutor to demonstrate the genocidal intent of the Appellant and for which the Appellant was convicted by the Trial Chamber.  

In Kajelijeli case, the Trial Chamber considered that the evidence brought by the Defence to demonstrate that the Accused person has done things in favour of Tutsis before the events of 
April 1994 are not such as to detract from the Prosecution evidence intended to demonstrate that the Accused person had genocidal intents to kill Tutsis.  I refer you to Kajelijeli judgement 150.  The Appeals Chamber upheld this jurisprudence in the Kajelijeli case.  I could also refer to the judgement of Trial Chamber in Nahimana, Barayagwiza and Ngezi.  In that case, the Trial Chamber convicted Hassan Ngezi to a life sentence, in spite of the fact that he served Tutsis by ferrying them outside the borders of Rwanda.  The Trial Chamber in that case was of the view that Ngezi's capacity to save was more or -- was greater than his capacity to kill, and I refer you to the Nahimana judgement of 
3rd December in its paragraph.  

Your Honours, by your leave, I would like to give the floor to my colleague Abdoulaye Seye to deal with the allegations concerning the alibi and the burden of proof.  Thank you very much. 
MR. SEYE:
Good morning, Your Honours.  I will deal with the Appellant's challenge to the various Trial Chamber's assessment of the Prosecution and Defence evidence.  I will try to be very brief and I refer Yours Honours to our respondent's brief.  The Appellant's challenges are found on ground two, four and all of the grounds 7 to 15 of his memo.  So, as I say, I will just give a few examples and refer to a few challenges.  The Trial Chamber's approach can show that the Appellant's challenges are unfounded.  I should also say that I will not go into detail to the evidence of rape since my learned colleague 
Madam Bianchi will be using those examples in her submission.  

As my colleague told you, the Appellant challenges -- the Appellant challenges all the factual conclusions of the Trial Chamber, apparently submitting that they are all unreasonable.  The Appellant merely repeats arguments which were unsuccessful at trial without anything new, without, in our submission, demonstrating as required how the Trial Chamber in its assessment of the evidence committed any error of law in validating its decision or an error of fact leading to a miscarriage of justice.  He simply proposes again and did the same thing this morning, his alternative reading of all or any piece of evidence accepted or rejected by the Trial Chamber, thereby asking this 
Honourable Chamber to conduct a trial de novo.  This is not only unreasonable, but it is wholly impermissible.  

Your Honours, counsel for the Appellant dealt at length this morning about the mode of participation.  I would say this, the case against this Appellant is a strong case.  This Appellant a cozy and businessman who occupied a position of influence in his community, actively, directly, physically participated in the atrocities.  He personally raped and killed with reckless disregard for human life and dignity as the Trial Chamber said in paragraph 606 of the -- of the judgement.  

This is a straightforward case and the Prosecution adduced evidence to the satisfaction of the 
Trial Chamber.  So, in a nutshell, our position is that the Trial Chamber understood and applied correctly the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  It did not cast any burden on the Appellant to prove anything.  It did not create a double standard whenever led in Defence or Prosecution evidence, but came to reasonable conclusions based on the entire evidence before it. 

So my submission on the approach the Trial Chamber took will cover two aspects.  I am trying not to repeat all the allegations and all the challenges.  So I will divide it -- divide my submission as follows.  First, I will address the assessment of the credibility of Prosecution witnesses by way of illustration of the Trial Chamber's fair and correct approach.  

And, secondly, I will deal with the challenges with regard to the burden of proof in relation to the assessment of Defence evidence including the assessment of the alibi proposed at trial. 

The approach of the Trial Chamber to the assessment of Prosecution evidence, in our submission, a correct reading of the record shows that the Trial Chamber exercised appropriate discretion to assess the credibility and reliability of witness testimony and to determine what weight if any to accord to it or to accept or reject the fundamental features of the evidence.  This principle well when articulated in this tribunal's jurisprudence need not develop here.  What the Appellant does, as I said earlier, is to merely repeat arguments which are based on alleged inconsistencies or contradictions in the Prosecution case.  All the allegations -- all those allegations and contentions were unsuccessfully advanced before the Trial Chamber.  So the first example I will use to illustrate our position is in relation to the allegation about the plot involving some seven or eight Prosecution witnesses.  I will sequentially deal with some challenges against the assessment of evidence leading to the finding of the Appellant's involvement in various attacks and rapes, and I will therefore focus on the evidence of AW together with W and the evidence of BC as well, some clarification needs to be -- 

Concerning the alleged plot, the allegation that Prosecution witnesses AP, AX, AQ, BB, BU, BF and BC have been reputed for the Prosecution by the current conseiller of Gishyita secteur is not only defamatory, but it is wholly unsubstantiated and gratuitous.  The exhibits counsel referred to this morning, if I am not mistaken, the witness statements were on point 14, the seventh page referred to one contact person.  This, in our submission, is simple meaningless and amounts to mere speculation.  And if we were to speculate, we could also say that most of these witnesses were living in an area where the most important person or the main contact person is the conseiller, it might be logical that they indicate that name.  Therefore, it doesn't give any order -- reason to find that because of that indication that caused the Appellant any role in pushing them to commit the (Inaudible).  

In fact, the Appellant simply lists a series of unsupported allegations, but the record is clear that the allegation was first made in his closing brief.  The Appellant did not confirm any of the witness with that allegation.  The allegation was never considered by the Trial Chamber although this Honourable Appeals Chamber stated in Kajelijeli at paragraph 26, and I quote:  "The Trial Chamber was entitled to take into account the fact that the Appellant did not put such allegation to the witnesses for their reactions, this is when assessing the credibility of the witnesses."  But here the Trial Chamber did consider the allegation, but the allegation did not succeed at trial. 

Concerning Witness AP, for example, the Appellant challenged her credibility containing that her testimony is necessarily biased as it is part of the alleged plot organised by the conseiller of Gishyita.  AP is related to the conseiller.  But allow me to summarise briefly AP's testimony.  AP, a Tutsi woman, witnessed among other things two Tutsi men she identified by name being beaten to death by the Appellant and others.  She personally saw the Appellant whom she knew very well, raise a clap and hit one of the men over the head and said, "This is how you kill a Tutsi."  AP also witnessed the Appellant taking away two of one of his neighbour's daughters.  The girls followed him in his house where he raped them before exposing them outside completely naked so that the young men in the house could see, and I quote "what Tutsi girls looked like."  This can be found at paragraph 19 of the judgment.  

The Trial Chamber noted in paragraph 30 of the judgement that the Appellant only raised the allegation against AP in his closing brief and never confronted the witness with it during cross-examination.  This could be fatal to the allegation.  But, nevertheless, as I said earlier, the Trial Chamber considered the allegation in assessing AP's credibility and found at the end that this allegation did not in any way discredit AP's testimony, which it found to be internally consistent and I quote, "not shaken by extensive cross-examination by the Defence.  And notably, thinking about the plot, the Trial Chamber noted that in its view, AP did not exaggerate the evidence.  This could be found at paragraph 23 of the judgement. 
And the same reasoning and finding applies to the other alleged members of the plot.  Concerning Witness AQ, for instance, the Chamber was mindful of the allegation of partiality and stated as follows, that it has, I quote:  "Accordingly, considered her testimony with the necessary caution."  This is found at paragraph 106 of the judgement.  

It is note worthy, Your Honour, that all the witnesses who gave evidence on the same issues as the one allegedly involved in the plot were not listed by the Appellant as being part of the plot.  I will give very few examples.  The Trial Chamber relied on Witness BB and BC, two alleged members of the plot, regarding the attack against Tutsi refugees at Ngedombi hill.  

Another witness, Witness W, also testified on that issue to the satisfaction of the Trial Chamber.  W was not listed as a member of the plot.  Similarly, the Trial Chamber relied on the evidence of Witness BB, an alleged member of the plot regarding various events, including the assassination of 
Asiel Kambanda.  All the witnesses found credible by the Trial Chamber, in particular Witness AF, AT, BE, MBH also gave evidence on this issue accepted by the Trial Chamber.  

Regarding the issue of Kambanda -- I would like to point out that the way the Appellant argued today with regard to the beheading of Asiel Kambanda, who was new, it was not even in his brief.  In any case, the Trial Chamber's finding at paragraph 450 of the judgement is that, and I quote:  "The Prosecutor has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused participated in the killing of Tutsi businessman named Asiel Kambanda.  And I should say that paragraph 448 of the judgement simply summarised how the Appellant participated in the killing.  

And, I would like to add, with your permission, that I would subscribe to the Honourable Judge Shahabuddeen's proposition in this way.  In our submission, inferences could be drawn from the entire evidence, including the fact that Witness BB testified very clearly that the Appellant was among the students -- among the attackers and people shooting at them.  And Witness AF, if I am not mistaken, Witness AF did testify that it was the Appellant who beheaded Kambanda.  For the other witnesses who were not listed as members of the alleged plot, the Appellants once again repeats his argument raised at trial and refer Your Honours to some alleged inconsistencies and contradictions. 

I will refer to our brief here.  I will rely on our brief because I don't want to spend a lot of time explaining all those challenges and all the questions on those challenges.  I will simply say that, for instance, Witness AW, the Trial Chamber said about this witness that the thrust of this person's account is that as a refugee, he gave a detailed account of the Appellant's participation in the attack against Tutsis.  His evidence is largely similar to that of Witness W.  And just this Appellant is complaining -- is challenging the timing of the attack, the date of the attack and so on.  I would like to read to Your Honours just one passage of AW's testimony, that can be found in the transcripts of 14th April 2004, page 48, 
lines 31 to 37. 
(Pages 18 to 36 by Sithembiso Moyo)



































	1230H
MR. SEYE:
And I'm reading French, that's from the transcript.  

"The attack started in the morning and in the evening.  Each time they would attack us it was an order to kill people.  That was their sole objective.  Even at night they would kill people.  I am not in a position to give you any specific time, but I tell you but I can tell you that (unintelligible) participated in the attacks, but regarding the time, at any point in time, whether in the morning or in the evening, the attackers would kill people."  

One has to consider that the witnesses, the refugees on the hill were always on the run, being hunted down.  One has to consider that they were not standing at one point on one hill waiting for their enemies, followers or his friends to kill them.  The Tutsis were always on the run, and AW indicated in this regard, "How can I tell you where I was standing?  I would not stay in one spot.   Throughout the day we would run in the bushes."  14 April 2004, page 48, lines 18 to 20.  And in our submission, under normal circumstances, normal contradiction is disclosed in this witness evidence.  Therefore evidence must fail.  

At the end, the Trial Chamber considered the evidence of all these witnesses, AW, Witness W, and found that (unintelligible) participated in at least two large-scale attacks against the Tutsis at (unintelligible).  

Regarding Prosecution Witness BC, that does not demonstrate any error in the Trial Chambers finding that there was no contradiction in the witness's account of how her children were killed, and we are talking here about material contradictions.  

I should say that there is a (unintelligible) problem of paragraph 128 of the responding brief, this is the paragraph (unintelligible) read this morning about the killing of BC's children.  And my learned friend is correct that in the French transcript did talk about -- did say what he read, namely that the grenade, in French, the same grenade allegedly killed BC's children.  I should read some clarification herein that in our respondent brief filed in English, paragraph 128.  That portion of paragraph 128 reads as follows:  "Some refugees were killed by a grenade thrown by the applicant, himself, who also killed BC's children in the course of the attack on Kanombe hill" and we see that in the French version.  It is as follows:  "Some refugees were killed by a grenade thrown by the Appellant.  The same grenade killed BC's children."  He made that comment about contradictions between paragraph 128 and paragraph 129 of his appellant brief.  But based upon our original brief, the brief filed by the Prosecutor, there is no contradiction.  In fact, there is no contradiction in the Prosecutor's case and the affidavit given by BC.  
Contrary to the applicant's contention in 107 and 109 of his brief, BC did not testify that her children were killed by the grenade launched by the appellant.  In fact, during one attack against Kanombe hill on 10 April 1994, BC saw the appellant throwing a grenade which killed many Tutsis, she said.  Those not killed by the explosion were subsequently finished off by assailants with machetes.  

BC also described how later the same day, later the same day towards sundown, after the attack against Kanombe hill the appellant gruesomely killed her children -- cut the throat of her first child and cut off the arms of both of her children -- other children, sorry.  The appellant then cut the witness's two hands then completely cut off her left hand and hit her on the head and shoulders with a machete.  The trial judge saw BC.  The Trial Chamber assessed her evidence, including, in light of all the testimonies.  It noted, and I quote, "The consistent and corroborative testimony of BC, W and BB, it found BC credible."  And doesn't demonstrate otherwise.  

Turning now, very briefly, to my second point, burden of proof in relation to Defence witness on alibi.  Clearly -- and this is our position -- the Trial Chamber did not reverse the burden of proof with respect to Defence evidence including in relation to that.  The appellant assertion, very briefly, this morning found at paragraph 183 and 184 and paragraph 305 and to be certain -- of his brief, that the Trial Chamber reversed the burden of proof requiring him to provide what we call an absolute certainty of his absence from the crime scene is (unintelligible).  No error of law or fact is disclosed by the appellant on this issue.  And I will give a few examples on our position.  

We (unintelligible) to the general assessment of Defence evidence and the rationale of the alibi.  The appellant appeared to argue that any failure by the Defence to consider the circumstances in the defence of some -- evidence of some Defence witnesses as minor disclosed in fairness to a (unintelligible) stand out in the evolution of the evidence.  According to the (unintelligible), the 
Trial Chamber's conclusion disclosed such a double standard in relation to the evaluation of the testimony of Defence Witness DG and DF regarding the rape of several girls in the cemetery.  He also gave the example of the evidence of Witnesses BY, DK, BL and BF regarding the appellant's (unintelligible) in attacks on Kinyinya Hill (phonetic).  However, the question duly considered the numerous facts given by DG and DF, but given the vagueness of their evidence, the denial of any rape committed by the appellant, or in the region, while other witnesses testified to rape before the 
Trial Chamber.  

The Trial Chamber found it difficult to conclude that DG and DF were talking about the event at issue, namely the rape of several girls in the cemetery.  The evidence of Prosecution Witness AV on the same issue was found credible and accepted by the Trial Chamber.  

Similarly, the Trial Chamber gave cogent reasons for its dismissal of evidence given by Witness DY, DK, DN and DF.  Those witnesses simply say they didn't see that the attack and heard about any attacks, and I will not repeat our (unintelligible) point.  And I just would like to say one more thing, given the time, about the alibi.  

And I would say simply this:  The Trial Chamber below committed no error with respect to the lower alibi, in general, and as far as the alibi evidence.  

What the appellant raised as alibi is simply a complete denial.  He said that he could not have committed any of the crimes which occurred outside his home because he remained at his home in Gishyita continuously mourning his dead son from 8 to 16 April 1994, continuously.  

Your Honour, the appellant did leave his home during that period.  As the Trial Chamber found at paragraph 63 of the judgement, many credible Prosecution witnesses and different witnesses did see the accused in different places outside his home between 8 April 1994 and 16 April 1994.  

The evidence of at least two Defence witnesses, namely PQ28 and DC, contradicts the appellant alibi that Muhimana was in his home during that time.  TQ27 -- 28 testified he was among those who welcomed him and his father on the morning of 16 April.  

Defence Witness BC also places applicant at Mugunga church on 12 or 13 April 1994 during the looting of the CARITAS's foods store.  Once again, the burden remained full out on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the (unintelligible).  In our submission the Trial Chamber considered all the testimony weighing both credibility determination and the nature of corroborative evidence and (unintelligible) has the Prosecution had established the guilt.  

To sum up, the Trial Chamber made no error respecting the burden of proof.  The Trial Chamber was best placed to assess the credibility and reliability of witnesses called by the Prosecutor or by Defence and to better determine where the proof lay.  The Trial Chamber properly rated the alibi.  It levelly accepted the fundamental status of the evidence implicating (sic) their plan.  It properly came to the conclusion he was -- indeed, was present at the crime scene and committed the crime of which he was convicted.  

Given the time, Your Honour, I'll stop here.  Those are my submissions.  Unless if there are any questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.   Well, I think it is the right time to break, now.  We will break for lunch and we convene at three o'clock for the continuation of the response of the Prosecution.  This hearing is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1245H to 1500H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll resume now our hearing and I will give the floor to the Prosecution to continue its response.  

You have the floor, Ms. Bianchi.
MS. BIANCHI:
Thank you, and good afternoon, Your Honours.  

As indicated earlier by my colleague, Mr. Nsanzuwera, I will address, Your Honours, in respect of two arguments.  The first argument I will respond to is in relation to the several issues raised regarding alleged deficiencies in the pleading of certain paragraphs in the indictment.  I will address two separate issues in this section and will demonstrate that in each case the indictment was either not defective or any defect was cured through the provision of clear, consistent, and timely post-indictment information.  

I will then address two legal arguments that have been raised by the Appellant in his Appellant's brief in relation to the Trial Chamber's conviction for rape.  Turning first now to the responses to the Appellant's arguments on the issues of pleading deficiencies.  

The Appellant has raised several arguments alleging that the Trial Chamber made legal errors in its assessment of whether certain paragraphs in the indictment had been pleaded with the requisite specificity in order to ground the convictions against the Appellant.  The Appellant alleges many instances of the Appellant.  The Appellant alleges many deficiencies in his brief and the respondent will rely for the most part on the arguments he made in response to those arguments in the consolidated brief.  However, I will elaborate on two arguments.  

The first is with respect to the pleading of the rape of Witness BJ at the Mugonero complex.  And the second is with respect to the pleading of the murder of Pascasie Mukaremera.  

Turning then to the first argument respecting the challenges made to the pleading deficiencies concerning the rape of Witness BG at the Mugonero complex.  Under this argument the Appellant has complained that paragraph 62 of the indictment was deficient as it failed to specifically plead that the place of the crime that the rape took place was in the Mugonero hospital building, as opposed to just Mugonero complex.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, interpreters request counsel to kindly slow down, please.

MS. BIANCHI:
-- first consideration must be the fact whether the rape occurred in the hospital as opposed to the complex is a material fact, as opposed to the evidence.  The respondent submits that the fact that the rape occurred in the hospital is not a material fact.  The distinction to be termed between material facts and evidence can be a difficult one.  However, the purpose of pleading material facts is to give the Appellant sufficient notice of the case against him to allow him to prepare his Defence.  In the case of Kupreskic the Chamber offered some guidance on this point.  At paragraph 89 the judgement the Appeals Chamber stated, "a decisive factor in determining the degree of specificity with which the Prosecution is required to particularise the facts of this case in the indictment is the nature of the alleged criminal conduct charged to the Accused.  

In this case the criminal conduct charged to the Appellant was that during the attack on the Mugonero complex the Appellant committed the rape of BJ, therefore, in this context, the material facts underpinning this charge were the victim was BJ; the date was the 16th of April 1994; the crime was rape; and the place was the Mugonero complex.  The indictment identified that the rape occurred at the Mugonero complex and the hospital was one of three buildings comprising or making up the complex itself.  It was, in effect, the complex.  

It is important to keep in mind that the charge against the Appellant was that the entire complex was under attack on the 16th of April, and the rape comprised part of the many atrocities that were committed by the Appellant during this attack on the entire complex on that day.  

In any event, and in the alternative, if the Appeals Chamber were to determine this was a material fact, then this defect in the indictment was cleared through the provision of clear and timely post-indictment notice.  

First, it must always have been clear to the Appellant that Witness BJ would testify to the event having occurred in the hospital.  

Witness BJ was named in the indictment as the victim of the rape; her evidence was then summarised in the witness grid attached to the pre-trial brief, where it noted that her evidence was in relation specifically to paragraph 6(C)ii of the indictment, which charged the rape at the Mugonero complex.  The pre-trial brief was provided to the Appellant one month prior to the commencement of the trial.  In addition, Witness BJ's statement dated 15 November 1999 was clearly referred to in the witness grid of the pre-trial brief.  This statement was disclosed to Appellant on 14 March 2000 and, significantly, BJ's statement of 15 November 1999 mentioned that the rape occurred in the hospital building specifically.  

Therefore, in this context the Appellant had received sufficient notice and must have been aware that the precise allegation was that the rape took place in the hospital building of the complex on that day.  

The second consideration in this legal matter is whether the Appellant suffered any prejudice to his ability to defend himself due to the fact the pleading of the indictment did not specify the rape occurred in the hospital.  In this case, in order for the Appellant to succeed, the burden is on him to demonstrate that his Defence was materially prejudiced.  

The Appellant did not object to the evidence as it was elicited during the trial.  

During her testimony, Witness BJ clearly and consistently discussed being in the hospital during the attack and that this was where the rape took place.  Defence counsel cross-examined Witness BJ on this evidence concerning the rape, but never mentioned any discrepancies between the conflicts in the hospital or cross-examined her on the basis of her testimony concerning the hospital, thereby clearly indicating that counsel was ready to deal with the evidence on that basis.  

It should be noted that the Appellant did, however, raise the argument in one paragraph of his closing brief with no further substantiation of that argument.  

The Appeals Chamber has held, in an interlocutory appeal decision in the Bagosora et al case, the name of the decision is "Decision on Aloys Ntabakuze's Interlocutory Appeal on Questions of Law raised on 29 June 2006", Trial Chamber I's decision on motion for exclusion of evidence, which is dated 18th December 2006.  At paragraphs 45 and 46 of that decision the Appeals Chamber states that "Where an accused does not object to the evidence at the time it comes in at trial, it is then up to the accused to provide a reasonable explanation for its failure to raise the objection."  The Appeals Chamber also noted that the Defence should also demonstrate that it brought the objection as soon as possible thereafter.  

The Appellant has completely failed to do so up this case and, as such, the burden of proof must shift from the Prosecution to the Appellant to demonstrate that his ability to defend himself was materially impaired.  However, the Appellant has made no submissions in this regard.  It is entirely unclear how the failure to have charged that the rape took place in the hospital, as opposed to the Mugonero complex, could have materially impaired the Defence.  

Either the Appellant took part in the attack on the complex on that day or he didn't.  And, indeed, at trial the Appellant raised an alibi stating that he did not leave his home between the 8th and the 16th of April.  That alibi was discussed earlier by my colleague, Mr. Seye, and the Appellant called evidence to support that alibi.  As such, it is difficult to see how the difference between the hospital and complex could have prejudiced him in his ability to present his defence, therefore, that ground of appeal ought to fail.  

Turning, then, to the second allegation regarding deficiencies in seating in the indictment, that dealing with the pleading of the murder of Pascasie Mukaremera, the Appellant challenges that paragraph 71 of the indictment -- he challenges that paragraph in two respects.  First, he alleges that the paragraph did not plead the correct material facts, such as time and place of the crime.  And he, secondly, challenges the pleading on the question of the mode of liability for the murder.  

Now, with respect to the first issue, the pleading of the material facts, such as the time and place of the crime, the indictment alleges that the murder took place on Nyakiyambo (phonetic) hill toward the end of May and that the murder was committed by an Interahamwe on the instructions of the Appellant.  The evidence adduced at trial in the (unintelligible) which the Appellant was based was different.  The Trial Chamber considered the difference in the material facts and found that the Appellant had received proper notice of the material facts.  And this finding was legally correct, as I will demonstrate.  

In advance of the trial, on the 16th --14th of March 2000, the Prosecution disclosed to the Appellant the witness statement of Witness AW.  The witness statement was dated 12 December 1999, which set forth at page 4 the circumstances of the killing of Pascasie Mukaremera; including date of mid-May; the place of Rugona hill; the victim, which was also Pascasie Mukaremera; and the manner in which the Appellant caused her death and that is that that Appellant killed her himself.  

The statement of --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, Prosecution is to fast for interpretation.  Could she be requested to slow down, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask you to slow down for the interpreters. 
MS. BIANCHI:
I will, thank you.  

The summary of the anticipated testimony of Witness AW reads:  "The witness fled to Rugona hill in mid-May 1994."  The witness saw Muhimana opening the stomach of a pregnant Tutsi woman called Pascasie Mukaremera.  Now this statement was specifically referred to in the charts of the witness grid, and that charge also made reference to the charges in the indictment to which each witness's testimony was expected to correspond.  The chart made clear that Witness AW's anticipated evidence related to the charge under paragraph 71.  The Appeals Chamber of the International Tribunal have confronted similar circumstances in cases of Gacumbitsi and Naletilic and Martinovic with the material facts concerning a particular incident were not treated pleaded in the indictment, but were included in a chart of witnesses that set forth the facts, to-wit, each witness would testify, and clearly identified the charges in the indictment to which those facts corresponded.  And in both cases the Appeal Chamber accepted that the detailed information was sufficient to put the Accused on notice of what specific evidence was being alleged.  Likewise, in the case of Ntakirutimana, the Appeals Chamber held that when a witness statement, when taken together with unambiguous information contained in the pre-trial brief and the (unintelligible) was sufficient to cure a defect in the indictment.  

It is our submission that this situation is substantially similar to in those cases.  The only difference here is that in those earlier cases the indictment was silent as to the facts -- as to the facts, whereas, in this case the indictment pleaded facts that were different than those that were ultimately adduced in trial.  

However, in our submission, this does not cause any difference to be made between the two circumstances, particularly, in the circumstances of this case, the situation was one that the information was not ambiguous.  

Witness AW was the only witness that was going to testify to the rape of Pascasie Mukaremera and as such in the circumstances where his statement and the evidence in that statement was specifically referred to, the information was clear and unambiguous.  

Importantly, in determining whether the Appellant had clear and consistent notice, we can have requested subjective factors in the case that would indicate his own understanding of the charge against him.  As noted by the Trial Chamber, no objection was made at the time that the evidence was adduced by Witness AW.  That evidence can be referred to or can be found at the transcript of 
14 April 2004 at page 9, line 34, to page 11, line 24.  

Counsel for the Appellant went on to cross-examine the witness at length on his testimony about this event and referred several times to the statement of 12 December 1999, thereby exhibiting a familiarity with it and its contents.  

In the closing brief, the Appellant noted the contradictions between the facts alleged in the indictment and the facts adduced at trial, at paragraph 318 of the closing brief, where it is stated that, "The 
Trial Chamber will assess whether it has been lawfully and appropriately informed about the scene of the crime and whether the information thus provided by the indictment is adequately precise to enable this (unintelligible) to make the full and proper Defence."

It is our submission that this submission ought not qualify as an objection to the notice of the facts as the Defence did not specifically state that he was objecting on the basis of notice, nor did the Appellant address the question of whether his preparation had been materially impaired by any lack of notice, nor in the terms as I've described in the Bagosora et al decision at September 2006.  The Appellant has not discussed why he failed to raise the matter when the evidence was adduced at trial, nor has he raised the issue at the earliest possible time thereafter.  As such, the burden of establishing that he was prejudiced by the late notice rests with the Appellant which he has failed to discharge.  

Accordingly, the Trial Chamber's decision that the Appellant received proper notice of the underlying facts of the charges against him was correct.  

Turning now with respect to the mode of liability with which the Appellant was convicted for this same murder, the Prosecution acknowledges that the indictment pleaded ordering as a mode of liability, which was different than the ultimate conviction against the Appellant, which was for personal commission.  

However, the Trial Chamber's approach to entreatment of this issue was founded on correct legal principles and that the conviction of the Appellant for this murder was not an error.  

First, at paragraph 1 of the indictment it charged the Appellant with the following:  "That the said charges are brought pursuant to article 6(1) of the Statute.  The Appellant was therefore on notice that he could be convicted for any of the modes of liability included under Article 6(1)."  The Trial Chamber noted at paragraph 573 that commission and ordering are punishable offenses under Article 6(1) of the Statute.  

Now, the Prosecutor's knowledge is that as has been established by the Appeal Chamber cases of Kivutchka (phonetic) and Kalevitic (phonetic) that it is always preferable for the Prosecution in its best practice to be as specific as possible when (unintelligible) liability; however, a failure to do so is not necessarily fatal to a conviction on that charge.  

In reaching its decision, the Trial Chamber relied specifically on a statement made by the Trial Chamber in the Cyangugu case which indicated that where the concise statements of fact of a crime adequately describe the accused's role in the crime, then the Trial Chamber, based upon those facts, can make the legal qualifications as to the mode of liability by which an accused can be convicted.  

This line of reasoning is supported by statements that have been made by Appeals Chamber, which are analogous to the present scenario.  In the Kalevitic (phonetic) case the Appeals Chamber considered a pleading which had charged the Accused with having participated in the planning, preparation, or execution of serious violations of international humanitarian law.  

The Appeals Chamber stated that "Failure to identify the exact mode of participation is not necessarily fatal to an indictment if it nevertheless makes clear to the Accused the nature and cause of the charge against him."  And that reference can be found at paragraph 351 of the appeals judgement.  

Similarly, in the Kovorscika (phonetic) case the Trial Chamber convicted the Accused of having participated in a joint criminal enterprise where the indictment had not specifically stated joint criminal enterprise.  In doing so, the Trial Chamber held that it was within its discretion to characterise the form of participation of the Accused, if any, according to the theory of responsibility it deemed most appropriate within the limits of the indictment and insofar as the evidence permits.  

At paragraph 51 to 54 of the Kovorscika appeals judgement.  The Appeals Chamber quoted the statement of the Trial Chamber and then went on to uphold the conviction pursuant to joint criminal enterprise finding that the failure to plead joint enterprise in the indictment had been compensated for by the Accused having received information which detailed the factual basis of the charges against him.  

Now, in his brief, the Appellant has relied on a statement made in the Rutaganda Appeals judgement where the Appeals Chamber stated that an example of where prejudice might arise is where the existence of inaccuracies could mislead the Accused as to the nature of the charges against him.  However, the appellants have not given the full quote of the Appeals Chamber.  In that case the Appeals Chamber went on to the qualify that statement by stating that, "Depending on the specific circumstances of each case, the question to be determined is whether an Accused is reasonably able to identify the crime and criminal conduct alleged in each of the paragraphs of the indictment.  
Therefore, the principle in these cases supports the Trial Chamber's determination in this case that it was open to the Trial Chamber to convict the Accused for the mode of liability not specifically treated in the indictment, as the Appellant had received sufficient information of the factual basis of the charge against him."  

It is further our submission that the issue of prejudice must be understood in concrete real terms.  In this case the allegation in the indictment was always that the Appellant was at the scene of the crime during the murder of Pascasie Mukaremera.  As treated in the indictment, the Appellant stood beside Gisambo giving him instructions to commit the murder.  

In the second scenario, Gisambo stood by the Appellant as the Appellant took the machete and committed the murder himself.  Therefore, the key factual allegation -- the key factual basis, as alleged by the Prosecution, was always constant, and that is that the Appellant was at the scene of the crime and participated in that murder.  As such, the Trial Chamber made no legal error, either with respect to the legal qualification of the method by which the Appellant participated in the murder or with its finding that the material facts under conviction had been provided to the Appellant by way of clear consistent and timely information.  

I will turn, then, Your Honours, to my second argument regarding issues that have arisen with respect to the convictions of rape.  

The Trial Chamber found the Appellant guilty of rape as a crime against humanity in relation to ten incidents of rape, seven incidences of which were committed personally by the Appellant and three others having been committed with his encouragement.  

Now, I will have just two legal issues that were raised by the Appellant in his appeals brief and I will briefly address another argument that was raised for the first time during the Appellant's argument this morning.  

First I will address the arguments raised by the Appellant that the conviction for the rapes of the two girls, Languida (phonetic) and Languese, (phonetic) cannot be sustained as the witness who testified to these, rapes, was not an eyewitness and, therefore, could not testify as to the actus reus or sexual penetration of the victim.  However, our submission will be that such evidence can be adduced by circumstantial evidence and, on the circumstances of this case, the only reasonable conclusion is that the Appellant had raped the two girls in his home.  

Second, I'll address Appellant's arguments regarding legal qualification of his conviction for abetting the rape of Witness BJ.  

The Appellant has complained that the Trial Chamber's conviction of him for this rape was legally unfounded as Article 6(1) did not permit a conviction for allowing, that is not recognised mode of liability.  However, as will be demonstrated, the Appellant's argument is legally unfounded as the 
Trial Chamber's conviction was for abetting, which is a mode of argument recognised under Article 6(1).  

I will then briefly address an article raised by Appellant's counsel this morning regarding what I understood to be a challenge to the pleading and the notice he received regarding the rape of the three girls in the Mubuga cemetery on the 15th of April.  Turning, then, first, to the challenges that have been raised with respect to the convictions made against the Appellant in respect of the rapes of Languida and Langese.  The Appellant raised the argument that the Trial Chamber erred in the application of the legal standards as settled in Kunarac in convicting him for the rapes of these girls, as the witness who testified to the rapes could not establish the actus reus and the sexual penetration of the two girls.  

However, it is our submission that Kunarac can in no way be relied on to establish.  That the rape can only be established through eyewitness and that is direct testimony.  

The Appellant's position is unsupported by the jurisprudence.  As argued at paragraph 107 of the respondent's brief, "It is well-established jurisprudence of the Tribunal that facts can be established during direct or circumstantial evidence."  There is no exception to this principle for the crime of rape.  If there were, it would result in a (unintelligible) for the crime of rape which is not supported in law and which would have the disastrous effect of creating a two hybrid (phonetic) for establishing that a rape occurred.  Now, as established in the Vasiljevic appeals judgement, at 458, "A circumstantial case consists of evidence of a number of different circumstances which, taken in combination, point to the guilt of the Accused person because they would usually exist in combination only because the Accused did what is alleged against him."  Such a conclusion would be the only reasonable conclusion available.  

In this case, the fact that the rape of the two girls occurred by the Appellant in the Appellant's home is the only reasonable conclusion available, based on the circumstances surrounding the events as observed by and testified to by Witness AP.  

First, Witness AP observed Appellant taking the girls into his home.  Then the witness heard the girls screaming horribly and shouting the Appellant's name and she heard that they were screaming that they did not expect him, the Appellant, to do that to them.  

Witness AP next observed the girls, shortly after hearing these screams being led out of the house by the Appellant.  The girls were stark naked and, as she said, they were walking with their legs apart.  The Appellant further degraded these girls calling on the public to come and see what Tutsi girls looked like, which can only be interpreted as a form of humiliation that was sexual in nature.  

In our submission, all of these circumstances can only point to the conclusion that what was occurring in the house was the rape of those two girls by the Appellant.  No other crime could reasonably be inferred from these circumstances.  

For example, the Appellant this morning mentioned that perhaps the Appellant was attempting to murder these girls.  However, such a conclusion is not reasonable on the evidence.  Witness AP did not mention any injuries or wounds that she saw on the girls as they left the home or were led out of the home.  And it doesn't make common sense that if the Appellant had failed to murder these girls in the home that he would give up and, instead, parade them in public naked.  

A key circumstance in determining what the crime must have been was that the girls were led out of the house naked for other people to see what Tutsi girls looked like.  This sort of treatment is certainly a sexual degradation which coincides with the crime of a sexual nature being under way.  As the parading of the girls can only be seen as a continuation of the treatment of the girls inside the house.  

Also, on these circumstances, the only reasonable conclusion is that the Appellant committed the rape.  The Appellant was in control of the event from the beginning to the end.  He led the girls into the house.  The girls screamed his name during the attack.  Then he led the girls back out of the house.  As such, he was the main person involved and controlled the entire event.  Therefore, the Trial Chamber's findings are eminently reasonable and within the parameters of the law.  

Additionally, the Appellant attacks the Trial Chamber's finding as an error of law alleging that the Trial Chamber ignored the legal reasoning it employed in other similar circumstances in its judgement.  In particular, with respect to their reasoning about the rape, the Appellant, in his brief, referred to the rape of one Espérance by an Interahamwe called Gisambo.  The rape had been testified to by a witness who was not an eyewitness to the actual rape.  But the Appellant's argument in this regard is a mischaracterisation of the Trial Chamber's reasoning.  The Trial Chamber did not set down some sort of rule as implied by the Appellant that it was necessary to be an eyewitness to the sexual penetration of the victim in order to grant a conviction for rape.  

The conclusion reached by the Trial Chamber about the rape of Espérance was not based on the fact that witness AQ was not an eyewitness.  Instead, the Trial Chamber did not find that the rape did not occur, but found that the Prosecution has failed to prove the allegation that the Accused offered Esperance to Gisambo and that he raped her in the Accused's presence.  The emphasis of the finding is therefore on the relation of the rape to the Appellant and not whether or not the rape actually occurred.  

The Trial Chamber limited its findings on the implication of the evidence to the involvement of the Appellant and thereby focused its conclusion on those issues, not generally on whether or not Gisambo actually raped Esperance.  

Now, an oral argument this morning, Appellant's counsel referred to other findings made by the Trial Chamber where it did not find allegations of rape to have been proven.  Those particular arguments were included in the Appellant's reply brief, which brief is not a part of the record as it was irregularly filed; however, I will just briefly address those submissions as well.  When looked at properly, looked at the examples given by the Appellant, the Trial Chamber's findings do not stand for what the Appellant claimed they do.  In each of the examples cited by the Appellant, the fact that witness did not personally witness the rape was one of many factors taken in consideration as the overall circumstantial evidence surrounding that particular charge.  The fact that the witness was not an eyewitness was not the determining factor for any of those conclusions.  

So, for example the Appellant claims that Witness BI's evidence on the rapes of three women was rejected because he was not an eyewitness in attendance during the rape.  This is a misreading of 
Trial Chambers' reasoning.  

At paragraph 224 of the judgement the Trial Chamber looked at the entirety of the evidence of 
Witness BI, which was that BI had been told by the girls that they had been taken away and raped, but the Trial Chamber specifically noted that the evidence was too unspecific to be relied upon.  And, in particular, the Trial Chamber noted that the witness could not say who raped whom and therefore the Trial Chamber did not accept the evidence because it lacked specificity in relation to the actual participation of the Appellant.  

Again with respect to the allegations made by the Appellant concerning the testimony given by 
Witness AU regarding the rape of two women in the Mugonero hospital, again the Trial Chamber looked at the entire total circumstances of the situation, including the vantage point of the witness, and the specificity of his testimony, and the specificity as to the Appellant's own actions in order to assess whether it can make a reasonable conclusion based upon the circumstantial evidence.  Therefore, once again, the fact that the witness is not an eyewitness was one factor in the overall matrix of facts whether a circumstantial case has been made out.  

Therefore the Appellant's arguments in this regard are without legal basis.  The Trial Chamber's findings in relation to Languida and Langese are consistent with the mode of assessment employed by the Trial Chamber throughout its judgement.  

Turning now to the allegations concerning the findings regarding the rape of Witness BG.  The Appellant here argues that the Trial Chamber erred in law in entering a conviction against the Appellant whose Article 6(1) did not permit a conviction based on allowing someone to do something, as it is not a mode of liability.  

However, the Appellant has distorted the Trial Chamber's findings and thus his arguments are unfounded.  

The Appellant has completely ignored the Trial Chamber's actual findings, which can be found at paragraph 553 where the Trial Chamber found that the act of permitting Mugonero to abduct BG resulted in the Appellant having abetted the rape of BG.  

Therefore the Trial Chamber took the factual finding that when Mugonero asked the Appellant for permission to take BG away with him, and when the Appellant allowed Mugonero to abduct BG, knowing that he wanted to rape her, within the terms of this statute this permission qualified as the mode of liability of abetting.  

The Appellant this morning argued that the Trial Chamber's conclusion was ill-founded and defining was based on the presence of the Appellant, yet as the Appellant said, he was not present during that rape.  

However, again, the Appellant's argument is ill-founded.  And at paragraph 553 clearly the Trial Chamber has found the Appellant abetted the rape by having allowed Mugonero to abduct BG, knowing that BG wanted to rape (sic) and, as such, the Trial Chamber's findings are legally intact and correct.  

I will turn, last, Your Honours, to just briefly an argument that was raised this morning for the first time during Appellant's counsel's argument with respect to the rapes of Colette, Alphonsine, and Agnés in the cemetery, in the Mubuga cemetery on the 15th of April.  The Appellant seems to be raising a complaint about the sufficiency of the pleading of those rapes.  The Appellant's counsel regretted defending himself on these charges because he had been taken by surprise because the charge does not appear in the indictment.  The Appellant, however, did not further elaborate on or substantiate this argument and this argument did not appear in his Appellant's brief.  But just to address this very briefly, Your Honour, you will find that at paragraphs 193 to 196 of the judgement the Trial Chamber deals with the detail of the pleading of this particular charge noting that the indictment alleged that Witness AV had been raped in the cemetery, whereas the evidence adduced demonstrated that it was not AV that had been raped, but another person by that same first name.  

Now, as noted by the Trial Chamber, the Prosecution, during trial, sought to clarify this mistake for the record and noted that a typographical error had been made concerning who was raped in the cemetery, indicating that the Prosecution had not meant to charge that AV, herself, had not been raped.  When specifically asked about this clarification the Appellant did not about object to the clarification.  

The Trial Chamber then considered all the circumstances that demonstrated that the Appellant had received sufficient notice of this charge and asked that Appellant's argument, as I understand it, to have been made this morning, is without basis and the Appeals Chamber ought not allow it.  
Subject to any questions, Your Honours may have for me, those are all of my submissions concerning the convictions for rape and with respect to the pleading issues.  

Questions?  Judge Daqun.
JUDGE DAQUN:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I have a question of the rape apparent to the two girls, Languida and Langese.  

The Prosecution claims that it is the only reasonable conclusion that Appellant raped the two girls in his house.  My question is that (unintelligible) arrogance that the Accused is alone in his house when the incident happened.  If there are other people present in his house, how could you come to the conclusion that it was the Appellant who raped the two girls?  Thank you, very much.
MS. BIANCHI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

In fact, I believe that the evidence on the record was that there were other people in the Appellant's home during that event.  However, in our submission, the circumstances surrounding this event can only point to the Appellant in the sense that the Appellant was involved in this rape from the very beginning to the very end.  He was the one who went to someone else's home and brought the two girls back to his house.  What is specifically -- what we submit is significant, is that Witness AP's evidence was that during this event, while the girls were screaming and something horrible was being done to them in the home, they were mentioning, specifically, the Appellant's name.  And in conjunction with specifically mentioning the Appellant's name, they said they didn't expect him to do that to them because they knew the Appellant, they had been led to his house because they knew him and as Witness AP testified, they trusted him because they knew him.  

So, the surprise and shock that they demonstrated during this event was directed at the Appellant.  And our submission is significant that no one else was mentioned by Witness AP, nobody else's name was mentioned, even though they may have been in the house.  As the event unfolds, the Appellant was the only one who comes out of the house with the two girls who are naked and are described as walking with their legs apart, which gives the indication that something sexual in nature had happened in the home.  And, again, the Appellant further degraded the women in a very sexual nature by saying, "Come and see what Tutsi girls look like."  So on the strength of that, it was the Appellant involved from the beginning to the end.  It was the Appellant's name being called out in distress by the girls in the home and it was the Appellant, again, who emerged from the house with the girls and continued to sexually degrade them.  In these circumstances it is our submission that the conclusion must be that what was happening in the home at the time that the women were screaming out someone's name that someone was doing something terrible to them, that that was the Appellant and that the rest of the circumstances surrounding the event must again be -- can only lead to the reasonable conclusion that what was the crime, the crime was rape.  There is no other reasonable conclusion on the facts that a crime other than rape, a crime that was very sexual in nature, was being committed in the home.
JUDGE DAQUN:
Well, maybe sexual assault, maybe aiding and abetting rape.
MS. BIANCHI:.
It may be, Your Honours, that he aided and abetted the rape.  The fact was he was involved, he was participating in what was happening in the home.  Now, if someone else was also involved, we don't have evidence to that.  There was no one in the house that we were able to call to give evidence of the specific nature of the event.  However, the circumstantial evidence is that the Accused -- the Appellant was involved in and participated in that rape.  The calling of his name, in our submission, was inclusive that he was involved.  Now there is no evidence to say whether he was personally committing or whether he aided and abetted, but the fact of the matter is that the evidence, as far as our submission goes, was he was involved in participating in the sexual assault on the girls in the home.  When he brought them back out, that was a continuation of the sexual assault.  

As the Trial Chamber found in Akayesu, the parading of the girls in the public naked is a form of sexual violence.  It is a sexual assault in and of itself and so for that very particular fact the Accused was guilty of committing sexual violence against the girls.  But when we come back to the continuation, it was a continual event, and that is our submission, Your Honour.  
JUDGE DAQUN.
Thank you, very much.  

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If there are no more questions?  There are no more questions.
MS. BIANCHI:
Thank you.  Those complete my submissions and I will turn back to co-counsel, Mr. Nsanzuwera, to discuss with Your Honours with respect to the issue of (unintelligible).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.
MR. NSANZUWERA:
Mr. President, Your Honours, we would like to conclude the Prosecutor's submissions by responding to the sentencing by the Trial Chamber.  The Appellant was sentenced to life, taking into account the circumstances of the crime.  The Appellant did not demonstrate to this Chamber that the Trial Chamber acted ultra vires by convicting him to life.  

The Appellant individually raped these victims.  Some of them were raped on several occasions.  One of the victims was a minor at the time.  She was 15 years old.  That is in paragraph 57 of the judgement.  The Appellant committed a crime of killing, and his direct and active participation was demonstrated, as well as his violence and cruel nature, just as was demonstrated during the rape.  During the rape of Witness AU the Appellant did not stop hitting her head against the floor.  These crimes committed with disregard for human rights, were, according to the expression of the Trial Chamber, were committed by a man who was respected in his community, contrary to what the counsel of the Appellant submitted that the Appellant was not a monster.  This man was a man who was respected.  Not only was he a conseiller of secteur, but he was a well-known person in the 
Gishyita commune and a father.  

The Appellant says that he saved the niece of his wife who married a Tutsi after the genocide of the Tutsis.  This is referred to in his brief under the topic Services Rendered to Tutsis, and I refer to the Appellant's brief, page 366.  The fact of saving the niece of his wife could not be considered as circumstance -- annotating circumstances because those who were raped were also Tutsis.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the Appellant has committed serious crimes.  The Appeals Chamber pointed out the monstrosity with which the crimes were committed and this can be found in 
paragraphs 610 and 613 of the judgement.  The Appellant argues that the convictions, the various convictions -- or the Prosecutor pleads that the life imprisonment be maintained.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
I have only one question, as regards aggravating factors Jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber, I refer to Sakijis (phonetic), where accused and later Appellant, was a physician.  It was said that there is no specific obligation and this can't be taken as an aggravating factor.  Wouldn't you compare the situation with a situation of a conseiller?  So that you can't argue that his role in the community has to be seen as an aggravating factor, as the Trial Chamber held, because he should protect life and not kill life, I'm, personally, in favour of his argument, but we have to take account jurisprudence of the 
Appeals Chamber.  And, second, do you feel the Trial Chamber was right in paragraph 608 to take it also as an aggravating factor that crimes were committed in the presence of others, only that the questions be litigated, not to be misunderstood?
MR. NSANZUWERA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  If I understood your question clearly, there are two aspects to you.  The first  aspect relates to the fact that the Appellant was conseiller de secteur and you are asking me if that may be considered as an aggravating circumstance.  I say yes, because the Appellant, as a conseiller and a respected personality with a lot of clout in his community, enjoyed the confidence of the people under him and he betrayed this confidence that the people had in him.  

Regarding paragraph 608, the fact of having raped these women in public, the Trial Chamber was of the view that this constituted an aggravating circumstance because, indeed, as the Chamber saw it, that added on to the humiliation that was inflicted on the victims.  The victims were humiliated through the rape of the Appellant and also by being paraded by others and that is why the Trial Chamber considered that as an aggravating circumstance.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Shahabuddeen has a question.
JUDGE SHAHABUDEEN:
If you look at paragraph 604 of the trial judgement, on this question of the duty of Muhimana as a conseiller to protect life and to stay away from committing crimes, is an act being dealt with by the 
Trial Chamber?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If Counsel is speaking, the interpreters cannot --
JUDGE SHAHABUDEEN:
After describing Muhimana as conseiller, the Trial Chamber states this constitutes an aggravating factor.  So, has the Trial Chamber considered this matter?  Yes or no.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The Trial Chamber based itself or the fact it places the whole event within the community, the context of the community.  Reference is not being made to his position as a conseiller but a person within the community who is respected within the community.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDEEN:
As I read this paragraph in its entirety for you, "Mika Muhimana was a conseiller and a well-known person in the Gishyita commune where most of the crimes were committed and occupied a position of influence in the community.  Instead of using or attempting to use his position within the community to promote peace and (unintelligible), he actively participated in the atrocities.  This constitutes an aggravating factor.  

Are we called upon to do anything additional to what the Trial Chamber said it would do?  
(Pages 37 to 55 by Rex Lear)



1555H
MR. NSANZUWERA:
Your Honour, I think this is within the discretionary powers of the Trial Chamber to consider as constituting an aggravating factor the fact that Mika was not only a conseiller but also a person known to all within the commune.  This falls within the discretion of the Trial Chamber to consider the fact that the Appellant enjoyed the respect of the community as an aggravating factor.
JUDGE GUNËY:
Thank you, Counsel.
JUDGE SCHOMBURG:
May I ask your opinion, in the absence of paragraphs 604, 608 and 609, would you say this would have any impact on the outcome or any impact on the sentence?  
MR. NSANZUWERA:  
If any of these paragraphs were not in the judgment, the Chamber could have convicted the Appellant to life imprisonment on account of the gravity of the crimes committed.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any other questions?  Do you have any other submissions, any other response?  
MR. NSANZUWERA:
(Not translated) ... yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I take it.  So now, that's the case.  According to the scheduling order, we will now break for half an hour and reconvene at 4:30 to hear the Appellant's reply.  

The hearing is adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1600H to 1630H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I call the session to order and give the floor to the Defence for Muhimana for its reply.  
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  We have followed the submissions made by the different members of the Office of the Prosecutor.  It is not our intention to respond to each of the arguments invoked but we will, however, say a few words on some of the statements made by them.  

May I first and foremost note that it is not because the issue of the Interahamwe as well as the links with one or the other of the convicted persons was not mentioned in either cases judged here that the Appellant in the instant case should not say anything and not demand that a definition or information -- additional information be provided compared to what was provided by the trial judge.  Let me also state that it is important in assessing the behaviour of the Accused that one not -- does not minimise the role that the Prosecution, as well as the trial judges, have played, or, rather, the role that the trial judges have conferred to the Appellant in his capacity as conseiller de secteur, thus making this an aggravating circumstance, especially in paragraph 604 of the judgment. 

Clearly, it is not stated anywhere that the conseiller committed or perpetrated any crime in his capacity as conseiller.  However, on the basis of his status, he was shown to be an individual who used his position in order to perpetrate crimes which have to do with the temporal jurisdiction-- the subject matter of the ICTR.  

If we look at other legal systems, I could say that the important social position of the Accused and his prominent position should rather be considered as a mitigating factor. 

The matter of the genocidal intent has been mentioned in this courtroom.  To my mind this is a very complex matter in the trials which take place at the ICTR, especially when one is to define the mens rea in the crime of genocide.  The issue of genocide and crimes against humanity is that at times definitions tend to overlap, especially when crimes against humanity, pursuant to the statute of the ICTR, is defined on the basis of discriminatory criteria.  In such cases, one has difficulty establishing the difference between the specific mens rea and the moral elements specific to crimes against humanity.  The Appellant states that, after hearing the Prosecutor's submission trying to determine genocidal intent on the basis of the acts, the utterances, the general context, the scale of the atrocities committed, and so on and so forth, the Prosecutor has not yet been able to demonstrate to us the specificity of the mens rea of genocide.  Especially since when one tries to define genocide, one would want to convince us that the planning or the political planning are not part of the definition of genocide.  But when one is to establish the mens rea, we are told that one is to take due account of external elements such as a number of facts, their scale, their systematic nature or their generalised nature.  So one notes that we have not yet been able to solve this matter.  In what way did the Prosecutor establish that in the instant case there was such a thing as genocidal intent if the elements are the acts, the utterances, the general context, the scale of the atrocities, how has one been able to specify the act -- the mens rea of genocide if one of the aspects is the fact of targeting a group because of its belonging to a specific ethnic, political or religious group?  We have not yet heard from the Prosecutor what makes a difference between genocide and crimes against humanity when one is to establish the actus reus of such acts. 

We have heard a representative of the Office of the Prosecutor attempt to tell us that the Appellant erred in his assessment of the evidence as adduced, and in order to make its submission legitimate, the representative of the Prosecutor stated that the Trial Chamber used its discretionary powers and that all the challenges we met here should be deemed inadmissible since they were questioning the sovereign powers of the trial judges. 

Obviously, this is a mode of reasoning which we hear quite often and which is favourable to the theory of the Prosecutor, but if one was not to act simply on the basis that the trial judges have discretionary powers then there would be no need for the Appeals Chamber.  If the Appeals Chamber was set up, it is for it to be able to remind the trial judges that their discretionary powers of assessment of evidence is not limited and that any sentence must be motivated.  This is the interest of the Appeals Chamber and it is also the reason why we have adopted such an approach.  

Regarding factual findings, the trial judges have to make sure that the criterion of reasonableness is taken into account.  I have looked into a dictionary which is not a legal dictionary, of course, but which provides us with common-sense definitions of words, and I did this in order to have a definition of "reason."  I used the Petit Larousse, the illustrated version thereof.  This dictionary says that "reason" is the intellectual capacity to reason and is also the fact of submitting one's mind to justice and equity.  Justice and equity, what does that mean?  Well, it means that the trial judge, by virtue of his sovereign powers of assessment of the evidence, must not only use his mind but must do so in conformity with justice and equity.  It is not enough for the trial judge to reason in order to be deemed reasonable.  He must also do so subject to justice and equity.  That is the reason why when we invoked the matter of the plot hatched by an individual occupying the functions of the Appellant and also using the Appellant's assets, we wanted the trial judge to have understood that such testimonies were unbiased and did not meet the criteria of justice and equity.  That is the reason for which we referred each and everyone to the evidence or the exhibits which established the particular link between this man and the witnesses.  

When I heard the Prosecutor refer to the murder of Kabanda, I failed to understand the interpretation made of BD's testimony.  According to that witness, the Appellant was amongst those who shot Kabanda.  What does that mean?  How many people shot at Kabanda?  The Appellant drew your attention to the fact that Witness BB himself stated that when Kabanda was shot at, he was fleeing from the attackers.  We put the question to him during cross-examination and asked him whether he was fleeing while looking back, and his answer was no, and the conclusion we drew was that he never saw who had shot at Kabanda. 

As for the grenade which allegedly killed the children of Witness BC, we are told today that the texts we had were not correct and that there had been an error in translation.  We take note of that fact, but at the same time we wonder whether that prevents us from stating that this information was taken note of since it was part of documents which were provided to the Appellant and the error was not notified to us. 
As for the defects in the indictment, I believe enough has been said on the matter, but we have heard the Prosecution stating that no objections were raised on our part.  It is my submission that objections can be raised as quickly as possible but that can only be so -- if the Appellant has not been able to make -- to raise objections, isn't this proof that elements were provided at the very last minute and that the Appellant was thus not in a position to prepare his defence correctly?  Is one to consider that when objections were not made as rapidly as possible, the truth must be ignored and that one should no longer consider that there was a defect in the indictment?  Let me say, in passing, that this is one of the merits of this Tribunal, that the indictment was well defined and that the modalities for its amendment were also well determined.  

And with your leave, Mr. President, I believe there are elements which are based on internal law that are not taken account.  In Rule 89, we are told that regarding the rules of evidence, the rules set forth in this section shall govern the proceedings before the Chambers; the Chambers shall not be bound by national rules of evidence.  When one is trying to convince us that on every occasion when an objection will not be raised rapidly or will be raised with some delay, this would lead to a situation whereby one would consider that all the defects have been cured with as a consequence that the truth might not be told in this Appeals Chamber.  I have tried to look into the statute or the rules of procedure and evidence to determine in which part thereof it was stated that objections were to be raised at a specific stage of the procedure, and I have found no such mention.  I do not know whether this is any national rule coming from the Anglo Saxon system, but I believe a balance has to be struck taking into account the civil law system.  

As you are aware in the civil law system, and, of course, I'm making the statement subject to the appreciation of the President of the Appeals Chamber, a criminal judge is an active judge who will not merely base his findings on the due diligence of parties.  A criminal judge takes initiatives because his main concern is the determination of the truth.  And so under Rule 89(b) says that in cases not otherwise provided for in this section, a chamber shall apply rules of evidence which will best favour a fair determination of the matter before it and are consonant with the spirit of the statute and the general principles of law.  

With respect, I would like to request from the Appeals Chamber that it determine to what extent the rules of procedure which would not otherwise be provided in the rules might have been borrowed from another legal system or from any legal system, international legal system.  And as a consequence, I wish to request that the Appeals Chamber be as active as the Trial Chamber when the objective is the manifestation of the truth.    

I now wish to turn to the issue of the rape of BJ.  I believe this is a matter that has been developed sufficiently, that is to say, to determine which act was committed by the Appellant as referred to in Article 6 of the Statute.  We have heard authorised, permit, aid, abet, but all of those have not been elaborated on enough since, as you will note in our appeals brief, specific questions were put to Mrs. BJ, the witness.  The witness was asked what the Appellant had told her, and this question remained unanswered.  The witness was asked what were the acts perpetrated by the Appellant.  There was no response.  What was the attitude of the Appellant?  No answer was provided either.  So why is it that the Prosecution, whose obligation it is to look into Prosecution evidence but also Defence evidence, has continued stating that the Appellant authorised an Interahamwe to commit a rape?  Why focus on that specific aspect?  

Regarding Agnés Mukagatare, I wish to refer to the judgment in its paragraph 195 in which we note that the Chamber noted that the Defence had expressed some reservations on the fact of including Agnés Mukagatare in the indictment during the pre-trial brief.  The Chamber recognises that reservations were expressed by the Chamber since it was not in possession of the document in question and it wished to verify the information provided by the Prosecutor.  Unfortunately, as the judgment specifies, the Chamber did not return to the matter after the commencement of the Defence case. 

So, the onus is on the Appeals Chamber to determine whether the approach of the Prosecution was sufficient in order to cure the defect in the indictment.  

With your leave, Your Honours, I also wish to locate an excerpt in which the Prosecutor, in person, acknowledges the fact that after having listened to the judgment on appeal in the Ntakirutimana case, that the Prosecution would not continue to mention facts that were not contained in the indictment. 

Mr. President, with your leave, I am attempting to locate the excerpt I am referring to.  I believe I have found it in the transcript of the 18th of January 2005, page 53, lines 14 and 20 -- or, rather, lines 14 to 20.  I wish to quote the words of the Prosecutor, in person, during the final submissions:  "To conclude, let me now turn to matters of evidence, of additional evidence on rapes that were not specifically pleaded in the indictment.  I am going to refer to jurisprudence.  We have followed the sentence -- the hearing of the sentence in the Ntakirutimana case, the Appeals Chamber.  You will recall that we filed our brief before the Appeal judgment in the Ntakirutimana case was given, but we heard this judgment and we heard what was stated by the Trial Chamber.  We are no longer of the opinion that all the charges that are not specifically pleaded in the indictment should be reviewed or should be retained and reviewed by the Trial Chamber with a view to sentencing the Accused," end of quote.  So the Prosecutor, in person, in his final submissions renounced any allegation which would not have been contained in the indictment.  
This brings me, Mr. President, to the issue of the sentence.  I have heard a representative of the Office of the Prosecutor refer notably to the rape of Witness AU whose head was hit on the floor on several occasions.  If one uses or relies on such testimony to ask for the refusal of any mitigating factors would be an error because it would mean that one would rely on an accusation which has not been established. 

May I refer you to our notice of appeal or, rather, our appeal brief in its paragraph 268 or, rather, paragraphs 268 to 275.  We shall note that in this brief, we challenged the site of the alleged crime.  The witness was in such a position from the beginning to the end of his testimony to determine in what location her rape took place.  She sometimes talks about a church, sometimes of a large room, a small room; sometimes she refers to a corridor.  In other words, there are many things one can find in such a testimony, and we do not believe that the Trial -- the Appeals Chamber should maintain or retain the aggravating circumstances as defined by the Trial Judge on the basis of such testimony. 
(Pages 56 to 61 by Leslie Todd)
























1700H 
MR. SONGA:
Regarding the sentence, I quoted a long excerpt of the text by Desmond Tutu, Nobel Prize winner, regarding the situation in South Africa, and this in order to try to provide insight on the situation prevailing in Rwanda.  When the trial took place, it was victory that came into place within the sentence, and the Judges and the Prosecutor packed their bags and went back to their respective far-away countries.  But in the case of Rwanda, the mission that was entrusted to you by the Security Council, Mr. President, Your Honours, was to reconcile the Rwandan people.  Such a reconciliation can never occur if through excessive sentences handed down, the Rwandan citizens would no longer be able to find themselves on the soil all together.  It might be that at any point in time and by 2010, you will pack your bags and go back to your respective countries, but the Rwandans would still be amongst themselves.  What would have been the purpose of justice if in its way of rendering decisions, the prospect of reconciliation has not been taken into account, has been completely overlooked?  That was the reason for my quotation of Desmond Tutu's saying so that above and beyond what is entailed, we remember the need for reconciliation.  

May I conclude, Mr. President, by reiterating what I said regarding the Security Council's strategy for the closing up of the Tribunal as well as to recommendations made by the Security Council to the two international tribunals, for them to be able to distinguish between the big fish and the small fry, and that, in that spirit, that everything done be -- that these aspects be taken into account in your deliberations when you will be given the responsibility of providing a fair sentence.  I will merely provide the reference of such a document which can be found in the basic texts of the Tribunal, 2005 edition on page 39. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I wish to thank you for the attention given to the Appellant and his counsel.  And let me conclude with what I should have started with, that is to say, extend to you my best greetings for the year 2007.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Songa. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
Mr. Songa, I have been interested in your submission, not only you touched upon the functions of this tribunal to promote reconciliation.  Well, that is an important function, but I believe we must see it in respective regard being heard to the fact that this is above all, a judicial institution.  

Now, Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, I believe, once explained that, "Yes, it is the function of the court such as this to promote reconciliation, but that that function is best discharged by its single-minded administration of justice as a court of law."  How do you react to that proposition, in other words, the Tribunal, if it considers a sentence to meet the justice of the case, must not impose another sentence just because it considers that this other sentence is better designed to promote reconciliation?  
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Your Honour.  It is true that a mission such as that of the reconciliation of Rwandans cannot be the exclusive preserve of a judicial institution even if on the other hand I must hasten to add that it would be unfortunate that such a mission be lost sight of by a judicial institution.  At the same time, I would like to say the following:  The Tribunal as a judicial institution, must pass a sentence within its discretion and regarding which it thinks that all the purposes of sentencing would be met.  But my conviction and, at the same time, my wish is that in determining a sentence there should always be hope.  There should be hope that in the determination of a sentence, one should be able to understand that within the context of the United Nations system no person is ever finally lost.  It should be remembered that whatever be the heinous nature of the crime that a man may have committed, such a person can always be socially useful and that the person, the perpetrator of the crime, should, therefore, be given an opportunity so as to be able to live in a society of free men.  The person should be given the opportunity to show that what happened to him was a temporary lapse in his life and that he is capable of ascribing to the values of the international community and also to the values that are the foundation of dignity in his national society.  Therefore, it is possible and that is my hope -- it is possible that your Chamber would be capable of finding or determining a sentence other than the sentence that we are challenging and that alternative sentence would, indeed, be a sentence which is fair, proportional and loaded with hope.  This is what I was trying to say in order to meet your concern, Your Honour. 
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
I thank you, Mr. Songa, for your submissions on that point.  I would, for my part, be proceeding to consider your arguments very carefully indeed.  

Now, may I turn to another aspect of this matter and that is, to your submissions concerning aggravation.  I take the opportunity of explaining that I do not separate myself from any of the principles we heard earlier this afternoon on aggravation.  My concern was a limited one of making sure that the Tribunal was seized of all the applicable texts. 

Now, the question in my mind is this:  Would the Appeals Chamber be, in order to understand you, to be submitting that the responsibilities of the Appellant as a conseiller do not have to be taken into account by reason of the fact that he has not been charged as a conseiller?  
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Your Honour.  To be candid, I think that when we examined the entire file, we noticed that the Appellant's status as a conseiller protected the secteur over which he was -- or in which he was a conseiller.  We noticed that in the file, it is in the house of Mika, conseiller in Gishyita secteur that large-scale killings did not take place.  It is in that secteur that it did not have large-scale and systematic attacks as was the case in other secteurs, in particular, in secteurs close to Mubuga or Ngoma.  The Appellant tried to explain, with the support of Defence witnesses, how much he was concerned about everyone's safety in his secteur.  It is certainly for that reason that the Prosecution, not having found anything to rely on within the geographical limits of the Gishyita secteur, that they brought the Appellant in his bedroom and started saying that he raped his sisters-in-law and other relatives, and the Prosecution did so on the basis of considerations which are purely made up.  

Now, what do we do with the responsibility of the Appellant as a conseiller?  First of all, I believe that he was a conseiller that was elected and esteemed by the population.  We do not have any evidence that on the eve of the events he lost his status nor his sense of honour, so much so that while some people may want him to be given a more serious sentence, as far as he is concerned, we should take his past into consideration to lighten his sentence.  I do not know whether I have satisfactorily answered your question, but, in any case, I am trying to express to you my deep, profound conviction.  
JUDGE SHAHABUDDEEN:
I thank you, Mr. Songa.  I return the matter to the President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Güney.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Thank you.  Counsel, in the course of your submissions, you challenged a significant number of testimonies and evidence relating to the -- on the basis of the fact that the testimony or evidence was not eyewitness evidence.  I would like to know the extent to which the testimonies you challenged could fit into the context of circumstantial evidence.  In short, what I want to know is, what is your opinion regarding circumstantial evidence?  Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Your Honour.  Allow me to check my notes with reference to your question.  Please, I crave your indulgence for a few minutes.  

As a matter of fact, I challenged a number of pieces of evidence, in particular, non-eyewitness evidence or testimonies.  According to some jurisprudence that was summarised in the Mpambara case,  the judgement dated 12th September 2006, circumstantial evidence cannot be accepted as establishing beyond any reasonable doubt the criminal acts to which they are related or it can only be accepted if that is the only reasonable conclusion that may be arrived at.  You would remember that a short while ago, indeed, we challenged the evidence adduced by AP.  We said that initially, that evidence was presented as direct or eyewitness evidence and then it became indirect evidence and then finally, it became circumstantial evidence.  

Well, with regard to such evidence, and I believe you do remember what we said in that regard.  We tried to show that the finding of the trial judge was not the only finding possible and reasonable that could have been arrived at.  We even insisted in saying that from the moment the house was closed and that our -- or, rather, AP was 15 metres away, and since it was also night, in spite of the availability of electric light, Witness AP could not distinguish or could not exactly know whether it was a case of rape, an outrage on human dignity, an outrage of physical integrity and so on.  So, not only was that not the only finding possible but acts that could have been ascribed to the Appellant.  Well, it happens that the Appellant was not the only person capable of committing such acts, because in the house there were, in particular, Bourgmestre Sikubwabo and many other assailants whose utterances Witness AP heard.  Therefore, in the case before us, we can say that circumstantial evidence was not adduced. 
JUDGE GÜNEY:
So, if I understood you clearly in the case at hand, you do not accept or agree that some evidence you challenged could be considered as circumstantial evidence; is that correct? 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Your Honour.  I do not see any circumstantial evidence in this case.  Thank you. 
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Songa.  

This concludes the argument of the parties in this case.

Now, if Mr. Muhimana so wishes, he will be allowed to give a brief personal address to the Chamber, as it is the custom of this Court.  So I wish to enquire whether Mr. Muhimana wants to address the Chamber personally at this juncture, and that is for a maximum of 15 minutes. 
THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I thank you for giving me this opportunity to express myself with regard to the injustice of which I am a victim.  Since I was a young person, my parents lived in peace with the Tutsis and our families married Tutsi people.  Personally, I have never hurt a Tutsi.  People with vested interest levied -- or levelled unfounded accusations against me.  But I wish to tell you that I have good relations with the Tutsis.  In my secteur, I did everything within my capacity.  However, the secteur conseiller did not -- does not have or did not have enormous power.  I did everything within my authority to defend the members of the population, in particular, the Tutsis who were hiding amongst Tutsi friends in Bisesero or the church.  

We gathered -- we assembled in order to protect those persons against small groups of persons who wanted to kill them.  It is people from my secteur who wanted to kill the Tutsis and loot their property.  The attacks did not come from outsiders.  All the inhabitants of my secteur, we came together.  We mobilised ourselves and we even killed assailants.  I can give you the example of Alexis Rutaganda, the son of Sebishiye.  He is the one who launched attacks after killing members of the Mpabuke family and the children of a witness, a witness who came to accuse me here.

1720H
THE ACCUSED:
"Together, with the members of the population, we arrested that person and killed him.  

"A few days later on, a certain Claver Umdrmungu (phonetic) attacked the Rutina (phonetic) cellule and a Gwatima (phonetic) cellule, as well, in order to flush out the Tutsis and kill them.  

"We called for help and we went to the site of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda interpreters says the witness is too fast.  
THE ACCUSED:
"The assailants wanted to kill members of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you slow down?  The interpreters are saying you are talking too fast.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am trying to speak fast because you've given me very limited time.  

I was talking about Claver Umdrmungu, the son of Chugatusi (phonetic) who brought together bandits in order to attack the Rutanangwanba (phonetic) conseillers In order to kill in those cellules Tutsis who were hiding amongst Tutsi families.  We, as members of the local population, went to save them and were able to drive away the assailants.  But when we arrived the assailants had hit an old man called Rwabataba (phonetic), Simone.  They hit him with a club and the old man was on the ground, but he was not yet dead.  The assailants were driven back by ourselves and they were unable to kill other persons.  

We looked for the leader of the group of assailants and killed him.  I did all of this in cooperation with members of the local population, without any external assistance.  

Later on, I did all that was within my powers to look for antibiotics in order to treat that old man.  
And I gave the antibiotics to the son-in-law of that old man who was called Devore, the son of Byimana (phonetic).  The old man recovered, subsequently, but his son, who was in the university, was killed.  He was killed at Butare university.  

This was not the only survivor -- or, rather, the only Tutsi who survived.  Other Tutsis in the area survived because, after the death of that person I mentioned, we arrested other attackers and beat them up.  I'm referring to Daniel Ruharumba (phonetic) and his sons.  We arrested them and beat them up, and they did not re-launch the attacks. 
There were five Tutsis in the house of a certain teacher called Hiram Muyaguru (phonetic).  Those Tutsis survived on that day.  

Other Tutsis, six of them, were with my brother-in-law, Seth Tubere (phonetic), they also survived.  

There is also Apollen Murayuie (phonetic) who had taken refuge with my parents, together with his two children.  He also survived.  And his wife came here to explain how he survived.  

Other persons were with families in that locality and those persons are still alive, and those persons wanted to come and testify in my favour, but they were so terrorised that they could not come here to testify.  

Let me back-track a bit to talk about the 9th.  On the 9th I went for the -- to fetch the body of my child who died in the course of the fight.  I came at midnight on the 9th and at that time the attackers had attacked the house of Alphonse Omyeraho (phonetic) who was a trader who fled early in the morning with his children leaving behind his wife, who was gathering their personal effects.  He left in the hope that he will come and fetch the wife.  The wife was not able to leave and she hid in the toilet of a neighbour, and around 2 a.m. I went to fetch her from the toilet of the neighbour and took her to my house, locked her up in my room.  

On the 10th I buried my child who died.  And on the 11th the woman in question requested me to take her to the location where her husband and children were, because there was a child who was breast feeding and that she needed to breast feed, and she had a lot of milk in her breasts.  On the morning of the 11th I left with this woman and took her to where the husband was, that is with a certain Etienne Mugabo.  I then came home and the situation compounded -- became compounded, and we hid the Tutsis with the Hutus, as I said a while ago.  

If I had any hatred against the Tutsis, why would I have done all those things?  I've been accused of having started killing the Tutsis from the 7th.  

Your Honours, let me add this, I've been accused of rape, but I, personally, did not rape anybody.  I'm not the kind who rapes.  This is a plot to ascribe to me acts of rape, which I did not commit.  There were no acts of rape in our area.  

Today, in our commune, there are Gacaca court sessions and proceedings in prisons, as well, where members of the population and prisoners meet to talk about crimes committed, but no reference is made to rapes.  There were no rapes in our region.  I, therefore, did not commit any rape.  
Let me give you an example, on a video footage that we produced here in Court this video was on a Gacaca proceedings, here there were in that footage there were Prosecution witnesses and 
Witness AB was seen in that footage talking about the crimes committed during the genocide, but he never mentioned the name Mika.  He never mentioned my name.  He never said that I had a group of attackers that I brought together and led them to the church to attack.  Witnesses have come here to tell stories, but they don't tell the same stories during the Gacaca proceedings.  

One day President Pasteur Bizimungu went to the Bisesero region, and names of the attackers and leaders of the attackers were mentioned, and also mentioned among those persons, the chief of staff of the army, James Karabebe (phonetic) to visit members of the population, and in the course of that visit -- and this is covered by video footage -- it is clear that my name was not mentioned among the attackers.  But here, in this Tribunal, I'm being accused of having led attacks and having raped women.  

Your Honours, let me give you an example related to the Mugonero hospital.  Witnesses who survived from that site came here as Prosecution witnesses.  Those witnesses came here before my case, but none of them ever mentioned that I raped women at that site.  Other Prosecution witnesses went to testify against one Kagaba saying that the one who killed Mukesenye (phonetic) after raping her and that he is the one who killed the daughters of a mosque carrier after raping them.  

This man's case is in the hands of the Prosecutor or his file is in the hands of the Prosecutor.  We requested that this file be disclosed to us in the Trial Chamber, but this was not done.  This man -- charges of rape have been brought against this man and these same charges are the ones brought against me at the site of the Mugonero hospital.  

Yet another example -- I'd like to apologise to the Prosecution team, what they do is to go and fish for all sorts of evidence to accuse -- all sorts of evidence against the accused person, they talk about co-perpetrators, crime sites.  And documents were brought by witnesses, my own witnesses, who were witnesses who had been implicated in those actions.  Those witnesses came here and were examined on those crimes, as well as other issues relating to the Defence.  

When the Prosecutor realised that those witnesses had nothing to say against me, he requested for an extension -- a time extension to look for another document to accuse me.  And in that document he alleged that I personally killed agronomists, and the Prosecutor claimed that that document came from Witness DJ.  But that document was a forgery.  

Your Honours, please indulge me a few minutes to talk about Mr. Mutasyngwa (phonetic) who is the representative of Rwanda at this International Criminal Court.  

When my judgement was rendered on the 18th, he granted an interview to the BBC where he, himself, stated that there wasn't sufficient evidence brought against me in my case, and yet he said that we should not be too concerned with the legalities, but that we should limit ourselves to the decisions of the Tribunal.  And he insulted me during that interview.  I'm talking about somebody who said there was no evidence against me and, yet, is asking that I be convicted for rapes that I did not commit on the basis of internal instructions of the Tribunal.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I ask you for justice, justice particularly in relation to the rape charges that was brought against me because I never committed any act of rape.  I thank you very much, indeed, and I wish you safe journey.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Muhimana.  This concludes our hearing now.  The hearing is adjourned.
