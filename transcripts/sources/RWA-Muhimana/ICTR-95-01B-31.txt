MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning to everyone in the courtroom.  The Court is in session now.  

May we have the appearances for the Prosecution? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, members of the Defence.  The Prosecution is composed of Maymuchka Lauriston, Florida Kabasinga, Renifa Madenga, myself, Wallace Kapaya, and Mr. Charles Adeogun-Phillips.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Defence?
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  The Defence team is same as before:  Counsel Kazadi, Counsel Munderere, Counsel Mathias Sahinkuye and myself, Nyabirungu Mwene Songa.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed with the evidence of this witness, we may respond to the oral ruling, Professor, you made -- oral motion you made at the conclusion of the hearing on Thursday last week.  You had asked for the verification of certain statement regarding Witness DAC.  We have gone through the transcripts, both English and French.  They are the same, and we go by the transcripts.  Thank you, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and to save you from the risk of being identified, you will be referred to by your pseudonym, DF.  You also please do not reveal any information that may identify you. 

Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth. 

Please, Mr. Issa, swear in the witness.
	(Declaration made by Witness DF in Kinyarwanda)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have a document called "Protected Information Sheet" in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you mentioned the -- have you read the particulars mentioned therein? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have read the document.  It contains my personal particulars.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you also accept your signature at the bottom of the page? 
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  This document is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 69, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 69 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please go ahead with your evidence-in-chief.
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you very much, Madam President.  

Your Honours, before I commence examination-in-chief of the witness, I would like to raise a motion before your Tribunal.  The witness fears for his safety if he testifies in open session.  He would therefore like to testify in closed session, in order to testify freely.  I thank you in advance for your determination of this motion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?  Do you have any objection to the closed session? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, not really, but -- no, no, we don't, I should -- no.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

1135H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to go back to some of the issues that we have talked about before the break.  

Now, when you wrote your statement to the Prosecutor on the 13th of July 2000, you indicated, when you referred to -- when you discussed the attack at Mubuga on the 13th of April 1994, you indicated in that statement the following -- and I'm going to read a portion of your handwritten statement to you.  Do you understand me so far?
A.	I understand you, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	In describing what had become of the 25 or 15 to 25 people that had been taken from the presbytery, you said the following to the Prosecutor, and I read from page 3 of the English translation of your handwritten confession, the second paragraph on page 3:

"The 25 people were taken in those vehicles which went down the small road to the cemetery.  I was not able to go in those vehicles; I remained behind with two people, namely Ryandikayo and Emmanuel Gifaransa, the son of Alex Sekabwa."  Then you continue, Mr. Witness, and you state as follows:. 

 "I cannot explain what happened at the cemetery where those people were killed.  All I know is that those people were killed.  After their massacre I saw the vehicles coming back and driving passed on their way home.  We also immediately returned home."

Now, Mr. Witness, that is substantially different from what you told the Court this morning; isn't it, sir?
A.	You say that it is different because I, as the person who was granted Devine grace, I did not know that I was going to be able to confess today.  So what I told you is that what I saw with my own eyes.
Q.	Do you recall, Mr. Witness, that one of the judges, the Honourable Judges in this courtroom, asked you this morning if what you had told us were things that you had gathered from other people or that they were things that you had actually seen yourself, and you answered that you had seen yourself.  Do you recall your testimony in that regard this morning?
A.	I am repeating this, those things that I saw with my own eyes.
Q.	Isn't it the case, Mr. Witness, that, in fact, you are not aware of the identity of the attackers that took part in the cemetery attack; are you?  Is that not the case, you do not know who those people were? You were not one of them, were you?
A.	I have not understood your question well, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Isn't it true, Mr. Witness, that besides the people who came from Mubuga secteur to attack those at the cemetery, those who had been recovered from the presbytery, they were also people from Gishyita secteur, is that not true, and you did not know those people?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Phillips, I think it would be better if we read his statement to him. 

Mr. Witness, didn't you say in your statement that, "The killers who had came from Gishyita had disguised themselves in long coats and hats.  I could not know their names."

Did you make this statement, "The only people I recognised were the above-mentioned officials from Mubuga"?  Did you make this statement to the officials in Rwanda?
THE WITNESS:
Do you recognise that the document that you have shown me was given to you by Rwandan authorities?
JUDGE SHORT:
My question is, did you make this statement to the Rwandan authorities?  The statement is before you and I have read a portion of that statement.  Did you make that statement to the Rwandan authorities?
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about the content of this document?  
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm talking about the specific portion that I have read to you in which you said that, "The killers who had come from Gishyita had disguised themselves in long coats and hats.  I could not know their names."  Let's deal with that portion first.
THE WITNESS:
As I testified earlier, I told you that I could not know the identity of those people, but if they were people that I knew, I would have recognised them and I would have told you so.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you are being asked a very straight question.  You have got a statement there in front of you.  It has been read, a portion of it has been read to you.  And all you are being asked is that what you told the Prosecutor.  

That is just a question, whether that is what you told the Prosecutor before anything else.  And if you wish, you can have the statement -- you read the statement to yourself in Kinyarwanda.
THE WITNESS:
I made that statement before the Rwandan Prosecutor.  And as you can see, this document comes from Rwanda courts.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what the Judge has read to you is what you told them?  That is all you are being asked.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I made that statement to the Prosecutor in Rwanda.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS.
Very well.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you also told the Prosecutor that you did not go to the cemetery and you, therefore, cannot explain what happened at the cemetery when those people were killed.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know if what you want to know is that I was very close to the victims at the cemetery.  I don't know if that is the purpose of your question.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, the question is very simple.  Did you not tell the Prosecutor in Rwanda that, you were not able to enter the vehicles that took these 25 people; that you remained behind with two people, namely ***************************************************************************, and, therefore, you cannot explain what happened at the cemetery where those people were killed?  Did you or did you not make this statement to the Prosecutor?  It is either yes or no.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I made that statement to the Prosecutor.
JUDGE SHORT:
But this morning you told us that you were present when these people were killed.  Which version do you want us to accept? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We cannot hear the Rwanda interpreter.
THE WITNESS:
I went close to where these people were being killed.  It is true that I wasn't really very close to the victims, but I could see what was being done to them, and that is why I am telling you the truth of the facts I was witness to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the distance between you and the people who had been killed?
THE WITNESS:
The distance was very short, and, besides, the place from which the vehicles came wasn't very far from where those people were killed; it was a very short distance.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How short?  Can you give us the estimate in inches?
THE WITNESS:
You want to know the distance from where I was standing, compared to the distance of the victims?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.

THE WITNESS:
Between where I was standing and where those girls were being killed, you had a distance of ten metres.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Very well, Mr. Witness.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know what you have to do as a criminal or a detained person in Rwanda to come within the first category of offences; do you know what that entails?
A.	If I told you this, it will be something that I'm not very sure of, so I do not know.
Q.	If your involvement, as you have said in this Court, was as passive as you have described it, why, in your opinion, have you been categorised to the first category of offenders, following your confession?  Can you help us with that?
A.	When you don't have to discuss with somebody, that person can make the kind of provision he wants.  I don't know which criteria are used in categorising criminals.
Q.	Have you always spoken the truth about the events of 1994 throughout the various judicial proceedings that you have been involved in?  Have you always spoken the truth; have you always been very forthcoming with the truth, sir?
A.	Each time that person came to see me to ask me what I did or saw, I related the facts I was witness of.
Q.	In your handwritten confession, you start off the paragraph as saying, "When the judicial police inspector of Gishyita commune interrogated me, I did not tell the truth.  Later on when the Ukuri (Truth) Commission explained to us the context of the gacaca court system, as well as the advantages of confessing to one's crimes and pleading guilty, I found it necessary to tell the truth about my responsibility in what took place between April and July 1994."  I refer to page one of the English translation of the handwritten confession dated 13th of July 2000. 

Now, Mr. Witness, is it still your evidence that you have always spoken the truth about the things that you did in 1994, sir? 
A.	I have spoken the truth with respect to what I did in 1994.  Besides, all of the Rwandan judicial authorities that come to see me ask me the question concerning what took place in my locality, and I tell them the truth.  And when they interview members of my -- of the population of that locality, they realise that it is the truth I say when they compare what I say to what the other members of the population say.
Q.	Mr. Witness --
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, the question is, did you in your statement to the Rwandan authorities state that, "When the judicial police inspector of Gishyita commune interviewed me, I did not tell the truth.  Later on when the Ukuri (Truth) Commission explained to us the context of the gacaca court system, as well as the advantages of confessing to one's crimes and pleading guilty, I found it necessary to tell the truth about my responsibility and what took place during April to July 1994."  

Did you make this statement?  Did you say this in your statement to the authorities from Rwanda; yes or no?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I made that statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Very well.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, can you tell us whether or not you recall appearing before the truth commission within the Gisovu prison in the ******?
A.	You want to know if I recall the subject matter of the interrogation?
Q.	Yes, if you were interviewed.
A.	Yes, I was interviewed by that commission.
Q.	And the truth commission is made up of whom; who are the panel members?  What sort of people are these?  Are they judges, are they lawyers, are they policeman?  Can you help us with that; what sort of people do you appear before at the truth commission?
A.	These are my detained colleagues who are members of that commission and who interviewed me.  And they used to talk to us about the benefits of pleading guilty and confessing.
Q.	So it is a commission made up of your peers, isn't it, sir, your own peers, people like yourself?
A.	That was the case.
Q.	And we have the transcripts of some of the interview that was conducted with you by your peers on the 13th of July 2000.  If you flip the page to the last page of the document you have before you, you will see the transcripts there, Mr. Witness.  Can you see that last but one page; do you see that, sir?
A.	Yes, sir, I'm on it.
Q.	Now, the first question that you were asked by your peers, and I wouldn't mention your name, but they mention you by name.  And then they state as follows:  "All of this time you had refused to speak out the truth," referring to you that is.  "Even during the gacaca proceedings of Mubuga secteur, you did not reveal anything.  Later you asked for this confidential discussion.  In addition, the director of that location is here with us" - sorry -- "the director of that location who is here with us had asked you to reveal what you know about what happened in Mubuga, but you were adamant in your refusal to say anything."

Then they asked you the following question, Mr. Witness:  "Now what makes you take the decision to tell the truth?"  In response you reply as follows:  "I was at first trying to figure out what actually happened."  That is how you responded to your peers who asked you why you had refused to speak the truth.  

Now, my question to you is, Mr. Witness, have you been able to figure out what happened since 1994 and since the time you were interviewed by your peers in 2000; and if so, have you arrived at a final position as to what your involvement in the genocide is, or are you still in search of the truth?
A.	I am no longer searching for the truth.  The reason wherefore I concealed the truth is that when I arrived at the office of the inspector of judicial police, he was accusing me with respect to the Mubuga acts.  And since I didn't take part in it, I didn't say anything to the judicial police.  When I was transferred from the detention unit to the centre prison, I met my colleagues, my peers, and they talked to me about the consequences of the crime and informed me of the benefits of pleading guilty and confessing; wherefore, I decided to speak the truth.
Q.	Let me read to you another question that you were asked by your own peers during that interview of 13th July 2000.  Your peers asked you:  "During the gacaca session, I asked you if the person named there, if that person's vehicle was used to carry victims to their death.  And you denied that.  Now you admit it, and even admit your part in it."  They asked you, "How do you explain that?"

Your response was as follows, Mr. Witness:  "Well, I wanted first to know how that person would react, and I wanted to be sure that he would not cause any harm to me, considering that his behaviour is not good, be it here or, indeed, outside."  Now, Mr. Witness, how much of what you have told us in this courtroom today are things that you have been told by others and how much of it are things that you actually have firsthand knowledge of?
A.	When I was interviewed I had concerns, I had fears; however, I no longer have these concerns today because the person who frightened me finally confessed and that helped me.  This means that I am no longer afraid.  Consequently, the problem has been solved as this person has confessed and spoken the truth as to what he knows.
Q.	Witness, how did you become a witness in this case?
A.	When I was in Kibuye prison, I was inside with the others; I was called amongst other detainees.  I was told that I would have to go and see the authorities.  When I met the authorities, I met a man who came to look for me.  He told me that he worked in this court and this person told me that I had confessed and pleaded guilty.  And he asked me whether I could tell him the truth too.  And since truth helps justice, I decided to tell him the truth as I had done to the others.  

After that this person asked me whether I could repeat my statements.  I asked him what he meant by putting these questions to me, and this person said, "If you are taken to Arusha, will you say the same thing as what you said to the Rwanda authorities?"  And I answered, "Truth builds and he who hides the truth becomes even more guilty."  And I added that I would repeat what I had said to the Rwandan authorities elsewhere.

So when this person said this to me, I agreed to tell the truth as I know it.  I couldn't avoid telling the truth to help the authorities to render justice for the Rwandan people.  That is how it happened.
Q.	And you have told this Court exactly what you told the Rwanda authorities; haven't you, sir?
A.	I did not add anything.  I said what I know.  I have made a true statement from the bottom of my heart.  I have told the truth.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for being so kind to answer my questions.                                                                                                          
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.  I need to enter some documents into evidence.  And I haven't handed to Your Honours the -- can I have the document with the witness back, please?  

You have the English translations, but I haven't entered the original Kinyarwanda documents.  So I would enter the -- I will seek to enter the originals as the main exhibits and the translations as the collateral documents of 40 whatever, or 50A and B in that regard. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The original Kinyarwanda statement of confession made before the minister of justice is entered and admitted as Exhibit P.  63.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Sixty-three, okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
To be kept under seal.  And the English version of the same document will be Exhibit P.  63E, E for English.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. P. 63K and P. 63E admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the original of  --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Of the letter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- of the letter in Kinyarwanda, made to --  submitted to the Prosecutor --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- is entered as Exhibit P.  64, under seal.  And the English translation of the same will be 
Exhibit P. 64E for English, under seal. 
(Exhibit Nos. P. 64K and P. 64E admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Attached to the letter, Your Honour, is also the transcripts of an interview with the truth commission.  It is pinned together as one document, but I think we need to enter it as a separate exhibit.  It is on page 5 of the English translation.  And in the original -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The original interview in Kinyarwanda will be Exhibit P. 65, under seal.  And the English translation will be Exhibit P. 65E for English.
(Exhibit Nos. P. 65K and P. 65E admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, I'm grateful.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the original Kinyarwanda we will make it as K.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Okay.  So, it will be P.  65K, Your Honour?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, P.  63K and P.  64K and P.  65K.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Very good.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, any re-examination?
MR. SONGA: 
	Yes, Madam President, a couple of questions,
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the examination-in-chief, the question was put to you as to whether you know a person call Pascal Mukangwira (phonetic), and I believe your answer was that you do not know this person.  Do you confirm your answer?
A.	I do not know her.
Q.	And can you tell us whether you know a person called Pascal Muhayimana?
A.	I do not know this person.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

If I understood you correctly, Mr. Witness, you made a statement to the Rwanda authorities regarding what happened at the Mubuga cemetery.  I don't know whether you answered the question, but is there any reason why you gave two different versions?
A.	I did not understand your question well, counsel.
Q.	This is what I was saying, Mr. Witness, you made a statement to the Rwanda authorities in regard to 25 persons who were killed in the Mubuga cemetery.  And you have made another statement today before this Court.  These are two different versions.  Have you said why you gave two different versions?
A.	I think that the truth can be used to reconcile people.  I made this statement to reveal the truth.
Q.	I would like to know whether the truth is what you said today or what you said to the Rwanda authorities previously.
A.	You have to be courageous to confess to crimes because the intention is to reconcile people.  If I told the truth to the Rwandans and if I told you the truth so that the truth shall be revealed, I think that it is important to show and to tell the truth.
Q.	Very well.  In the same entry when you made reference to killers, do you include only those who hit them -- or hit the victims or do you include the leaders as well?
A.	In view of the orders that I received in Rwanda, that is, we were told that even if you do not hit people, if you are in the company of people who hit other people, you are all the same.  That is why I said that all of these people were killers.  That is how it was explained to us.  We were told that if a person does something and you are in the company of this person, it is as if you yourself were committing the act; that is what we were told.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you confirm that there were masked people in the cemetery -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, did you say, "masked people"? 
MR. SONGA:
I believe that I understood that, Madam President, when his Honour Judge Short was putting the question to him regarding page 3 or the passage that appears on page 3 of the document produced by the Prosecutor.  That is the paragraph beginning with, "25 people".
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What he said is, "The killers who came from Gishyita had disguised themselves in long coats and hats."
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is different than masking themselves.
MR. SONGA: 
	Your Honour, you are, indeed, right.  That is the exact passage that I was referring to.  Consequently, I shall rephrase the question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you confirm that there were people hiding under caps and coats?
A.	During that night, you cannot walk about in the night if are you not wearing a coat.  Not everyone was wearing a coat, but you could still identify anybody that you knew beforehand.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  If I understood you correctly, you have appeared before gacaca; you have also appeared before the truth commission and before the Prosecutor; is that correct?
A.	This commission was composed of detained persons.  We were together; I answered their questions.  And I answered the same when the Prosecutor put questions to me.  And I did all of this to reveal the truth, which is aimed at reconstructing the cultural of Rwanda so that justice may be rendered to the people.
Q.	When you spoke about the gacaca in Mubuga, did you indicate the role played by Mika in the Mubuga cemetery?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this is not in the statement of this witness before the Court.  Why are you referencing it?
MR. SONGA:
	I shall withdraw the question, Madam President.  I have concluded my re-examination.  Most obliged.
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know where Sekabwa is presently?
THE WITNESS:
I do not know.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you hear that he is on the run?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he is on the run.
JUDGE SHORT:
These communal policeman that you said accompanied the gendarme, do you know under whose authority they worked?
THE WITNESS:
I do not.  They came from the commune, and I do not know what orders they had received.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before this Court.  

Mr. Registry, please assist.
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness.  And to protect your identity you will be referred to as Witness DG in the Court proceedings today.  We want make sure your identity is not disclosed.  And now you will be sworn to speak the truth. 

Mr. Registry.
THE REGISTRY:
Witness, please kindly stand up.  Raise up your right hand.  Repeat the following words after me.
	(Declaration made by the Witness DG in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have a sheet of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read entries contained therein?
THE WITNESS:
I can only read the names in Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You cannot read the remaining portion of the document?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read what is written in French.  I can only speak Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness with the translation, please.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has confirmed all of the particulars appearing on this sheet and has also confirmed his signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And this document is entered as Exhibit D. 70, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 70 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please lead your witness. 
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.  Before putting questions to the witness, Madam President, I would like to remind the Chamber of the motion that was made earlier on in the day in which I requested closed session for all witnesses coming from Rwanda prisons.  I don't know whether I can draw attention to that motion.  

And I would also ask you to clarify your position regarding cross-examination, for the reasons that apply to closed session for examination-in-chief apply to the closed session with regard to cross-examination.  These are the questions that I would like you to answer, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, he is a detained witness.  How would closed -- open session put him at risk? 
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President, I am just drawing attention to the concerns of -- expressed by the witness regarding some prominent personalities in Rwanda.  The witness wouldn't like those persons to be informed of the evidence he gives before this Chamber.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, if the identity of the witness is appropriately concealed, as we have done in the past, by ensuring that questions that might disclose his identity are asked and answered in closed session, what would be the need to deprive the trial of its proper character with matters not relating to the identity  of the witness and are matters of a general testimony?  It can't be that the witnesses require that what they say is said in secret, even where their identity is not disclosed or is appropriately concealed. 
MR. SONGA: 
	These are issues that I have referred to you, and if you are against my motion, I would go along with your decision.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We are not against your motion.  That is not a correct way of putting it.  We are in favour of the process and its integrity, and that requires that such of the process that can be conducted in public without putting the witness at risk should be conducted in public because this is a public trial.  That is not to say that we are opposed to your suggestion.  We are merely seeking to put it across to you that in the interest of justice, wider concept of justice, it is necessary that such of the testimony as can be given in public is given in public, and such that must be given in closed session is given in closed session to protect the identity of the witness against the possible consequences.  

And as the Presiding Judge has just observed, if a witness is presently held in custody, it is unlikely that he would be at risk from the general public.  And we think -- or I personally think that it is only his identity that must be properly concealed to the public, but the rest of the information which is -- which forms part of his evidence should actually be heard in open.  Maybe we should hear the Prosecutor on this.
MR.  KAPAYA:
Your Honour, we are opposed to a blanket motion of closed session for all of the ten witnesses.  Our submission is that each particular witness should be -- each particular case -- each particular witness should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  And this particular one, as Your Honours have rightly pointed out, I think there are sufficient guarantees for all of the sessions to be conducted in open.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. -- Professor, we feel that as much of the testimony that can be given in open session should be given in open session.  When it is necessary to conceal the identity of the particular witness we shall use the procedures we have used in the past to ensure that the identity is not unduly exposed. 
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  However, regarding this witness there is an aspect of his testimony which I would like him to give in closed session.  When I get to that aspect, I will apply for a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.              
WITNESS DG
first having been duly sworn,     
  testified as follows:
    EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
MR. SONGA:
I do not know whether the witness has heard me.  
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I said, good morning, Witness.   Good afternoon, Witness?
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, I will put a certain number of questions to you regarding the events in Rwanda in 1994.  

Can you tell us the circumstances under which you learned of President Habyarimana's death?
A.	I can do that.
Q.	Please go ahead.
A.	In 1994, in the month of April on a Wednesday, I went to Kigali.  I had to transport property belonging to ***********************.  I went to Kigali.  And ********************* and I went to Kigali about 6:30 p.m.  The Kigali road was not good.  When I got to the centre where I carried out my activities the time was about 1 a.m.  I rested, I went to sleep.  I did not deliver the property belonging to ************ because I was tired.  

In the morning when I was about to take a shower, I turned on the radio and I heard military music.  Shortly thereafter President Habyarimana's death was announced.  He had been killed.  After bathing I **********************and I went to deliver the property belonging to **********.  They asked me how I returned; I told them I did not have any problems on the road.  They were very happy.  They were satisfied that I was delivering their property.

I ************************ and I left to go back to the centre where I carried out my activities.  My house servant went **********************.  Those are the circumstances under which I learned of the head of state's death.
Q.	Do you recall your activities on the day following the announcement of the president's death?
A.	This is what I did:  On Friday the 8th, in the morning, the traders who were with me moved their vehicles, entrusted them ****************.  And I told myself since ***** ************************** *******************************************************************************.  So I ************************ to *********************.  And the other traders at the centre went to ***********.
Q.	Could you tell us, Witness, for how long that vehicle was parked at the ***********?
A.	From Friday the 8th right up until the 10th - or, rather, the 11th.  On the 11th some gendarme came to ask for **********.  They said they wanted to use the vehicle to provide for security in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  That is the secteur where I lived.  Initially, I refused to give them ***************, and they said, listen, we have slaughtered cattle and we need ************** to go and see what has happened.  Since the gendarmes had authority over me, I gave them *************.  So, I went and ************************************************************ the gendarme to the place where the cows had been slaughtered.  The cows were taken to the abattoir, and after that I took back ***********************  

********************** right up to the end of the month.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President, the witness has made mention of a place name.  We should expunge that name from the records.  And in the future, the witness will have to be careful not to mention such name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What name?  Name of which place?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where the cows were slaughtered?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
******************
MR. SONGA: 
	The witness made mention of where he was resident.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we didn't hear it.  If the name was mentioned, it will be expunged from the record.
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What was the distance between your place of residence and the Catholic Church, Mubuga?
A.	From the commercial centre where I resided up to Mubuga church, the distance was about 150 metres.  From the commercial centre to the parish was about 150 metres.  This is just an estimate in any case.
Q.	In the wake of President Habyarimana's death, what was the security situation in your secteur?
A.	As from the 8th of April there was no longer any security, because on Friday the 8th the gendarme attacked us.  The traders who had opened their shops were shot dead by gendarme, or beaten up by the gendarme rather then shot.  "Why did you open your shop after the president is dead?  So they beat up the gendarme (sic), and you can see that there was no security because we were being beaten and people were saddened by the death of the president.
Q.	Did you notice any movements of people during the days following the death of the president?
A.	On the Sunday, I believe it was around the 10th, since at the centre where I carried out my activities, I lived very close to the road, I saw members of the population, particularly women, accompanied by their children, carrying mats, moving towards the church.
Q.	What were they fleeing from, precisely?
A.	As a matter of fact, when we asked members of the population why they were fleeing, they said that they were afraid, they were worried.  They said they were running the risk of being killed.  We asked them why they were afraid, and they told us that they were moving towards the church in the hope of finding more safety there.
Q.	And who provided for their safety at the church; did you gather any information on that?
A.	At the church there were gendarme who had been sent from Kibuye.  Those gendarme were stationed there from the 8th.  They beat us up on the 8th in order to prevent members of the population to come and buy the articles in our shops because the head of state had been killed.  There were many gendarme there, and we believed those gendarme were providing for the security of those people.  There were other gendarme who left the church to go to Rwamatamu also to provide for security there, and subsequently they returned to Mubuga.  

So you would understand that there were many gendarme at that location.
Q.	Did you see the people who sought refuge in that church with your own eyes?
A.	I did not go inside of the church to find out how many people exactly had sought refuge there.  I did not step foot inside of the church to know the number of people who had sought refuge there.
Q.	Witness, do you know a man named Mika Muhimana?
A.	I know Mika Muhimana.  I used to pass close to his house whenever I went to deliver crates of beer in Gishyita and Mugonero.  I didn't know him personally, he was not my friend, but I used to see him.  And people used to say that he was conseiller of Gishyita.  I used to pass near his home whenever I went to sell crates of beer. 
Q.	Do you remember seeing him in April 1994?
A.	From April up until August, I did not see Mika in Mubuga parish nor in Mubuga commercial centre.
Q.	Did you know a man called Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	Charles Sikubwabo was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.  He used to come to the commercial centre in the morning quite often, and he used to say that some of us ought to go to the battle front.  Since in ******************************************************, I told him I couldn't go to Bisesero because I was ***************.  So he left me alone.  

Regarding members of the population who used to come to shop in the commercial centre, he beat them up and obliged them to go to Bisesero.
Q.	Witness, let us come back to the refugees in Mubuga church.  Did you hear what became of them?
A.	Regarding refugees at the church, I subsequently heard gunshots fired by gendarme who were stationed there.  They were opening fire on the refugees.  Thereafter, those gendarmes killed those refugees.  By the way, they throw grenades on the church and the church was destroyed.
Q.	Are you telling the Court what you heard or what you saw with your own eyes?
A.	Regard the attack against the church which was carried out with guns, after the month of June people came and said to us, come and clean up the church.  Since I was a Roman Catholic we were asked to go and clean up the church so that it could be used in the future for worship.  I noticed that the roof of the church had been damaged.  

Regarding the damage on the church, I saw that with my own eyes.  Besides, from the commercial centre where I was resident, I could hear sustained gunfire against the church.  And I saw the impact of bullets on the walls and the roof of the church.
Q.	Apart from the events in the church, did you also hear of the death of girls at the cemetery?
A.	Yes, regarding those girls who were killed at the cemetery, the night of the 14th and the 15th at about 2 a.m., 2:30 a.m., I saw a young man called ******** (phonetic) who came to my house accompanied by two gendarmes.  He came and knocked on the door and said to me, "There are some people here who want to see you."  I dressed up.  And when I got out onto the veranda, I saw gendarmes.  And they asked where *********************.  And I said, no; I had already been traumatised since the 10th; I told them that *****************  

One of the gendarmes told me, "Our commander would like to see you.  "They asked me to follow them.  When we got to their camp, very close to the road leading to Kibuye, where their commander was stationed, the one who was taking the lead told the commander who wanted to meet that person.  And he said, "That gentleman has left with the bourgmestre of the commune."  We left with the gendarme.  

When we got below the church, on the road leading to the cemetery, we met two vehicles transporting the girls of the bishop, who had been obliged by the gendarme and the bourgmestre to get on board the vehicle.  They had been asked to go on board two Toyota pick-up vehicles.  The vehicle stopped;  and the gendarme working for the commander who wanted to see me said, "This is the man you want to see."  And the gendarme said, "Listen, we don't want to see him again.  We have solved the problem."  

It would have appeared that they ***************************************** those girls, and if they hadn't found *****************, I would have been obliged to give them *********, because if I hadn't done so, I would have been in trouble.  So we stayed there for sometime.  There were gendarme and other people.  The gendarme and the bourgmestre stepped aside to talk to one another; I don't know what they said.  Then suddenly, we heard the bourgmestre say, "Let them pass."  The people stepped aside.  The vehicle went towards the cemetery, accompanied by the gendarme.  And we members of the population accompanied the gendarme and that vehicle.  

When we got to the cemetery, the youngsters who were there started taking out those girls from the vehicle and they killed them.  Those girls were killed at the cemetery in my presence.  It was under moonlight; everyone could see what was happening.  They were, therefore, killed in my presence under moonlight.  I saw what happened with my own eyes.
Q.	Did you go back to the cemetery on foot?
A.	From where the vehicles had been parked, the vehicle transporting the girls up to where they were killed, there is a very short distance.  We covered that distance on foot.  Only those girls were in the vehicle.  The members of the population were all walking on foot from the road leading to the dispensary right up to the cemetery.  The distance is only some metres, and they covered the distance on foot.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Those girls, can you assess their number?
A.	From my estimates, because I was ****************************************, be they seated or standing, I can say that there were about 25 girls, but there were -- there was also a gentleman and his wife.  So the girls, the man and his wife totalled about 25.  

I **************************************, and I tried to make an estimate.  The people were sitting in the two cars and I could say there were about 25 of them.
Q.	Amongst those girls, were there some that you could identify?
A.	Amongst the girls who were killed at that location, I don't know their names.  The person who was killed at that location, his name was Herman Muzungu.  The girls were called the girls of the bishop.  I'm a person who used to transport people and goods.  I didn't know the girls, so I can tell you that I wasn't able to know any of the girls because in my day-to-day life, I minded my business.  Since I was a trader, those girls knew me but I didn't know their names.
Q.	Were you able to estimate the number of assailants?
A.	I can give -- make an estimate because I was an eyewitness.  There weren't too many.  I think -- I can look at the number of people here and try to see how many of them were there, but I think there were about 30 of them.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Amongst the assailants, were there some that you could recognise or identify?
A.	Amongst the assailants, I identified nobody.  But there is a young man who was holding my hand and his name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  He was present.  And since he came from the same secteur as myself, I knew him; otherwise, the other assailants were composed of a group of young men that the bourgmestre had brought, and I didn't know their names.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what did you say that young man -- he was holding your hand?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  There was a certain (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) who used to reside in the same secteur as myself.  We were together and we even talked to each other.  His name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He was one of the members of the assailants, correct?
THE WITNESS:
That young man resides in Mubuga, in the Mubuga centre.  He is the only person that I can identify.  The others had been brought there by the bourgmestre.  I don't know from where, but he had brought them, and I couldn't identify them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the young man disclosed by the witness is to be kept under seal.  

Mr. Witness, you are reminded not to disclose the name of your relatives or the name of any other person that may identify you.  Thank you.

And, Professor, it is 1:00 p.m.  We will take lunch break and resume at 2:30.
	(Court recessed at 1302H)
(Pages 31 to 48 by Donna M. Lewis)

	(Court resumed at 1430H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings in the Court are resumed.  

Professor, please proceed with your evidence-in-chief. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Before the lunch break, Mr. Witness, we were talking about what happened to the girls at the Mubuga cemetery.  I think I had just asked you the following question:  Did you know the weapons that were used to kill the girls?  Can you recall that?
A.	Yes, I do remember because I was there.  Those girls were killed with clubs, clubs with which their heads were hit.  Nobody used any firearm or a machete, but clubs were the weapons used.  I was there and I saw the events with my own eyes. 
Q.	Did you identify the persons who used the clubs?
A.	The assailants had been brought by the bourgmestre of the Gishyita commune and -- I'm talking about the Gishyita secteur.  They came from various cellules thereof and I didn't know them.
Q.	Now, so talking about the victims, were you able to identify some of them?
A.	Amongst the victims I knew Herman Muzungu,  as well as his wife.  Concerning the girls of the bishop, I didn't know them.  I could recognise their faces but I didn't know their names, and I think I explained to you that because of my trade I used to go from one place to the other, so I didn't know their names.  The only person that I was able to identify and whose name I knew was Herman, and besides I didn't know his wife's name, nor did I know the names of his girls, but I must point out that the girls were the girls of the bishop who used to reside at Mubuga.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you learn that prior to their killing, those girls had been raped?
A.	The bourgmestre brought out these girls from the presbytery, the bourgmestre himself, and the gendarmes put them in two vehicles.  When I came there, the moment the gendarme commander had asked me to come, had made me to come, I saw the girls who were -- the girls who were in the vehicle.  We on our part, we followed the motorcade, and at the level of the cemetery they were asked to come down from the cars and they were killed.  I saw how they were killed, but nobody said that they had been raped, and I was seeing what was happening.  So they were brought out of the cars, the vehicles, to be killed.  I was there present and there was moonlight.  There was light and they were surrounded by several gendarmes who used to reside in that locality.  So I do not think that it could have been possible for them to be made to go down from the cars and to be raped.  What I did witness was the killing of the girls, so they weren't raped.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are you telling us that you followed the vehicles carrying the clubs from the presbytery to the cemetery?
THE WITNESS:
From the presbytery right up to the cemetery where they found me, I saw the girls with the bourgmestre and the gendarmes who were surrounding the vehicles, and I must make it clear that from Mubuga up to the point below the parish, there is a short distance.  So nobody could have come out of the car since the cars or vehicles were surrounded by gendarmes, right from the cemetery up to the location where I was.  There were gendarmes all over the place and nobody could even greet those young girls.  So nobody came out of the vehicle to be put aside, given the number of gendarmes that were with the girls.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you give us the distance between the two places? 
THE WITNESS:
I can make an estimate of the distance.  Let's say from the presbytery right up to the -- right to the place where the girls met me, there's a distance of about 100 metres, and from there up to where they were killed, there's a distance of about 60 metres.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So was the total distance of about 160 metres? 
THE WITNESS:
Exactly.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And is that the distance they were being transported by the --
THE WITNESS:
From the place where they were killed --
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, the witness didn't complete his sentence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, I'm asking you is it your evidence that they were being transported for 160 metres by vehicles, by two vehicles? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How many were in each vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
If I can make an estimate, a vehicle was carrying 13 persons, and the other, 12.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
One was carrying -

THE WITNESS:
And in each vehicle, that is in the front cabin, you had only the driver and the gendarmes were surrounding the vehicles.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, the gendarmes were transported with what? 
THE WITNESS:
The gendarmes were keeping guard over the young girls and they are the ones who made the girls to come out of the presbytery, they and the bourgmestre, they're the ones who opened too because no other person could have done that. And after having opened the doors of the presbytery, they followed the young girls and they were protecting them. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, listen to my question very carefully.  The girls were carried in two vehicles.  That's what you said.  One vehicle had 13 of them; the other vehicle had 12 of them.  If the front cabins of the vehicles were occupied by drivers only, that is what your evidence is -- listen.  That is what your evidence is.  I'm asking you now in what way did the bourgmestre and the gendarmes travel from point A, that is where the girls were taken from, to point B, which is where the girls were killed.  How did the gendarmes travel and -- how did the gendarmes and the bourgmestre travel? 
THE WITNESS:
When I was made to come out of my residence to come and see the gendarmerie commander, I was told when I came -- a gendarme told them when I arrived that "This is the man in question."  Another person answered, "The commander has gone with the bourgmestre to the parish."  The bourgmestre therefore was in the car, but when he reached the parish he left his vehicle and the girls were transported in the other vehicles.  So the bourgmestre was on foot behind the two vehicles.  This is how the vehicle left point A to go to point B.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What were the types of vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
The two vehicles were of the Toyota Stout brand.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And they were driven away and the bourgmestre and the gendarmes walked behind them?  Is that your evidence?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you're correct.  In the two vehicles, in the front cabins you only had the drivers, and behind, you had the girls.  And the gendarmes and the bourgmestre were escorting the two vehicles and they were near the vehicles and we, members of the population, were following the vehicles as well as the gendarmes that were beside the two vehicles.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, were they walking, walking, escorting the vehicles?  As the vehicles were (microphones overlapped) and they were walking?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were on foot.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They were on foot.  And the vehicles were being driven.
THE WITNESS:
Each vehicle had a driver.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Driving it away?  And that vehicle was escorted by people on foot?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but the gendarmes were on two sides, on both sides of each of the vehicles and the members of the population were behind.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now members, when you say members of the population, how many members of the population are you referring to?
THE WITNESS:
I was referring to members of the population that the bourgmestre had made to come to kill those girls, and there were about 30 of them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thirty members of the --
THE WITNESS:
And I'm talking about those who were carrying clubs. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There were 30 members of the population carrying clubs, walking, and gendarmes walking and girls being transported in vehicles; is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
None of the girls walked.  They were in cars.  They only got to the ground when they were made to come down from the cars to be killed.  No girl could have come out of those vehicles given the gendarmes that were there to keep watch over them.  Besides, they were very furious and they wanted to be sure that no girl was going to come out of the vehicles.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you hear my question or -- and I want to ask it again for the last time.  Is it your evidence that the girls, 25 of them, were transported in two vehicles for 160 metres, one vehicle carrying 13 of them and the other vehicle carrying 12 of them, in which the front cabins were occupied by drivers only and these vehicles were escorted by gendarmes on foot and members of the population were armed with machetes -- with clubs, also on foot, and the bourgmestre also on foot?  Is that the evidence you would like this Tribunal to receive?
THE WITNESS:
That is my testimony. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were those vehicles provided by you? 
THE WITNESS:
One of the two vehicles belonged to a trader who was living in that centre, and it is the bourgmestre who had requisitioned -- I can even tell you the name of that vehicle, the second vehicle also belonged to another trader in that centre and that vehicle had been requisitioned by the gendarmes.   **************************************************** was told later that they didn't require *************** any more since they had already found others.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time did it take to travel from presbytery to cemetery?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
We're sorry, we cannot hear the --
THE WITNESS:
The distance that I was able to cover from where the gendarme found me, right up to the cemetery, that distance took quite a short while because you're talking about a distance of about 60 metres, so it was a very short walk.  So it took a short time as well.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is a short time?  How many minutes or hours?
THE WITNESS:
I can say that it took about five minutes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Five minutes.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, so your evidence is that you were not at the presbytery when the girls were brought out, but that they came to meet you somewhere else, right?
THE WITNESS:
I wasn't where the girls were, where the girls came out, but they found me just below the church.  But I was following the vehicles in which the girls and the gendarmes were -- in which the girls were.  I was also following the gendarmes and the assailants, but no member of the population came from the presbytery.  It was only the bourgmestre and the gendarmes.  And they found the population on their way, and that is where I met them.  So you had the gendarmes, the bourgmestre, who took the girls from the presbytery, and they met us on the way to accompany them right up to the cemetery.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why did you follow the girls?  You wanted to witness the killings? 
THE WITNESS:
The commander later told me that the reason they'd asked me to come no longer held, so I was following the assailants without really knowing if they were going to kill those young girls.  You must understand that if I had decided to take another route, the gendarmes would have beaten me and probably killed me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, if someone were to tell you that Mika was amongst the assailants, how would you react?
A.	It was during the night but there was moonlight so I was seeing what was happening.  If anybody told me that Mika was there, I wouldn't accept such a statement because I know Mika.  Mika never went to that place.  I never saw him amongst the assailants.  I have eyes.  My sight is good.  There was moonlight.  Mika was never there.  It is therefore a lie.  I was able to identify the bourgmestre.  I was able to identify the people that I knew so I wouldn't have failed to identify Mika because I knew him very well.  Mika never went to that place. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know a person of Mubuga called Agnes Mukagatare?
A.	I do not know that person.  I don't know her.  I don't know her.
Q.	How about a person called Colette?
A.	Neither.
Q.	Do you know a person called Alphonsine? 
A.	I do not know Alphonsine.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When we read your identification particulars, you mention that your current address is a prison.  How did you come about getting into prison?
A.	I was arrested in 1994.  I was arrested because there were people who wanted to take possession of my property.  I was put in custody after the arrest and those who wanted to avail themselves of my property did so.  That is therefore why I was arrested and detained.  Because of all that I had as property people made -- caused me to be arrested and kept in custody in order to own my property.  While I was in custody, I examined my conscience and said to myself that I should explain the circumstances surrounding those who were killed before me, and I asked for a pardon from the members of their families, to all authorities as well as from the Rwandan authorities.  Today I am awaiting trial before the Rwandan courts, and I hope that justice will prevail and it will be done me, because I explained the things that I was witness to and I didn't want to tell lies because when you plead guilty, you don't tell lies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you in a position to identify persons who wanted to grab your property? 
THE WITNESS:
I know them because those people have grabbed my property and they are the same people who caused me to be imprisoned.  I had cows, I had houses that were used for commercial purposes, and all of them have been taken from me.  I have nothing any longer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were they government officials? 
THE WITNESS:
Amongst them there was a government employee and other people but who were supported by these persons.  To grab my property, they used ************************************ and before the judges I was declared guilty.  They immediately took my goats, my cows, my homes -- my houses, and sold them at an auction.  For example, a house which could have been valued at 200,000 Rwandan francs was sold at 100,000 Rwandan francs.  And a goat valued at 20,000 would be sold at 10,000 Rwandan francs. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And since you were arrested in 1994, how many charges have been proffered against you? 
THE WITNESS:
I explained to you that on the 11th of April 1994 gendarmes came to my home and took *********.  I went ************************************************************* and I gave it to the gendarmes.  And the gendarmes said that cows had been attacked with machetes by some people, and I was asked to make ********************** so that it would be used to provide security.  And I agreed to give up *** ********.  I went with the gendarmes, and when we got to the place where the cows had been attacked with machetes, I realised that these cows had been killed.  And the gendarmes took along with them a policeman -- or the gendarmes claimed to go and find a communal policeman who had gone home with his communal gun and they attacked the people who were living with this policeman.  So I was accused of having gone with these people who had shot at the people.  And that is why I was accused.  And the inhabitants accused me and stated that I had come with the people who came to kill them.  And I tried to defend myself by saying that these victims -- or these people were victims of security officials.  And I explained everything that had happened, as I have told you now.  

************** was taken over and if you consider that it is a crime, I ask for your forgiveness, but I am explaining to you the events as I experienced them.  I have been detained since 1994 and I have not been judged up until now.  And yet I had explained all of this.  I had written it down in a statement and today what I am waiting for is that my case will be brought before the gacaca courts. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did you write it on the statements? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to the events of the cellule? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, I'm asking you when --
THE WITNESS:
I think it was in 2002.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you --
THE WITNESS:
November 2002.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is when you wrote your statement confessing to these things? 
THE WITNESS:
I wanted to explain this to you.  In 2002, in November, on the 19th, I wrote down a statement to explain what had happened in Jurwe.  On the 3rd of October 2003 I explained what happened at the cemetery. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you have written two statements, the one in November 2002 talking about the events of where? 
THE WITNESS:
I explained what happened in Jurwe cellule where gendarmes had shot at people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In 2003 you explained the cemetery; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  I explained this to the prosecutor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Between 1994 and 2002 you denied it; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I denied nothing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And why did you not explain it earlier?
THE WITNESS:
I withdrew nothing I had said before. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(No interpretation)

THE WITNESS:
Did I explain that I withdrew anything I had said before?  No.  I have never denied the facts that I admitted to.  On the 19th of November 2002, I explained how the gendarmes had shot people.  On the 3rd of January 2003, I explained the facts that I was eyewitness to.  I have never written anything that contradicted my prior statement.  I have always asked for forgiveness and I've always explained how things happened.  Up until today, I have never denied the facts that I admitted to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you an eyewitness to the events in Jurwe cellule?
THE WITNESS:
I went with gendarmes and we got to the place where the cows had been cut with machetes.  They had said that they were going to see the policeman who had gone home with his service weapon.  And when they arrived there, the gendarmes walked some 200 metres.  They arrived at the policeman's home, and when they got there, they shot people.  They went on foot.  The vehicle could not reach that place.  I explained from which point they took me to the place where the cows had been cut with machetes.  However, I did not arrive at the place or reach the place where the people had been shot.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, please. 
THE WITNESS:
But for sure these people were shot. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I had thought that I might require a closed session, but the problem has been addressed differently.  I have therefore come to the end of my examination in chief.  I thank you, Madam President.  

And I wish to thank you very much, Mr. Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Kapaya, now you have the floor.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right.  So please understand the questions and reply to them very briefly. 

THE WITNESS:
All right.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	You testified that sometime in April you travelled to Kigali to deliver goods.  Now, when, what date did you drive back to Kibuye?  Can you tell us the date, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That he came back to Kibuye? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
It was a Wednesday.  The following day would have been the 6th.  I went to carry the goods of the ****************.  The following day would be the 7th.  I spent the night driving.  I went to Kibuye and I arrived in the night.  That was on the 7th.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	On your way from Kigali to Kibuye, did you encounter any roadblocks on the way?
A.	On that day, that is Wednesday night, I left Kigali and I arrived at my home without coming across any roadblock.  I went to the filling station to get fuel, and since there was no electricity, I was forced to stay there.  So from Kigali to Gitarama up to my home, there was no roadblock.
Q.	Were you stopped by anyone on the way and asked to identify yourself?
A.	Nobody stopped me and I spoke to no one on my way.  As the vehicle was loaded, we were driving slowly.  Nobody stopped me.  I left Kigali and I drove all night and I reached the commercial centre of my area without being stopped by anybody. 
Q.	Witness, I will now show you the name of an individual and ask you some questions pertaining to this name.  
MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Issa, you can help me with this?  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, my first question is whether you are currently staying with that person in the place you are staying now. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Shouldn't the first question be whether he knows him? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you know that person? 
A.	Yes, I know this person.
Q.	Now, are you staying in the same place currently with this person?
A.	We are under detention in the same (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filled under seal)  prison.
Q.	For how long have you been with this person in that place?  For how long have you been staying together?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you mean prison? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, sir. 
THE WITNESS:
First I was under detention in ***************************.  Before the detention he used to live within the same commercial area or centre.  He used to live with his parents.  This person used to sell bread and tea, and people would buy that when they went either to Kibuye or to Cyangugu.  So I used to go by above where he plied his trade.  I knew him and he knew me.  We are under detention together in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) prison.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. SONGA:
The witness is giving information that might identify him, especially the name of the prison.  If that can be struck from the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the prison will be struck off from the record.  And, Witness, we may remind you once again, please don't disclose any information that may lead to identify you. 
THE WITNESS:
All right.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	During the period you have been with this person where you say you're living with him, has he at any time approached you to ask you to confess to crimes you allegedly committed between April and June '94?
A.	This person asked me because I was at the place where these people were killed.  I agreed and I said that I would plead guilty.  I was with this person when these crimes were committed.
Q.	Now, let's turn to *************.  If I understood you correctly, you said that you were approached twice and asked to surrender ************* for some use.  Now, when was the first time that someone asked to use ********** between April, May and June '94?
A.	The first time was the 11th of April they ***************and they shot the people that I mentioned.
Q.	Now, when they -- who approached you for ****************, and did you voluntarily surrender it to him?
A.	It was gendarmes who came to see me and they told me that they wished to provide security.  I first of all refused.  And afterwards, the bourgmestre learnt of this and he sent a communal policeman called Ruhindura (phonetic).  This policeman came with -- returned with gendarmes.  They threatened me, and I said to myself if they are threatening me and since the bourgmestre is the one who sent these people, I decided that I would go *********************************************************.  I didn't have a choice.  They were saying that they wished to provide security.  You yourself will understand that the gendarmes were supposed to be providing security.  So we left.  And when we got to the place where the cows had been cut with machetes, they went further on and they reached the place where they shot people. 
Q.	Did you accompany them?  Did you accompany the gendarmes on this trip ***************?
A.	I gave ******************* and I went with them.  My neighbour's cows had been cut up with a machete.  I myself, I wanted to see for myself what the situation was at that place.  So I went with them.  However, I stayed back at the place where the cows were, but they went forward for another 200 metres to see the policeman who had gone home with his service weapon.  When they arrived at a distance of 200 metres, they shot the people.  Those who wished to take my cows claimed that these people had been shot because of me.  And that is why I was arrested and imprisoned.  People were shot.  Nobody killed them with clubs or machetes.  These people were shot.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when the cows -- you said the cows were cut.  When the cows were cut and the people were killed or shot, was this person who appears on a piece of paper with you?
THE WITNESS:
I was with that person when the monsignor's girls were killed.  But this person was not with me at the place where people were shot.  This person was with me when the bishop's girls were killed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us the name of the person whose cows were slaughtered?
A.	Yes, I know this person.  This person is called Muragizi, Augustin.  But this person is deceased.  So the cows belonged to this person. 
Q.	Now, I want some clarification here.  Did the gendarmes ask you to go -- did the gendarmes require your vehicle to go to this man's place or the incident regarding the slaughter of Muragizi's  cows had passed and then the gendarmes asked you -- asked ************* to go somewhere else?
A.	When the gendarmes asked me ********************* they told me that there was no security in Jurwe cellule and the people of the cellule had come to seek refuge in the commercial centre.  So the gendarmes were saying that they would provide security at that place when they asked *********** ********.  The communal policeman came to tell me that I should give up ********** to provide security because people had taken refuge at the commercial centre and cows had been cut up with machetes.  So I decided to go and ************************************************ and I went with them, and when we got to the end of the road where the cows had been slaughtered, the gendarmes disembarked from the vehicle.  They went to the place where the communal policeman who had the gun lived, and when they arrived there -- you will understand that I didn't go with them.  So after a while, I heard gunshots.  They were shooting the people that they had found there.  I took these cows and I said to two of the gendarmes who had stayed back, I asked them to take these cows to the slaughterhouse.  But these gendarmes asked me to wait for the other ones who had gone.  That is what I did.  They returned and I took them away. 
Q.	Now, sir, have you at any time confessed before the Rwandan authorities for participating in the killing of the girls at the cemetery?   
A.	Would you explain this question to me, please, so that I can answer it?  What authority are you referring to? 
Q.	Have you at any time confessed before the gacaca courts or before the prosecutor in Kibyue that you participated in the killing of the girls at the cemetery?
A.	Yes, I pleaded guilty to having been responsible to -- for this action and I did so on the 3rd of January 2003.  I asked -- I wrote a letter to the prosecutor in Kibuye and I explained that these girls were killed in my presence.  On the 19th of November 2002, I wrote to the prosecutor, explaining the circumstances of the shooting of people in Jurwe cellule.  I explained that these people were killed by gendarmes.  And during gacaca meetings, we always give testimony.  We say that we plead guilty each time because these events took place in our presence.  We testify to what we saw.  I cannot lie.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how do you consider yourself responsible for the killing of the girls?  Can you explain? 
THE WITNESS:
I consider myself as being responsible because the killing of these people took place in my presence.  I explained this.  It is up to the courts of law to decide.  I have pleaded guilty.  I was present during these events; I was present.  I have acknowledged it.  I have asked for forgiveness from the Rwandan state.  I have acknowledged my crime.  If I did not acknowledge it, I would not have put it down in writing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were you in a position at that time to prevent the killings? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I did not know that these killings would take place.  On the 11th, they came and got me from my house with ***************** and the people who came to fetch me had guns.  On the 11th these people came and took me from my home.  It was two gendarmes who were carrying guns.  These are the circumstances under which they took me away.  I did not know what they were going to do.  I did not know that these people were going to be killed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	By the way, Mr. Witness, do you know why the girls were killed?
A.	The girls were killed for more or less the same reasons as the others were killed in the country.  They were killed for their ethnic origin.  Those girls were killed; others were killed as well. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What was their ethnic origin? 
THE WITNESS:
They were Tutsi. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now let's talk about the people who you say were present or participated in the killing of the girls.  Was that person whose name appears on that paper present?
A.	Yes, that person was present.  We were together.  If that person hadn't been there, the person wouldn't have confessed to having participated in the killing of those girls.  That person herself confessed with regard to the death of those girls.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And did this person, the person who appears on the piece of paper, physically participate in the killings? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, from where we were standing, since that person was present, even though that person did not kill anyone, she's considered as being responsible for the killings.  But I didn't see her take any weapons to kill anyone.  But if people were killed in your presence, you were indeed considered as having participated in the attack and we participated in the attack.  If we had been asked to kill that -- that person had been asked to kill the girls, he would have killed them.  So she was considered as having participated in the killings because she was present.  I know that that person wrote to the prosecutor, confessing to having participated in that attack and requesting forgiveness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How did you get to know this?  How did you get this information? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you want to know how I got to know that the girls of the bishop had been killed? 
JUDGE SHORT:
No.  I want to know how you got to know that the person whose name appears on the piece of paper had written to the prosecutor and asked for forgiveness.  Did he tell you himself? 
THE WITNESS:
That person came to ask for my advice.  He told me, "Listen, you know what happened.  Are we ready to plead guilty and to explain what happened?"  And I told him, "Listen, since we were there on the scene, we should tell the truth." 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did you last see that person? 
THE WITNESS:
That person was very close to the centre where we were working in his mother's house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you --
THE WITNESS:
I stated to you --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, when did you last see him? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, do you want me to explain that now?  I can state to you when I saw him for the last time before I was detained.  Perhaps I could say that I saw him yesterday.  That is why I would like you to explain further, Your Honour, before I respond to that question.  Because I do not quite understand your question.  I don't know exactly what you want me to say.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The question is not when you were -- not when you saw him last before detention, it's when -- what day or time is it you last saw him:  Yesterday, last week, last month, last year, the year before, or when was it? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, listen, we were brought here this morning.  But I don't know where that person is now.  Since this morning, I haven't seen him.  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And when you last saw him -- when you last saw him --
THE WITNESS:
This morning I came with him. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you remind him of when he came to tell you to confess?  Did you talk about that? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  By the way, we did not spend the night in the same bed.  He has his bed and I mine.  But we came together in a vehicle and we did not talk to one another.  Since I arrived here, I do not know where that person is.  I was in a room somewhere, but I didn't see that person.  And when I came into the courtroom, I didn't see him.  So we have not had the opportunity to discuss this event and we had no reason to do so because we are finished with this whole business.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, who admitted the guilt first, you or your friend appearing on a piece of paper? 

You had better enter this document as an exhibit. 

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, I am entering it as a Prosecution exhibit. 
THE WITNESS: 
	It was that person who first of all confessed guilty and then I did the same subsequently.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he suggest to you to plead guilty? 
THE WITNESS:
That person came and asked me, "Listen, we were witnesses to that event.  We have to explain what happened."  And I told him, "Listen, since the government wants us to tell the truth on what happened, we'll do so."  That person first confessed and subsequently I examined my conscience.  I decided to explain what had happened and I asked for forgiveness.  That person confessed before me and I did so shortly thereafter.  I prepared a document and I asked for forgiveness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, this document would be Exhibit P. 66, to be kept under seal.  
	(Exhibit No. P. 66 admitted, under seal)
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to ask you something.  Would you allow me to do so?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I am worried.  We decided to plead guilty but some people are resisting for reasons of security, my security and that of my family, what we say here may be broadcast over BBC and Radio Rwanda.  What we are doing here is relevant to the country.  I therefore request that this Chamber not allow what we say here to be broadcast over BBC or in Rwanda.  For instance, people who are trading in the same commercial centre as myself are not still alive.  I am the only survivor.  Although you gave me a pseudonym, I find that it is not prudent to allow the BBC or Radio Rwanda to broadcast my evidence.  I would pray that the Chamber should retain what I say and that all these documents be put under seal, placed under seal.  And I thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, you are giving testimony like your other friends principally because you want the truth to be known.  I think you have told us that you decided, you and the person whose name is on the sheet of paper, decided that in order to assist the process of reconciliation and so forth, you would let the truth be known.  You have been invited to testify in these proceedings, and to protect your identity, you have been provided with a pseudonym, which makes it impossible for people outside here to know who is the person who has given whatever testimony that may be sent out.  In what way do you think your telling us those things, which you say are the truth, which you say is the truth which you would like to be known, is going to adversely affect you?  In which way is it going to affect you if we conceal your identity as we have done by giving you a pseudonym? 
THE WITNESS:
These are my concerns.  It is true that you have given each witness a pseudonym, but I have told you that in the ******************************************************************************************************** there with me.  If you decide to protect or respect the safety of someone and you said that such-and-such **************************, people can identify me.  If you can't do otherwise, I would trust what you say.  I decided to come and testify, and I would go along with your decision. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm mindful of what you have said because I think that is important, both to you and us, do what you can to assist the reconciliation process that is taking place in your country.  And one way of doing it is ensuring that the truth itself in this particular trial arrives at the truth and that these are not proceedings which are done in such secrecy as to undermine the process of reconciliation, of justice, of understanding.  We will do what we can to try and ensure that your own identity is not disclosed more than is absolutely necessary, so that we keep you safe and we keep the process safe.  And I'm pleased -- and thanks to you for your understanding for the need for carrying out proceedings that are reasonably open so that the truth can make us free.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed with your remaining cross-examination. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Just for the record, Your Honours, the name that appears on the piece of paper is Defence Witness DF.  Just for the record. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now you have identified one person among the 50 who took part in the attack on the girls.  Was Sikubwabo and Ryandikayo present during the attack on the girls?  Sorry, Rutaganira instead of Ryandikayo.
A.	Sikubwabo was present.  When we went to the place where those girls were killed, we were not with Rutaganira.  However, in the middle of the killings, I saw Rutaganira.  Although I saw him, I did not see him kill anyone whatsoever.  He did not give any orders to anyone to kill anyone.  I saw the bourgmestre talking to him vehemently, as if he was accusing him of coming late.  I did not see him killing anyone whatsoever.  I did not go down.  I did not alight with him.  He arrived when the killings were already taking place.  And the bourgmestre was angry with him, as if he was blaming him for not coming early enough.  He came in the middle of the killings.  He stood aside and he was blamed for having -- apparently blamed for having come late.   
Q.	And where were the gendarmes who took part in the killings stationed?  Were they stationed in Mubuga, in Gishyita commune or outside Gishyita commune?
A.	The gendarmes were residing in Mubuga.  They were stationed in Mubuga.  They first of all did their work at the parish but they were lodged at Mubuga.  They could go to Rwamatamu or Gisovu, but their base was Mubuga.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us where is this Rutaganira at the moment?  Do you know where is he now? 
THE WITNESS:
Rutaganira went on exile in Zaire.  I did not leave the country.  Up to today, I cannot tell you where he is.  He went on exile, and up 'til today, people don't know where he is.  I was arrested in 1994.  I am still in prison and that person left in 1994.  I therefore do not know where he may be at the moment.  What I'm saying also applies to Sikubwabo; he went into exile.  He is not in the country and I don't know where he is.  They all went towards Zaire in 1994.  And since 1994 I've been in detention.  I have no information regarding people who are at large.  And given the fact that we are poor, even though it has been announced over the radio where those people are, since I don't have a radio set, I don't know where -- I don't know whether they have returned to the country or not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yes, Witness, you testified that you don't know Mika well.  Was that your testimony? 
A.	I explained to you that I knew Mika very well.  I was a trader.  I ******************** to the various trading centres.  I ****************************************.  I used to meet Mika.  I used to go to Mugonero and there I would meet Mika, so I told you.  That is since April 1994 up until August, I hadn't seen him in Mubuga.  I didn't see him in Mubuga.  April up to August 1994, I didn't see him in Mubuga.  But I know Mika.  He was conseiller.  I was a trader.  We weren't friends. 
	(Pages 49 to 66 by Karen Holm-Porter)












	1600H
JUDGE SHORT:
You said you did not see Mika from April to August in Mubuga.  Did you see him from anywhere else, apart from Mubuga, during the same period?
THE WITNESS:
At the beginning of the war, I no longer carried out my commercial activities.  I didn't go to Mugonero or to Gishyita anymore.  During the war I stayed at home and instead I had ************************ somewhere.  If I'd gone to Gishyita, I probably would have met him at his home, but I never went to Gishyita.  I explained to you that in April, or since April up until August, in Mubuga where I was running my business, I didn't see him.  He never came there.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, apart from Mubuga secteur, were you able to identify attackers who came?  Let me put my question this way: were you able to identify attackers who came from outside the Mubuga secteur, among the 30 people?
A.	Amongst the 30 assailants, I can't tell you that I identify.  Whoever those people, who came from Gishyita, it is Charles Sikubwabo who brought them.  I looked at those people, but I did not know the names of the assailants.  I was able to identify the person whose name was written down on a sheet of paper.  And that person came late, and he was blamed for coming late.  And when that person came, he stood aside.  Besides, people were at the point of beating him, and when we left that place, we were not with that person.  It is only subsequently that I saw him, and he was standing there with his arms crossed and, you know, he was being -- he was being talked to rather badly. 
Q.	And where did this person - okay.  And the person who appears on this sheet of paper came from Mubuga secteur, did he not?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which person? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's P. 66, Your Honour, on the -- the name which appears on that paper.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	He came from Mubuga secteur, does he not?
A.	His mother used to live in the Mubuga secteur, and it is in that same secteur that the person used to carry out his activities.  He used to sell bread and milk.  Be it prior to, or during the war, that person was residing at Mubuga.
Q.	Witness, you testified that Sikubwabo used to come to your area to mobilise people to go to Bisesero.  Can you tell us whether he had meetings in order to mobilise people, and the reason why he wanted the people to go to Bisesero?  Can you tell us those two things briefly?
A.	During the war that bourgmestre used to scour the whole commune.  If he had -- he seized a vehicle that belonged to some of the people who used to go all over the place.  And on his way he used to beat people.  I was lucky because I told him that ******************************************************** **************************************************************************** concerning me.  Nobody could flee from him without being, you know, hit by the bourgmestre.  So he used to go about the entire hill and was asking people to go and take part in the attacks at Bisesero.
Q.	Did he hold meetings to sensitise people to go to Bisesero?
A.	He did not hold any meetings, but he used to beat anybody he met on his way, but I never heard that he held any meeting.  And he used to hit and tell people, the people he met, to go and participate in the attacks.  He would also enter shops, and when he found people who still had some strength, he would hit them and send them out, but anybody who saw him used to flee from him.  People were running away from him. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, is it your testimony that on all of these occasions that you saw Sikubwabo, he wasn't accompanied by any other officials apart from the gendarmes?
THE WITNESS:
The gendarmes were in their own vehicles.  I saw him accompanied by gendarmes, but the day they took the girls out of the presbytery -- but he was always in a car accompanied by communal policemen.  The gendarmes had their own vehicle.  He never used to carry gendarmes in his car; he had his car and the gendarmes had theirs.  He was, however, always accompanied by communal policemen, and wherever he went, he had in his car communal policemen who used to carry firearms.  And since there was famine in April, people used to go to look for food, like beans, et cetera, and they would be caught by the bourgmestre, but I never saw any gendarmes in the bourgmestre's vehicle.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you never saw him move around with any conseiller? 
THE WITNESS:
I never saw him in the company of a conseiller apart from Rutaganira, who met us where the young girls were killed.  And he was upbraided and blamed for coming late.  Otherwise, wherever he was, he was with communal policemen, and most often he used to go to the centre, you know, going from shop to shop looking for people who could accompany him in the attacks at Bisesero.  He's the one who used to drive his own car even; he didn't have a driver.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, I have placed before you, and the Honourable Judges and Defence, a document, and I'd like you to tell us whether you recognise that document.  Do you recognise -- have you made that statement?  Have you signed that document on the date it is shown to have been prepared, that is, 19th November 2002?
A.	I am the person who signed the document.
Q.	Now, you testified here that there was a time when you and the person whose name appears on the piece of paper I showed you -- you started to confess to the killings of the girls at the cemetery.  Do you agree that, in this document, nowhere do you confess to the killing of the girls at the cemetery?
A.	The people of the prosecution came to prison to ask detainees to confess under crimes committed in the cemetery.  It was in that framework that I made my confession.  Now, the person whose name is in that document and myself left and went to Kibuye, and he's a person who was chosen to make the confession, but I didn't confess for that specific crime.
Q.	All right.  And I'll show you another document which I'll ask you to identify. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, unfortunately, this one has not been translated into English or French.  Your Honours, you will be provided with a translation in due course.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, did you also make a so-called confession to the Rwandan authorities on 7th September 2000?
A.	I will request that you give me leave to read this document -- to give me the time to read this document to be able to identify him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, take your time. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to read it.  

Without wasting your time, I must recognise that I am the author of this document.  I am the person who drafted this document.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	My question then, Witness, is that in September 2000 and in November 2002, you had an opportunity to confess the crimes, as it were, but you didn't.  And, actually, in your November 2002 statement, you did not -- the so-called confession -- you did not confess to anything because you say, and I'm reading from your -- from page 2, seventh line from the bottom --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you are reading this document?
MR. KAPAYA:
The second one -- the first one, Your Honour.  In the -- the point is that I was saying --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. KAPAYA:
To the one of November 2002.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the one of November 2002, all you say about your purported confession is that, "I confess to ************************* under duress, it is absolute coercion, which **************************** gendarmes to go and kill people."  That's not a confession (unintelligible).  Why do you term that as a confession?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Microphone not activated)... the whole sentence.  The question is not fair.
MR. KAPAYA:
I wonder whether the witness has seen the place in the first place.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but read the rest of the -- the following sentence, "It is clear --
MR. KAPAYA:
"It is clear, therefore -"
JUDGE SHORT:
-- "I confessed" - "I confessed" -- after the one you read, "I, too, was in it, in that expedition.  It is clear, therefore, that I am guilty of complicity in the crime."
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Conclusion, "I confess that crime and wish to ask for forgiveness."  What more can anyone say? 
MR. KAPAYA:
But can -- maybe it is a matter for argument, Your Honour, because he says, "I am confessing for complicity," but he says he did it under duress.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He *****************************, he went to -- and was present, or witnessed, or acceded to, or took part under --
MR. KAPAYA:
Under duress -- under duress.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Duress was there in ***************, which is quite possible.  There is nothing difficult about that.  He may not have wanted to *************, but he may have been told he has no choice but to give it.  The rest of it is he does, you know, (unintelligible) voluntarily.  Therefore, he is guilty, at least, for complicity, and he says so.  You can't say that that is any less than a clear confession of participation.
MR. KAPAYA:
In my view, Your Honour, I think the necessary means is lacking, but I leave it at that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
One would have to -- if you had a gentleman who had three years of primary education, you are really taking through those major concepts of criminal law.  You are not being fair much to him, I think.
JUDGE SHORT:
You could ask him why he thinks that he was involved, or he had to plead guilty, or confess to any crimes, even though he said that he ******************* under duress, why he thinks he's guilty of any crime even though he *************** under duress.  Maybe you could ask him that and give him an opportunity to give you an explanation.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, I don't know whether you have seen the portion we have been (inaudible) to you.  The question is this: why do you say you were guilty of complicity in the crimes when you - when, in another breath, you say that you were coerced, you were forced, to ******************************** and perhaps to go along with these people wherever they went?  Why then do you say that you are guilty when you say that you were forced to take part in the actions?
A.	In my confession of guilt, I contacted the persons responsible for the gacaca courts, and I told them all that I know.  After that they told me, "You have to plead guilty, and your case will be examined," because they knew that that case was going to be before the gacaca courts.  The -- those responsible for the gacaca courts knew this very well because when those girls were killed at the cemetery, I was present.  Accordingly, I was asked to explain all those events and that the judges were going to take their position.  So they asked me to plead guilty because - "On that location you were on the scene and you were witness to all that happened there, and if you didn't go there nobody would have been prosecuting you for that crime."  

Now, where the gendarmes shot at people, I also explained what happened there.  I told them the gendarmes *********************** by force and committed that crime.  And they said, "Since you made things easy for them, you are guilty and therefore will be prosecuted for that charge."  This gives the reason wherefore I wrote out the statement to clarify things and bring truth to light, and if I didn't do so the truth would not have come to light.  I had to explain to the judicial authorities what happened by saying the truth -- the whole truth, as I know it, and relate the facts for which I was witness.  They accused me for having *************************************************************************************** ********** Of course, I did that, and I was present when those girls were killed.  Do you think that I can remain silent while I was there -- even though I was there?  So without this I don't think I would have been part of the reconciliation, or if I don't do this I wouldn't have played my own part in the reconciliation process.
JUDGE SHORT:
In your confession statement dated 19th November 2002, you did not mention anything about these girls being killed in a cemetery, did you?  You spoke about other incidents, but you did not mention the killing of the girls in the cemetery.  Why didn't you?
THE WITNESS:
I explained this to you.  On the 19th of November 2002, I mentioned the events of Jurwe where the gendarmes shot at people on the 3rd of January 2003, that is when I explained the circumstances surrounding the killing of the girls because, as you're well aware, in our confession of guilt, we fill forms that are typewritten.  And after filling those forms, they are, you know, put along with other documents.  So I was made to fill that form, and I compiled all those documents, and all the forms that I filled are in the legal department.  So I fulfilled all the various steps in the guilty plea procedure.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. KAPAYA:
We don't have that one, Your Honours.
JUDGE SHORT:
You don't, but in your confession dated 7th September 2000, which you were given an opportunity to read a few minutes ago, have you spoken about the killing of the girls in the cemetery?
THE WITNESS:
The document of 7th September 2000 concerned the events in the Jurwe cellule where gendarmes shot at people.  And I wanted to inform the prosecutor thereon.  I did so in order to be released like the others.  I have also explained to you on the 3rd of January 2003, I compiled all the documents and conveyed all the information to the prosecutor, the public prosecutor in the Kibuye province, and that document was forwarded to the Kibuye legal department.  Subsequently, the officials of the Kibuye public prosecutor's office came and made us fill a form that -- the form for the confession of guilt, that was on 3rd January 2003.  I wrote to the prosecutor, and on another date the deputy prosecutor came, and I wrote another document, I filled another form, and all these forms were compiled, and put a document up on 3rd January 2003, which also includes that of November 2000, and all these forms and all the information therein are found in the Kibuye legal department, office of the prosecutor.  So all this, including the document filled by the deputy prosecutor, I think, that's the situation in which I am right now, in which my case is right now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, why did it take you so long to confess your guilt?  According to your testimony you were arrested in 1994.  You confess your guilt for the first time in the year 2000 and then in 2002.
THE WITNESS:
It was 2003, rather.  I was, first of all, detained in the Gitarama prison where I spent five years.  When I was trying to be transferred to the Gisovu prison, I told myself that since I had been transferred into my region, I should shed light on the events of 1994.  We were told that there was no statute of limitations on this crime, so we should examine our consciences in order to reveal the truth, and these are the circumstances under which I provided all these explanations and information to the prosecutor of the Kibuye legal department, and I am continuing with my confessions today.  I can still do them.  So I did not delay in confessing.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, you told us here that when they arrested you in 1994, you had actually not committed any crime and that they arrested you because they just wanted to take your property; was that not your testimony?
A.	That is what I told you in 1994.  In 1994, when I was arrested, I was charged with abetting the gendarmes in their mission to kill people.  My view was that ****************************** under duress.  I asked for advice from various people so that I would know what attitude to adopt.  Some people said to me, "You must first examine your own conscience before you make a decision."  So I took some time and I went to see the judges of the gacaca courts.  I explained everything to them, and they asked me to write to the public prosecutor and provide all the details.  And this is the advice they gave me, and I followed it.  I first confessed to the Jurwe events and, subsequently, I confessed to what I did during what happened in the Mubuga cemetery.  Besides, today, awareness is being raised to the fact that we should confess to everything of which we are guilty, which is what I have done.  I have explained everything to the prosecutor, and I don't think there is any problem in that regard.  I have mentioned the events to which I was an eyewitness.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that is all I have for this witness.  I produce the confession statement of 7 September 2000 as Prosecution Exhibit P. 67.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is the original document in Kinyarwanda?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, P.67.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is Exhibit P. 67, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 67 admitted, under seal) 
MR. KAPAYA:
And the one of 19th November 2002 as Prosecution Exhibit P. 68.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You don't have the Kinyarwanda version?
MR. KAPAYA:
We'll supply it in due course, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So this English version of the -- dated 19th November 2002 is Exhibit P. 68, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 68 admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Do you have any re-examination? 

MR. SONGA:
No, I have no questions, Madam President.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Witness, you have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony.  Thank you.  

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who is next?  Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the following witness is DAA.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please bring in the next witness. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness.  And to protect your identity you will be referred to as Witness DAA; this is your pseudonym.  You also make sure not to disclose any information that may lead to your identification.  Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth.

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.
(Declaration made by Witness DAA in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have a piece of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the particulars mentioned therein?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness with the translation?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's done, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the protected information sheets in front of us, all the three documents bear a different signature and they are not dated too. 

Mr. Issa, can you show these protected information sheets to the professor.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the date is an omission.  This is a document that was filled and signed today, but the variance in signatures is due to what has been mentioned.  He is illiterate, so he tries to sign each time and it is never quite the same.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What about your document? 

Mr. Issa, can we have the documents which are in front of the witness?  Let us see what signature is that. 

Professor, why don't you ask the witness to come replace the document?
MR. SONGA:
That is what I was going to suggest, Madam President. 
WITNESS DAA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you ready to use your fingerprint or put your fingerprint on the document that was explained to you a while ago in Kinyarwanda?
A.	All right.
Q.	Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
While we wait for the ink to come, we can proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the contents of the document which were explained by the interpreter, do you accept them as correct information? 

THE WITNESS:
That is my statement.  The information is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Professor, you can proceed now.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Can you describe to us the circumstances under which you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	It was in the morning; I had just woken up.  Neighbours said to me that there was no security in Kigali.  They asked me what had happened -- I asked them what had happened, and they replied that Habyarimana was dead.  I asked how he died, and the neighbours replied, "We heard that his aircraft was shot down."  That is how I learnt of his death. 
Q.	In what year was that, Mr. Witness?
A.	I think, in any case, it was in 1994.
Q.	Can you tell us the month as well?
A.	I remember the year 1994.  I didn't quite follow to remember the date or the month.
Q.	What was your situation, security-wise, in your area when you heard of the president's death?
A.	After the death of Habyarimana, there was no security because two or three days after that, gendarmes came.  There were also soldiers.  They beat up people who were selling their wares in shops.  So the shops were closed down; bars were closed down.  So we had to flee this centre.  During that period the situation was not good. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, the exercise is completed and all the documents have been thumbprinted by Witness DAA.  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which is this thumb; right or left?
MR. HOMETOWU:
It is his right thumbprint.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered as Exhibit D. 71, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 71 admitted, under seal)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, proceed please. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in 1994, after the death of the president, did you notice any movement of people in your secteur?
MR. SONGA:
Is the witness being translated for? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I shall repeat my question.  Mr. Witness, I was putting a question to you as follows: in your area after the death of the president, did you notice whether there was any movement of people?
A.	There was the movement of people, but after the arrival of the gendarmes, the movement reduced and they were not as we had known them before.
Q.	You referred to gendarmes.  What exactly were they doing after the president died?
A.	They came, they hit people, so people fled the centre.  And on the following day they went to church, and that is where they stayed.
Q.	What church are you referring to, Mr. Witness?
A.	Mubuga church.
Q.	To what faith did this church belong?
A.	It was a Catholic church.
Q.	When you say that people went to the church, can you tell us who those people were?
A.	Are you referring to their age or their ethnic group?  Are you referring to men or women?
Q.	Very well.  If you might -- could tell us, for instance, about their ethnic group?
A.	It was Hutus and soldiers who went there.
Q.	What did they go and do there?
A.	After the arrival of the gendarmes, they came up and asked people to go to the church.  These gendarmes began to shoot at people in the church, and they went there to kill.  On that day, about 9 a.m., they began to shoot at people.  So they went there to kill.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it is 5 p.m.  Is this a convenient time to stop for the day?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you stop --
MR. SONGA:
We may stop, Madam President.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which people -- who went there to kill and to kill who? 
THE WITNESS:
That's a difficult question.  Can I know the names of the people who were present there?  Some I saw and I could identify them, but there were many people, there were many people.  I was, myself, present. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, it is entirely possible that His Honour will return to his question tomorrow, but I just wish to give you some information regarding the list of witnesses.  I wish to state or to indicate that No. 33 and No. 35 are no longer part of our list of witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thirty-three and what?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thirty-three and 35, Your Honour.
MR. SONGA:
Thirty-three is AH10 and 35 is AH9.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we are still continuing with your evidence.  You are under an obligation of oath.  Please do not communicate your evidence or proceeding of this Court with anyone outside the court.  Thank you.  We will resume tomorrow morning at nine. 
(Court adjourned at 1704H)
