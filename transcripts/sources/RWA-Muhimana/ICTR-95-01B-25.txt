EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	The first question that I wish to put to you is this: how did you go through the day of the 7th of April in Rwanda?  Do you remember that?
A.	I did not have any problems on that day, but we were told that President Habyarimana had been killed.
Q.	Who told you of the death of the president?
A.	I heard it on Radio Rwanda.
Q.	When you learnt of it, were you alone or were you with other people?
A.	I was with the members of my family, at home.  At that time I was at home.
Q.	At home.  Is this what we saw in the document that was presented to you a while ago?  Is it the same address?
A.	Yes, I was in my home at the place where I was born.  And this is the same address that appears on the document that was presented to me.
Q.	Did you stay in your home after the death of the president?
A.	As time went on, the problems increased.  There were problems of security, so people were gathering.  So I myself joined in a group of people who assembled on a hill not far from where we lived.
Q.	Can you remember what may have happened the day after the 7th of April?
A.	On that day, this was the day on which we began to gather, and people gathered depending on whom they knew.
Q.	Do you confirm that you belong to the ethnic group that is indicated on the document that you were presented with a while ago?
A.	Yes, I belong to that ethnic group.
Q.	And when you say that you used to gather, was it just this ethic group or was it a mixture of all ethnic groups?
A.	First, we gathered as a mixture of all ethnic groups.
Q.	Were you on a particular hill when you gathered?
A.	Yes.  We went to a high hill.  But even if ethnic groups were mixed, we gathered according to secteur.  So I was with people who came from my secteur.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened on the 10th of April?
A.	On the 10th of April, attacks coming from the secteur that was next to ours -- people attacked us on the high hill where we were gathered.  They killed a young lady who was with us, and we left that hill to go and gather in a church which is in my secteur of origin. 
Q.	Can you tell us which church that was?
A.	This is the Adventist church.
Q.	Where was it located?
A.	This is in the secteur which is indicated in the particulars, or in the list of particulars that was presented to me.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you remember what happened at that church?
A.	We stayed there for one day and one night.  On the 12th, we were still a mixture of ethnic groups.  People came from other secteurs who came to attack this church and we tried to defend ourselves; that is, all the ethnic groups.  They called the Hutus who were with us to go and negotiate with them.  The Hutus went to negotiate with the assailants and the assailants showed them a letter which they claimed had been written by Bourgmestre Sikubwabwo.  Since these people were armed with guns, they told the Hutus who went to negotiate with them that they should separate from the Tutsis.  They began to attack us with grenades and machetes.  Some people were killed and the rest of us scattered into the bushes, and we went into different directions, that is for those who survived.
Q.	You have just stated that you were asked to separate from the Tutsis.  You in fact mean, don't you, that you were asked to separate from the Hutus?
A.	At that time I was saying that from the 10th Hutus and Tutsis were together.  There were small attacks that were launched against us that we could repel because we were together, Hutus and Tutsis, to fight them.  But at one point the Hutus of Murangara came and asked the Hutus to negotiate with them and they showed a document to these people and told them that Hutus should separate from the Tutsis.  Since this group was gathering firearms, the group was divided into two, we were attacked and scattered.
Q.	Thank you.  The attack that you say occurred on the 12th of April, when did this take place; at what time?
A.	The attack began at about eleven o'clock.  It intensified from midday to 1 p.m.
Q.	Can you tell us how many assailants could there have been?
A.	There were many.  They didn't come from just one direction; they came from several directions.
Q.	Were you able to note whether these assailants had leaders?
A.	Yes, that is where the document (sic) was.
Q.	Were you able to identify them, for example, by their names?
A.	I was able to recognise some of them; for example, Ryandikayo and Mpagazehe.  As for the others, they were bandits that were being used.
Q.	When these events occurred, did you know a man called Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you make his acquaintance?
A.	I knew him when he was a trader.  At one point in time, he was elected conseiller, but he continued to ply his trade.  So I knew him as somebody who ran the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did this 12th April attack end?
A.	The attack ended in the evening, but people had scattered and had hidden in the bushes.  There was no more resistance.  People only sought to hide, and the assailants went here and there in the bushes and in houses to find the people that they were hunting. 
Q.	Where did you go after this attack?
A.	I went towards the Mubuga church in the evening of that day.
Q.	Did you go alone or were you with other people?
A.	I went alone.
Q.	When you arrived at Mubuga church, what did you see?
A.	I found other people there who had spent some days there.  And as time went on, people kept coming.  I also saw gendarmes who were standing there and who were supposed to be guarding the bank.
Q.	How many gendarmes were there?
A.	I do not know how many there were.  Some of them went between this place and Ryaruhanga.  I saw three of them, but some of them went back and forth so much so that I cannot tell you the exact number.
Q.	And what did you do in the church while you were there?
A.	I was with other people.  Mass was said for us.  We prayed.  That's what we did, nothing more.
Q.	Who said mass for you?
A.	There was a priest called Marcel.  It was he who said mass.
Q.	You also say that you were praying.  Was it still with Father Marcel, or were there other people?
A.	The father said mass, and in his absence there were other people who led us in prayer.
Q.	Are you able to give us a name?  Amongst those who led you in prayer, do you remember any names?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Par exemple?
A.	There was a man called Kayumba.
Q.	Mr. Witness, how did you live in the church?  Who gave you food in the church?
A.	It is the priest.
Q.	And where did he get this food?
A.	Caritas had a store of food.
Q.	Were you fed every day?
A.	I did not stay there for long.  I arrived on the night of the 12th, and on the next day we were given food, and afterwards I left that place.
Q.	You mentioned stocks of food made by Caritas.  Did you learn also that this stock was looted?
A.	Yes, it was looted in my absence -- sorry, it was looted in my presence.  I saw it happen. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda interpreters would like the witness to come closer to the microphone because they have trouble hearing him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you come closer to the microphone.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you say you were present when Caritas' food was looted in Mubuga; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that store of foodstuffs was looted in my presence.  I was there during the day when that store of foodstuffs was looted.
Q.	Was it during the day or at night?
A.	It was in the evening, before nightfall.
Q.	Were you able to identify the persons who were carrying out the looting?
A.	Yes, I was able to see them.  There were many of them.  I saw people who looked like leaders but who were not carrying bags of food.
Q.	You state that you saw leaders.  Were there any that you identified and that you could identify by name?
A.	Yes.  The ringleader was the bourgmestre Sikubwabo and he is the one who was leading that group.  You also had the conseiller of the secteur where the building was.  There was also a certain Ryandikayo and a conseiller who was called Rutaganira.  Mika was also there. 
Q.	Did you see leaders make a count of the Tutsi?
A.	No, except probably I arrived after this had been done.
Q.	You gave Mika's name.  Can you enlighten us further on this?  What did he do?
A.	Are you talking about the time when the looting was taking place?  He was standing there.  He was doing nothing.  I didn't see him do anything.  I didn't see him kill anybody, but he was present.
Q.	Mr. Witness, while you were in the Mubuga church, at what spot in the church were you standing precisely?
A.	I was on the left side.
Q.	And with respect to where the food supplies were, can you determine the distance?
A.	The store was behind the church, in the rear part of the church, and when the foodstuff was brought, it was brought to the front.  We couldn't see the store, but we could merely see the foodstuff being brought out of the store because it was found in the rear side of the church.
Q.	While you were in the church, did you learn that girls were assassinated or murdered in the Mubuga cemetery?
A.	Yes, I heard people talk about that, but I wasn't an eyewitness thereof.
Q.	And what did you hear?
A.	I learnt that some girls of the Monsignor had been brought to the cemetery to be killed.
Q.	Were you told who had taken them there?
A.	I learnt that it was the Interahamwe that had attacked that place, and many other thugs of that (unintelligible) region were amongst them.
Q.	Did you also learn that they might have been raped?
A.	It was said that those thugs had found them in the sacristy, but we didn't learn that the thugs had raped them in the cemetery.
Q.	When did you leave the Mubuga church?
A.	I left the church around the 14th in the evening, given that the looting had taken place on the 13th.  And the following day, early in the morning, the attack was launched.  A few people were killed.  Teargas was thrown at the people, and one of the gendarmes that had been guarding the bank advised us to flee.  He told us that our fate had been sealed.  I therefore left, like the others, and we were trying to go and hide at a friend's place or some of us hid in the bush.
Q.	Can you be more specific as to the date on which you left the church?  Do you recall the date?
A.	I don't quite recall the date.  People were still there and those who remained there were exterminated after I had left. 
Q.	And which way did you go when you left the church?
A.	I went and hid myself in the adjacent bushes.
Q.	For how long did you hide there?
A.	I remained in hiding for some time, because I sought to find a (unintelligible) that would take me to Congo.  I succeed in doing this and finally went to Congo.
Q.	In what part of Congo did you go?
A.	First I went to the Ijwi island.
Q.	For how long did you stay there?
A.	We stayed there for some days because we were told that our safety couldn't be guaranteed.  People were transferred either to Goma or to Minova.
Q.	And for how long did you stay in Congo?
A.	I stayed in Congo for two and a half months, almost three months.
Q.	And after the close to three months, where did you go?
A.	Those who were within the country had been beaten, and so we returned to Rwanda.

WITNESS DD,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I am going to ask you my first question.  When did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learnt of it on the 7th of April, in the morning thereof.
Q.	And who told you about it?
A.	I heard about it over the radio.
Q.	Were you alone when you learnt the news?
A.	I was with my mother and my sister.
Q.	Were you at the address found on the sheet of paper that has been presented to you a while ago?
A.	Yes, I was at that same address.
Q.	And did you stay at that same address after the death of the president?
A.	I remained there, but after a while, it became necessary for me to leave the place.
Q.	And where did you go?
A.	We took refuge on the mountains of our region.
Q.	At what day did you go to take refuge on the mountains of your region?
A.	We started fleeing between the 8th and the 9th.  It was in the evening, and people kept fleeing up until the 12th.
Q.	When you said people fled until the 12th, what does this mean, that they were going into the mountains? 
A.	It was on those mountains that we assembled.
Q.	Were you members of the ethnic group that is shown on your sheet of particulars or you were there, you know, being members of the different ethnic groups?
A.	It was only one ethnic group.
Q.	And which is that ethnic group?
A.	The Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	And how were you living on those mountains?  Were you safe?
A.	There wasn't security because we were facing assailants.
Q.	And what day specifically did you confront the assailants?  Was it on the 8th or on another day?
A.	The attacks began, with effect from the 8th right up until the 12th.
Q.	And were you able to identify the assailants?
A.	Yes, I was able to identify them because they were my neighbours.
Q.	Can you give us their names?
A.	I can give you their names, but this would reveal my person and make it unsafe for me.
Q.	Would a sheet of paper help you to do this? 
A.	Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know how to read? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you able to write down the names? 
THE WITNESS:
I will request that you send somebody to assist me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How would mentioning the name of the assailants identify him?  Is it not better that we go into a closed session for a while? 
MR. SONGA:
I will leave it up to you, Madam President, to take the decision. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please close the session. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 11 to 12] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 10 by S. Eboe-Osuji)

















MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are in open session now.  Be careful with your identity.  Thank you.  

Professor, proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, if I understood what you said correctly, you said you arrived in Mubuga church on the 12th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And why did you flee towards Mubuga church?
A.	I fled towards Mubuga church because my relatives who were with me and other people had told me if someone had sought refuge in that church he would not have any problems because no one would attack God's house, God's church. 
Q.	And at what time did you arrive at Mubuga?
A.	We first confronted some attackers on the hills before we arrived in the church, around midday.
Q.	What situation did you find in Mubuga church?
A.	We found many other people there, and we settled there with those people.
Q.	Did you have the impression or occasion to note that you were well protected within the church?
A.	We had the impression that our safety was provided for because gendarmes were present.
Q.	How much time did you spend in Mubuga church?
A.	I left the church on the 15th, very early in the morning.
Q.	At about what time, Mr. Witness?
A.	It was between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m.
Q.	During the three days that you spent at the church, how did you spend your day, your days?
A.	We spent those days praying.  There was a priest called Marcel who led us in prayer.  We were together.  And during the entire period, we prayed.  And when he went into the presbytery, a certain Mujyambere who was parish secretary led us in prayer.
Q.	How were you fed, Witness?
A.	Food was given to us.  The food was distributed by Caritas, and people who were with us used the house that was used by the priest as a kitchen for cooking the food.
Q.	During those three days, were you fed?
A.	Yes, I was fed.  We shared whatever food was available.  Everyone shared with one another.
Q.	Did you hear that the Caritas store had been looted?
A.	I heard it since I was present in the church when the looting took place.
Q.	At what distance from the scene of the looting were you?
A.	I was not very far from there.  I was behind the window, observing the looting.
Q.	Did you see the looters?
A.	I saw them.
Q.	Did you identify any of them?
A.	I recognised two men, the former bourgmestre Sikubwabo and a trader called Ryandikayo.
Q.	Did you know a person by the name of Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was he one of the people who looted the food in Mubuga?
A.	No.
Q.	And if he had been there, would you have recognised him?
A.	I would have recognised him because I knew him.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you make his acquaintance?
A.	I knew him when he was a trader and subsequently when he became conseiller.
Q.	While you were in the church, Witness, were you able to see any of the personalities from Kibuye come to take a count of the Tutsis within the church?
A.	Nobody came to count us, apart from a gendarme who asked us how many of us were there, and to which question we answered we were numerous. 
Q.	Were you present during the distribution of weapons in front of the church?
A.	No.  The only people who had arms were gendarmes.
Q.	Do you confirm that you left the church on the 15th, very early in the morning?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you say why you left very early in the morning, that morning of the 15th of April?
A.	On the 14th an attack was led.  During that attack a few people were killed, and at night girls who were auxiliaries from the -- apostolic auxiliaries arrived.  We heard the shouts of those girls.  A gendarme came and we asked him what had happened, and he said they had abducted those girls, and he said, "You yourselves will be killed the following day.  If you have to leave the church, you must leave the church."  Only those who were able to leave the church left the church.
Q.	You made mention of an attack on the 14th of April, didn't you?
A.	Yes.  It was not a large-scale attack.  The assailants attacked and killed a few people, and left.
Q.	Were you able to identify the attackers on that day?
A.	They were gendarmes.  As a matter of fact, most of the time it was the gendarmes who fired at refugees.
Q.	Witness, you made mention of filles de Monseigneur, Daughters of Monsignor.  What exactly did you hear about them?
A.	They were abducted on that day, at night.  And while they were being abducted, they screamed and they went into the bush below the church, and we observed that their bodies were littering the cemetery. 
Q.	Did you see those bodies?
A.	I saw those bodies with my own eyes.
Q.	Did you hear that those girls had been raped?
A.	I heard nobody say so.
Q.	Did you hear that those girls were disembowelled?
A.	I did not observe anything of the sort because when I passed nearby their bodies, it was in broad daylight, and I could see their bodies very clearly.  I did not observe that their bodies had been disembowelled.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you left Mubuga church, where did you go?
A.	I left the church and I went up the hills of Bisesero again.
Q.	Did you know the Bisesero hills?
A.	No, I did not know them, but since that was the direction we took, I was able to know them.
Q.	Are you in a position today to say on what hill precisely you took refuge?
A.	We did not take refuge on one hill alone.  We ran across several hills.  There was one hill called Mubuga, another called Muyira, another named Mutiti and another one by the name of Kanyinya.  We went on all those hills, running, seeking refuge.
Q.	You've made mention of Muyira.  While on Muyira, did you witness or were you a victim of an attack?
A.	On Muyira hill, there were two large-scale attacks.  There were, of course, several other smaller attacks.  On the 13th and 14th of April, there were two large-scale attacks during which many people died.
Q.	Did you see the number of the attackers?
A.	There were very many of them.  They included Interahamwe, gendarmes and ordinary members of the population.  There were many of them.  They came onboard all sorts of vehicles, including buses.  There were very many of them.
Q.	Among the attackers, were there any of the people you personally identified?
A.	The person that I first recognised was Bourgmestre Sikubwabo, whom we caught sight of from a hill.  He was showing the attackers how they had to kill us.  That was the only person I was able to recognise.
Q.	Did you see Mika among the attackers?
A.	Of course I knew Mika, but I did not see him.  If he had come, he would have been beside the bourgmestre, giving advice to the other attackers.  If I did not see him, it was because he was not there.
Q.	Do you assert that, with regard to the dates that you mentioned?
A.	Yes, I confirm that fact.
Q.	I believe you also made mention of Kanyinya.
A.	We also sought refuge on Kanyinya hill.
Q.	Can you possibly recall the period when you were on Kanyinya?
A.	It was during that period, around the dates I mentioned, while we sought refuge on all those hills of Muyira, Mutiti, Kanyinya and the other hills.  As a matter of fact, we were running across those hills.
Q.	And while on Kanyinya, you did not see Mika Muhimana?
A.	I did not see him there.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You stated that you ran from one hill to another in Bisesero.  Did you happen to witness or were you aware of rapes committed on the various hills of Bisesero?
A.	That would not have been possible.  The attackers rushed on victims to kill them, and to share them amongst themselves, I don't think that under those circumstances the assailants could have raped anyone. 
Q.	You therefore confirm that you did not witness any rape?
A.	I did not witness anything of the sort.  I did not see anything of the sort.
Q.	Do you also confirm that you never heard about that at all?
A.	I never heard about that at all.
Q.	And when did you leave the Bisesero hills?
A.	The French helped me to leave the scene.
Q.	And you left those hills to go in what direction?
A.	I believe if I mentioned where I went, that would endanger my safety, since it is a place known by everyone. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, as far as I am concerned, I don't think that question is very important, so I will withdraw it and inform you that I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief. 

Mr. Witness, thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Cross-examination.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Mr. Witness, as far as you are concerned and as far as you are aware, not a single woman was raped either in Mubuga or Bisesero throughout the genocide; is that not the case, as far as you are concerned?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Songa.
THE WITNESS:
I saw nothing of the sort.  That is my testimony.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, in answering the question regarding rape, it was specifically with reference to the sites in Mubuga and not Bisesero.  He did not talk about rapes throughout the genocide.  I don't think that question should be put to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has answered the question already. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The question has been asked and answered.  I am satisfied.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned seeking refuge at the Mubuga church and you mentioned seeing a man called Sikubwabo present at that location.  Now, my question is, do you also know a man called Rutaganira?
A.	I know Rutaganira.  He was a conseiller.
Q.	And did you see Rutaganira at all at the Mubuga church whilst you were there, sir?
A.	I did not see him.
Q.	Very well.  Now, having arrived at the Mubuga church on the 12th of April, as you testified, would I be correct in saying that you and other refugees were free to roam around the area, you were free to move around?
A.	No, you would be wrong if you said so.  We were not allowed to move about.  We were not entitled to move about outside the church since we were the target of killers.
Q.	And that period of confinement lasted until when, sir?  When was it that you were allowed to move around?  Did there ever come a time when you were allowed to move around, sir?
A.	We left at the time when we left that area.  Otherwise, while we were in that area, we were not allowed to leave.
Q.	So if that was the case, then you are unable to tell us about many of the things that you testified about in this courtroom this morning, are you?
A.	I have no other information for you, apart from what I have told you.
Q.	So if you were not able to leave the church, then you were not able to see the bodies of those girls that you described to us this morning, were you?
A.	I saw those bodies when I went out of the church.  The cemetery was not so close to the church that I could see the bodies from the church.
Q.	Oh, really.  And it's your testimony, sir, that you were able to leave the church at some stage before 
5 a.m. -- between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. on the 15th of April, sir?  Is that what you are saying?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Okay, so --
MR. SONGA:
Bad translation.  He said, "In the morning."  What does that mean?  He said, "In the morning."  The Prosecutor asks, "Is it four or five o'clock; is that correct?"  So does "is that correct" mean "this morning -- it is correct that it was in the morning at 4 or 5 or at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. in the evening"?
THE WITNESS:
I said four to five o'clock in the morning. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you.  That's what I thought you said.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, can you tell me how you were able to leave the church this morning?  The doors were open?  You just simply walked out at 4 or 5?  Can you describe how you came about leaving just before the attacks that day?
A.	A gendarme had just told us that we would be killed.  We did our best.  We went out through the windows of the church.  That was from the side that was not being guarded by the gendarmes.
Q.	So you did what, you removed the windows?  You broke them?  Can you describe what you did?  You just passed through the windows, just like that.  Can you help me with that?  How did you leave through the window?
A.	The windows could be opened.  We did not break them.  We opened them.
Q.	And how many of you went out through these windows, sir?
A.	It was a small group of us, about 30 persons.
Q.	All men?  Woman?  Children?  Can you help me with that?
A.	There were young men and other men.  Many of us were young people. 
Q.	Very well.  So suffice it to say that you were not present at the church, at Mubuga church, around 
ten o'clock in the morning on the 15th of April, or were you, sir?
A.	At that time, I had already left the church.
Q.	So would I be correct in saying that you obviously have no information as to the identity of those who attacked the church that day, or do you, sir?
A.	The events that took place after my departure, you would be right in saying that I do not know who was present, but I can tell you that on the 14th I was still in the church.
Q.	I asked you about the 15th, sir.  What's your answer?  Do you know or don't you?
A.	When we were in Bisesero, we noted that the church had been attacked.  We heard many gunshots at that place.
Q.	You still haven't answered my question.  Who attacked the church?  Do you know or don't you?
A.	Are you still referring to the 15th? 
Q.	I am, Mr. Witness. 
A.	I do not know those who attacked the church then.
Q.	Very well.  Now let's talk about something slightly different.  Now, you talked about the 14th of April and this was an attack that you claim you witnessed carried out by gendarmes.  Were these the same gendarmes that informed you the day after that the church was going to be attacked before you left through the window or were they different gendarmes?
A.	The gendarmes relieved each other.  But the information that had been given to me came from a gendarme who gave it to us when the others were not listening to him.
Q.	So what time was the attack on the 14th, the attack carried out by the gendarmes?
A.	The attack took place in the morning and ended at about nine o'clock.  Between nine o'clock and ten o'clock, the attack had already ended.  And after the attack, the assailants left.
Q.	And those that were attacked on the 14th between nine o'clock and ten o'clock were Tutsi civilians, like yourself?
A.	The attack began in the morning and ended at 9 to 10 in the morning.  They were Tutsis.
Q.	And you then decided to, having witnessed that attack, you then decided to stay in the church for almost another day, did you not, sir?  Is that not the case?
A.	I stayed there because I had no other place to go.  The elders had told us that normally churches were not attacked.  People were taken unawares.  And when the gendarme told us that we would be attacked, we understood that what our elders had said was no longer true, so we decided to leave the church.
Q.	So the window that you escaped from the following day was not there the day before, was it, sir?  That window that you went through on the 15th, that window wasn't there on the 14th when you witnessed this attack?
A.	The windows were there.  We had barricaded them.  It was not easy to go through these windows because the assailants who were attacking us with guns were behind the windows.
Q.	And on the 15th, where were those gendarmes then?  They had gone away?  That's your testimony, sir?  They were no longer there?
A.	They had not left, but they were on the other side and we went by another side.
Q.	Very well.  Now, the man you describe as ****** -- and I don't want you to repeat his surname.  Just let's talk about him as ***********.  I want to ask you some questions about him.  Do you recall your testimony in that regard?
A.	I remember what I said about him.  I said that I was not with  ***********, either in the church or in Bisesero.  I learnt after the war that ********** had hid at Mukiga's and he had been able to escape.
Q.	That's what I want to talk to you about now.  Now, Mr. Witness, first of all, you were not at Mukiga's house yourself, were you?
A.	I did not go there.
Q.	So you didn't see the man *********yourself at Mukiga's house, did you?
A.	I did not see him there.
Q.	In fact, you do not know what the man ********* did between April, May and June 1994, do you, sir?  You didn't know where he was. 
A.	I did not know where he was, but in the various places where I sought refuge, I did not see him there, and at these places there were many people who came from the secteurs of our region.  Since I did not see ******** afterwards, I was told that he may have survived, that he did survive but that he was at Mukiga's.
Q.	So you went into Mubuga church, which was filled with several people, thousands of people, and you went around looking for a man called **********, didn't you, sir?  He was so important to you, you tried to seek him out of all those people.
A.	It wasn't necessary for me to seek him from amongst those other people.  But if he had been there, I would have seen him.  I would have seen him because I knew him.
Q.	And just in the same manner, is it also your testimony that you just happened not to have seen the man Mika either in Mubuga or in Bisesero?  You were looking out for him as well, sir?
A.	I do not understand what you mean.  Why would I have looked for him?
Q.	That's what I wonder too.  So how would you know that Mika was not present at Bisesero, sir?  Were you looking for him?
A.	No.  The assailants who came to attack people came in broad daylight, but I did not see him amongst the assailants.  This is why I said I did not see him there.  And the assailants were not hiding; they did this all in broad daylight.
Q.	How did you become a witness in this case, Mr. Witness?  How did you become a witness?
A.	I was at home, my house.  I saw ******* come to my house.  The person said to me -- the person said to me that she (sic) was called*******.  And this *****, he asked me how I had gone through the events of 1994. *** told me that Mika was detained in the prison of this Tribunal, and he asked me to come here and say what I knew about him. 
Q.	Did ******** tell you if a man called ** had been a witness in this case?
A.	He did not tell me.  I learnt about it here.
Q.	How did you hear about it here?  Can you tell me about that?  Who told you about this ****** man?
A.	You asked me whether I knew him.  I explained what I knew about him.
Q.	Is it therefore your testimony, Mr. Witness, that the very first time that you came about the name ******** that you talked about this morning is when I asked you about him or when your counsel asked you about him?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you testified that you left the church in the morning at about 4:30 to 5.  Was it still dark or was it daylight?
THE WITNESS:
It was at dawn.  It was not very clear, but one could see.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, this gendarme who told you that you were going to be attacked the next day, where was he when he told you that?  Was he inside the church or outside the church? 
THE WITNESS:
He was outside the church.  And the other gendarmes had gone to kill these young ladies that I told you about.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did he say it loudly or did he say it in whisper? 
THE WITNESS:
There were three of us quite close to the window and he told us.  We asked him what was happening, we hear people shouting.  And he said these are young ladies that have been kidnapped, and told us that the next day we would also suffer the same fate.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did he tell you not to tell the other people? 
THE WITNESS:
He did not ask us to hide this from the other people.  We informed them, but considering that the refugees did not have a choice, the refugees decided to stay there and those who wished to followed us.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you told the other people they were going to be killed the next day, and 30 of them decided to go and the others decided to stay? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  They stayed there because -- even my parents and my sister stayed with the refugees who were in the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, you told us that Bisesero had several hills.  You remember you gave us the names of several of those hills? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And can you see everywhere on those hills when you are standing on one of them? 
THE WITNESS:
Considering that there were woods here and there on some of the hills, we could not see other hills.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So it is possible for someone to be in the hills and you not to see him? 
THE WITNESS:
I could see the person in question, because when we were attacked on one hill, we moved to another hill.  If the person in question was there, then I would see him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm not asking you about the person in question.  I am asking you if it is possible for someone to be on one hill when you are on another hill and for you not to see him.
THE WITNESS:
It's not possible because we moved together.  We were not in different groups; we were in a group.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am asking you of somebody, not part of your group.  A human being could be on one of those several hills where you cannot see him -- where you cannot see him, either because the hill is behind the other one or because it is wooded.
THE WITNESS:
It is not possible.  We moved over all these hills when we were fleeing, so you cannot say, therefore, that I could not identify one person or another.  We did not stay just on one hill.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did the attackers go with you or did they go on their own? 
THE WITNESS:
The attackers chased us. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it your evidence --
THE WITNESS:
We did not go with them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it your evidence, therefore, that you could or could not see all the attackers all the time? 
THE WITNESS:
I could see them every morning that they came.  And there were people who were advising the assailants, and it is when they gave this advice to the assailants that we saw them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how many of those assailants did you recognise? 

THE WITNESS:
I saw someone called Ndimbati who comes from Gisovu.  The people who were with us knew this Ndimbati.  There was also the bourgmestre of Gishyita who was called Sikubwabo.  These were the people we saw most often.  The others were Interahamwe and gendarmes, as well as other many civilians.  There were people who even spoke Kigoyi, a language that we do not understand very well.  So we could not understand what they were saying.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The only two you could identify were those two.  What about the other hundreds that were there?  You could not identify them?  
THE WITNESS:
Those, I could not have known them because I didn't see them. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, who is this ****** who came to look for you to give evidence?  What's your relationship with him? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not know this ****.  There was no relationship between us.
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know whether he is related to Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know of any relationship that might exist between him and Mika.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you ask him how he came to locate you? 
THE WITNESS:
I asked him.  He told me that he was looking for people who would be able to talk to him about what happened in our region.
JUDGE SHORT:
How long had you known Mika before this incident? 
THE WITNESS:
Even before the war, I knew Mika while he was a trader and a conseiller.
JUDGE SHORT:
What was your relationship with Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
None.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you have any contact with him? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I used to see him and I knew him.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, you've identified two of the attackers, Sikubwabo and somebody else.  Now, did you see Sikubwabo when he arrived? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw Sikubwabo with my own eyes each time there were major attacks; for example, those of the 13th and the 14th, I saw him then.  It was he who was in front of the assailants.
JUDGE SHORT:
How did he arrive, on foot or on a vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
He came onboard a vehicle which was in front of the bus that was carrying the assailants.
JUDGE SHORT:
What kind of a vehicle was it? 
THE WITNESS:
He came onboard a Toyota that belonged, in fact, to a trader called Rulinda.  Sikubwabo had seized this vehicle after killing this gentleman. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How many people were in the vehicle in which he arrived? 
THE WITNESS:
It was carrying other people that I did not know.  I cannot tell you how many there were, but it could be seen that there were many people in the vehicle because the vehicle had space in the back for that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How many people were in the vehicle in the front with Sikubwabo? 
THE WITNESS:
In the cabin, I saw him get out in the company of a gendarme who was carrying a gun.  This is the person that I saw with him.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you didn't identify that person? 
THE WITNESS:
I was not able to identify this gendarme.
JUDGE SHORT:
How many people were giving instructions to the assailants?
THE WITNESS:
It is the bourgmestre.  It is he who ran the commune, and it is he that I saw often.  It is he who, therefore, welcomed the assailants to the commune.

JUDGE SHORT:
Was he the only one giving instructions to the assailants? 
THE WITNESS:
It is he that I saw the most often.
JUDGE KHAN:
Mr. Witness, you talked about the looting in the church, looting of the store in the church.  Did you see Mika in the church at the time of looting? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE KHAN:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we just have a slight matter to raise.  It concerns the translation following up from the question from Honourable Judge Short and my questions concerning the person from the Defence that contacted him.  I get the impression -- and I want to give the witness a chance to confirm whether this is the case.  My Kinyarwanda-speaking assistant has indicated that the name he gave that was translated as****** was actually *****.  Can I get a confirmation from the translators that that was indeed what he said and that was translated as *****, for the record.
THE WITNESS:
******.
JUDGE SHORT:
What did he say?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says ******. 
THE WITNESS:
*****
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home.  

We take a short break and resume after 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed at 1057H)
(Pages 13 to 25 by S. Eboe-Osuji)




	(Court resumed at 1135H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed. 

Good morning, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you being a protected witness, will therefore be referred to as Witness DM in these proceedings.  You also do not disclose your name, or name of your parents, or name of your residence, or any other information that may lead to identify you.  Now you will be sworn to speak the truth. 

Please, Issa, swear in the witness.
 (Declaration made by Witness DM in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have a protected information sheet in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document before me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the particulars mentioned therein? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that these particulars are correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this your signature at the bottom of the page? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes; it is my signature. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  This document is entered as D. 44, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 44 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have the floor for examination-in-chief.  

WITNESS DM,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I'll put a few questions to you, and this is the first question: when did you learn of President Habyarimana's death?
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, that was in the ending at -- at 5 a.m.  In the news, we heard from the morning to evening, we heard that he was dead.  Those are the circumstances under which I heard of his death.
Q.	Who was that person?
A.	Habyarimana.
Q.	At the time, were you at the same address as indicated on the sheet that you have just read?
A.	Yes; I was at the same address. 
Q.	And what was the day of the 7th of April like with regard to security?
A.	On the 7th of April, a communique was broadcast calling on people to stay at home.  No one left their home; we all stayed indoors.
Q.	Do you remember what happened on the 8th of April?
A.	On the 8th, the Hutu and the Tutsi were together; there were no problems. 
Q.	And the following day, Madam Witness, could you tell the Court what that day was like with regard to safety?
A.	The following day the Hutu and the Tutsi were together at a place called Mudukoni.  At that place, people parted company.  The Tutsis went to Bisesero.  Before getting there, they stopped at Rukegero; whereas, the Hutu remained down in the valley.  And, at one time, people went back home and the Tutsi continued their journey towards Bisesero.
Q.	Madam Witness, with the assistance of the registry, we'll show you the name of one area and we shall ask you a few questions regarding that area. 
MR. SONGA:
With your permission, Madam President, I will ask the registry to show this paper to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please show it to the witness and also to the Prosecutor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you have the sheet before you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Have you read the name of the place mentioned on it?
A.	Yes, I have read the name.
Q.	Thank you.  You made mention of the place where you resided.  I would ask you to keep that in mind.  With regard to the name before you, can you tell us how far your place of residence was from that place mentioned on the sheet?
A.	From where I resided, to the place mentioned on the sheet, it is a distance that can be covered in four to five minutes.
Q.	Thank you.  During the events of 1994, did you hear about the distribution of weapons in that location?
A.	At that location, Kiziba, no weapons were distributed because the inhabitants of that area were shepherds who were illiterate.  The -- they were cattle rarers.  There were no inhabitants that knew how to read and write.  The others were soldiers in the army of Habyarimana.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
At this stage, in my examination-in-chief, Madam President, I'll put to the witness a series of questions which will be the last questions, and require a closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR SONGA:
May I proceed?
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 34] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 26 to 28 by Roxane Lane)
















MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registry, please call in the next witness. 
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President, the Defence had prepared three witnesses for today.  I believed that it was enough.  With the discipline, however, that Judge Muthoga has imposed upon me, I have expedited matters so much faster than initially believed.  What is more, we have for this week only six witnesses.  We have already heard four of those witnesses and only two are left.  I think that, at this rate, the remaining two will be heard tomorrow morning.  The next witnesses will only arrive on Friday.  I do not know how many of them there will be, but we would like to prepare them for Monday morning.  This is the situation that we're facing, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you had estimated a time for 45 minutes for each witness. 
MR. SONGA:
It was the maximum.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. SONGA:
And I believe I have remained the average.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We should have, at least, 12 witnesses for the week. 
MR. SONGA:
It is possible, Madam President.  If witness protection brings them to us, we shall bring them to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you tell us why didn't you prepare the other two witnesses when you have given us 45 minutes for each witness? 
MR. SONGA:
This is based on the indications of the day of yesterday.  We thought we might finish with three witnesses, but we only were able to deal with one.  So yesterday there were three witnesses, two of them spent all the time here without being able to be heard, so we did not wish to take the risk to tire them once more.  In addition, or at the same time, we bore in mind that if we were to finish three today, there would only be two of the available witnesses.  That is how we looked at the matter, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, was it your choice to transport six witnesses for this week when you have given us an estimated time of 45 minutes for each witness? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President.  The presence of witnesses here does not depend on me; it depended on the witness protection section. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, please call the witness protection tomorrow morning at 9:00 to give us the explanation why did they only transport six witnesses for this week.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If we don't have any other arguments, we will stop for the day.  We will adjourn and resume tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. 
(Court adjourned at 1220H)
