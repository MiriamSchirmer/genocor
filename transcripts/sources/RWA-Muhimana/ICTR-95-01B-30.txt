EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you a number of questions, and I would like you to answer me concisely.  For starters, how did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana of Rwanda? 
A.	I learned about the death of Habyarimana while I was at home on the 6th of April 1994.  It was about 9 p.m., and as I was about to go to bed, immediately I heard over the radio that the president had just died.  It was therefore necessary for me to go and inform my colleagues who were in another room.  I asked them if they heard the news, and they confirmed that they had learnt of it.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The day following the president's death, that is on the 7th of April, how did you spend the day? 
A.	The next day, I went to my workplace, and when I arrived there, I sat down.  At about 10 a.m., I went to buy some -- to buy a drink.  I went therefore behind my office.  It was a small bar, but it was closed.  I was therefore compelled to go to the centre where I could buy something to drink.
Q.	At what time did you reach your workplace? 
A.	I got there at 7:30.
Q.	At what time did you leave your place of work? 
A.	I left my place of work to go home at 5:30 p.m.
Q.	Do you know a person called Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew Mika Muhimana because he was an authority of the secteur in which I used to reside.
Q.	Did you know him before the events of 1994? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	Do you recall having seen him on that day of the 7th of April? 
A.	On the 7th of April, I saw him.  When I went to the centre where I had to -- I went to buy myself a drink, I saw him come out and enter a house.
Q.	Where you saw him coming out from to get into a house, was it his house? 
A.	Yes.  That's a house where he used to spend the night.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know the members of his family?
A.	As concerns the members of his family, he is one I used to see, his wife as well, a young girl who used to run a small trade near his house in a cooperative, but apparently she used to live in Mika's house.
Q.	Can you tell us a little more on this young girl?  For instance, what could have been her name?    
A.	That young girl had -- was nicknamed Commando but indeed her name was Esperance Mukagasana.
Q.	Can you tell us what might have happened to her during the events of May-June 1994?
A.	Are you referring to that young girl? 
Q.	Yes, indeed, Mr. Witness. 
A.	I learned that a group of persons called Abakiga might have abducted her.
Q.	Did you learn if -- or did you hear that Mika was present when she was abducted?
A.	No.  Mika was not present in the house.
Q.	Mr. Witness, still with respect to Mika's family, did you know his wife?
A.	I knew his wife.  She was called Savera.
Q.	How did you know her?
A.	I knew her because she was a teacher in the centre that was not far from our residence.
Q.	Did you know her ethnic origin?
A.	Yes.  I knew her ethnic origin.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what it was?
A.	She was Tutsi.
Q.	Did Mika and Savera have children?
A.	Yes.  They had two children, two male children.
Q.	Did you know those children?
A.	I knew the children because when I used to go to their parents' home, I would see them.
Q.	Can you tell us what became of them?
A.	I know that one of the two children died.
Q.	Can you tell us the date on which he died?
A.	He died on the 8th, the 8th of April.
Q.	How did you learn about it?
A.	I was in my place of work, and when I came out to go outside, I saw people who had assembled in his house, and I wondered what was happening there.  I therefore went down, and when I got close to the house, I asked the children who were passing by what had happened in that family.  They told me that Mika's child had died.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  If I understood you well, you spent the day in your place of work, except when you got out to go down to the centre. 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Were you able to learn that there was a meeting that brought together members of the population and the authorities of Gishyita on that 7th day of April? 
A.	No.  There was no meeting.
Q.	Mr. Witness, with the assistance of the registry official, I will send to you a name, and on the basis of that name, I'll ask you a number of questions. 

Were you able to read the name, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Does it refer to anybody you know? 
A.	Yes.  I knew this person.
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you got to know the person? 
A.	This is how I knew that person.  I told you that when I went to my place of work, I went out to go and buy something to drink.  When I got to a place behind my place of work -- that person used to run a small bar there.  The bar was closed, and when I got there, I asked where the owner had gone.  I saw an old man who used to be called André.  I asked him where he had gone, and André told me that the operator of that bar left very early in the morning with another group of persons. 
Q.	And the person who gave you the information, did he also tell you where the person had gone and where the group of persons with whom he went away had gone?
A.	Yes.  He said that those people had gone to Bisesero.
Q.	Did you see that person again on the 7th of April? 
A.	On the 7th of April, I didn't see that person, because when I went to my place of work at 10 a.m., I went out to buy a drink, and when I went to the workplace of that person, I realised that his small bar was closed, and I was told that the person in question left early.  So I didn't see him.
Q.	Were you told if he had gone with members of his family? 
A.	Yes.  The person had gone away with his children.  There was nobody, save for the old man that I met thereabouts.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know a person who was called Desideri, D-E-S-I-D-E-R-I, Desideri?  Do you know a person called Desideri?
A.	I knew Desideri because the old man in question told me that he had also gone with the other lady very early in the morning.
Q.	Those two persons, the lady whose name you have on the piece of paper, and Desideri, of what ethnic group was he or were they?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  With the assistance of the registry official, I will send you another name and you will tell me if you know the person who bears that name. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The person is unlikely to be a protected witness? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour.  This will depend on relationship. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci.
MR. SONGA:
Can I proceed with the next question? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have a name in front of you.  Do you know that person? 
A.	I know this person.  He is the one who ******************************.
Q.	What kind of relations did you have with the person? 
A.	He was *************.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see that person on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell us where you saw him on that day of the 7th of April?
A.	On the 7th of April, that person went to his place of work.
Q.	Was it the same place of work as yours?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did he spend the day in -- at that place of work?
A.	No.  That person was not compelled to remain at his place of work.  He could go somewhere else.  He could go out.
Q.	Did you see him holding a meeting with the population or did you learn that he held a meeting involving the population? 
A.	No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this is a leading question.  Did he talk about meeting? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  We'll try to proceed differently. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you learn that a meeting was held at Gishyita on the 7th of April? 
A.	No meeting was held at Gishyita on the 7th of April.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know a person who went by the name Obed Ruzindana?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Did you see him on the 7th of April in Gishyita? 
A.	I didn't see him there.
Q.	Still with respect to the last person whose name is on that piece of paper, did that person have any ties with Mika Muhimana?
A.	No.  He had no ties with Mika Muhimana.
Q.	Did you see them together in April?
A.	Never.
Q.	How about in the month of May?
A.	I never saw them together.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You never saw them together in April? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
April and May? 
THE WITNESS:
I never saw them together. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you see them together in June? 
A.	I have never seen them together. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know a person by the name Mulindahabi?
A.	I knew him.  He was a major figure.  He was an agronomist of our commune.
Q.	Did you know what happened to him during the events of April-May-June 1994?
A.	I know what became of him.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber about him? 
A.	As concerns that person, on the 7th, at about 10:30, I was coming from where I had gone to get a drink, and since it was closed, I went to a trader called Senani.  And after having taken my drink, I went back to my place of work at eleven o'clock, and on my way back, I saw gendarmes at the primary school of the square, and he was there.  He was on a motorcycle in the company of another agronomist.  The gendarmes asked them where they were coming from and took them immediately to the communal office, and they were with a communal police officer, and when they got to the communal office, they put them in custody.
Q.	Did you have the name of this other agronomist?
A.	He was called Nkundiye, N-K-U-N-D-I-Y-E, Nkundiye.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that they were put in a cell.  And what happened subsequently? 
A.	Subsequently, I went home, and when I reached my home, ******************************************** he asked me who had arrested those two persons, and I told him what I had witnessed.  And he told me that it may be possible that those two persons had been killed because -- and they were going to bear the responsibility for his death.  And I told him if those two people had been killed, that would have been following the orders of a lieutenant, because orders were given to everyone, not to move about.  So those people were caught.  They were caught in the act.
Q.	Now, when you saw those people taken to the cell --
JUDGE SHORT:
Hold on.  Those people were caught in what act?  Could you explain what you mean by those people were killed because they were caught in the act? 
THE WITNESS:
People were forbidden from moving about on board vehicles or motorcycles.  When those gendarmes stopped them, they had fuel with them, and so they arrested them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the act for which they were arrested?  What is the act for which they were arrested?
THE WITNESS:
The act, Your Honour, actually was the flagrante delicto; that is, they were doing exactly what they were not allowed to do.  They were arrested because -- because they were seen going about.  I think that it is because people had been forbidden from moving about in vehicles or on motorcycles, but people could walk about, but over short distances. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And this was on the 7th of April? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And who was the lieutenant whose orders you say it must have been through -- on his orders? 
THE WITNESS:
It's a lieutenant that was operating in that region and who had been given the powers by the commander.  He was a gendarme lieutenant.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know his name? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  He couldn't even tell us his name. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And your testimony is that you were told that these two persons may have been killed on the orders of this lieutenant? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  It might have been that he was the one who gave the orders. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Had people been told that if they break the order not to move around, they would be killed? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was it usual for the gendarmes and the communal police to arrest people and kill them? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  That wasn't commonplace. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Continue, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What was the ethnic origin of Mulindahabi?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	And what was Nkundiye's ethnic group?
A.	He was also Tutsi.
Q.	Did you see Mika where those persons were arrested? 
A.	No.  Mika was not there.  When I left the centre, I had left Mika at his home.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know a place called Kiziba? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	How far is it from your place of work? 
A.	The distance between the two places is about one kilometre, probably a little more, or a kilometre and some metres.
Q.	Did you learn that weapons were distributed at Kiziba to the members of the population for the purpose of going to kill the Tutsi? 
A.	I never learned about anything of the sort. 
Q.	I would like to make it clear to you that I'm referring -- or that my question concerns the month of April.  Are you going to confirm your answer in respect of the month of April? 
A.	No.  I never heard or learned that anybody received weapons in that region.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if somebody gave a conflicting testimony, that is that it is Muhimana who killed Mulindahabi and Nkundiye, what would be your reaction?
A.	I would not think this would be possible, as far as I'm concerned.  I was there when those people were arrested and I just left Mika at his home.  I left my place of work at 5:30 p.m. to go home, and when I got home, ***************************** and informed me that he had been told that the people who had been put in the cell had been killed and that the order for them to be killed had been given by a lieutenant.  So as far as I'm concerned, it is out of the question that it could be Mika that killed them, especially as it was said that the orders for them to be killed were given by this lieutenant I mentioned. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it the same person who appears on the piece of paper in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this is the same person.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You've answered the question that it was impossible for Mika to be the one who killed them.  You've given a long explanation.  I want to ask you one or two very short questions.  One of them is:  Were you there when they were killed?
THE WITNESS:
No.  I wasn't there. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know the time when they were killed? 
THE WITNESS:
I think they were killed between seven and 6:30 p.m., because ********************************, arrived at the house at about 7:30 p.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
P.m.  Between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., were you with Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I was at home. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were at home, alone, without -- Mika was not with you at home? 
THE WITNESS:
Mika was not with me. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in his capacity as conseiller of the secteur, could Mika command policemen? 
A.	No, he could not give orders to policemen.
Q.	As a conseiller of the secteur, did Mika have an office in Gishyita? 
A.	He did not have an office.  He worked out of his home.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you're telling us that ******************** told you about the death of two agronomists.  Did he tell you who killed these two agronomists?  
A.	It is these gendarmes and the policeman who probably killed these two agronomists, on the orders of this lieutenant.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were asked whether ************************ told you who killed the agronomists.  Answer that question. 
THE WITNESS:
When he came, he told me that the people in the cell had been killed by the gendarmes and the policeman who had arrested them, on the orders of this lieutenant.  Therefore, he said that he would **********************************. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who would************************? 
THE WITNESS:
**********************. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have referred to gendarmes and policeman.  Is it possible to give their names? 
A.	I did not know these gendarmes, but the policeman was called Ruhindura.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you know a policeman called Charles?
A.	I knew him.  He was also the policeman for the commune.  But afterwards, he gave up this job and he went back to his area of residence.
Q.	Did you hear what happened to him? 
A.	I heard of it.
Q.	Can you tell the Court? 
A.	I learned that he was killed during an attack against Bisesero and that it is the Abakiga who killed him.
Q.	Do you know what happened to his body? 
A.	No.
Q.	Did you hear that on the 7th of April, Mika raped girls in his home? 
A.	I don't know whether you can imagine that to be possible.  How do you think a person who has a wife can do such a thing?  It is not possible, in my view.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Answer the question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall repeat the question, and the Court is asking you to give a concise answer.  Did you learn that girls were raped by Mika in his home on the 7th of April? 
A.	I did not hear of it, and it did not take place.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why do you say it did not take place? 
THE WITNESS:
I say this because I never heard such a thing.  Besides, it's not possible.  It cannot be done. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why not? 
THE WITNESS:
Because, in my view, a person who is married cannot rape someone in his own home, especially young girls.  It's not possible. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe I understood that you mentioned the name of Esperance Mukagasana; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you hear that she had been raped by Mika? 
A.	I never heard such a thing.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am almost inclined to apologise for my speed.  I have concluded my examination-in-chief. 

Mr. Witness, I thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You need not apologise, but thank you for being quick. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for your cross-examination. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good morning, Your Honours.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAPAYA:
Maybe we should enter the documents the Defence have tendered because I may wish to use them in my cross-examination. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sure. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank the Prosecutor for this reminder. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first document with the name is entered as Exhibit D. 67, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 67 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the second is Exhibit D. 68, under seal.  Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. 68 admitted, under seal.)
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have asked that document be placed before you because I want to start my examination --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which of the two have you asked to be placed before him? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's D. 68, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
D. 68, thank you. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you know that ********************* charged with Mika Muhimana, along with others in this case? 
A.	I would have heard of it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you mean initially? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
They were charged together? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  If we get him now, we may wish to join them up because the indictment is still there.
JUDGE SHORT:
And what's your answer?  Because the translation I got is, "I would have heard of it."  I'm not sure what that means.  Witness, what's your answer to the question? 
THE WITNESS:
Would you mind repeating the question? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Were you aware that *************************************************************** charged with Mika Muhimana, or was initially jointly charged with Mika Muhimana in this case? 
A.	Yes.  I heard of it. 
Q.	Have the Defence told you that many Prosecution witnesses testified that they saw **************** and Mika participating in committing crimes in Gishyita, in Gishyita and Bisesero, between April, May and June?  Are you aware of that?
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you suggesting to him that the Defence told him that? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, I'm asking him whether he's aware of that, whether the Defence have told him that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Ask him whether they've told him.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Have the Defence told you that? 
A.	No.  They did not tell me that.
Q.	They didn't even tell you that some -- even some Defence witnesses have testified that ************* was seen participating in crimes at Mubuga church on 15th of April?  Have they told you --
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I don't know whether the Prosecutor phrased his question correctly, because I can hear him say that the Defence witnesses said that ****************************************************** ********** and Mika are alleged to have committed crimes.  I didn't hear any Defence witness say any such thing.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This question was whether these two persons were seen together.  The Defence witnesses testified that Mika and *********, they were seen together in --
MR. KAPAYA:
DC testified to that, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
They were seen together where? 
MR. KAPAYA:
At Mubuga church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What I find -- Mr. Kapaya, what I find a little unnerving in your question is your insistence that -- whether the Defence told him that as opposed to what would he say if witnesses said that.  I think you're making a thinly veiled attack on the reputation of the Defence. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Are you aware that Defence witnesses testified that you -- that ************* who appears there was seen with Mika at Mubuga church?  Are you aware of that?
A.	No.  I'm not aware of that.
Q.	Are you aware also that other Defence witnesses, like DD, saw ************ participating in attacks at Muyira hill on the 13th and 14th of May 1994?  Are you aware of that?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya, how would the witness be expected to be aware of what a witness testified?  Why don't you ask him or tell him, "In fact, a witness testified this position.  What is your position on it?   Do you agree with it, or what do you say about it?"
JUDGE SHORT:
Or maybe would he be surprised to hear that a Defence witness has testified to this effect?  That would be a more appropriate way of confronting him with this kind of evidence. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be surprised to hear that witnesses, Defence witnesses at that, have testified that ******************* --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Specify the witnesses, too, which witnesses. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I said DD, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
DD? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Go ahead. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q. Mr. Witness, on the 17th of August, '94 -- 2004, a witness, DC, told this Tribunal that *********** who appears there was a ring leader of crimes that were committed at Mubuga church.  Would you be surprised to hear that? 
MR. SONGA:
Objection.  Madam President, I would like to understand whether the person being referred to is only the **********************.  I would like to --

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would counsel please repeat the question? 
MR. KAPAYA:
To simplify the process, I will simply refer to the question and answer in the transcript that was asked on that day as regards to Witness DC.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya, with respect --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This witness is a witness in his own right.  Other witnesses have come and said whatever they have said.  He has no basis on which he would know what the witnesses have said, and you can't properly confront him with it.  You can merely ask him would he be surprised by that kind of evidence and what would be his response, but you don't have to put it out of -- on the transcript at all. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, that's what I was doing before Mr. -- counsel for the Defence intervened.  He said that that is not what this witness testified here.  The idea is to show that that witness had said that actually the person who appears there was the ringleader of the people who went to attack the Mubuga church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is correct, but for your part it is merely to say that has been said.  It doesn't really matter whether Professor Songa agrees or doesn't agree with the transcript. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Okay.  Witness, would you be surprised to hear that the person who appears there was said to be the ringleader of the persons who took part in the crimes at Mubuga church?
A.	It is not true. 
Q.	All right.  And if I tell you that Defence witnesses have said before this Tribunal that he was seen at Muyira hill along with others on the 12th and 13th of April participating in attacks on Tutsi, would you be surprised to hear that? 
A.	It wouldn't be true. 
Q.	Or that on the 16th of April, he was seen participating in attacks at Mugonero complex; would you be surprised at that? 
A.	I know nothing of that.
Q.	Can you tell us whether you know where that person is now? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is courageous on your part, Mr. Prosecutor, but, nevertheless, ask the question. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, if you feel like telling us? 
A.	I don't know where this person is at this time.  I saw him for the last time when we were in the forests of former Zaire.
Q.	And what year was that? 
A.	It was in 1995.
Q.	Do you have reason to believe whether he has moved from that place or has not moved?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's not a fair question, Mr. Kapaya.  Don't investigate through the witness.  He's talking about ***** ****** 
MR. KAPAYA:
Maybe the witness may have a wish to respond to that question, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I know he will, but on the other hand, I think you're asking him an unfair question. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Okay, Your Honour, then I withdraw the question, if that's the view of the Bench. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Certainly my view.  It's not necessarily the view of the whole Bench, but definitely, any probing into the whereabouts of ************** is not a fair process for this -- for the trial. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.  I withdraw the question, if that is the position of the -- the view of the Bench, Your Honours, of the majority. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How is this line of questioning relevant to your cross-examination on the counts against the Accused?  If you could establish the relevance of this, then it would be in order. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour may recall that in our pre-trial brief we have charged -- we have alleged a joint criminal enterprise, that is between this person -- that person, Muhimana and others.  That is why.  So it is important for us if -- it's important for us to know the whereabouts of that particular person because we are interested in him.  Secondly, he has taken an oath to speak the truth.  If he knows, he can speak the truth, "I know where he is" or "I don't know."  That's our view, Your Honours. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Yeah, and I agree with you that to that extent there might be some relevance, but you've already asked him if he knows the whereabouts of this person, and I believe he answered that question by saying that he did not -- he does not know; the last time he saw him was in the forest somewhere in Zaire in 1995.

MR. KAPAYA:
That's right, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
But at the moment -- since then, he does not know his whereabouts.  Can you go any further than that, once he has denied knowing his whereabouts or knowing whether -- you also asked him whether he's aware that he has been charged with the Accused, and he said he's not aware of that, right?  Don't you think you've exhausted that line of questioning then? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Then I will proceed in a different manner, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, what that person was fleeing from in 1995?  What did he flee from? 
A.	He went into exile because there was war in the country, there was no safety, and it became necessary for people to flee.
Q.	What was the connection between the fleeing and the war?  Why would he flee from that?  People were still there up to today who were --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But the witness is one of those who fled.  Why don't you ask the witness, "Why were you fleeing yourself?" 
MR. KAPAYA:
Okay.  Let's move to another line of questions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can ask the question, Mr. Kapaya, the last question which you wanted to put to the witness. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have reason to believe that the person who appears on that document has or has not moved from Zaire? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Was that the question? 
JUDGE SHORT:
The question was whether he knows why the person fled, or whether -- or whether you are putting it directly to him that the person fled because of his involvement in the acts of genocide.  I think that was the thrust of your earlier question which we are saying you can put to him. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I didn't recall the sequence of the questions because of the interruptions that have come up in the course of the cross-examination. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, you testified that that person was not involved in any wrongdoing between April, May and June.  Now, what did he flee from, if he was not involved in wrongdoing? 
A.	He fled because the war which had started in Kigali spread to Gitarama and even into our region, and the people fled because there were gunshots, even though outside that building.  When gunshots were fired, everyone fled, and there might have been a mad rush to flee.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is it your testimony, then, Witness, that you are not aware that that person whose name appears on the piece of paper fled because he was involved in acts of genocide and that he is wanted for his participation in those acts?  Are you saying that you're not aware that that is the reason why that person fled from the country?  Is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
What I mean is that he fled following the outbreak of war which was raging through the country. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I understand what you have said, but I am asking you:  Are you aware that he fled for a special reason, namely his involvement in criminal acts committed during the period, during the genocide period?  Are you aware of that or not?  Or are you saying that he fled just like many other people who left the country because there was war in the country?  Which is your evidence?  What is your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
He fled from the war, just like the others did.  I don't know whether he fled because of acts he may have committed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, I'm still on that person.  Was he working in April, after the downing of the presidential plane?  Did he go to work from the 6th of April to the end of April?
A.	Yes.  He was working. 
Q.	Was he working in May 1994? 
A.	He was working.
Q.	How about June, up to mid-June, 15th -- up to -- how about July, up to 15th July 1994?  Was he on duty? 
A.	We left the country on the 30th.  When we got to the former Zaire --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
30th of which month? 
THE WITNESS:
The 30th of June.  Because, on the 1st of July, we were in ex-Zaire, the other country I mentioned. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Was Muhimana working in April '94, after the 6th of April? 
A.	He was working in his house.  I believe he was working.
Q.	How about in May and June '94?  Was he working? 
A.	He was still working.  I believe he left the country in July.
Q.	Now, was it part and parcel of ******************************************************************************* ****************?  Was that part of his functions? 
A.	During the war, the situation was very complicated, because when the war reached its peak, the Abakiga came and wrought havoc in the country, doing whatever they wanted.  ******************* had no control over people, such that he couldn't put an end to such disorder.
Q.	That was not my question, Mr. Witness.  My question was this:  Was it ********************************** *********************** in April, May and June?  That's all I asked. 
A.	That person was *************************************************************, but during the war, he did not have the means to do so.
Q.	Was Mika Muhimana responsible for security in his secteur in April, May and June? 
A.	I believe he did not have that responsibility, since people did not listen to him.
Q.	You say he didn't have that responsibility because people didn't listen to him or it was not part of his official functions to maintain security in the secteur? 
A.	What I mean is that during the war, the conseiller had no control over the population.
Q.	Now, how many communal policemen were posted at the Gishyita commune office? 
A.	There were two police officers there.
Q.	Isn't it true that a bourgmestre could commission for reinforcements from the préfet if the need arose?  Isn't that the position? 
A.	It was possible.  By the way, that is why the commander requisitioned gendarmes who were posted in certain secteurs, and those gendarmes provided for security from those secteurs, from the posts where they were working in these various secteurs.
Q.	And how many -- how many gendarmes were commissioned during April, May and June, to your knowledge? 
A.	They were working in shifts.  I cannot tell you the exact number because every day they worked in shifts in certain centres.
Q.	There was also a pickup assigned to the commune, was there not? 
A.	That pickup had been brought by a gendarme, and since the officials of the commune did not have a vehicle, that pickup was requisitioned by them for use in the commune.
Q.	Was that pickup in use between April, May and June? 
A.	Yes.  That pickup was used during that period.
Q.	And wasn't it a fact that the bourgmestre and sometimes one Gisambo used to drive that pickup? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Are you saying that the bourgmestre never used to drive that car, that vehicle? 
A.	That pickup was driven by the bourgmestre and his driver.
Q.	And what was the name of his driver? 
A.	He had no driver.
Q.	And what functions did Gisambo do at the commune? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you say he had no driver? 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what he said, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Earlier you said that this pickup was driven by the bourgmestre and his driver. 
THE WITNESS:
He drove that pickup alone. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you saying you did not say earlier that the pickup was driven by the bourgmestre and his driver? 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you remember the type -- the make of this pickup? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you tell us? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a Stout, Toyota, blue in colour.
JUDGE SHORT:
A blue Toyota. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he have a driver? 
THE WITNESS:
He did not have a driver. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Did you know a person called Gisambo, between April, May and June? 
A.	I did not know that person.
Q.	April, May and June, did you testify that neither the Accused, that is Mika, **********************, held any meetings at the commune centre or at the Gishyita centre?  Was that your testimony? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There was no testimony like that, Mr. Kapaya.  The testimony was there was no meeting on the 7th and also that during April, May and June, the witness never saw the person attend there with Mika.  I did not get the evidence that there was no meeting, that he said there was no meeting at all in the months. 

MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, that's why I was asking, Your Honour, to confirm that that is what he said.  If he said differently, then I will ask him whether he said differently. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You shouldn't ask him that he said something he didn't say.  You should ask him what he said, if he -- if it's one you want to follow up on, but if you tell him the evidence was that you did not -- there was no meeting in April, May and June, when he didn't say so, it is not a fair question. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Let me rephrase my questions.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, did ********************* hold any meetings in Gishyita centre between April, May and June?  Did he or did he not? 
A.	No meetings were held. 
Q.	Did Mika Muhimana hold any meetings in Gishyita centre between April, May and June? 
A.	No meetings were held.  If any meetings had been held, I would have participated in them.
Q.	Can you tell us how, then, the security situation was communicated to the people in the area by the leadership? 
A.	What I know is that the bourgmestre told the secteur, and members of the population could ask questions to him regarding the population, and the bourgmestre would answer saying that there was no problem with regard to security. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, before the events of April '94, did the conseiller or the bourgmestre hold meetings in Gishyita? 
THE WITNESS:
No meetings were held. 
JUDGE SHORT:
They never held meetings to communicate with the people in their communes or secteurs? 
THE WITNESS:
When the war broke out, it was not possible to hold meetings because there was disorder; people moved from one place to the other, went to Bisesero and elsewhere.  There was disagreement within the population.  It was not possible to hold a meeting. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm asking you before the war broke out.  Were meetings held before the war broke out? 
THE WITNESS:
Before the war broke out, meetings were held.
JUDGE SHORT:
And how were the people informed about these meetings? 
THE WITNESS:
The bourgmestre informed the conseiller that on such-and-such a day, there would be meetings, and the conseiller, in turn, informed members of the comité de cellule and the members of the comité de cellule informed the people.  That is how those meetings were organised. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So the bourgmestre worked very closely with the conseiller; is that not so?  The bourgmestre communicated his instructions to the conseiller? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, prior to the war.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you -- and during the war, the bourgmestre did not communicate with his conseiller; he did not work closely with the conseiller during the war? 
THE WITNESS:
During the war, it was no longer possible.  There were disturbances, and it was not possible to hold meetings in areas where there was insecurity. 
JUDGE SHORT:
It was not possible for the bourgmestre to contact the conseiller to have discussions with the conseiller about the security situation? 
THE WITNESS:
That could have been possible, but what was impossible was rallying all the conseillers.  For instance, in the Bisesero regions, conseillers of certain secteurs could not be found and also in Mubuga region, it was not possible to find conseillers of that area.  There was also Ngoma.  It was also impossible to rally the conseillers of that area.  It was therefore very difficult and impossible to rally all the conseillers at a meeting.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You said there were meetings before the war.  Can you tell us how many meetings -- such meetings did you attend?  
(Pages 1 to 22 by Mark Porter)










	1100H
THE WITNESS:
Before the war, many meetings were held.  I am not in a position to state to you how many meetings I attended because meetings were not held every day.  But once or twice a month, there was a meeting. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you say that during the war not a single meeting was held.  Is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
During the war, it was impossible to convene such a meeting. 
JUDGE SHORT:
In your area, the situation was so chaotic that it was impossible to convene a meeting? 
THE WITNESS:
Because there were security problems, it was not possible to organise a meeting because there was intense fighting.  It was impossible to rally members of the population. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you know where the bourgmestre used to go during April, May, June, with his car? 
A.	He often went to areas where there was fighting.  On one occasion he went to Kiziba.  He brought weapons that had been seized from people.  Those arms were brought back to the commune, and the bourgmestre was accompanied by gendarmes.  I saw that with my own eyes.  I saw machetes, clubs, and spears. 
Q.	Would he normally leave alone or used to leave with people in the car? 
A.	He was the one who drove the vehicle, but he was often accompanied by gendarmes. 
Q.	Was there any occasion on which he and Mika left together? 
A.	I haven't -- I never saw Mika board that vehicle. 
Q.	You testified that Mulindahabi and Nkundiye were killed allegedly because they contravened the order to not move around; is that correct? 
A.	Given the prevailing situation, on that day people could go out and move about on foot, but if you were on board a motorbike or in a vehicle, you were arrested. 
Q.	So if you wanted to move around, say you wanted to move from Gishyita to Kibuye town with a motor vehicle, what procedure would you follow?  Was there mechanisms set in place to allow movement of people in cars during April, May, June? 
A.	You could move about provided you had a travel document allowing you to move about.  As far as I could understand, on that day people could be seen transporting petrol, and it was thought that they were trying to create insecurity, and that is why they were arrested. 
Q.	Who, to your knowledge, Mr. Witness, used to issue the travel permits during the war? 
A.	During that period, no one could move about without documents.  When you left one commune to go through another, you needed official documents because if you were arrested without a document, there was no explanation you could give for that. 
Q.	Is it true that the process of getting a document started with the conseiller and then one would move to his bourgmestre?  Was that the procedure? 
MR. SONGA:
Objection, Madam President.  I would like to be sure that what the witness is saying is well translated insofar as the documents are concerned, because in Kinyarwanda I'm hearing ibyangombwa and I hear the Prosecutor talking about travel documents.  I wonder if the interpreters can reassure us that ibyangombwa in Kinyarwanda means "travel documents".  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you respond, Mr. Interpreter? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we used the word document. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And my question, Mr. Witness, was that in order to get that travel document, does the process, does the process start with your secteur conseiller and then move up to the bourgmestre?  Can you tell us then --
A.	No.
Q.	-- how it's done? 
A.	The procedure began with the commune. 
Q.	To your knowledge, April, May, June, did any people come to the commune office to get travel documents to go anywhere? 
A.	Yes.  ************************* 
Q.	Witness, on --
JUDGE SHORT:
************************ 
THE WITNESS:
Some ************ to apply for documents that would enable them to travel, and sometimes **** ***************.  And the person concerned, they would come later and sign them out. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, there was a meeting in Kibuye town on the 3rd of May, 1994.  Are you aware of that meeting? 
A.	Yes, I never heard about it.
Q.	You never heard that the prime minister, Kambanda, convened a security meeting in Kibuye town on the 3rd of May, '94? 
A.	I know nothing of it. 
Q.	So it follows logically, does it not, that the bourgmestre and Mika didn't attend that meeting? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness didn't hear of the meeting, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's why I put the word logically, Your Honour.  I withdraw that part of the question. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Let me, let me recall your evidence, Witness.  Did you say that the bourgmestre used to go around and then talk to people and then people would ask him questions, and this was how he communicated with the people?  Was that the evidence you gave earlier? 
THE WITNESS:
That is what I told you.  When the bourgmestre went to your place, the members of the population living in the area would come and ask him questions, and he would provide instructions to them. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So the security situation permitted the bourgmestre to go around areas and to talk to people and they asked him questions, but the security situation did not make it possible for meetings to be held? 
THE WITNESS:
The bourgmestre could not convene or organise a meeting because he wouldn't have been able to bring together every person because there was a problem between the members of the population.  There was some conflict amongst the population. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So how was he able to -- you earlier said that he met people and people asked him questions.  How did these meetings -- if you don't want to call it a meeting, but how did these encounters or dialogue take place? 
THE WITNESS:
Before the war meetings used to be held, but when the war broke out, it was impossible for the bourgmestre to convene and hold a meeting because a portion of the population had gone to Bisesero; others were dispersed here and there.  So the bourgmestre couldn't have been able to convene and hold a meeting because he would have had only a few people.
JUDGE SHORT:
You said that during the war the bourgmestre could not hold meetings, but he could go around the communes, go around the areas, and he could talk to the people and the people would ask him questions.  Is that not your evidence, that this happened during the war? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I said.  And when he went to whatever centre, people would come to him and would ask him what conduct to hold.  I am talking about two or three persons but not the entire population. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, now let's briefly look at the situation in the Gishyita centre.  Apart from Mulindahabi and Nkundiye, are you aware of any other people who were killed during April, May, and June in Gishyita centre? 
A.	I don't know any others. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, how long would you take to conclude your cross-examination? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Maybe 10 minutes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, then we'll continue with your cross-examination, and after concluding the evidence of this witness, then we'll be able to stop for the day because there is no other witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, go ahead. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	What did you say?  Did you say -- did you testify that apart from Mulindahabi and Nkundiye, there was no other deaths that you witnessed in Gishyita centre?  Is that your testimony? 
A.	No, I didn't see any others. 
Q.	Was Gishyita centre operational between April, May, and June?  I mean, were shops open?  Were people doing business? 
A.	Insofar as that is concerned, I will tell you that there were few people who used to open their shops, but others, like the Tutsi, had gone to take refuge on the Bisesero hills. 
Q.	And who are the Hutu you recall used to do business at Gishyita centre around -- in April, May, and June? 
A.	There was a certain Senani and a certain Ziraseka.
Q.	Did you know one Assiel Kabanda? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.  He was a trader in that centre.  Even at a certain point, he went bankrupt.  He sold one of his shops to a certain Bosco, and he went to the hills and resided there. 
Q.	Do you know what became of him in May or June '94, before you fled? 
A.	I learned later, and I'm thinking of the month of May, that he would have been killed at Bisesero and that he was killed by the Abakiga. 
Q.	Did you see his head hung at the door of his shop? 
A.	No, not at all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us what is Abakiga?  What do you mean by the Abakiga? 
THE WITNESS:
The Abakiga were young persons who used to come from Gisenyi.  Those people were sent officially to protect or ensure security, but those were people who had been given military training. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Their job was to keep the security and to look after the people, not to kill the persons?
THE WITNESS:
I know that when those people arrived, they said, "We realise that there's lots of fighting here, but what are you doing?  Let us do the work." 
JUDGE SHORT:
So you are saying that the Abakiga were asked to go and provide security, but instead they were killing people; is that what you're saying? 
THE WITNESS:
They killed people, because when they arrived they started threatening people.  For instance, I couldn't move about, and when I met the Abakiga, I tried to hide because I run the risk of being killed by them. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They said, "You were not working.  Let them do the work."  Is that what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE SHORT:
And the work you are referring to was killing? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know the Interahamwe? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know the Interahamwe.  They were the youth of the MRND party, and those people also received military training. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you have Interahamwes in your region? 
THE WITNESS:
There were no Interahamwe in our region because the MRND party did not exist there. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And who gave them the training? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know who used to give them the training.  What I know is that the MRND party used to provide them with uniforms and issued instructions to them. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And did they have -- were they armed?  Did they have weapons? 
THE WITNESS:
When they arrived, some of them had weapons; others didn't have weapons with them. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And did you get to know about their activities during the war, what they did? 
THE WITNESS:
During the war, they came to our area and they said, "But these people are from Kibuye.  We don't know what kind of people they are.  They haven't done nothing.  Fighting is not going to stop here."  And so immediately, they took over Bisesero. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us which party did Mika belong to? 
THE WITNESS:
As concerns Mika Muhimana's party, I think that he was a member of the MDR party.  That was Mika's party, I think. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And the bourgmestre's party, what was it? 
A.	The bourgmestre, when he came to the area he came from the army, and a soldier didn't have the right to belong to a political party.  And when he started working -- now, listen, I am hesitating.  I think he did not have a political party. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that he did not belong to any political party? 
THE WITNESS:
Maybe he belonged to a political party, but I did not see him working actively in any party whatsoever.  You know, in the country there were some political parties.  Probably he was a member of some other party. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this Abakiga, what was their ethnic group? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Abakiga or the members of Abakiga?
MR. KAPAYA:
The ethnic group of the Abakiga, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Or the members.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Or the members.
MR. KAPAYA:
Or the members of the Abakiga.
JUDGE SHORT:
What was the common ethnic group? 
THE WITNESS:
I think that the Abakiga were Hutu. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is it your testimony, then, that all attacks in Gishyita commune were perpetrated by people other than those coming from Gishyita, from within Gishyita commune? 
A.	No, there were also soldiers who were collaborating with the assailants.  I'm talking about the gendarmes.
Q.	In other words, were there any civilians in Gishyita commune who took part in attacks on Tutsi in Gishyita commune? 
A.	It is possible that there might have been bandits who took part in things like that, you know, for the purpose of looting. 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's, that's all, Your Honour, from the Prosecution.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kapaya.

Any re-examination, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
I don't have any re-examination, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, during April and May and June, did you yourself work? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I used to go to my place of work, and I had lots of work. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You had a lot of work at your place of work.  And that place of work, is it **************************** ****************? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you say that he used to go out and meet people and do other things, out to the population, including Bisesero? 
THE WITNESS:
This is what I can say:  That person used to ************************************************************** ****************** with weapons, and he was accompanied by soldiers or military men.  And I heard that those weapons had been seized from people who were fighting in Kiziba, and so they had seized clubs and machetes and spears from them. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did ******************************
THE WITNESS:
Me, on my part, I had ************** because I was very busy. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And therefore ****************? 
THE WITNESS:
*************************************************************************************************************** ***************************
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, on the 7th of April you said you went to work, and then you left your office.  Now, tell us, exactly how long were you away from the office, from what time to what time? 
THE WITNESS:
On that day I went to the office.  I left the office at 10:00 to go and buy a drink.  I went by the house of a certain lady who has a small bar.  It had been closed.  I went to the centre, and I came back later to the office, and at 5 p.m. I went back home. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And my question is, how long did you stay out of the office?  When you left the office, what time did you return to the office? 
THE WITNESS:
I left the office, and I came back at midday.  I left the office half an hour later.  I went to the house, I ate, and came back to the office. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So you left the office at about, was it 10 or 10:30, you said, and came back at 12? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you saw --
THE WITNESS:
That is when I came back to the office.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you saw Mika at what time? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May the Honourable Judge use his microphone.  Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you saw Mika at what time at the Gishyita centre? 
THE WITNESS:
I left the office at about 11:45, and when I left the centre, Mika remained there. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And what time did you -- you said you saw two people arrested, this agronomist, you -- what time did you witness that event? 
THE WITNESS:
That happened at about 11:45.  That is when I left the centre. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, you also stated that the bourgmestre and Mika could not ensure security during the war.  Could you tell me why, why not?  What prevented them from preserve -- ensuring security? 
THE WITNESS:
The reason is as follows:  During the period the war intensified, and the conseiller virtually had no powers any more.  Probably, the conseiller -- or, rather, the bourgmestre could call on the military men and ask them to bring him assistance, and that is why.  And besides, those military men were -- had been sent.  I think the military commander sent his soldiers to ensure security in the commune; otherwise, the bourgmestre alone couldn't do anything. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But the bourgmestre did not do that, did not seek assistance in order to ensure security?  In your area, I'm talking about. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know anything about it, but I know that at a certain point when *******************, I saw military men who had taken position at that location.  I don't know who had asked those military men to come.  I don't know if it was a commander or someone else, but I saw them taking up positions on that location. 

JUDGE SHORT:
Now, tell me, what's the normal relationship between the bourgmestre and the conseiller, to your knowledge? 
THE WITNESS:
To the best of my knowledge, the bourgmestre collaborates with the conseiller within the framework of meetings, for instance, with the population, and I think this is how the bourgmestre collaborates with the conseiller. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this brings us to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony and wish you a safe trip home.

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the door. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
This was the last witness for this week.  The witness support section had agreed to bring in 11 witnesses, but only seven witnesses were made available for this week.  Mr. Constant, could you inform the witness support section that we should have at least 12 witnesses for the next week. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Madam President, I will do so, but I think they brought nine witnesses for this week, and they programmed to bring 10 more witnesses -- they were supposed to bring 10 more witnesses yesterday, but they couldn't do so.  They are expecting them today.  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, are you able to let us know, and if so when, who the next witnesses will be? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, as much as we can, we try to comply with the schedule of appearance as we showed in our definitive list.  So if the protection witness -- the witness protection unit can bring number 9, 10, and 11 and 12, that's the order that I will follow.

Madam President, before you declare that we rise, I would like to make an oral motion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.

During the appearance of Witness DAC yesterday, there was a misunderstanding with respect to where the witness stated concerning the children of Witness BG.  In the Kinyarwanda version, as in the French translation that I heard, the witness stated that Witness BG had a child, but that if this were to be disputed by telling him that BG had other children, he could well accept, insofar as BG could have -- or might have had other children entrusted to her. 

When I gave that version that I think I heard well in both Kinyarwanda and French, the Honourable Judge Short pointed out to me that this would be an additional element that I was bringing up.

For purposes of knowing the truth and in order to protect our personal integrity, we would like to request from the high Chamber to do the necessary verification from what the witness stated and to ascertain whether the English translation that reached the Judges, that was heard by the Judges, was -- faithfully captured the statement of Witness DAC.  This is the purport of my oral motion, Madam President, Your Honours, and I will be grateful for the attention you will give it.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have the transcript, and we will look into it on Monday morning comparing -- and compare the English and the French. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, did you say that you are expecting ten witnesses today for the next week?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, ten detained witnesses in Rwanda are expected to arrive today.  I believe there are other witnesses coming from other locations.  I will verify and notify the Chamber accordingly.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.

We stop here for today and resume Monday morning at nine.  Thank you.
