MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to all present here.  The Court is in session now.  May we have the appearances for the Prosecution? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, members of the Defence.  The Prosecutor today is represented by Mr. Phillips and myself, Kapaya, Ms. Madenga and Ms. Lauriston.  Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the Defence, please. 
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, my learned friends of the Prosecution.  The Defence team shall comprise Professor Nyabirungu Songa, Maitre Kazadi Kabimba, Maitre Léopold Munderere and Mathias Sahinkuye.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Good afternoon, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you being a protected witness, you will not be called by your name.  You will be referred to as Witness AT in these proceedings.  Also please do not disclose your name, place of residence or any other information which may lead to your identification.  You shall speak the truth, and for that you have to take solemn declaration. 

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
	(Declaration made by Witness AT in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 

Mr. Prosecutor, please, you have the floor for the examination-in-chief. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Before I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Kapaya, before you proceed, how many statements -- written statements of this witness do we have? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah.  That's what I wanted to say, Your Honour, that the witness has made five statements, one dated 20th June, 1996, the other one on 10th July 1996.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first one is 20th June 1996?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the second one is 10th July, 1996?
MR. KAPAYA:
That's correct, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the third one is?
MR. KAPAYA:
The third one is the 7th of February -- 12th of November 1999.  The fourth one is dated the 7th February 2002.  And the last one is dated 27th August 2002. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we don't have the last one? 
MR. KAPAYA:
You will notice, Your Honours, that in the binder there are only two statements, that of November, '99 and August 2002.  We disclosed the other ones to Your Honours and the Defence last week, was it Thursday?  Thursday or Friday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Yes, we have received three written statements but not the statement of August 27, 2002. 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's in the binder, Your Honour; the one on 27 August 2002 is in the binder.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. KAPAYA:
And due to this apparent late disclosure, we have decided to limit the testimony of this witness to the events relating to Mugonero complex only.  So I will not lead any evidence on Bisesero, although, of course, the Defence is at liberty to cross-examine him on that respect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I wish also to point out, Your Honours, that the witness testified in Kayishema/Ruzindana as Witness FF on the 17th and 18th of November, '97, and he also testified as Witness GG in Ntakirutimana on the 20th, 24th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
GG in Ntakirutimana? 
MR. KAPAYA:
GG in Ntakirutimana on the 20th, 23rd, 24th and 25th of September 2001. 

I now wish to proceed with my examination-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, please proceed.  
WITNESS AT,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, just for a moment.  You are going to lead your evidence on the written statement of 12th of November 1999 and --
MR. KAPAYA:
And the one of 27th of August.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
27th of August, 2002. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, but at the same time I pointed out that I limit the examination-in-chief to only the activities in Mugonero complex.  I will not touch on Bisesero with this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Please proceed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness AT, do you have a piece of paper before you that contains your personal particulars? 
A.	Yes, I have the document before me. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I didn't hear the witness's response. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He has it before him, he says, but I don't have it before me.
MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry, Your Honour.  Maybe we should furnish that.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, this is Witness PW-13 before this Court? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It is. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, did you and I go through these particulars and that you verified the truth of what is contained therein by appending your signature on the document?    
A.	Yes. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I produce the particulars, the document containing the particulars of this witness, Prosecution Exhibit -- as Prosecution Exhibit P. 17, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It will be so entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 17, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 17 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness AT, I'm going to ask you questions concerning the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994, particularly in April, to the extent that you know them.  Do you understand me? 
A.	I am following you, Mr. Trial Attorney.
Q.	Were you resident in Gishyita commune, Kibuye préfecture, in Rwanda, in April 1994?
A.	Yes. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I'm sorry, I don't get the English translation, the response, from the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe your headphone is not working. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Prosecutor, can you hear the interpreter's voice now? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Now, I can, thank you very much.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
You're most welcome.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, as you went about your life in April, '94, do you recall hearing about the death of the president, President Habyarimana, that month?
A.	We heard about it.
Q.	Now, did you observe any unusual activities following the death of the president on that date? 
A.	On the day following the death of Habyarimana, let's say three or four days later, there was a poor climate that set in in our locality, and the Hutus had adopted a rather poor attitude.
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours what exactly you observed three days following the death of the president?  
A.	After Habyarimana's death, for those who did not have radio sets, we learned of the death on the Thursday morning when we were told that the plane that was carrying the president had been downed.  And three days later, Hutus began being threatening towards us.  They started looking at us in anger and we started becoming afraid.  And three days later, they started killing our cattle, burning our homes.  And when you met a Hutu on the path, he -- and asked him, "Have you seen me?" he would say, "The only time that a Hutu will be killed is when you will be cut up into several pieces and the person will be dead only when I see a part of his body that have been dismembered."
Q.	Sir, can you tell us why Hutu were killing your heads of cattle, were chasing you around?  Can you tell us the reason? 
A.	They assaulted us by saying that the president's plane had been downed by Inkotanyis and that Inkotanyis were Tutsi.
Q.	Now, following the eruption of that violence, did you continue staying in your area of residence? 
A.	When we realised that our cattle were being killed and that our houses were being burnt, I took my wife and children and we went and sought refuge in the Mugonero hospital, given that it was said that there were gendarmes guarding or protecting that place.  We were also told that Mugonero was safe.
Q.	How many children did you have as of April, '94, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I had three children, two boys and a girl.
Q.	Now, how long did it take you to travel from your residence to Mugonero hospital, and how did you go?
A.	I went to Mugonero on foot, and it took me ten minutes.
Q.	Do you recall the date that you fled to Mugonero hospital? 
A.	On the 10th of April 1994.
Q.	Sir, was that the first time that you went to the complex, on that day?
A.	Before, we had taken -- before, we took refuge; the assailants didn't assault us.  And when in 1994, we thought the situation was going to be the same.  That is why we sought refuge.
Q.	I mean, have you been to the Mugonero complex previously on any business?
A.	Before the onset of the war, we used to go to Mugonero to receive treatment, because there was a hospital there.  Furthermore, we could go there to look for jobs.
Q.	And do you belong to any religious organisation, to any religion, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I am a Protestant adventist, among the Protestant adventist religion.
Q.	Where were you going for prayers on Sabbath?
A.	I used to go to the adventist church at Ngoma.
Q.	Now, having arrived at the complex, did you and your family stay in one location, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Women and children were inside the church, and we, the men, we used to spend the night outside the church.
Q.	Who decided that women -- was there anybody in particular who decided that women should go stay in the church and the men in the courtyard? 
A.	There were elderly pastors who felt that children could suffer from cold and it was settled that the children and women should remain inside the church.
Q.	Now, did you find other refugees at the complex? 
A.	Yes.  There were Tutsi refugees in that church.
Q.	How did you know that they were Tutsi?
A.	All those who sought refuge at the hospital said that they were not secure in their homes, which is why they were coming to the hospital to take up refuge, because there were gendarmes that were supposed to be protecting people.  In other words, all those who came to the hospital were coming to look for some form of security, since they learned that there were gendarmes there.
Q.	Now, did they tell you why they fled their homes to come to the complex? 
A.	We all had the same problem; that is, fleeing from the Hutus who wanted to kill the Tutsis.
Q.	Could you determine from these other refugees where they came from, their communes, for instance, or préfectures? 
A.	Some of the refugees came from the Rwamatamu commune, some from Gishyita and others from Gisovu.  There were all -- all the Tutsis converged at Mugonero because they had learnt that they would be secure in that location.
Q.	Can you tell us approximately how many refugees you found on the 10th of April? 
A.	At that time, there weren't very many refugees, but when we arrived, the number of refugees started mounting and actually became very many; they became very many.
Q.	Now, did you and the other refugees go with any property to the complex? 
A.	Some had come with their cows, but for most of us, we left our homes closed.
Q.	Now, while at the complex, Mr. Witness, did you find the gendarmes which you have testified to? 
A.	Yes.  I found gendarmes there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's a kind of leading question, Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I thought the witness testified that the reason why he sought refuge at the complex is because the gendarmes were protecting them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he say gendarmes? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I heard him say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, how many gendarmes did you find at the hospital? 
A.	There were two gendarmes there.
Q.	Did you know them personally, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, were you at the hospital on the 16th of April, '94? 
A.	Yes.  I was there. 
Q.	What day of the week, if you recall, that was? 
A.	It was a Saturday. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether anything unusual happened on that day? 
A.	Interahamwe and others who had prepared the attack meant to kill the Tutsis, started killing Tutsis.  They began at 9 a.m. and only ended at about 9 p.m.
Q.	Now, that morning, did you see the two gendarmes we have talked about? 
A.	I saw them. 
Q.	When the attackers started arriving, were the gendarmes around? 
A.	In the morning, the gendarmes told us that they were going to protect us.  They told us they -- we were going to be attacked and left the place.
Q.	Now, do you know how the gendarmes found out that you -- did they tell you why they said that you were going to be attacked on that day? 
A.	They called those responsible for the refugees and told us, "Today, you are going to be attacked, so you should protect yourselves."  And at 9 a.m., the attacks began.  That's after we had been told that we are going to be attacked.
Q.	Sir, can you tell us how the attackers you said came were dressed?  How were they dressed? 
A.	Some of the attackers wore military clothes; others civilian clothes.  There were also Hutu civilians who were armed with cudgels and machetes.
Q.	Now, could you tell where these attackers came from?  I mean, could you recognise any of them? 
A.	I recognised some of the assailants who arrived on board vehicles.  Mainly the leaders of the attacks arrived on board vehicles, because it is when the vehicles were parked that the attacks began.
Q.	Now, you described the attackers as civilians and -- who were armed with traditional weapons.  Is that what you said, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.  But there were also civilians who were armed with guns.
Q.	Now, when the attackers launched the attack, did the refugees do anything?  Did you do anything to defend yourselves? 
A.	At the start, we were attacked by Hutus who were not armed.  We felt that it was thieves who wanted to take our cows.  We rebuffed them.  It is when the leaders of the assailants arrived with guns, and we began to seek refuge in the church, where people were being attacked with other weapons that were not firearms.  The assailants had cut the electricity supply and destroyed the water piping.  The hospital was not working at all.  It had been closed down. 
Q.	Sir, I'm still at -- I'm not quite -- I'll get you on to your explanation regarding the attacks.  Did you say that there was any initial attack that you repelled -- is that your statement? -- that was composed of Hutu civilians?
A.	Yes.  We repelled this attack.  After we did so, we saw on the road, the Gishyita-Kibuye road, we saw vehicles in which were armed assailants, and these armed persons began to fire at us and to throw grenades on the refugees, but we had been able to repel the first attack using stones.
Q.	Sir, can you tell us how long the first attack lasted? 
A.	It lasted about 15 minutes, because the assailants became frightened of us, because the assailants that were armed with guns had stayed in the background.
Q.	Now, when did the other attackers arrive?
A.	It is those who arrived at 9 a.m., because the first attack happened at about 8 a.m.  The assailants that had guns came at nine o'clock in the morning.
Q.	Now, can you now tell us how the subsequent -- the subsequent attackers arrived?  By what means did they come to the complex? 
A.	We first saw the vehicle of Ntakirutimana, Elizaphan.  It was a Toyota vehicle.  He parked the vehicle in front of his office.  And the other vehicles also parked in front of his office.  Afterwards, we saw the vehicle of Ruzindana, which was carrying Mika and some soldiers.  After that, we saw another vehicle -- Ruzindana's vehicle was red.  It was not covered.  This was followed by the vehicle of the Gishyita bourgmestre; that is Sikubwabo.  After that we saw the hospital vehicle that was carrying soldiers and which came from Kibuye.  After that we saw the vehicle of Kayishema, who was accompanied by another truck in which there were soldiers. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you're quite fast.  Now, you are saying that you saw six vehicles.  Now, let's start with the first one.  You said you saw the motor vehicle that was driven by one Elizaphan Ntakirutimana; is that what you said?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Okay.  What colour -- sorry, what colour was that vehicle? 
A.	It was a Toyota, which had stripes quite near the wheels.
Q.	Had you seen that vehicle before that day?
A.	It was Ntakirutimana's vehicle.
Q.	Who was Ntakirutimana?
A.	He was the president of the Kibuye/Cyangugu field.
Q.	And where was his office located? 
A.	His office was located in Ngoma, quite close to the place where the memorial to the victims of genocide was erected.
Q.	Was it within the Mugonero complex or outside the Mugonero complex?
A.	It was within the Mugonero complex.  In Mugonero, there was the hospital and the field office.  So there were two different leaders.
Q.	All right.  And who else did you notice was aboard that vehicle?
A.	Are you referring to Ntakirutimana's vehicle? 
Q.	Yes, please. 
A.	He was accompanied by people who were in the back of his car, but I was not able to identify or determine the names of these persons.
Q.	Could you tell whether they were civilians or soldiers, the people at the back of the vehicle? 
A.	I think there were two soldiers and civilians who were armed with guns but I was not able to find out their names.
Q.	You said the other vehicle belonged to one Ruzindana.  What type of vehicle was that?  Can you describe the make, please, if you can? 
A.	Ruzindana's vehicle was not covered, was red in colour, and he parked it there.  He was accompanied by Mika and two soldiers, and Ruzindana went towards the centre to see whether all the Hutus that he had ordered to attend had come.  So the Tutsis who had taken refuge in Mugonero tried to destroy bridges, but the pastor exhorted us to refrain so that the responsibility for the starting of hostilities should not be thrown on us. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you kindly restrict your responses, your replies, to what I'm asking you?  Can you try to do that, please? 

Now, who -- you said in Ruzindana's car was Mika.  Who else was there? 
A.	There were persons armed with guns, and others with clubs.  They had come from the direction of Gishyita.  Others came from elsewhere, and we could not -- we could not know them.
Q.	Now, did you see this motor vehicle arrive or did you -- you saw the people after they had disembarked from the car? 
A.	The vehicle was parked within my line of sight.  I was trying to hide, to protect myself.
Q.	Now, can you tell whether Mika was seated in the front cabin with Ruzindana or he was seated at the rear part of the vehicle?
A.	Mika was in the rear of the vehicle.
Q.	Was he armed or was he not armed? 
A.	He was carrying a gun, slung across his shoulder.
Q.	Now, who was Obed Ruzindana, Mr. Witness?  Did you know him before that day?
A.	I knew him well before that.  He was a trader and a native of Mugonero.  His father was also a trader.  He was a driver for his father.  They prospered and they acquired vehicles.  These vehicles transported tea, and they took this tea to Kigali or to Mombasa.
Q.	You said the other vehicle you saw was driven by Sikubwabo.  Who is Sikubwabo and can you describe the type of car in which he came with? 
A.	Sikubwabo was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.
Q.	Now, what type of car did he come with?  Do you know the make, type, colour? 
A.	It was a vehicle that belonged to the commune.
Q.	Do you recall the colour of that vehicle, Mr. Witness? 
A.	It was a white vehicle.
Q.	Was it covered from front to the rear or it was an open -- it was open in one part? 
A.	No.  The vehicle was not covered everywhere. 
Q.	Now, were there other people in that vehicle, apart from Sikubwabo? 
A.	Yes.  There were, but we did not know these people.  I do not know where they came from.
Q.	Were they civilians or soldiers?  Were they armed or not armed? 
A.	When the assailants came, civilians and soldiers were mixed.  There were civilians that were carrying machetes, and soldiers that were carrying guns.
Q.	Now, how many of those people do you see in Sikubwabo's car? 
A.	There were about ten or more people in the vehicle, given that I didn't count them.
Q.	Now, where were the vehicles parked?  Where did they park, Mr. Witness? 
A.	They parked their vehicles opposite Ntakirutimana's office and they went up on foot.
Q.	Now, how close were you from where these vehicles were parked? 
A.	I was at a distance that enabled me to identify a person if I saw them.  The person who came down from the vehicle could be identified if I knew him before.
Q.	Can you attempt a guess, say how many metres, in terms of metres?  Can you give us the distance in terms of metres? 
A.	I don't think I can make an estimate in metres, but from where I was standing, I was able to identify a person if I knew him well before.
Q.	Now, after they had arrived, what did you observe?  What followed? 
A.	They began to fire on people, and I ran away.  Since I was the father of a family, I remembered my family that was in the church, and when I tried to open the doors of the church, I realised that they were closed, they were locked.  That is when I went to the hospital and hid in the surgery room.
Q.	Now, before we get to that, Mr. Witness, I notice from my notes that actually you had said the other car that came, the other -- the other one belonged to Gérard Ntakirutimana.  What type of car was that? 
A.	It was a vehicle that belonged to the hospital.  It was a present from the state to the hospital.
Q.	And who was Gérard Ntakirutimana, Mr. Witness? 
A.	He was a doctor in the Mugonero hospital.
Q.	And who was -- was he alone in that vehicle or he was with some other people? 
A.	He was with Mathias Ngirinshuti, but there were other people.  They had come from the direction of Gishyita, and some persons whom we did not know, but we could see that a person was coming along with people, and we wondered why the doctor would attack his own hospital.  We were very surprised. 
Q.	Now, were these other people soldiers or civilians? 
A.	These people were mixed.  Even those who were carrying clubs climbed on board these vehicles, because they were going to help the others. 
Q.	The other vehicle you described, Witness, was that of Kayishema.  Who is Kayishema? 
A.	Kayishema was the préfet of Kibuye préfecture.
Q.	What type of vehicle did he come with at the hospital? 
A.	He came on board a vehicle that was covered, and behind him there was a truck, on board which were soldiers.
Q.	You said that when the attack started, you ran towards the church.  Is that so, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I went towards the church, and the church was closed.  That is when I went towards the hospital, and I hid in the basement, where the surgery room was found.
Q.	Now, why did you go to the church first? 
A.	I had remembered that my family was there.  I felt that I could perhaps run away with one of the children.  And when I arrived, the church was closed.  So I went to the church because I had the feelings of a parent.
Q.	Now, from the church, you said you went to the hospital building.  What part of the hospital building did you go to, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I went to the basement, where the surgery room was found. 
Q.	Now, did you go straight to the surgery or you passed some other places before going to the surgery, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I went directly to the surgery room.
Q.	Now, can you describe the way you took as you went in the hospital, the place where you said you went to seek refuge? 
A.	First there was a small bush to cross, and when one reached the hospital, one chose in what direction one wished to go.  I took the initiative to go to the surgery room. 
Q.	Now, do you know the layout of the hospital, the hospital building, Mr. Witness?  Are you familiar with the layout of the hospital building? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you tell us how it is constructed?  I mean, how many rooms, where they are located, and that kind of information. 
A.	There were rooms in the upper part of the building, and there were also rooms in the basement, and these rooms in the basement are adjacent to the surgery room.
Q.	Now, when you entered the hospital, did you go to the basement first or did you go to the first floor? 
A.	I went directly to the surgery room.
Q.	Now, is the surgery room on the first floor or on the basement? 
A.	The surgery -- the surgery room is in the basement.
Q.	Now, how many rooms are in the surgery place, the surgery room?  How many -- is it -- I mean, how 
-- let me put it this way:  How is the place you went to seek refuge constructed?  How is it structured? 
A.	There is the surgery room.  The surgery room is common.  There is the waiting room.  There is a delivery room.  There is the anaesthesia room, and the room where people go for dental appointments. 
Q.	So in other words, is it correct to say that you went to the surgery wing which contains several rooms?  Is it correct to put it that way, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.  There are several rooms.
Q.	Now, let's now focus in the room in which you hid.  Can you tell us how big that room is? 
A.	There are several rooms in the surgery wing, because one couldn't just enter anyhow into the surgery room itself.  It is on this day that -- on that day that I went there.  Anybody who goes to the surgery room or the theatre is somebody who is going to undergo an operation of one sort or another.  I cannot give you the size, the measurements of this room.
Q.	Now, could it have been as big as this courtroom here, when you think of it now, when you reflect in your mind? 
A.	Unless if you divide this courtroom into several rooms, there are several rooms, but this courtroom can have partitions or small rooms that were part of this unit.
Q.	Sir, if you take the middle part or the part starting from here to the booth down here, could the rooms be as big as this area or as big as where Their Honours are seated or as big as that other end of the room there? 
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I would say that this courtroom or that room, the surgery room, could cover -- could take 30 persons.
Q.	When you think of 30 persons, standing, sleeping or squatting?  In what position? 
A.	Thirty persons.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he say this, 30 persons?  Did he say 30 persons? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, he said 30 persons, yes. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	What was your response, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Thirty persons lying down dead.
Q.	All right.  Now, did you -- did it have doors, windows?
A.	There was just one door, and there are also windows.
Q.	Was the door intact?  Did you find it intact? 
A.	No.  The door had been broken down.
Q.	And how about the windows?  Were they intact? 
A.	The windows had been broken in search of people who had taken refuge.
Q.	Now, did you find any people in that room? 
A.	I only found bodies, but other people found me there.
Q.	Okay.  Apart from the bodies, were there any other objects in that room, that you observed? 
A.	There were beds.
Q.	How many beds did you find there?
A.	I found three beds.
Q.	Did they have mattresses or bare beds?
A.	Yes.  There were mattresses.  They had not been looted yet. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately what time you entered in that room?
A.	It was during the daytime.  I was not wearing a watch, but if I were to make an estimate, I would say that it was about 11 a.m.
Q.	And when you entered that room, where did you stay? 
A.	When I arrived, I covered myself with bodies that were still bleeding, and there was blood running even into my mouth.  And when the assailants came, they thought that I was dead.
Q.	Now, as you lay hiding in that room, what did you observe?  What did you see? 
A.	Three girls came out of breath, and each of them lay on a bed, and it is these girls who found me there.
Q.	Now, how long was it --
JUDGE SHORT:
I didn't quite get that.  You said that three girls came out of breath or entered the room and they were out of breath when they entered the room.  Is that what he says? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, maybe we can clarify from the witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, can you say again how the three girls entered the room?  Could you give your evidence about the three girls again?  
THE WITNESS:
Those girls came running, and they lay down on the three beds.  They remained there.  They were apparently waiting for death to come and meet them.  They seemed resigned to their fate.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	After how long had you been hiding there when the girls -- did the girls come?  After how many -- after how many minutes? 
A.	I had just spent a short while there when those girls arrived.  I had just hidden beneath those corpses.
Q.	Now, had you known those girls before that day? 
A.	I had known them well before then.  Among them was Kajongi's daughter.  The other two girls were the daughters of a certain Amos Karera.
Q.	Now, do you know the name of the daughter of Kajongi? 
A.	Yes.  I knew her name.  Her name was Mukasine.  She had just completed her nursing studies in the nursery school -- in the nursing school.
Q.	And did you know her father, and what he did?
A.	Her father's name was Isaac Kajongi.  He was the accountant of the adventist association.  He was therefore the subordinate of Pastor Ntakirutimana.
Q.	Do you know where this girl and her parents lived? 
A.	Yes, I knew.  They lived in a hospital building, because their father was working at the hospital, and workers at the hospital were lodged by the hospital.  So he lived either in the building of the association or the building belonging to the hospital.
Q.	Did you know the other girls, the daughters, you say, of Amos Karera?
A.	I knew them but I have forgotten their names.
Q.	Do you know what they did for a living? 
A.	One of the two girls was a teacher and the other was a student.
Q.	Do you know where they lived? 
A.	They lived in Kanyinya.
Q.	Do you know how far Kanyinya is from the complex? 
A.	Those were buildings that were very close to the church and the hospital, because those buildings belonged to hospital workers.  So the distance was a very short one.  So short that whenever there was a patient who was in agony, a worker could be sought on foot.  It wasn't necessary to use a vehicle to go and get the hospital worker. 
Q.	Did you know what their father, Amos Karera, did for a living? 
A.	He was a worker at Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Do you know what type of work he did? 
A.	I believe he was working in the laboratory.
Q.	Now, can you tell us what happened after the three ladies had come in the room? 
A.	After the three girls arrived in the room, they lay down and shortly thereafter, I saw Mika suddenly appear, accompanied by the two sons of Kanyabungo, who were also soldiers.  They were carrying firearms.  The two daughters of Kanyabungo -- the two sons of Kanyabungo went towards the two girls and asked them to forgive them in vain, and Mika called Mukasine.  She asked -- she was asked to undress, and she refused, and Mika undressed her forcefully. 
Q.	Let's take this in bits.  Now, who are the -- do you know the two sons of Kanyabungo?  Had you known them before that day, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I knew them.  They ********************.  And during holidays, we used to see one another.
Q.	Do you know where they lived or what they did for a living? 
A.	They were soldiers.  Their father was also a soldier, but he was already on retirement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, this information, all these details, will not identify the witness? 

MR. KAPAYA:
No, it will not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead, please. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Even when he says they ***************************? 
MR. KAPAYA:
******************* -- there are ****************************** of the witness.  I don't think that --
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.  Okay. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, after Mika and the two sons of Kanyabungo had entered that room, could you tell us what transpired next? 
A.	After they had entered that room, each of the three took one of the three girls.  Mika took Mukasine, and she raised hands to plead for mercy from Mika, but he refused.  May I proceed? 
Q.	Just a minute.  Now, did Mika tell this lady anything?  Did you hear Mika say anything to this lady? 
A.	Mika spoke to Mukasine using these words:  "Undress." 
Q.	And what did Mukasine do or say? 
A.	Mukasine raised her hands, pleading for mercy, but Mika refused.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did Mika speak to the other two ladies too? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  The two other companions of Mika took care of the two girls, while Mika went to Mukasine.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When Mika entered the room, he went straight to Mukasine? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  In that room were only the three persons alive, so the three assailants went straight to those three persons.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yes.  Now, what did Mika do next? 
A.	He asked Mukasine to undress.  Mukasine first of all pleaded for mercy, in vain.  Mika said, "Undress quickly."  The girl refused.  And she sat on the floor, and Mika undressed her forcefully. 
Q.	How did he do it?  How did he undress her forcibly?
A.	He took off the panties she was wearing and threw her on the floor, undressed her forcefully and threw her on the floor.
Q.	And did you see Mika undress? 
A.	Mika took his gun and hit Mukasine on her body with the butt of the gun.  Then he opened up her legs forcefully.  Then he took his penis and thrust it into the vagina of his victim.  The victim was crying, but Mika was doing this forcefully because the victim did not want to be raped.
Q.	Now, while Mika was raping this lady, what was happening?  Did you observe what was happening to the other two ladies? 
A.	The two girls were also being raped.  They were crying.  So Mika was doing what the other assailants were doing.
Q.	Now, how long did the acts of rape take place?  Could you determine the time? 
A.	About five minutes.
Q.	Now, what happened thereafter, after they were raped? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Which of the rapes took five minutes?  Mika's rape or all of them? 
THE WITNESS:
The three assailants completed their acts almost simultaneously.  And after their acts, they said, "Those girls are Inyenzi.  We are not going to abandon them here.  We are not going to leave them alive."  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And what did you understand by "Inyenzi," Mr. Witness?
A.	The term "Inyenzi" pertains to the Tutsi.
Q.	Now, did anything -- did you observe anything happening to those women now, those three women? 
A.	Mika dressed up, took his gun again, and asked the two young men, "Let us kill those two -- those Inyenzi."  Mika said, "I'll count one to three and then open fire simultaneously."  So he counted from one to three, and I could hear the splutter of gunfire, and I understood that they were already dead.  And indeed they were killed.  Subsequently, Mika took Mukasine's legs, opened them apart, and said, "Everyone passing should see what the vagina of a Tutsi woman looks like." 
Q.	Now, were any people expected to pass in that room that day? 
A.	There were Hutus who did not pass that way, and normally, the assailants went round the various rooms to verify whether there weren't any survivors.  No one was expected to see that.  They were all Hutus because all the Tutsis had been killed.
Q.	Witness, how far were you -- how far did the acts of rape occur from where you were hiding?  How far was it?
A.	It was a very short distance, because the bed on which those young girls had lain was very close to me, opposite to me.
Q.	Could it have been from where you are to where I am or from where you are to where these gentlemen are seated? 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why don't you let him determine the distance instead of giving him one or two options? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I thought I could make it shorter, Your Honour, by --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But it could also be from where he is to the end of the room.  Ask him, "From where you are, how far would it be?"  He will then give you a distance.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour, I will adopt that.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from where you were hiding to where the rape takes place, how far was it?  Could you estimate the distance? 
A.	From the witness box to where the white lady sitting opposite me is sitting. 
MR. KAPAYA:
That would be about ten metres, Your Honour?  No, five metres? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, can you give us the measurement in metres? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, it's about four and a half metres. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, you said that you were hiding under dead bodies.  How then could you see the rapes which were happening on the beds? 
A.	Well, the fact that I witnessed the rapes, even today, when I think about it, I am overwhelmed because when those acts were being committed, I was only thinking about them.
Q.	My question, Mr. Witness, was:  You were hiding behind -- beneath dead bodies, feigning death; how could you -- how were you able to see the rapes as they were being committed?.  That was my question. 
A.	I could hear those young girls crying, and I would lift my head and lie down again.  They couldn't see me because they were busy raping those young girls.  Even if I had decided to go out of that room, they would not have seen me because they were busy raping those young girls.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, were you lying on your back or were you lying on your stomach? 

THE WITNESS:
I was lying on one side.  And they were on the other side.  There was no table blocking my view.  And there was no other room in the middle that could obstruct my view.  So I could see without any difficulty. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And were these dead bodies next to you or on top of you.  When you say you were lying on the corpses, were the dead bodies next to you or on top of you? 
THE WITNESS:
I was covered by some bodies, while others were beside me.  Blood was flowing over my body.  When the assailants came and found me drenched in blood, they told themselves I was dead, like all the others who were there. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, after Mika and his companions had left, did anyone else come in that room, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Assailants entered that room, and finding that there was nobody alive there, they left again. 
Q.	Now, how long did you stay in that room? 
A.	I spent a whole day in that room, and I left at night.
Q.	Now, before leaving, did you find out what happened to your wife and three children? 
A.	We saw each other before the beginning of the massacres, and since then, I never saw them again.
Q.	Have you been able to know what happened to them? 
A.	No.  They were killed, like all the others who were killed.
Q.	Have you been able to recover their bodies, Mr. Witness? 
A.	We were unable to bury our dead, because all the dead were buried by caterpillars in mass graves, so we were unable to bury our dead.
Q.	We are very sorry about that, Mr. Witness. 

Now, let's backtrack a bit to the period you stayed at the complex between the 10th and the 16th of April.  Now, were you able to observe whether there were any Hutu seeking refuge at that place? 
A.	There were two Hutus.  There was one Manase Gakwerere  and a certain Mbarubukeye, Jesuit.
Q.	Now, did these two people stay up to the -- were they present when the attack was launched on the 16th n the morning? 
A.	When Gakwerere understood that only Tutsis were targeted, he left with his family and Mbarubukeye stayed behind.  The attack was launched while Mbarubukeye was still there. 

Regarding Mathias Ngirinshuti, a nephew of Mbarubukeye told him, "You have to go."  Mbarubukeye who had a Tutsi woman, said, "I cannot leave unless my wife is given back to me because I have to leave with my wife.  If that is not the case, I will stay here and be killed with the others."  So they tried to take it out of that area but he refused.  By the way, Mbarubukeye assisted us when we resisted the first attack.
Q.	So what happened to Mbarubukeye, finally, Mr. Witness?  Was he able to leave with his wife? 
A.	Yes.  He remained with his wife and even today they are still together.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Hutu Mbarubukeye survived that attack, along with his wife? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Mathias, who was one of the leaders of the attack, was able to save them, and up until today, Mbarubukeye, his wife and all of their children are still alive. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, how did he save them?  How did Mathias manage to save Mbarubukeye and his wife? 
A.	Mbarubukeye was Mathias's uncle.  He was the brother of Mathias's father.  Mathias did not want to save Mbarubukeye's wife, who was Tutsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you said that Mathias was able to save Mbarubukeye.  How did he save him? 
THE WITNESS:
He came and told him, "Come out of this place, because we are going to kill the Tutsis.  If you remain here, we are going to kill you along with the Tutsis.  And it may be possible that attackers who do not know that you are Hutu may kill you without knowing."  Mbarubukeye said, "I can't leave without my wife."  Subsequently, they took Mbarubukeye, his wife and their children and took them along with them, and today they are all alive. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So Mathias took them all, the family, together?  All the family? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So that you're saying that when the attack started, Mbarubukeye and his family were evacuated from the place?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	No.  Mbarubukeye had refused to leave because they didn't want to free his wife.  So when we -- we had tried to fend off the attackers with stones, Mbarubukeye also helped us to fight back the assailants.  And when the assailants came, Mathias realised that Mbarubukeye's life was going to perish, whereas he was Barabukeya's cousin.  So he saw Gérard and other assailants and decided to release Mbarubukeye, his wife and their children, and he accompanied them right to their room.  So you understand that Mbarubukeye left that place with his wife and children at the beginning of the attacks, and when they accepted to release him with his entire family. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, you have talked a lot about Mr. Mika Muhimana.  Did you know him before 16th of April, '94? 
A.	I knew him.
Q.	When and how did you know him before that date? 
A.	Mika Muhimana, he's a person I knew when he was doing his trading.  He was a trader who used to buy and sell coffee.  We who were farmers and who used to farm coffee and who prepared coffee to sell to him, knew him.  So you realise that I knew him. 

Secondly, Muhimana was a councillor of the Gishyita secteur, so he was the second personality after the bourgmestre.  When the bourgmestre had to go to participate in meetings and he wasn't there, he's the one who represented him.  And when there was a problem, you submitted it to Mika, and when he could solve the problem, he would do so.  Otherwise, he will ask you to wait for the bourgmestre.  So you understand that he is somebody that I knew very well.
Q.	Can you tell us where he lived? 
A.	He used to reside in Gishyita.
Q.	And you say that he was a councillor.  He was councillor for which secteur?
A.	He was the councillor for the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Do you know where his parents lived? 
A.	His parents used to reside at Rwaramba R-W-A-R-A-M-B-A.
Q.	And where is that place?  In which secteur or cellule is Rwaramba?
A.	I know that Rwaramba was in Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Can you tell us how the person you described as Mika looked like when you last saw him in April, '94? 
A.	I know Mika very well.  He used to come to Ngoma.
Q.	Can you tell us how he looked like, his complexion, size, age? 
A.	Instead of describing him or giving you his age, just ask me to show him to you.  Let us not beat about the bush by asking me what he looks like or what were his features.  That could be difficult for me to describe him, whereas I'm seeing him right here in the hall.
Q.	Where, Mr. Witness, do you see a person whom you recognise as Mika in this hall?  Can you show us where he is? 
A.	There he is.  He is wearing a T-shirt, as if he were a Muslim.  It's white. 
Q.	What else --
A.	He's also wearing a white cap. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I think that's sufficient identification of the Accused person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The witness has recognised the Accused. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

That's all I have from this witness, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kapaya. 

Mr. Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the Defence lawyer, that is Counsel for Mika, in order to test the credibility and accuracy of the statement given in examination-in-chief.  Please understand the questions and reply them very briefly. 

Professor Songa, you have the floor for the cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
   THE WITNESS:
	Good afternoon, Counsel.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have a series of questions that may undermine the safety of the protected witness.  May I ask for a closed session for a few minutes? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, what do you say? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No objection, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going into closed session for a while.  Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 22 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 21 by Mark Porter)








1555H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now we are not in closed session, so don't give any information that may lead to identify you. 

Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the questioning before the investigators of the Tribunal, you stated the following on the 12th of November 1999:  And I read:  "My testimony in Arusha were limited to the killings of Bisesero, and I also related the facts on the killings of the Mugonero centre and the planners were none other than Ruzindana, Obed, Kayishema, Ntakirutimana, Elizaphan, Mika, the councillor of Gishyita, the bourgmestre Sikubwabo, and others." Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	Yes.  I did make that statement. 
Q.	What do you mean by "planners," Mr. Witness? 
A.	Well, I was referring to the plotters of the genocide.
Q.	Can you tell us why you call them the plotters? 
A.	It is because those are the persons who used to lead the attackers.  Besides, they were the authorities, and the members of the population used to follow their instructions.  Traders, préfets, 
sub-préfets, had planned -- that had masterminded that genocide because if they hadn't done so, the population wouldn't have followed them.
Q.	You told the Prosecution investigator the following:  "Regarding rape and other sexually related crimes, which is the purpose of your investigations, I knew about some cases, in particular three cases of rape and one case of sexual mutilation."  Can you confirm that statement? 
A.	I made that statement, but then haven't you heard women who came to testify here?  I'm sure you must have listened to their testimonies.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did somebody tell you that the investigator was coming? 
A.	No.  I only saw them come to my house.  I didn't have any contact whatsoever with them.
Q.	Can you tell us why you did not talk about these cases of rape and sexual mutilation in your previous statement? 
A.	Alas, Counsel, do you think we can say everything that Mika did? 
(Page 25 by Mark Porter)





1600H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you know Mika before the events of April 1994?
A.	Ask Mika, rather, if he didn't know me.
Q.	Mr. Witness, today you are the one who has to answer questions. 
A.	I knew him well before then.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know his family?
A.	With regards to his family, I met his wife either at home or I used to meet them together at home.  I knew his wife very well.  She died after the war and she was a teacher. 
Q.	Would you recall her name?
A.	Don't ask me to give you her name.  I've told you what was her occupation.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you can please help us in answering the questions, we would be obliged.
A.	I know that his wife was a teacher, but I did not know her name.
Q.	Did you know her ethnic origin?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was her ethnic origin?
A.	Even if Mika was going to kill Tutsis, he at least left one with him.  His wife was Tutsi.
Q.	Did you know Mika's parents' address?
A.	Yes.  They used to reside at Rwiramba.
Q.	Is Rwiramba a cellule or a secteur?
A.	Rwiramba was in the Gishyita secteur.  I can't say exactly which cellule it was, if it was the Rwiramba secteur, but I know that they used to reside on the Rwiramba hill, but that is in the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to have on a piece of paper -- I have a name written on a piece of paper so that the witness may state the nature of the relations linking him to this person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, yes, please give a piece of paper to the witness.

Professor, there are two names on this piece of paper.  Is it an alias or is it two names?
MR. SONGA:
This is the surname and the first name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Show it to the Prosecutor, too.

Show it to the witness.  
Mr. Witness, do you know this person? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know how to read.  Give me the name in full or please ask someone to read for me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Should we ask the Kinyarwandan interpreter to assist the witness?

Mr. Issa, please switch off the mike.

Professor, please ask the question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know the person whose first name and surname appear on the piece of paper that the interpreter is reading to you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, please read out the name to the witness.  Did you? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you read both names?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
What's going on?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did he say?
JUDGE SHORT:
Have you mentioned the name to him?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour, I have read the name to him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Has he responded?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
He said that if he were asked -- if he were told where the person used to live, then he might be able to identify this person.  
THE WITNESS: 
And if I don't know the person, then I'll tell you that I don't know the person.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with your leave, we shall include the address of the person in question on the piece of paper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  Please bring the piece of paper to the professor.  

Mr. Interpreter, please stay there.

Show it to the witness.

Yes, Mr. Interpreter, what did he say?  Did you read out the address of the person on the piece of paper?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  The witness says that he knows the person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have the answer.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you state on the same piece of paper the relations that bind you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He knows the person.  Did he say that he's related to him?  

Mr. Witness, how is this person related to you?  Write it down on the piece of paper if the person is related to you.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness states that there is no relationship between he and the person in question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I hesitate between two possibilities, either to be satisfied with this answer or to have the relation between the witness and this person included on the piece of paper; that is, the relation as it appears in the witness bundle, and to request confirmation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you point out that portion in the bundle?
MR. SONGA:
I shall do so, Madam President.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, the name on the binder has an "M" before the "G."  The name you have on the note has an "N" before the "G".

MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the surname is not the same.
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President, I would request that we go easy, that we take, for example, the statement, the witness statement of 27th August 2002.  In regard to identifying the witness, that is the witness particulars, point 9 of the witness particulars, we have the marital status and all the necessary information thereon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the surname is not the same, as pointed out by Judge Short.  It is "M" in the binder, before "G" in the binder, whereas the name which you have written on the piece of paper describes "N" before "G".
JUDGE SHORT:
Actually, the name in the Kinyarwanda section is different from that in the English section.  

Prosecutor, the names are different in the binder.  The English name is different from that in the Kinyarwanda section of the binder.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we understand that there is no material difference.  It's all a question of translation.  The way the names are written in the Kinyarwandan dialect is slightly different from --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So Mr. Phillips, do you confirm that this name is the same as mentioned at paragraph No. 9 of the English version?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I believe that the idea is that it's meant to be the same name.
JUDGE SHORT:
Even though they are spelt differently in English, you are saying that they are the same name; is that what you are saying?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We don't have reasons to believe that they refer to different people.  Our understanding is that it refers to one and the same person, Your Honour.  Perhaps my learned friend can actually put the question to him that he's trying to ascertain and ask -- and put the relationship to him and let him decide whether or not yes or no.  The name of the person has not been mentioned, it's on a piece of paper, so if he puts the relationship to the witness, then he would answer him yes or no.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Please proceed in this way.
MR. SONGA:
We have already indicated all the information on the piece of paper. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, with the interpreter's help, you might take cognisance of what appears on the piece of paper, and we would request that you answer yes or no, whether that is indeed the relationship that exists between you two?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mention the relationship.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, explain the relationship of the person to the witness.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
This has been done, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did he say?
THE WITNESS:
Do you -- would you please give me a moment so that I can answer you?  I have on my person my national identity card.  I will bring it to you and you, yourself, will verify.  I have it in my bag.
JUDGE SHORT:
We are not interested in your identity.  We are interested in the relationship between you and the name written on the piece of paper.  Is the relationship that mentioned by counsel?  

Interpreter, have you mentioned the relationship to him?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
And what was his answer?  Could you ask him again, please.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask him whether that relationship is correct or not.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness insists that there is no relationship between himself and this person.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can he tell you the name of his wife, and write it down on a sheet of paper?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did she die?
THE WITNESS:
In 1994.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Now you have the answer.  Please proceed.  The name written by this witness on the piece of paper is different from the name which you have mentioned on a piece of paper.
MR. SONGA:
It is a very useful difference, Madam President. 
MR. SONGA:
Q.	Just one question, Mr. Witness.  Since 1994, have you remarried?
A.	I do not have a wife.  If you have a relationship with somebody, you can see that this is indeed your wife.
MR. SONGA:
At this point in the cross-examination, Madam President, I don't know whether the procedure will allow it.  I would like to call on the Prosecutor to tell us why the identification particulars of the witness and the person whose name appears on the piece of paper show a particular relationship between the two.  Is this an accurate piece of information or a mistake or forgery?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, what would be your response to the claim made by professor?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
My response would be that this is a matter for argument, Your Honour.  First of all, I don't think my learned friend has led enough basis for the sort of submission he has made, in any event.  We feel this is a matter for argument.  I don't think he's actually done enough to ascertain whether this is the case one way of the other, anyway.  He's just been moving around in circles, moving a piece of paper.  There are other ways of doing this, and I don't think he's exhausted the avenues that are open to him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how is this question relevant to your case? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, it is you, yourself, who alerted the witness to the fact that he would also be questioned in regard to establishing his credibility, so there is a link with the credibility of the witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's correct, Professor, but you have gone as far as you can lawfully go.  You have asked him questions.  He has told you there is no relationship.  It is now your burden to prove that in fact there is a relationship.  That you can do by calling evidence or producing documents which indicate a relationship that may lead the Court to think who is telling the truth, but you have, in my judgement, gone as far as you can lawfully go.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Phillips, do I understand you to say that you take these particulars to be correct?  Is that your position? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
To the best of our knowledge, the person indicated therein was a witness before Your Honours, and we understand her to  -- at least she believes that there is such a relationship between herself and this witness.  So to answer Your Honour's  -- yes, that's our understanding prior to today, that there is such a relationship.  We have not received any information to the contrary before now.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Beyond your document, beyond the sheet you have put here, have you any other evidence to contradict the answer that Accused has given? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, no.  We didn't think it would be an issue at any stage, so, no.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Okay, Professor.  Go on.
MR. SONGA:
Before I proceed, Madam President, I would like to state that I am, at this stage of the proceedings, satisfied with all the answers that I've received.  However, I would like to request at this time that the Prosecution document that bears the witness's signature in regard to identification of himself and the person in question be entered as proof.  This should be the same for the piece of paper that the Defence used, and the piece of paper that the witness had to write on in response to the question put by the Honourable Judges. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the piece of paper on which is the name that you have written is Exhibit D. 20, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 20 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the name of the person written by the witness on the piece of paper is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 21, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 21 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness statement of 20 June 1996 is Exhibit D. 22, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 22 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this a convenient time for a short break?  We will take a short break for 15 minutes. 
MR. SONGA:
Of course, Madam President.
(Court recessed from 1632H to 1655H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing of the Court is resumed.  Professor, you may continue with your cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I would like to crave your indulgence and request for leave to go back a little bit and request leave for the Defence to tender as an exhibit the identification or the particulars of the witness, I mean the name of the person whose name we wrote down on the sheet of paper because that is some person who testified in this trial.  We will have his particulars which state clearly the relationship between the witness of today and the person whose name we wrote down on a piece of paper, and this, Madam, with your leave, so if the registry can take this document and consider and tender it as an exhibit for the Defence, I would be very obliged.  Thank you.

We would like to apologise, Madam President, because we have only the French version of that document, because the English version was not in the file that was tendered or filed by the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This will be entered as Exhibit D. 23, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 23 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please continue. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the is a non-government organisation called ********************, which published a book in which a statement appears.  Do you recall having met the investigators of **************** on the Mugonero events? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, excuse me.  Your Honour, I have an observation to make.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
I was labouring under the impression that this was the witness particulars of this particular witness.  Now that I have found out it relates to another witness, I think it's fair that it should be put to the witness, at least to comment on why -- maybe on why he thinks that the person who put those particulars there appear -- name him as the person who is related to this particular witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How does this witness know that that witness had appeared before this Court? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I mean, at least the witness should know that there is someone who is purporting or is saying that he has a relationship of some sort.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But he has specifically denied the relationship.  He admits that he knew this person, but he denied a relationship -- I mean, the relationship which was mentioned on the piece of paper by Professor.

MR KAPAYA:
So perhaps if the witness is asked what would be his comment on the allegation or on the fact that the other person there claims that she has this type of relationship with this man.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, you can do that in re-examination.  If you don't, actually, I was minded to ask one or two questions, but you would have the opportunity to clarify the matter if you think there is some ambiguity created by this line of questioning by Professor Songa.
MR. KAPAYA:
Much obliged, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Remembering always, Counsel, that this witness is not a party to the creation of the exhibit, so the exhibit exists independent of him.  It's not his information which has been recorded in that.  It is that other witness's information which has been recorded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked the following question.  There is a non-governmental organisation that is a ****************************************, and in one of the publications of the said ************************, there is one of your statements.  I would like to know if you recall having met the investigators of the organisation in question.
A.	All the investigators I have met did not give me their particulars.  I don't know if I met the investigators of that organisation.
Q.	I would like to make available to you the document citing your name, and which reproduces your statement. 
MR SONGA:
Probably I will have to request the services of the technical staff, so, Madam President, if you will give leave to the registry to make it possible for the witness to see the statement I am referring to.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But, Counsel, that is a very unusual procedure.  This witness says he doesn't know how to read or write.  How are you going to put books and text to him which he obviously has not read or written? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, can we see the document?  Is it a witness statement, or what is it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, first you should ask the witness whether he had given any statement to ****************** people.
Professor, this is not a statement made by this witness.  It's just a story of one of the ******************.
MR. SONGA:
I thought it was my understanding that it was reported under the witness's statement, and besides, his name does appear there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The problem we have, Professor, is if the witness is not able to read or write, then it means that he has never read this statement you are putting to him, and since it is a statement by somebody else, you can't hold him to the contents unless he admits familiarity with the contents, and he can't admit familiarity if he is, in fact, not able to read them.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I will not overstress it.  I may ask another question to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you confirm having left your residence to go to the Mugonero hospital complex on 10th of April 1994?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness's microphone is not lit.  It is lit now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please repeat your answer.
THE WITNESS:
I left my home on 10 April 1994.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you know before that hospital complex?
A.	Yes, I knew it.
Q.	How many buildings comprised that complex?
A.	I cannot know, but I know that we had the hospital buildings, we had the classrooms, so you can see that I was never able to count the number of buildings that made up that complex, but I know that there were many buildings in the complex.
Q.	At what time, Mr. Witness, did you arrive at that complex?
A.	It was in the evening.
Q.	Was it still daytime, or it was the night already?
A.	It was still daylight.
Q.	Did you reach the place alone or did you reach there with your family?
A.	I was with my family.
Q.	Who were the members of your family that came along with you?
A.	I was with my wife and three children.
Q.	In a case to which you have appeared to testify already, you made a statement to the effect that you were with all the members of your family.  I am referring to the Kayishema and Ruzindana case.  You came to testify on 21st November 1997, and this is the question that was addressed to you: "What did you understand by members of your family?"  And your answer was, "I was referring to brothers and sisters who were of the same womb as myself and with whom I have the same father."  

Now, I'm asking you the question again.  When you went to the Mugonero complex, who were the members of your family that came along with you?
A.	My brothers and sisters found me in the Mugonero complex, but when I left my home, I was with the members of my immediate family, viz. my wife and children, and all my brothers and sisters were killed at Mugonero.  Can't you understand that you were referring to members of my family, that is my brothers and sisters who have the same mother and the same father as myself?
Q.	In which building, Mr. Witness, did you take refuge?
A.	We took refuge in the Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Which building, more precisely?  Was it in the church, for instance?
A.	When we arrived at the complex, we were accommodated in the laundry room, and on the day of the massacre, that is when the children were dying, were freezing, children and women were brought into the church building while the men stayed outside where it was raining cats and dogs.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Please go ahead.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I would like to understand your answer, Mr. Witness.  Where were the men?
A.	We were outside in the courtyard.
Q.	Are you talking to me about the days on which the attack was launched?
A.	No, we spent the night outside.  I'm talking about the men.
Q.	Thank you.  Up to what date did you remain outside?
A.	Up to the 16th.
Q.	If I understood you well in this Chamber, on the 16th April, there were attacks?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Did you recognise some of the assailants that took part in the first attack?
A.	The attack was made up of members of the population, and we fought back those assailants.  Subsequently, the masterminders of the attacks came and attacked us.
Q.	The first attack, was it led by which group of people?  How many people were leading the first attack?
A.	The attack was conducted by Hutus who came to kill us, but we were resistant against it before armed assailants came, and there were very many of them.
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, how you successfully resisted that first attack?  Was it because there were many of you?
A.	There were many of us, and the assailants were not armed.
Q.	You say that during the first attack, the assailants did not have arms or weapons?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	So why do you talk of attack?
A.	Well, it was an attack because the assailants were coming to massacre the Tutsi.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you say they did not have arms, do you mean guns or arms?
THE WITNESS:
They were armed with machetes and clubs.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	We take it, therefore, that they were armed?
A.	Yes, they had machetes and clubs.
Q.	Let's now turn to the second attack, Mr. Witness.  At what time did that attack begin?
A.	That attack began at nine o'clock, whereas the first one had begun at 8:30.
Q.	Where were you, Mr. Witness, when the second attack began?
A.	I was close to the Mugonero hospital, but I was hiding somewhere.
Q.	Very close to the hospital.  Were you outside the hospital?
A.	Yes.  I was behind the fence.  Well, the hospital buildings were not fenced, so I was outside the buildings.
Q.	What did you do when the assailants arrived?
A.	I took flight.
Q.	Where did you go, Mr. Witness?
A.	I took refuge within the hospital.
Q.	In what part of the hospital, precisely?
A.	I took refuge in the building that was found on the ground, on the basement; that is, in the surgery room.
Q.	Now, before going to the surgery room, did you try to take refuge elsewhere?
A.	I tried to hide in the church, but it was closed.
Q.	Is that the only place where you tried to take refuge?
A.	Yes, until nightfall.  Otherwise that's the only place where I tried to take refuge.
Q.	Do you recall, Mr. Witness, your statement of 12th November 1999 before the Tribunal's investigators?
A.	Yes, I do remember that statement.
Q.	I would like to read a portion thereof.  "As I was outside" -- I refer you to page 4 of the French version.  "As I was outside, I saw the attackers start killing the refugees or shooting at the refugees indiscriminately.  Meanwhile, I ran to room 3 of the medical complex to hide."  Can you tell us exactly where that room 3 is? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which statement? 
MR. SONGA:
Paragraph 4, Madam President, of page 3.  That's 364.  Madam President, I'm putting the statement of 12 November 1999, and in the French version, that portion of the statement is on page 4, and Madam President, in the English version it's on page 3, or page 364, fourth paragraph of the English version, of the English version of that page, fourth line, or third line actually, the end of the third line, "As I was outside, I saw the attackers," so the paragraph begins with, "On 16 April 1994, around 9 a.m.," et cetera, et cetera.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	The question, Mr. Witness, are you referring to room No. 3 of the medical complex?
A.	That room is found in the basement.  That is where the surgery room is found.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you want to say that room 3 is the surgery room?
A.	The surgery room comprises several other rooms, including room 3, and that is where I hid myself.
Q.	If I understood you well, a short while ago, Mr. Witness, you talked about the surgery room.  The surgery room is divided into several compartments.  Were you in compartment No. 3?
A.	Yes, room 3 of the surgery wing.
Q.	How many rooms were there in the surgery wing?
A.	There were many rooms, because since that day, I haven't gone to the surgery block because nobody can easily get access to it.
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it when you were in room 3 of the surgery block that you found 30 bodies?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you realise what was happening in the adjacent rooms?
A.	No, I didn't know what was happening there, because I didn't move from where I was.
Q.	And what makes you talk of the surgery room?
A.	That's because that's where I was hiding.
Q.	So why don't you tell us "one of the surgery rooms"?
A.	I have told you about the -- about where I was.
Q.	You talk of 30 bodies.  Were they heaped?  Were they, you know, like in a heap, bodies over others, or were they lying side by side?
A.	People were being cut into pieces with machetes and there was part of a person's body that somebody could fall on somebody that was already dead, and sometimes you had bodies that were in a heap or that were lying one on top of another.
Q.	When you entered the hall, did you find assailants therein?
A.	No, they had already left, but rather there are some of them who came and found me in that room.
Q.	When you arrived, were you the first person to get into the room?
A.	But I've just told you that I found three persons there who had been cut into pieces with machetes, and probably more of them.
Q.	Were you the first person alive who entered that room?
A.	There are other people who came from other rooms, but I am the only person who left that room alive.
Q.	I am talking about your entry into that room.  Were you the only person who entered that room alive?
A.	I entered that room hoping that I was going to find other persons alive in that room, but I only found bodies there, bodies that had been cut into pieces with machetes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you talk to us about your position vis-à-vis those corpses?
A.	It is in that very surgery room that I was.
Q.	Well, I said talk to us about the position in which you were vis-à-vis the bodies.  Were you lying on ground?  Were you above, on top of the bodies, and others on top of you, or what exactly what was the position?  What was the position of your body vis-à-vis those bodies?
A.	Since there were people who had been cut into pieces with machetes and who were still bleeding, I found myself on top of the bodies, and I was blood-soaked, and it was easy for people to think that I was dead as well.
Q.	How many bodies were under you, Mr. Witness?
A.	There were only bodies above me, but I can't say that I was covered with all the bodies that were in that room.
Q.	I would like to understand.  How many corpses were under you, not above you?  I want to understand.
A.	Rather, you should ask me about the bodies that were on me, not under me.
Q.	Do you want to say that there were no bodies under you?
A.	I was lying on the ground and I had bodies on top of me.  This does not mean that I was completely covered.  However, given that blood had flowed onto my body, when a person entered this room, I could leave my eyes open to see what was going on, but I was pretending to be dead.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What was the position of these bodies that were lying on top of you?  Were they lying on their stomachs or on their backs?
A.	There were bodies on top of me.  I cannot tell you what position they were in.  I can't tell you that.
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness, I was a bit distracted, maybe you have already answered me.  How many bodies were there on top of you?
A.	I would say three bodies.
Q.	Were there any bodies under the beds?
A.	No, the bodies came up quite close to the beds, though.
Q.	When there any bodies above the beds?
A.	No.  I would say that those who were killed were lying across the beds, and this was afterwards.
Q.	To get onto the bed, did you have to walk on bodies?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that you repelled the first attack and you took refuge in the surgery room, and on seeing the second attack, you suddenly came up against bodies in the surgery room.  Where did these bodies come from since the first attack was repelled?
A.	The hospital doesn't have a wall around it.  There were Interahamwes who came in from one side, and it is those ones, those Interahamwes, who cut up these people with machetes.  Others came from the southern end, and the assailants -- armed people came to swell the numbers of the assailants, people armed with guns, because there are several ways of entering this hospital.
Q.	Before this attack, did you know the surgery room?
A.	I knew the surgery room.
Q.	All the rooms in the surgery, you mean, or just the room in which you took refuge?
A.	I knew where the surgery room was, but I had never entered there.  That was the only day on which I went there, because before I used to just see it.
Q.	Since then, have you seen the surgery room?
A.	After the end of the war, I did not go near the surgery room.  However, I go to the hospital from time to time.
Q.	Up until now, as you speak to us, you have not set foot in the surgery room; is that correct?
A.	No, I have never had to have a tooth pulled out and I have never had to be operated upon.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the course of this year, did you meet an investigator from the International Criminal Tribunal?
A.	I do not remember that I met with him in the course of this year.
Q.	So you have never accompanied an investigator to the surgery room?
A.	No.  And in any case, nobody is allowed to have access to this room.
Q.	If perhaps we were to show you the person we are referring to, might you recognise him?
A.	I know that I have never gone there with anybody whatsoever, and even if you felt like going there, you would not have access.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with your permission, I would like to show the witness the picture, the photograph of a person to help refresh his memory if need be, with the assistance of the registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please.

Professor, you want this picture to be shown to the witness? 
MR. SONGA:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We didn't get the translation. 

THE WITNESS:
I'm telling you that I don't know how to read.  If you're referring to this person, it's true that I went to show him the surgery room, but we were not allowed access.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have concluded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This photograph is on page K0286193, and the photograph which is already exhibited as 
Exhibit P. 2C.  Is this the photograph?  Yes, it's the same photograph.

Mr. Witness, do you know this person on the photograph? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that this person asked me to go and show him where the surgery room was.  When we arrived there, we were prevented from accessing this room under the pretext that the white man was not present, so we went back without having access to the hospital.  In fact, we were told that the official -- the head of the hospital was not present.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In your statement of 20 June 1996, Mr. Witness, you state that you saw Pastor Ntakirutimana return and that there was another vehicle behind him and that you recognised the vehicle of Ruzindana in which Mika was sitting.  Do you recognise this statement?
A.	Yes.  I made this statement.
Q.	Who was driving Ruzindana's car?
A.	It is Ruzindana, himself, who was driving.
Q.	How many persons were in this vehicle?
A.	I saw people in the back, but I was not able to determine their number.  However, I was able to identify Mika, and I couldn't forget him.
Q.	How was Mika dressed?
A.	He was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt.
Q.	What colour?
A.	I don't remember the colours any more.
Q.	Where was he seated?
A.	He was sitting in the back of the vehicle.
Q.	Was he directly behind Ruzindana?
A.	He was in the same vehicle.  Ruzindana was in the front cabin and Mika was in the back.  I therefore concluded that they were together. 
Q.	Who else was in the cabin?
A.	I was not able to determine who else was in the cabin.  I only identified Ruzindana.
Q.	How were you able to identify Ruzindana?
A.	I told you that in respect to Ruzindana, I knew that he was a trader.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you become acquainted with Ruzindana?
A.	I knew Ruzindana first as a trader.  In the beginning, he used to drive his father's vehicle.  His father got rich, he bought several vehicles, and he gave one of them to Ruzindana, and his father told him, "Do not drive trucks too often because you might fall ill because of this sort of work." 
(Pages 26 to 42 by Trevor Gerbes)
































	1745H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Were you able to meet Ruzindana in other circumstances, of course, before the war? 
A.	Before the war, Ruzindana had a vehicle that used to ply the taxi trade, and if you had money, he would take you in his vehicle and drive you to Kibuye.  This vehicle burned on the slopes of 
Lake Kivu, a route to Mugonero.
Q.	Do you mean, Witness, that you knew him when he owned this taxi?
A.	Yes.  When a person wanted to make a trip on board his vehicle, Ruzindana took him on board.  However, I knew Ruzindana when he was still young.  He is someone of my -- of the same age as me.  Even before he began his trade, I knew him. 
Q.	That is what we wanted to hear, Mr. Witness.  At what age did you and Ruzindana get to know each other? 
A.	From the age of -- from the age when a person is able to recognise someone and remember it.  I know that apart from the fact that he used to go to Mombasa driving a vehicle, I also know that he had vehicles which he used to transport tea from the Gisovu tea factory.
Q.	During your childhood, were you neighbours?
A.	We were neighbours because we went to the same market.
Q.	Did you meet in school, for example? 
A.	That is possible because I wanted to know how to write my name, to avoid having to use my fingerprint as a signature. 
Q.	Could you tell us about your school, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I went to the same school as him in Gasharu.  When I failed, I went back home. 
Q.	After how many years did you fail? 
A.	I had done four years, but it must be said that our teachers enabled us to make progress in our classes, even though one knew nothing at all.  When I left the school, I could neither read nor write very well. 
Q.	May we take it, then, that you spent four years with Ruzindana in school? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And after four years you were still unable to read or write? 
A.	I had problems.  I wasn't very good at school.  I was allowed to be promoted from one class to another, just to please me. 
Q.	And why did this stop after the fourth year?  Why did they stop pleasing you, Mr. Witness?
A.	My parents having noticed that I was not very good at school, they advised me to abandon school to go and watch my parents' cows. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, regarding your schooling, we have another version which states that you did only one year of primary school.  What do you think of this version that we have found in your witness statement of the 24th of September 2001, in the Ntakirutimana trial? 
A.	If you were to ask me the question, I would tell you that I didn't even do the first year of primary school.
Q.	So what are you talking about? 
A.	Having noticed that school didn't do anything for me because I don't even know how to read or write, when I was asked to go and look after the livestock of my parents, the situation worsened.  And right now, we are actually asking people to come and teach us how to read and write. 
Q.	Witness, five minutes ago you told us that you spent four years in school with Ruzindana.
A.	I told you that it didn't help me any -- because I left the fourth year of primary school without having learnt how to read or write. 
Q.	That is not the question, Mr. Witness.  When you say to this Court that you spent four years with Ruzindana, should we assume that you did indeed spend four years or no year at all because you can neither read nor write?  So please tell us, did you spend four years in school or you assume that you did not spend any time in school, no year in school because you can neither read nor write?
A.	It is as if I learnt nothing.  Even if I went to primary school for four years, I cannot write my name, I cannot read.  So what use were these studies?  I cannot boast that I went to school when the schooling was not useful to me. 
Q.	Yes or no, did you spend four years with Ruzindana? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  At this time I should like to put the question to you once more.  When one reads your witness statement of 24th September 2001, in the Ntakirutimana trial, we see the following:  You were together in Gasharu during the only year when you went to school.  Why did you talk about one year? 
A.	I think that this is not an important question.  If I state that I did one year of primary school, I think that is the same thing.  One year and four years of primary school studies are the same thing. 
Q.	We ask questions in order to determine the truth.
A.	The truth is that I did four years of primary school, but it didn't help me at all.  Why are you focusing on this question?  I did four years but it didn't help me any. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just answer the question asked and don't make comments on the question.  

Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
There is some difficulty.  There is a lot of background noise.  I am not able to speak well. 

I think the technical problem has been resolved. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q. Mr. Witness, I shall read the question and the answer and then we shall move on to other questions.  This is what the transcript says.  
"Q.	Witness, you state that you went to school with Mr. Ruzindana in Gasharu during the only year in which you went to school."  
"A.	Yes, it is during this year that we were in the same class."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have asked this question from the witness and he has answered it.  You should rather move on to another question. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with your leave, I would like a resolution of this double version of facts regarding the witness's educational history.  And I would like to tender the relevant extract of the transcript as exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please. 

	Professor, do you have the English version of extract of witness statement in the Ntakirutimana
	case?
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I have the impression that we are having some trouble finding them but they do indeed exist. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, then we would ask you to please read out this question -- highlighted questions, which we believe was read out to the witness, please?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Put it to the witness.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  I gave the following extract: This is the 24th of September 2004 (sic).  
"Q.	Witness, you state that you went to school with Mr. Ruzindana in the only year during which you went to school."
"A.	Yes, it was during that year that we were in the same class."
MR. SONGA:
That was in September 2001. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Mr. Issa, please bring the statement.  

So the extract of the witness statement in the Kayishema case dated 17th of November 1997 is Exhibit D. 24E for English to be kept under seal, and Exhibit D. 24F for the French version, under seal.
	(Exhibit Nos. D. 24E and D. 24F admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the extract of witness statement in the Ntakirutimana case dated 24th of September 2001 is Exhibit D. 25F for French, to be kept under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 25F admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think these are the open Court sessions, so they need not be kept under seal.

Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can I ask you a general question.  Have you ever considered in your cross-examining the implication of Rule 90(G)(ii)?
MR. SONGA:
I will look it up, Your Honour.  Which Rule did you refer to, Your Honour? 
JUDGE SHORT:
In your cross-examination -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Your Honour put on your microphone, please? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Sorry.  In your cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses, have you ever considered the implication of Rule 90(G)(ii)?  Do you want me to read it for you? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Your Honour, I believe I am taking it into consideration. 
JUDGE SHORT:
All right. 
MR. SONGA:
Even if it were only to illustrate what I have just stated -- if we are referring to education, it is because the witness states that he knows Ruzindana, and it is important for us to know the circumstances under which he knew him.  But from his prior statement, he stated that he had met him in school.  There is another implication -- another possible implication; that is, that the witness, in the course of many of the questions put to him, has stated that he neither knows how to read nor write, whereas he has been to school and has signed all the statements very clearly.  That is what we are trying to ascertain, Your Honour. 

JUDGE SHORT:
I hope we are referring to the same section.  I am referring to the section, the Rule which says that, "In the cross-examination of a witness who is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the 
cross-examining party, counsel shall put to that witness the nature of the case of the party for whom that counsel appears, which is in contradiction of the evidence given by the witness."  If you are taking it into consideration, that is okay. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, is it one of the days that I can hope you will oblige me in the usual way?
MR. SONGA:
That was my wish, Your Honour.  But since Madam President asked me to take my time, I believe we will have to go up to 7 p.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't take much of their time.  Don't take more than it is necessary. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No.  Professor, I didn't ask you.
MR. SONGA:
And, Madam President, we would like you, if you can allow some time - 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
For you to address the issue of your motion on change of calendar
MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Extension of time, yes, for the Defence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Overlapping microphones)...If we could do it today. 
MR. SONGA:
If it is possible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, if it's possible. 
MR. SONGA:
That is a bet. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, go ahead.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you stated that you know Sikubwabo.  Who is Sikubwabo? 
A.	He was a bourgmestre of Gishyita commune. 
Q.	Did you know him before that date of the 6th of April? 
A.	I knew him when he was bourgmestre. 
Q.	How did he arrive on the scene?
A.	He came on board a communal vehicle. 
Q.	Who was driving that vehicle? 
A.	It was driven by the bourgmestre himself. 
Q.	What kind of vehicle was it? 
A.	It was a white communal vehicle.  It wasn't entirely covered. 
Q.	Was it a car, a pickup?  What kind of vehicle was it, please? 
A.	It was a Toyota vehicle. 
Q.	What were the dimensions of that vehicle? 
A.	You are asking for dimensions of the vehicle?  Don't you know the dimensions of a Toyota?
Q.	Was it a car, Witness, or a pickup? 
A.	It was a Toyota vehicle that was not covered.  It was not entirely covered.  I am not in a position to describe this vehicle for you any further. 
Q.	Was there a rear part to that vehicle? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Were you able to identify the people who were in the rear of the vehicle? 
A.	I could only identify the bourgmestre.
Q.	Were you able to see, even if you couldn't identify them, any other people? 
A.	Not only were there people in the rear, there were also people in front. 
Q.	How many could there have been? 
A.	There were about 10 of them, but I did not count them. 
Q.	Apart from Sikubwabo, we take it that you did not identify any other person? 
A.	No other person. 
Q.	When you saw Sikubwabo, what was the distance between you and him? 
A.	I could not measure the distance but from where I was, I could identify anyone who was standing at that distance.  I feared for my life.
Q.	Did you also recognise Ntakirutimana among the assailants? 
A.	Yes, I was able to recognise Ntakirutimana because I had known him well before then. 
Q.	Under what circumstances did you know him? 
A.	He was a pastor and preacher in the church.
Q.	How did he arrive on the scene? 
A.	He came accompanied by assailants, and he was coming from the Gishyita direction, on the road between Ngoma and Gishyita. 
Q.	Who else did you recognise? 
A.	I made mention of Obed Ruzindana, Ntakirutimana, Gérard, Sikubwabo, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana and Eliezer Niyitegeka, as well as Kayishema.
Q.	Thank you.  And who was Kayishema?
A.	He was préfet.
Q.	How did he arrive on the scene? 
A.	He came on board a vehicle what was open, completely open. 
Q.	Witness, did all these people you have just mentioned arrive at the same time? 
A.	They arrived in turns. 
Q.	Did they consult with one another before the attack? 
A.	I am not aware.  I saw them coming to attack Mungonero.  They came from Gishyita.  I do not know whether they consulted with one another beforehand. 
Q.	You state that they were leading the attack.  What do you mean by that?  How do you know that they were at the head of the attack, they were leading the attack? 
A.	They were leading that attack because it was when they arrived that people started shooting on refugees.
Q.	Did you have the impression that someone was giving orders? 
A.	Beginning with Ruzindana, Mika and Ntakirutimana, all of them gave orders. 
Q.	Did you hear any order being given? 
A.	Yes, the order to kill Tutsis.
Q.	Did you hear it? 
A.	Yes, I heard it with my own ears.
Q.	Who was speaking? 
A.	We wrote a letter to Ntakirutimana while we were at the hospital, and his response to us was that we had already been handed over and that orders had been given.
Q.	Is that the only order you can point out to us? 
A.	Now, the préfet was capable of stopping the war, but did he not stop people from being killed.  So as far as I am concerned, it was a conspiracy.
Q.	You make mention of the préfet.  What did you hear him say? 
A.	I heard him say that the work should be started, that the time had come. 
Q.	To whom was he speaking? 
A.	He was speaking to those who were armed with machetes and clubs, because those people had waited for the arrival of the préfet and the others. 
Q.	You make mention of the presence of gendarmes.  Do you confirm having seen them? 
A.	I saw them.
Q.	How many of them were there? 
A.	There were two of them.
Q.	How did they arrive on the scene? 
A.	I stated that the préfet had sent them there to provide for the security of that area. 
Q.	And soldiers, did you see them? 
A.	I saw soldiers arrive with killers on the 16th of April. 
Q.	How many of them were there, Witness? 
A.	There were two of them. 
Q.	Were they in uniform? 
A.	Yes, they were in military uniform and were wearing red berets. 
Q.	Do you assert that there were also civilians?  Is that correct? 
A.	The civilians were Tutsis who had sought refuge there. 
Q.	Among the assailants, weren't there civilians? 
A.	There were civilians armed with machetes and clubs. 
Q.	Were they wearing any particular clothes? 
A.	They were wearing ordinary clothes.
Q.	On that day, did you see Interahamwe? 
A.	On that day, everyone was an Interahamwe.  There was no distinction. 
Q.	Even the soldiers? 
A.	Soldiers were in their usual uniform.  We did not know that soldiers were Interahamwe.  They were wearing their usual uniforms.  On that day we did not know what Interahamwe meant.
Q.	Did you subsequently know who the Interahamwe were? 
A.	Yes, we got to know that subsequently. 
Q.	And when you knew, what did you understand Interahamwe to mean? 
A.	We considered that everyone who killed was an Interahamwe.
Q.	Witness, you refer to youngsters trained; is that correct? 
A.	We considered that every Hutu who killed during that period was an Interahamwe, whether they were civilian or military.
Q.	And when you make reference to trained youngsters, are you referring only to the Interahamwe? 
A.	There were soldiers who killed people and others who were armed with machetes who were also killing.  But during that period, everyone who killed, everyone who committed killings was considered as an Interahamwe. 
Q.	But why do you talk of trained youngsters?  Do you have any information?  Did you have any information on the training they received? 
A.	Did I tell you that they received training?  What I said was that everyone who killed was considered by us as an Interahamwe.
Q.	Witness, I believe I have one of your statements in which you make reference to trained youngsters.  I will look for it and read an extract of it to you. 
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Madam President, I am still looking for the passage.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, the statement in question is that of the 20th of June 1996, page 3 of the French version, and you state as follows:
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In which case?
MR. SONGA:
We are dealing with the witness's own statement given on the 20th of June 1996.  In the French version, it is on page 3, and we would like to read the following to the witness.  It is a list that appears at the end of the page.

"Amongst the attackers, I saw Obed Ruzindana, Charles Sikubwabo, Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, Préfet Clément Kayishema, gendarmes, soldiers, civilians and trained youngsters."  And my question has to do with the fact that he states that youngsters were trained. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you have information regarding the existence of such trained youngsters? 
A.	Youngsters had been trained so that they could go out and fight against the Inkotanyi, who had attacked the country, and those youngsters had been trained in Gishyita at a place called Gatocyi.  The training was aimed at enabling them to go and combat the Inkotanyi.
Q.	On what date was such training given, Witness? 
A.	The training took place in 1993.
Q.	Did you see the place where the training took place?
A.	Yes, there was a youth camp.
Q.	Were those youngsters locked up? 
A.	They received training and at the end of the day they returned to their homes. 
Q.	Witness, we are still dealing with the date of the 16th of April.  How did you survive in that surgery room? 
A.	I stayed in that room and at about 9 p.m., the massacre ceased.  Power had been cut and so they started looting and the killings stopped. 
Q.	Did other people, Witness, find you in that room? 
A.	Three people found me in that room. 
Q.	At what time did you enter that room? 
A.	I was not wearing a watch, but I entered that room at about 11 a.m. 
Q.	Between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., what were you doing? 
A.	We were on the ground watching people being killed and when situation got worse, we fled and sought refuge there.  It was at about 11 a.m. 
Q.	Can you be more precise?  You started by watching what was happening.
A.	We tried to hide.  We could go to one side and be confronted with the assailants or soldiers, so we decided to flee towards that place.  And when I got inside the surgery room, all I found there was bodies. 
Q.	For two hours, that is all you did? 
A.	We were running left and right, trying to hide.  We had nothing else to do.  Can I really try to tell you that we tried to stand up to them?
Q.	And yet, Witness, if we read your statement very carefully, it would appear you were trying to stand up to them.  This is what I read in your statement of 1999.  "On the 16th of April 1994, at about 9 a.m., that complex was steaming with Tutsi refugees and it was attacked by the following people.  They were leading a multitude of attackers.  We tried to repel them in vain.  And the assailants started using traditional weapons.  They resorted to using firearms and grenades."  

So contrary to what you stated before the Chamber, you were repelling the assailants between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.  Can you see that?  Can we take it that was the situation? 
A.	Let me explain to you what happened.  We first of all tried to combat the attackers who were not armed with guns.  We tried to repel them.  But when the assailants armed with guns arrived, we started fleeing.  During the first attack we tried to resist, but when the assailants armed with guns arrived, we realised that we were weak and decided to flee. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  As explained to us in your testimony before this Chamber today, when you said that a Mathias Ngirinshuti and Gérard successfully found themselves amongst the refugees armed with stones to release the Bangukiye family.  Can you tell us exactly what happened?
A.	They did not join the crowd of refugees.  They came to look for Bangukiye, and Bangukiye found that his wife as well as his children -- and they then left and the others were killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state -- you stated on the 12th of November 1999 that while you were concealed by the corpses, Demos Karera, the medical assistant in that complex, and who was accompanied Mukasine, entered that room and they lay on the bed; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you know them before? 
A.	I knew them.
Q.	How could you see them whereas you were covered by bodies? 
A.	They entered before Mika and his companion arrived.  So when they came, I realised that those were Tutsis who were seeking refuge in the room.  And when I raised my head, I realised that there were girls that I knew, and they lay under the bed.  And Mika and his companion found them in that room. 
Q.	So far you have not yet told me how you could see them enter when you were covered by bodies? 
A.	From time to time, I could raise my head, so I was able to see them. 
Q.	Were you pushing the bodies aside to be able to see them? 
A.	I could raise my head and throw a glance.  Later I would take back my position.
Q.	I am asking if you could push aside the bodies. 
A.	Well, I raised my head and when I realised that I ran the risk of being discovered, I would take my original position and I would stay put.
Q.	By gathering the bodies around you or on you? 
A.	Yes, I wasn't wounded.
Q.	Thank you.  You talk of Kajongi's daughter.  Who is he? 
A.	He was an accountant. 
Q.	Did you know his children? 
A.	Yes, I knew them.
Q.	Do you have their names? 
A.	I know the names of his children -- of his sons and those of Mukasine. 
Q.	How were his sons called?
A.	One was called Paul Muvuni.  He is an officer of the army.  The other was called Didast.  He is a lieutenant in the FPR army. 
Q.	Lieutenant of the RPF army?  What about Karera's daughters?
A.	Well, Karera's daughters came with Mukasine.
Q.	And who was Karera?
A.	He was a medical assistant. 
Q.	Did you know the personnel of the hospital?
A.	I knew them.
Q.	Did you also know their families? 
A.	Yes, we knew the members of their families because we used to attend the same church. 
Q.	Throughout the day in that room, were you alone with those girls?
A.	People were coming into the room and when they realised that they were literally with corpses, they would go back.  They were coming to look for survivors to kill. 
Q.	How were the two Karera girls called? 
A.	I did not know their names, but I know the name of their father.  We used to go to schools far from that region, or, rather, they used to go to schools away from that region, but at that time, they were on holidays. 
Q.	You stated, Mr. Witness, on the 12th of November 1999, that once in room No. 3, the three girls lay on the bed.  My question would be to find out if each of the girls took a bed? 
A.	There were three beds in that room. 
Q.	How high were the beds? 
A.	Well, the beds were of average height.  These are beds that patients used to sleep on. 
Q.	In order to climb on the beds, did you need to step on the corpses before reaching the beds? 
A.	You could even sit on the bed from a standing position on the floor, and when you sat on the bed your feet will still be on the floor.
Q.	Please, try to understand my question.  Could you reach the bed without having to step on the corpses -- without having to stand on the corpses? 
A.	Well, we were walking on corpses because the corpses came close to the beds. 
Q.	Probably they also stepped on you? 
A.	Yes, they stepped on me but I could not move.
Q.	And why not? 
A.	I could not move because I could have been killed. 
Q.	You hadn't yet moved your head to realise that there were only girls?
A.	Well, I would move my head, but when I heard people pass by, I would retain my breath because I had blood all over me and I was like, you know, like a dead person, myself. 
Q.	When you recognised them, did you talk to them? 
A.	No.  And besides, they didn't know that I was there up until the time they were killed.  Even Mika couldn't tell if I was there or not. 
Q.	When you moved your head to see, didn't he see you? 
A.	No.  Mika and his companions were busy taking care of the young girls, so they could not realise that I was there.  When they were through with raping the girls and after having killed them, they went out and they didn't know that I was there, and so they didn't see me. 
Q.	When Mika entered, what time was it? 
A.	I had just spent a few moments in that room when Mika and his companions came, just merely after the girls had come in. 
Q.	How was Mr. Mika dressed? 
A.	He was wearing a pair of trousers.
Q.	With a shirt or without one? 
A.	He was wearing a shirt and inside the shirt he was wearing a white T-shirt. 
Q.	And what was the colour of the shirt? 
A.	Well, it has been quite a while.  I cannot quite recall the colour of the shirt. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
These questions have been answered to you, Mr. Professor.  
MR. SONGA:
I do not recall having asked those questions, Your Honour.  And if I have already, please excuse me. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement of 27th August 2002, you state that Mr. Mika was wearing a long military type jacket, khaki colour.  Would you confirm that statement? 
A.	That is the chemise he was wearing that I talked about.  He removed that shirt and remained with his white T-shirt. 
Q.	Do you mean that by a long military jacket of khaki colour, that was the shirt you are referring to?
A.	Well, it was a shirt, a long shirt, but it is not a very long jacket that goes right down to the feet. 
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that Mika was accompanied by Kanyabungo.  Who is that Kanyabungo?
A.	He was rather accompanied by Kanyabungo's sons, rather.
Q.	And who are they? 
A.	They were soldiers. 
Q.	Did you know them? 
A.	I knew them but didn't know their names.  Kanyabungo was also a soldier who had gone on retirement. 
Q.	Did they say anything when they got in? 
A.	They asked those young girls to undress themselves. 
Q.	Can you tell us who raped who? 
A.	Mika raped Mukasine, whereas the girls of Karera were raped by Kanyabungo's sons. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to read a portion of your statement of 27th August 2002, and you say the following: "Apart from raping, Mika also raped Mukasine, the child of -- the daughter of Kajongi as well as -- mostly Karera's daughters.  Those are the two cases that I know."

Do you confirm that in your statement of 27th August 2002?
A.	My statement was not well recorded.  I talked about Kanyabungo's sons.
Q.	And who did what? 
A.	They raped that young girl. 
Q.	You stated in the same statement --
A.	Well, that is what I stated, unless my statement was not well recorded. 
Q.	Well, that statement does bear your signature, Mr. Witness.  
A.	It is possible that my statement was not well recorded.  But I do recall having stated that Mika raped Mukasine and Kanyabungo's sons raped Karera's daughters.  That is what I stated.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You stated on the 12th of November 1999, that in asking the girl to undress herself, and because she refused to comply, Mika hit the girl with the butt of the gun; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And what was the effect of that hit? 
A.	The effect that was -- the result was that Mika had to undress her forcefully.
Q.	What clothes was Mukasine wearing? 
A.	She was wearing a skirt.  Her red pants were first of all removed and she was wearing a yellow skirt. 
Q.	Did you talk of red shorts? 
A.	Yes, her red shorts were stripped off her. 
Q.	In your statement, we rather read black shorts. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Black what, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Black shorts.  Yes, Your Honour, we are talking about the statement of 27th November 1999, in the long paragraph which begins with, "On 16th April 1994."  In the middle of that paragraph, and I am going to read an extract thereof.  "Mika asked the girl to undress.  But as the girl refused since she was still lying in the bed, he forcibly took off her black shorts which he threw on the floor.  Then he pulled down the white shorts that were inside his trousers and freed one leg."  This is what we read in the statement of November 1999. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry.  We read differently in the other statement; that is the one I was on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, on the following page it was clarified that Mukasine was wearing a yellow skirt and a multicoloured top, page 4 of the English version, second sentence from the top. 
MR. SONGA:
At the declaration of which date, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of 12th November 1999.
MR. SONGA:
Are you referring to Mika's dress or Mukasine's, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is page 4 of the English version, a statement of the 12th November 1999, second sentence.  It reads: "I should point out that Mukasine was wearing a yellow shirt and a multicoloured top." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A yellow skirt, Madam President.
MR. SONGA:
I do not quite see the sentence, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Page -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
The sentence starts:  "After the rape and the killing, they abandoned the bodies right there and left.  I should point out that Mukasine was wearing a yellow skirt and a multicoloured top.  She was not wearing a bra."  That paragraph -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you find it?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I can see that portion, Madam President.  "After the rape and the killing, they abandoned the bodies right there and left.  I should point out that Mukasine was wearing a yellow skirt, a multicoloured top and she was not wearing a bra." 

If I may try to understand, I do not think that this changes much in the portion that I read a while ago, because, apparently, this is only -- this is part of the dressing that is quite different from what I was referring, especially when Mika is said to have removed the girl's red underwear, which he threw on the ground.  I was only reacting to the witness's statement when he talked about red shorts. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What we are pointing out to you, Professor, is that in the same statement, there is contradictory material.  One of them is said to be pointing out, which means the issue must have been discussed between the person recording the statement and the witness.  And the witness, of course, is expected -- expected that the correction had been made after he pointed out the colour of the dressing.  

You are not too far from seven o'clock, Professor. 
JUDGE SHORT:
We are already there, actually. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, today you have disappointed us. 
MR. SONGA:
I am quite aware of that, Madam President.  It is simply because the subject matter is difficult. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So how long -- how much further do you propose to go, roughly, estimate?
MR. SONGA:
Between 30 and 45 minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then we will stop for the day and continue tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.  The Court is adjourned until tomorrow afternoon. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
