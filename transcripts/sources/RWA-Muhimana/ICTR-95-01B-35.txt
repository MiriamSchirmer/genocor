MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning to everyone in the courtroom.  The Court is in session now.  

May we have the appearances for the Prosecution, please. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is represented by Maymuchka, Florida, Madenga, myself, Kapaya and Mr. Charles Adeogun-Phillips, senior trial attorney.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  

Defence. 
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  The Defence team remains unchanged.  Maitre Kazadi, Maître Munderere, Maître Sahinkuye and yours truly, Professor Songa.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are continuing with your evidence-in-chief.  You are still under obligation to speak the truth.  

Professor, please go on. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS NM6,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	When we broke up last time, you were talking to us about what you were doing to obtain documents.  Can you tell the Chamber what documents those were.
A.	It was an identity card, birth certificate, certificate of good conduct, as well as an attestation of full identity. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you also recall if you had all those documents on the same day or if you had them on different days?
A.	I had those documents on different days.
Q.	On those different days, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us about the security situation in that secteur in April 1994. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, before you answer that question, what were the different days on which you say you saw Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw him, with effect, from the 9th -- from the 9th right up to the 27th of May, but it's not like I was seeing him every day.  I can take out Sunday.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You said between which dates, 9th and 27th of? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ninth of May? 
THE WITNESS:
From the 9th to the 27th of May, excluding Sundays.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ninth of which months? 
THE WITNESS:
Nine May. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you say you saw him every day or you did not see him every day? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I saw him from the 9th to the 27th, except on Sundays.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Every day? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What time of the day? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to see him sometimes in the mornings, say at nine o'clock, or at midday, or between midday and 1 p.m.  I could also see him in the evenings, between 4:30 and 5 p.m.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did you mean by seeing him?  Did you meet him every day? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I didn't hold conversations with him.  I used to meet him where he was. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where was he?  Where was it that you met? 
THE WITNESS:
Sometimes he would be in front of his house or in his shop that was below his house.  At other times he would be conversing with people at the centre or at Senani -- or at Senani's place, where he had a shop.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did have you any reason to look for him? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not have any reason to look for him.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, am I correct in saying that when you gave evidence on Friday, you gave us specific dates between the 9th of May and 27th of May when you saw Mika, are you now saying that -- first of all, am I correct in saying that that was your evidence last Friday, that you gave us specific dates between the 9th of May and 27th of May when you saw Mika and you said that those dates you remember seeing Mika.  They rang a bell.  Is that not what your evidence was last week? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, can you please repeat your question. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm saying that, is it not correct that last week when you gave evidence, you did not say that you saw Mika every day from the 9th of May to 27th of May, except Sundays, but you gave us specific dates during that period when you saw Mika.  Is it correct or not? 
THE WITNESS:
You are right. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So you are now changing your evidence?  You are now saying that you saw him every day from 9th May to 27th, except Sundays; is that what you want the Court to accept? 
THE WITNESS:
That is what I said, but the dates I recall are those that I mentioned to you last time.
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.  Now, you said sometimes you saw him in the evening, sometimes in the morning, sometimes in front of his house.  Do you remember the dates on which you saw him in the morning, the dates on which you saw him in the evening, the dates on which you saw him in front of his house? 
THE WITNESS:
On the 9th, I saw him at about midday; on the 13th, I saw him in the morning.
JUDGE SHORT:
On the 9th when? 
THE WITNESS:
He was in front of his house. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Go on. 
THE WITNESS:
On the 13th, I saw him in front of his house and I saw him again in his shop.  In the morning, I saw him in his house.  At midday, I saw him in the shop, and in the evening, I saw him again in his shop.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When did you see him on 13th?  Did you see him twice on 13th? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw him three times.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
On 13th? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)
THE WITNESS:
I saw him in the morning, at midday, and in the evening. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Morning where; midday where; evening where? 
THE WITNESS:
In the morning, I saw him in front of his house; at midday, I saw him in his shop, just below his residence, and in the evening, I saw him again in his shop. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Those are the dates you remember? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When was the next date you saw him? 
THE WITNESS:
On the 25th, I saw him in the morning. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where? 

THE WITNESS:
In front of his house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Any other time? 
THE WITNESS:
On the 27th, I saw him in the evening. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When? 
THE WITNESS:
He was in another shop.  The shop that was different from the one I mentioned before. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which shop? 
THE WITNESS:
It is a shop that belonged to a certain Senani. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And with whom was he? 
THE WITNESS:
He was conversing with someone whose identity I did not know. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On these other occasions, was he alone or with others? 
THE WITNESS:
Sometimes he was in the shop conversing with people; at other times he was alone in his house.  When he was in the shop, quite often he was in the company of other persons who were there. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did you go in the shop? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what did you go to do in the shop? 
THE WITNESS:
Since I had trekked more than five kilometres, I would stop there to take a sweet drink.  There was also a telephone line there where I could call, or I could eat in the shop.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm not asking what you do.  I'm asking you what you did. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, can you please repeat your question.  I don't quite understand it. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did you go to the shop to do? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I went there either to eat or to make a phone call. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Either to eat or to make a phone call.  Did you talk to him?  Did you order the food from him? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't talk to him, but often I would tell him "good morning" like I would to any other person who was there. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you what you did, not what you would do. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't quite understand the purport of your question.  I went there because there was a telephone, so I could make calls there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, (overlapping microphones) plus three days when you saw Mr. Muhimana:  On the 9th, on the 13th, on the 25th and the 27th; those are four days.  Now, of those four days, twice you saw him in the shop -- or three times, actually, you saw him in the shop.  Of those three times, I'm asking you, what did you go to do in the shop?  Did you go to telephone or did you go to eat or did you go to drink a soda?  What did you go to do on each of those occasions?  That's all I'm asking you: not what you could do; what you did.
THE WITNESS:
I do not think I can answer that question because I cannot recall all that I did on each occasion that I went there on those dates. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You can not recall all the things that you did when you went there on each of those occasions.  Is there any reason you are able to recall those occasions that you went there?  Is there any reason that makes you able to recall that you saw him in the morning or you saw him at midday or you saw him in the evening on the 13th and the number of times you went there?  Is there anything that makes you remember that?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have reasons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which are those? 
THE WITNESS:
The reason is that I went to the commune to look for the documents on those dates.  I recall those days, by the way, because on the 9th I went to the commune o' clock time.  On the 13th, that is the date on which I got the first document.  The 25th was the date on which I obtained the other documents, and on the 27th I left where I used to live to go to work. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now I'm asking you, Mr. Witness, not why you went to the commune office.  That you have told us very clearly and graphically.  What I am asking you is, is there anything, any reason, why you would remember that you went to Mika's shop or went to his home or went there three times on the 13th?  What is it that makes you remember that?  Is there any particular reason why you would remember that? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not have any specific reason except that the date corresponds to the date on which I obtained the documents; otherwise, there is no special reason.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There is no special reason to remember that you went to Mr. Mika's shop or that you saw him?
THE WITNESS:
I could have gone there to buy food or drink.  Apart from that, there is no other particular reason. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you went to this secteur, did you learn that rapes had been committed in Mika's home by Mika himself? 
A.	No, I heard nothing of the sort.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness NM6. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you, if I recall correctly, on Thursday last week, you testified that you hadn't seen 
Mika Muhimana since childhood, around about 1980, before you saw him again in April or May 1994; is that correct?
A.	I did not understand your question.  Would you please repeat it. 
Q.	Let me make it slightly easier for you.  You hadn't seen Mika Muhimana since 1980, had you, when you saw him again in 1994, during the genocide?  The last time you saw him was in 1980, before that, wasn't it?
A.	It is not 1980.  It was 1989, in fact.
Q.	Didn't you testify on Thursday last week that you hadn't seen him since 1980?
A.	I said that the last time I saw him was in 1989.
Q.	Pardon me.  Now, you have been asked several times this morning if there is any specific reason why you would remember having seen Mika Muhimana on four dates that you have mentioned.  Do you recall being asked that this morning, sir?
A.	I remember that these questions were put to me.
Q.	And your response was that you saw him because you had reason to -- you remember having seen him on these dates because you were busy doing some administrative things in the commune office, like collecting documents and things like that.  Do you recall telling us that, sir?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Would I therefore be correct in saying that all the occasions that you claim to have seen Mika were chance meetings; they were not scheduled, were they, sir?  You didn't have an appointment to meet with him on these dates, did you, sir?  You just happened to bump into him, didn't you, sir?
A.	Thank you for such a very good question.  What you have just said is totally correct.  There was no specific reason for our meetings; it was just a matter of chance.
Q.	Indeed.  Now, you have also testified -- and can you give us an idea with this.  Each time that you met him -- let's take the 9th of April, April 9, for example.  You testified you saw him at midday outside his house.  Can you tell me how long you --
MR. SONGA:
Objection.  I believe that it is not on the 9th of April.  It is the 9th of May instead.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The 9th of May.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	The 9th of May, Witness, sorry.  Can you tell us how long you spent with him, or you observed him for how long?
A.	On the 9th -- on the 9th, I saw him for 20 minutes because he was standing in front of his house with someone that I knew.  They were playing cards.  So I saw them for about 20 minutes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Standing, playing cards? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Playing cards where? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were playing cards.  He was playing cards with someone who was his neighbour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where were they playing cards? 
THE WITNESS:
In front of Mika's doorstep.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So on the 9th of May, you saw him for 20 minutes for the entire day, didn't you, sir?
A.	That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you were asked by my colleague Judge whether Mika was playing cards, standing in front of his house.  What was your answer to that?  Was he standing, playing cards with this friend of his?
THE WITNESS:
They were sitting down on chairs.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	The next date that you testified that you recall seeing Mika was on the 13th.  Did you recall saying that, sir?
A.	I remember.
Q.	Were you yourself with him on the 13th of May, sir?
A.	As I explained to you before, I was not with him.
Q.	That's what I thought you said.  Now, on the 25th of May 1994, were you yourself with him, sir?
A.	No, I was not with him.
Q.	On the 27th of May 1994, were you with Mika Muhimana, sir?
A.	I was not with him.
Q.	Very well.  The commercial centre that you have described, is that the same as the Kiziba centre?
A.	No, it is not the Kiziba centre; it is the Gishyita business centre.
Q.	And that's different from the place known as the Kiziba commercial centre, is it, sir?
A.	They are different.
Q.	And the location you describe as the Gishyita commercial centre, how far was that from Bisesero; do you know?
A.	They are separated by about 9 to 11 kilometres.
Q.	Therefore, Mr. Witness, if you, for example, were riding in the car and had to travel between Gishyita centre and Bisesero, to your mind, roughly how long would that 9 to 11 kilometre distance take you?  Can you help me with that?  Five, ten minutes, one hour? 
A.	It would take about 30 to 45 minutes, because as I remember it, the road was not very good.
Q.	Very well.  So if you had to go from Gishyita to Bisesero, it would take you about 40 minutes, as you say, maximum, in a car.  Sorry, I saw you nod, Mr. Witness, but it didn't register on the record.  If you could just say something into the microphone:  yes or no. 
A.	I did not nod.  I was trying to determine whether this distance corresponded to what I had indicated. 
Q.	And what's the final conclusion that you've arrived at, sir?
A.	To conclude, if I look at the distance, I would say that it would take 40 minutes to cover it by car.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's go back to the 13th of May then.  Around about what time did you see Mika on the 13th o' clock time, sir, in front of his house in the morning?  What time was that in the morning?
A.	Nine o'clock.
Q.	And for how long did you see him in front of his house, sir?
A.	I saw him in passing.  I cannot tell you for how long I saw him.
Q.	So two seconds, 30 seconds, one hour?  Just give me an idea.  Five minutes, that sort of thing. 
A.	I would say 15 seconds.
Q.	So the first time on the 13th at nine o' clock outside Mika's house whilst he was playing cards with a friend lasted 15 seconds; are we agreed on that, sir?  Around about that, something like that?
A.	I didn't understand your question.
Q.	In summary, can we say that the first time that you saw him on the 13th of May in the morning at 
nine o' clock you observed him and his friend for about 15 seconds; is that correct?
A.	No.
Q.	So what's correct?  How long did you -- tell me what is the situation then.  Was it 15 minutes, 
15 hours?
A.	I have indicated 15 seconds.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the second time you saw him on that day, the 13th of May, was at midday you say outside his shop.  Do you recall telling us that, sir?
A.	No, that is not what I said.
Q.	Can you refresh our memories as to what your testimony is for the second time on the 13th at midday?
A.	As I said before, I explained that on the 13th, at about midday, I saw Mika near a store below his residence.  I cannot tell you for how long I saw him, but I remember that it was during the lunch break, so I saw him at this store for about 20 to 25 minutes.
Q.	Now, to have seen him in the store for 20 to 25 minutes, you must have been standing there with him, yourself doing other things, like having lunch or doing other things that took you 20 minutes; is that correct?  What were you doing there for 20 minutes?
A.	It was during the break.  I was buying a snack or eating or telephoning.
Q.	Was Mika also on break at this time, sir, do you know?  Was he having a lunch break as well, sir?
A.	I didn't know his schedule, but I saw him in the store.  But he was not there all the time.
Q.	We're still talking about the second time on the 13th at lunchtime, midday, as you say.  Now, when you saw him for 20 minutes, what was he doing on that day, sir, at that particular time?  What did you see him doing?
A.	He was talking with people inside the store and he was drinking a sweet drink; the others were drinking beer, and the others were eating roasted meat.
Q.	I see.  Around about how many people were with him in the store at this time, about 10, 15, 20?
A.	There were three, four or five people.
Q.	All men, perhaps? 
A.	There were women sometimes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you go inside the shop? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I went into the store.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are only being asked about the 13th, second time, so don't tell us there are women sometimes.  That incident, that second time where -- was Mika with all men, all women or mixed men and women?  That's what we're asking you on the 13th, midday, lunch break. 
THE WITNESS:
It was not only people of one sex who used to go into the store.  People of either sex could go in there. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm not asking you who could go in there.  I'm asking you -- you have said that Mika was with other people:  Some were drinking beer; some were eating roasted meet, and Mika was drinking sweet drink.  Those with him at that time, sometime during lunch break, after 12 midday, those ones, were they men, were they women or were they both men and women?  That's the question I am asking you. 
THE WITNESS:
It was men and women, and often it was teachers of a school of Gishyita.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Very well.  Now, the --
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, what makes you remember the kind of drink that Mika was having on that day?  What makes you remember that he was having soft drinks whilst other people were drinking beer? 
THE WITNESS:
I say this because I know that he did not drink alcohol. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You know he does not drink alcohol.  How did you get to know that? 

THE WITNESS:
From the time I knew him in my childhood, I knew -- I know that he had a store, and for five years I never saw him drink alcohol.  I thought therefore that he didn't drink alcohol because I had never seen him do that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, go on, please.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's talk about the last time -- in the evening now, still on the 13th.  We're still on the 13th of May.  You saw him again in the evening.  Can you remind us of the location, near some shop as well?
A.	It was in the same store.
Q.	And was he again drinking --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, I thought you said earlier that that was in a different store.  Sorry.  That's right.  Another -- sorry, Witness.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Witness, was he again drinking Fanta with his friends when you saw him on -- in the evening? 
A.	I would like to ask the Prosecutor to repeat the question. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, actually, can you start off by telling us what time it was in the evening that you saw him?  Give us an estimate of the time you saw him. 
A.	I cannot tell you the time, but it was between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.
Q.	Four p.m., 5 p.m..  Now, how long did you see him?  How long were you with him when you saw him between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on the 13th of May, sir?
A.	I saw him for a very short while.  As I told you, I did not have an appointment with him.  I saw him in passing when I was returning home.
Q.	Very well.  We understand that, sir.  Can you help us by giving us an approximate length of time that you may have spent with him?  One minute, two minutes, 15 seconds, just to have an idea, sir. 
A.	If I said that I had spent some time with him, it would mean that I had an appointment with him.  I didn't really spend time with him.
Q.	So if you say you spent five minutes with him, would that be indicative of the amount of time you spent with him?
A.	Don't ask me that I spent some time with him.  Ask me for how long I saw him.
JUDGE SHORT:
In fairness to the witness, he did not say he spent time with Mika. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's a matter of semantics, Your Honour.

JUDGE SHORT:
Spending some time and seeing the person are two different things.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I accept that, but I also do have a strategy in cross-examining this witness and there are things I am trying to arrive at, and he is welcome to either agree or disagree with me as he sees fit, Your Honour, and he has just done that, so I take the point.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, is it your testimony that you were not with Mika but you just saw him?  That's what you say?
A.	At that time, yes.
Q.	So how could you be so sure it was him that you saw?  How far away were you from him?  You were not with him, as you say. 
A.	I know him.  He was not the only person I was looking at.  I could also see other people who were on the scene.
Q.	Very well.  And since you were not with him and you saw him, how long did you have to observe him?  Could you help us with that?  An hour, two hours, that sort of thing.
A.	I did not stay that evening for long.  I would stay for about 15 to 20 minutes and then leave again.
Q.	So is it your testimony then that for 15 minutes, even though you were not with Mika, you just happened to stand somewhere observing him and what he was doing with others for 15 minutes, or can you tell us exactly how it was that you saw him for 15 minutes, without being with him?
A.	I used to go to the centre to get a vehicle.  I could pass through it on foot as well.  So I used to pass through it, and at times I would go to greet people or to have a drink.  But I didn't stay for long to chat with people.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have been told several times in this courtroom today that we're not interested in hearing what you did in general.  I have asked you a specific question about the 13th of May between 4 and 5 p.m. when you saw you saw Mika for 15 minutes.  My question was very simple.  What were you doing for those 15 minutes when you saw him on that day at that time?
A.	I was taking a soft drink.
Q.	Were you taking the soft drink in the same place Mika was, sir, or were you across the road and could see him at a distance? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think the witness said he saw him in his store.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The witness has said many things since Thursday, Madam Witness -- Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, where did you see him on 13th evening? 

THE WITNESS:
As I stated to you, on the 13th in the evening I saw him in the shop.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Very well.  And you were in the same shop at the same time, sir?  That's what I just asked you.  You were in there? 
A.	We were together, but we did not have an appointment.  We only found ourselves in the same shop.
Q.	That's what I thought you said earlier.
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Now let's move to the 25th of May 1994.  You saw him once, did you, on that day in a shop conversing with people, didn't you, sir?  Was this the same shop or was it another shop? 
A.	I said that I saw him in the morning on the 25th in front of his house.  I did not state that I saw him in a shop.
Q.	Very well.  You probably did, actually, pardon me.  I have my notes here saying two things.  How many times did you see him on the 25th, Mr. Witness, once or twice?
A.	I saw him only once on the 25th and that was in the morning.
Q.	In front of his house?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  How long did you have to observe him that day at that time?
A.	Just a few seconds because I was just passing by.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now let's go to the 27th.  This time you saw him in the evening at Senani's shop.  It's a different shop now; is that correct?
A.	Yes, you are right.
Q.	How long did you have to observe him when you saw him in the evening on the 27th of May, sir?
A.	I saw him for about five minutes.
Q.	Do you know around about what time that was, sir, on the 27th?  Is it between 4 and 5 again?
A.	It was shortly before 6 p.m.
Q.	Thank you, sir.  Now, these are the four dates that you have told us ring a bell in your head or mind, or however you put it.  Is that correct, sir?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, can I ask you, you have testified that all the occasions that you saw Mika was because you yourself were involved in obtaining some documents from the commune office.  Is that your testimony, sir?
A.	You are right.
Q.	So help me with this.  When you saw him on the 13th and the 27th in the evening, were you also obtaining documents at those times in the evening?  The commune office was still open, sir?
A.	On the 27th, at about 6 p.m., I was returning from the préfectural office.
Q.	Very well.  Now, I forgot to ask you, on the 25th of May, you saw him for a few seconds, but at what time was that in the morning?  Can you help us with that, if you remember, sir?
A.	The time was about 9 a.m.
Q.	Nine a.m.  And this was when you were on your way to the commune office, was it, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  Now, so let me ask you the following, and I want you to listen very carefully to what I want to ask you.  It is not so much a question as opposed to a proposition.  I want to cast your mind to the 13th of April -- May, pardon me, 13th of May.  Are you with me, Mr. Witness?
A.	I am with you.
Q.	Now listen.  Is it your testimony, and would I be correct in saying, that apart from seeing Mika on the 13th of May for 15 seconds sometime around nine o' clock in the morning, 20 minutes sometime around midday and another 15 minutes between 4 and 5 p.m. on that day, you did not see him at any other time on the 13th of May 1994?  Would that be a reasonable assumption or conclusion following your testimony in this court today, sir?
A.	Please, Prosecutor, I would like you to put that question to me again.
Q.	Certainly.  Would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that following your testimony in this court on Thursday and this morning, would it be accurate to summarise your testimony as follows, as far as the 13th of May is concerned:  That apart from the 15 seconds that you claim to have seen Mika on the morning of the 13th of May at nine o' clock and the 20 minutes that you saw him at midday drinking a Fanta in a shop, and for the 15 minutes on the same day in the evening between 4 and 5 p.m., also drinking a Fanta, you did not see him at any other time on that day.  Would that be a reasonable conclusion on your testimony, sir; yes or no?
A.	You would be right.
Q.	In the same vein, would I also be correct in saying that on the 25th of May, 25 May 1994, apart from seeing him for a few seconds around about nine o' clock in the morning, on that day, sir, you are not able to account for his whereabouts for the remainder of the day on the 25th?  Would I be correct in saying that, sir?
A.	You would be right.
Q.	Finally, on the 27th of May 1994, would I also be correct in saying, sir, that following your testimony in this court today, apart from seeing Mika for five minutes around about 6 p.m. on that day, you are not able to tell us about his whereabouts for the remainder or the totality of the 27th, are you, sir?
A.	You would be right.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I ask you one final question, now.  How did you become a witness in this case, sir?
A.	The professor as well as his co-counsel came to meet me where I currently reside to put questions to me regarding the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  They questioned me regarding 
Mika Muhimana, asking me whether I knew anything about those issues, and I answered those questions.  They asked me whether I would be ready to come and testify at this Tribunal, and I accepted to do so.  Those were the circumstances under which I accepted to come and give evidence in this case.
Q.	Did you at the time then also inform them that you had seen Mika on at least 15 occasions between the dates of May, May and June of 1994, sir, when you had that meeting with them, sir?
A.	They did not put any questions to me on that subject.  They wrote down the questions and answers that were dealt with during my interview, but no questions were put to me on that subject.
Q.	Did the question and answers include questions such as, "Did you see Mika Muhimana at all during the three months of the genocide 1994?  Did you see him at all even having a beer?"  Did they ask you those sorts of questions, sir?
A.	They did not specify the days.  All they asked me was whether I saw Mika in May, and I said so and that was all.
Q.	And you on that occasion then told them that you had seen him -- you recall that you had seen him on the 9th, on the 13th, the 25th and 27th, and ten other occasions that you may not be able to recall.  Is that what you told them in those notes?
A.	No, that is not what I told them.
Q.	Can you give me an idea of what you told them, sir?
A.	They asked me whether I knew Mika Muhimana and I said yes.  They asked me whether I saw him in May and I also said yes.  They then asked me what were the events that occurred where I was residing after President Habyarimana's death.  Those were by and large the questions put to me.
Q.	But you haven't told us very much about the events in your neighbourhood after the president's death.  Rather, you've told us about specific dates where you saw Mika.  So are you telling me that you never discussed these dates and events with anyone before you came to the court on Thursday?
A.	With no one.
Q.	In fact, isn't it correct to say that in fact the Defence counsel in this case never even spoke to you about those events that you were going to testify about, isn't it, sir?  He didn't, did he?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Yes, I thought so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, is it your evidence that you never saw Mika in April 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
I never saw him.  Did you say in the month of April? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
April. 
THE WITNESS:
No.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to have a document placed before you.  

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Document No. 1, Your Honours, is what I am referring to.  

Just give him document No. 1.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, do you recognise the name on that document?  Please don't speak the name out.  Please just tell me whether you know the name or not.
A.	I recognise this name.
Q.	Do you have any blood relationship with that person in document No. 1, sir?
A.	Yes, I am related to this person.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that the person in that document is indeed your brother?
A.	You would be right.
Q.	And do you know if the person in document No. 1 is employed by the Defence in this case?
A.	Yes, I know.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have document No. 2 placed in front of the witness.  

I think there is a follow-up question by Judge Short.
JUDGE SHORT:
Employed as what? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have tried to refrain asking that question because I am worried about his identity.  I hadn't rehearsed that in my mind, but if you think it is harmless, then --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Write it down. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Perhaps, Your Honour, yes, perhaps that's a better way to do it.  I am grateful for that, Your Honours. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Can you write down on a piece of paper, Mr. Witness, the nature of the -- the nature of the person listed on document No. 1's employment in the **************** 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'm going to bite the bullet and ask a direct question. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that the person listed on document No. 1 is a **** **************** and you know him as such?
A.	Yes, you would be right in saying so. 
Q.	Thank you.  Have you seen document No. 2, sir?
A.	Yes, I have it.
Q.	Do you know the person listed in document No. 2, sir?
A.	I know the person.
Q.	How do you know the person, sir?
A.	Our parents are the same.
Q.	In other words, she's your sister, is she not, sir?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is the person on document No. 2 related to the person in document No. 1, sir?
A.	Yes, they are related. 
Q.	Following on from your testimony earlier on, would I be correct in saying that they are brother and sister?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you know if the person in document No. 2 has had any involvement in this case in any capacity whatsoever?  And if so, can you tell us what that involvement has been?
A.	I have no idea.
Q.	I see.  Mr. Witness, I thank you for your -- for answering my questions this morning. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the document back from the witness, please.  

Your Honours, can I enter document No. 1 as the next Prosecution exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document No. 1 is entered as Exhibit P. 83, and document No. 2 is entered as Exhibit P. 84, both documents to be kept under seal. 
	(Exhibit No P. 83 admitted, under seal)
	(Exhibit No P. 84 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Can I just state for the record that the person on document No. 2 is also known in this case as TQ7.  Tango, Quebec, seven.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
TQ7.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
TQ7, Tango, Quebec, seven.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
I have no questions in re-examination, Madam President.  And I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, are you related to Mr. Muhimana?
THE WITNESS:
No, we are not related in any way.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Remember, you told us that the last time you saw him was before 1994.  The last time you had seen him was 1989.  You remember that?
THE WITNESS:
I remember that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where did you see him in 1989? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw him ************** where I was working.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
At ************** where you were working.  And have you got any specific reason why you remember a 1989 encounter with Mr. Muhimana at ************ where you were working?
THE WITNESS:
No particular reasons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did he come to do at ***********? 
THE WITNESS:
He came for ************.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
************ him? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you talk to him?
THE WITNESS:
No.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you have -- did you actually meet him or you just saw him? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw him.  By the way, he did not come to *************** only once.  He came on different occasions, but I don't remember the exact number of times.  But the last time I saw him I did not talk to him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you talk to him on any other occasions when he came in 1989?
THE WITNESS:
At times I would greet him, just as I greeted everyone I knew. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You did nothing else but greet him.  You said hello to him and he went; is that what you are saying? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I am saying.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you are able to remember that that is in 1989 and not '87 and not '88 and not '90 and not '92 and not '83? 
THE WITNESS:
That is what I recall.  I recall that it was in 1989.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you have reason for recalling '89? 
THE WITNESS:
I have a reason because I left that place of work in 1989.  I had worked there for only six months. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, you also testify that you had known Mika since childhood, while you were in primary school; is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That's correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
What capacity did you get to know him when you were in primary school?  How did you get to know him while you were in primary school?
THE WITNESS:
He was running a shop and he was a trader, and he was one of the influential traders in our area.  I used to go to his shop, therefore, to buy sweets.  Those are the circumstances under which I got to know him. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please call in the next witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, can I just seek some clarification from my learned friend from the Defence in relation to the witnesses he's producing today.  We have a certain list and we just want to confirm that it's in that order.  Can he confirm that the witnesses are going to be DY, AH8, AH7 and AR1, in that order, so we know.  I am grateful. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, after the witness that has just appeared, plans are that we call DY, AH7, AH8, AR2, DH, GS, DU, and finally the Accused himself.  

I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to point out that, following what I have been informed of, AH7 has already appeared in the Ntakirutimana case, and his pseudonym was 9.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, apart from this witness, there are seven witnesses remaining? 
MR. SONGA:
Those are the last witnesses, Madam President.
	(Witness ushered in)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to point out that the order I have -- the order of appearance I have just presented was decided following consultations with Mr. Constant, who expressed a wish that we should, as much as possible, stay within the time that we still have at our disposal and that we try not to call further witnesses.  Otherwise, there are, I think, three that we are ready not to call to appear in the event that the Chamber would want to stick to its judicial calendar.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, that decision is yours and do not use either Constant or the Court as an excuse for not calling any particular witness.  All right?  I hope you appreciate that. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let the record reflect, Professor, that this Chamber has not -- has not stopped you from calling the witnesses.  I want to be absolutely clear, because your responsibility is to...(overlapping microphones)
MR. SONGA:
In that case, Madam President, we would like it to be on record that we are not going to leave witnesses that we would like to call on, you know, not appearing, that we would like to call all the witness that we wish to call.  

I wonder if my last statement was translated.  For the Chamber, what I was saying was that I wanted to ensure that I collaborate with the Chamber.  Otherwise, if the Chamber thinks otherwise, then I will call all those that I had intended to call in addition to those I have on the list that I have given.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, we are not asking you to call witnesses if in your own judgement you think it is not necessary to call them.  We're not asking you to call witnesses who you didn't need to call, but at the same time, the Court is not stopping you from calling witnesses who you think you need to call, in the best interest of your client.  So you have to make that judgement.  But we're not asking you to call all your witnesses if you don't think some of them are necessary.  Do you understand?  You have to make that judgement.  But you don't have to call witnesses, for example, if you think some of the witnesses are coming --
MR. SONGA:
I understand you, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
(Overlapping microphones)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We would like you, Professor -- for you to feel like you are not under pressure from the Chamber to reduce your witnesses.  We do not want you to say, "I might have defended Mr. Muhimana better if the Chamber would let me call all my witnesses."  That's what we would like the record to reflect.  It is your judgement that you don't need the witnesses you are not calling.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would also like to inform you that we would not like to hear the (unintelligible) witnesses. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I had explained to you the mindset in which I accepted to make a number of reductions, but then you have just told me that the Defence should not rely on the decision of the Chamber to reduce its list.  And that is why I wanted it to be understood, Madam President, I was doing this in order to be collaborative. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, call all the witnesses you need to call, Professor, and go on defending your client. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and to protect your identity, you will be referred to as Witness DY in the court proceedings today.  You also make sure that your identity is not disclosed.  Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth.  

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
	(Declaration made by Witness DY in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you have a document before you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there's a document that has just been placed before me on the table.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the contents of the document? 
THE WITNESS:
I attended primary school only up to the second year, so I can't read very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness with the translation of this protected information sheet.

WITNESS DY,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	We are going to ask you some questions in respect of the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  Do you confirm that those events occurred while you were at the address that we have in the sheet detailing your particulars?
A.	Yes, I was at that address, but I would like to request that you give me leave to witness (sic) in closed session because I am not very sure about my security.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when you need to go into closed session, just raise your hand and we'll go into closed session.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Your counsel would tell us when he would ask you questions which might reveal your identity, and when he does, we will then go to closed session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learned of his death during the week in which he died.  I heard about this over the radio.
Q.	Do you recall the date of the announcement, Witness?
A.	I don't recall the dates, but the month.  It has been a while ago, and I have forgotten some details.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In April 1994, can you at least tell us what was the security situation in your secteur?
A.	During that period, well, I was a farmer.  I stayed at home, but during the week in which Habyarimana died, I did not go anywhere.  I was doing some chores in the house, and people came and told me what was happening here and there, but I wasn't keen to learn what was happening in the secteur.
Q.	And what did they tell you what was happening?
A.	There is a member of the cellule committee, whom I heard saying that President Habyarimana had been shot down.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	No, he didn't tell me, but it was said that he might have been -- his plane might have been shot down when he was returning from a meeting in Arusha.
Q.	Did -- can you tell us --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can we ask the Defence lawyer to repeat his statement, please?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you tell us which ethnic groups were in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	There were Twa, the Tutsis and the Hutu.
Q.	Were they living in harmony following or after the president's death?
A.	They continued to live in harmony, but four days after the death of the president, there was fighting between the Hutu and Tutsi.
Q.	Can you remember where?
A.	I knew about a certain fighting where I participated, but I participated by -- I was compelled to take part in the fighting.
Q.	So, the fighting in which you took part, where was that?
A.	The fighting took place in the Karora cellule in the Mara at the Murangara cellule in the Gishyita commune.
Q.	You were witness to the fighting that you have just mentioned?
A.	I was an eyewitness to the fighting.  And besides, I explained this to the person who wrote this down concerning people who were killed in the fighting.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were an eyewitness or you were a participant?
THE WITNESS:
Since I had been coerced into fighting in the attacks, it is obvious that I participated in the battles.  I was told that the Tutsi had to be killed, and when I came to the location, I did not kill Tutsi, but I was a witness to what was happening.  I saw people who killed Tutsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You participated in which attacks?
THE WITNESS:
I participated in the attack of Karora, in the Mara secteur, in the Murangara secteur.  Murangara and Mara are bordering secteurs, or neighbouring secteurs.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know a location called Bisesero?
A.	Yes, I know that place because I even took part in some of the attacks that were launched against Bisesero.
Q.	Can you remember during which period the Bisesero attacks took place?
A.	Since I went to Bisesero thrice, I can say that the main -- the major attack that led to the killing of many people is the one that took place on the 13th of May 1994.  Otherwise, I can't remember the dates on which the other attacks took place.
Q.	And what happened on the 13th of May you are referring to?
A.	There was a major attack and that is why I can't forget the date on which it took place.  And during that attack, very many people were killed in Muyira in Bisesero.
Q.	You say that you did participate.  I didn't quite understand.
A.	Yes, but before that attack, I had participated in other attacks wherein people were not killed, but I can't forget that attack because it led to the death of many people.
Q.	How many of you assailants were there?
A.	There were many people.
Q.	Do you remember some of them?
A.	I remember, for instance, the people who had gone there from my place with me.  I know them.  There are also people of Gishyita that I saw and that I know.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber about the few names that you retained amongst the assailants?
A.	I have requested to answer certain questions in closed session, because for me, it's not good for me to give the names of those people in an open session, because those people have very influential people that are their relatives, which is why I would like to give the names in closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, arrange for closed session.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning.
     (Pages 41 to 42 by Haruna Farage)






























	1225H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	We'll put a few questions to you regarding the events in Rwanda in 1994.  Witness, how did you learn of President Habyarimana's death?
A.	I learnt of it on the 7th in the morning.
Q.	How did you spend the 7th?
A.	That day was a particular day because everybody was wondering what was going to happen.
Q.	And what was the security situation like in your secteur?
A.	The security situation did not improve.  It instead wasn't from the 7th onwards.
Q.	When you state that it wasn't, can you recall exactly what happened?
A.	After the 7th, there were movements of people leaving their homes and heading to the Mugonero complex while others headed for the hilltops in Murambi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Murambi is spelled as follows:  M-U-R-A-M-B-I.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you know Mika Muhimana in April 1994?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	For how long had you known him?
A.	I had known him as conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Did you see him during the events of 1994?
A.	I did not see him.
Q.	Witness, I will show you some names, and you will tell us whether you know the person bearing that name.  Do you know a person named Joy Mukasine?
A.	I know that person.
Q.	Can you tell us who that person was?
A.	At the point in time, she was my nursing aide teacher in Mugonero in 1993.  Thereafter, that person stopped working to go and further her studies at the national university.  In 1994, she was a student.
Q.	Could you please tell us where she was studying?
A.	She was studying at Butare national university.
Q.	Can you tell us whether she was still in Butare in April?
A.	Let me explain things to you.
Q.	Please go ahead.
A.	In 1994, she was not in our region.  Her brother arrived in May of 1994.  I would rather say 1995. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Since my father was a friend to her father, she talked to my father, and my father asked her whether she had any news of members of the family and explained that his brother was in Butare where his father's junior brother was.  He also told us that the junior brother had survived but that he did not know where the other members of the family were.  
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you.  In April 1994, did you know a person called Josiane?
A.	I knew her.
Q.	Can you talk to us about her?
A.	Regarding Josiane, I will tell you that she was the daughter of Amos Karera who used to live at Kanyinya in the Uwuingabo cellule, Gishyita secteur.  She was a teacher in the primary school of Ishya in Ngoma secteur.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Ishya is spelled I-S-H-Y-A; Kanyinya is spelled K-A-N-Y-I-N-Y-A; Uwuingabo is spelled 
      U-W-U-I-N-G-A-B-O, Uwuingabo.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you hear about her in April 1994?  
A.	No.
Q.	Was she in her place of residence?
A.	I cannot explain this to you because I did not see her during that period.  I wouldn't know.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know a person called Eugenie?
A.	Yes, I know her.
Q.	Can you tell us what she was doing in April 1994?
A.	I can't know since she was not in our region or area, Ngoma.
Q.	Did you know where she was?  
A.	I heard people say that she was residing in Kigali, but I cannot tell you the neighbourhood in which she was or what she was doing in Kigali.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us when you left your area?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please carry on.
A.	I left our area in 1995, towards the end of March.
Q.	Up until 1995, can we take it that you did not leave your area?
A.	In July, I left that region and went right to Cyangugu. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What year?
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
In July 1994, but I left that region to come back to our home.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the name of this witness is not given on the list filed by you.  Where is the summary of this witness?
MR. SONGA:
The witness I am leading in evidence, Madam President, is No. 37 on our list, and his pseudonym is AH7.  We are going to verify, but I think the summary of facts is in the document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you say 37?
MR. SONGA:
That's correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thirty-seven is TQ14. 
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour, I would like to invite you to verify this.  When I talk of a No. 37, I'm referring to the list that we tendered with the title "Order of Appearance of the Witnesses," of defence witnesses, so on that list this witness is a witness No. 37 and it bears the pseudonym AH7.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where is the summary, Professor, the summary of this witness?
MR. SONGA:
The summary of the facts appear on the document of 8 July 2004, entitled "The Final List of Defence Witnesses."  That is on No. 7.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we don't see this witness's name on the list provided by you on the 18th of June 2004, and we didn't receive any other list.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, what I'm saying is the following:  In the document of 8 July, which only gave the pseudonyms, it is the witness AH7 with his summary statements, and I'm saying that in the document entitled "The Order of Appearance of Defence Witnesses," it is AH7 and it is on No. 37 and this details his name, his full name.  Probably there are problems in identifying the document of 8th of July, but I think we can give you the references.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have not provided us with the summary, the summary of his statement?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  We have the documents here with us.  It is a document that was recorded in the case management section, in the registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we are not in possession of this document.
Give it to the Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Then I don't know.  I think the administration of the Chamber should explain, because we did tender it and it shows all the indications that we gave it in.  It was duly registered and provided with or assigned a serial number. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have the document of 9 July?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, but we don't have it in English.  I don't think it was ever translated, but we do have the French.  Maybe it was not translated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, go on.  
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if someone were to tell you -- to say that Joy Mukasine was in Ngoma in April 1994, how would you react?
A.	I wouldn't accept that since I didn't see her there, so I can't confirm that.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know -- you will allow me to take you backwards because that wasn't what you said regarding Eugenie.  Can you tell us, Eugenie, who was she?
A.	You are going to -- forgive me, but I'm going to use a term -- she is Josiane's sister.  I cannot say if she is her older sister or her younger sister.  So she is a Karera, Amos's daughter as well.
Q.	Witness, did you know the Mugonero hospital in 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you learn that it was attacked in April 1994?
A.	Yes, I learned of that.
Q.	Can you talk to us about that attack?  Who are those who attacked Mugonero?
A.	Many people were assembled at the Mugonero complex.  And in Ngoma, there were people of bad conduct and who were always arrested and detained and who at every turn would want to loot other people's property, and they looted the property in Ngoma, and then they went to Mugonero, where they looted everything and killed people and then went away with the looted goods.
Q.	Did you learn that during the events of April, women were raped in the Mugonero hospital?
A.	I never learned of this, and I cannot confirm it.  Besides, before 1994 or thereafter, I never learned that there were cases of raping in our locality.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to send you a sheet of paper on which you will find a name, and you will tell me if you know that person or not.

MR. SONGA:
Was the name shown to the Judge and the Prosecutor, to the Judges and the Prosecutor? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you see -- have you seen the name of the person?
A.	Yes, I've seen it.
Q.	In 1994, did you know that person?
A.	I knew the person.
Q.	Did you also know where she lived in April 1994?
A.	Yes, I knew where she was living.
Q.	Can you also tell us how the person survived the events?
A.	I can tell you of the circumstances under which this person survived the events because we talked about this.  She told us that in April 1994, she had an uncle who -- he had an uncle who lived around Murambi, high up in the mountains, and they went there to lead their flock to pasture, and she went ----- and he went and stayed there, and those are the circumstances in which he survived the events.  And besides, around May 1995, I was with that person, and the person told me that he or she was in the Murambi hills and was using or utilised certain strategies.  You will excuse me for using this term, but this person used to wear banana leaves and armed his or herself -- him or herself with a machete and would pretend to be an Interahamwe.  That is what this person told me. 
Q.	Now, if someone were to tell you that he had taken refuge in the Mugonero hospital, how would you react?
A.	Whoever would say so, if I have to go by what the person told me, since I was witness to what the person told me, of course I will not accept such a statement.
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, Witness.  I am going to send you another sheet of paper, and you are going to tell us if you know the person whose name would be on it.
Q.	Witness, have you read the name on the sheet of paper?
A.	Yes, I have read it.
Q.	Did you know that person in April 1994?
A.	Yes, I knew the person.
Q.	How did you know the person?
A.	I knew where the person was living and knew the name of his or her father, and she was our neighbour.
Q.	Do you know how the person survived the events of April, May and June 1994 in Rwanda?
A.	I can tell you.  There is a difference between the circumstances of that person and those of the other.  I know that she was residing in the Murambi hills, but she didn't tell me how she survived the events.  I think I can end here.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.

Mr. Witness, now you will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor on your right.  Please understand the questions and answer them briefly.

	Professor, you don't wish to enter those two documents that you showed the witness?
MR. SONGA:
That is correct.  Madam President, Your Honour, thank you for reminding me of this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first name shown to the witness is entered as Exhibit D. 87, under seal.  And the second document with the name shown to the witness is entered as Exhibit D. 88, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 87 admitted, under seal)  
(Exhibit No. D. 88 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, or is it morning, Witness?
MR. SONGA:
It is afternoon.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Prosecutor.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you testified as a defence witness in the Ntakirutimana case; did you not?
A.	I never said so.
Q.	Yeah, you didn't say that, but I'm asking you whether you testified for Dr. Gérard and Pastor Ntakirutimana in the Ntakirutimana case on the 29th of April 2002?
A.	That is true.  But that question is different from the first one.
Q.	Now, did you say in that case that between the 14th of April and the 30th of April, you were********** *********************** your father's ************** close to or in your area of residence?
A.	I stated so.
Q.	Did you also say that for almost the entire month of April, you were also ******************************** *********?
A.	I so stated.
Q.	Now, on the 19th or the 16th of April 1994, you were not at Mugonero hospital, were you?
A.	Can you please repeat your question, in particular, regarding the year that you mentioned?
Q.	I'm talking about the 16th of April '94.  Were you at Mugonero hospital?
A.	No, I wasn't there.
Q.	Was there a time in April, between the 16th of April and the 30th of April, that you visited Mugonero hospital?
A.	Are you talking of the 16th?  I want to be sure of the date.  I want to be certain about the date.  I didn't quite understand.
Q.	I asked you the dates between the 16th of April and the 30th of April.  Did you at any time visit the Mugonero hospital, the Mugonero complex?
A.	At a certain point, I went to the Mugonero hospital, but I cannot recall the date, but it was between the two periods, between the two dates.
Q.	Could it have been a day or two, that is on the 17th or 18th or 19th, following the attack on the 16th?
A.	I don't recall the dates, but all I know is that I went there.
Q.	Could it have been -- okay.  How long?  Can you tell us approximately how many days following the attack on the hospital?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The attack on the 16th of April?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, sir.
THE WITNESS:
I cannot give you the exact date.  I can't say exactly on what date it was.  I don't recall it.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right.  In Ntakirutimana you say it was around the 18th -- the 18th or 19th.  Do you maintain that that was your testimony in Ntakirutimana?
A.	If that date is recorded somewhere, that will be the truth, but I don't quite remember.
Q.	Now, my main question is, when you visited that area around those dates, the 18th or 19th, did you find any dead bodies at the hospital?
A.	Yes, I found dead bodies there.  I remember having found two bodies where I passed by.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it an appropriate time to take the lunch break?
MR. KAPAYA:
I think I don't have very long --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, then you can continue.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	What was the response, Mr. Witness?
A.	I testified to having seen two corpses on my way.
Q.	Did you go around the hospital buildings, in the church, the Mugonero hospital and in the administration block?  Did you enter those places?  
A.	No, I didn't go to all those places.  
Q.	Now, when the attack was taking place on the 16th, how far were you from the Mugonero hospital?
A.	I was at a distance that could be covered in 15 minutes.
Q.	Could you see people going to attack the hospital, or did you hear them say anything?
A.	After a certain amount of time, I saw people dispersing here and there, but I did not see those who were going towards the hospital.  Rather, I saw those who were returning from the hospital after some time.
Q.	Did you see motor vehicles, for instance, going towards the hospital, carrying  people?  
A.	No, I did not see vehicles.
Q.	Now, you were shown the names of -- you were shown names of three people, three women:  Joy, Josiane and Eugenie.  Were you living in one cellule with these people in April '94?
A.	No.
Q.	How far was your residence from their residences?
A.	Their residences were at a distance that could be covered in 30 minutes trekking.
Q.	Now, you were also shown names of two men.  As regards the first man, you say that he told you how he escaped the 1994 genocide, which you refer to as the 1994 events.  You testified to that, did you not?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Are you aware that this person has testified in -- are you aware that this person gave evidence in this case?
A.	I am not aware.
Q.	Are you aware that this person gave evidence in the Ntakirutimana case?
A.	I am not aware either.
Q.	Are you aware that that person gave evidence in the Kayishema and Ruzindana case?
A.	I'm not aware either.
Q.	And that that person had maintained throughout that he was at the Mugonero hospital and in the Bisesero area during the events of April, May, June '94?
A.	I haven't understood your question.  See, you are making a statement.
Q.	Yes, I'm making a proposition, actually, that this guy had maintained throughout the three or four trials that he was at Mugonero and he was in the Bisesero area in April 1994, contrary to what you have testified here.  You have nothing to say to that proposition?
A.	There is nothing I can say on that.
Q.	That is all I have.  Thank you very much.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, re-examination?
MR. SONGA:
I don't have any, Madam President.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, in 1994, you were 17 years old; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did you have any reason to know the whereabouts of those two people's names you were shown?
THE WITNESS:
There was no reason for me to know where those people were because I didn't go about with them, but if I have to refer to the discussion that I had with them, I can say that -- I can say something about it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What about the three women?  Did you have any reason to know, to watch where they were or where they were living?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was the reason?
THE WITNESS:
There's a reason that makes me know where they were.  I believe it would be better for you to ask me a question on an individual, on a person, one after the other, and then I can give you explanations on each of the persons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were told the names of three women.  I can't remember what their names are.  One is Joy Mukasine.  Did you have any particular reason to know where Joy was?
THE WITNESS:
I can say that I knew for sure where Joy Mukasine was, and the first reason is as follows:  First, she ****************************************************************************************.  She told us goodbye because she said she was going to pursue studies in the university.  That is the first reason.  Secondly --

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What I'm asking you is not whether she was at the university or not.  It's just whether you had any reason to know what happened to her or where she went in April of 1994, whether she stayed at the university or went to Butare or went to Kenya or went to Australia or went to Gishyita.  Do you have any reason to know, to track down her movements?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Joy Mukasine, as I said, there was a particular reason because her brother met my father.  I don't know if I can give his name.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't give his name.  The reason is because her brother met your father.  That's the reason?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And Josiane, do you have any reason to know where or what she was doing?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the reason?
THE WITNESS:
This is the person who used to live in our area.  She undertook her studies not far from our residence.  I used to meet her every morning, and besides, I knew in which school the person was working.  I was on holidays.  I therefore can confirm that she was at home because I used to move around in the vicinity of the house. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You met her every day when you went to **********************?
THE WITNESS:
I didn't ********************every day.  It is in 1994 that I ********************, and that person wasn't doing the same.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you meet her then every day that you were going to******?  That is what I'm asking you.
THE WITNESS:
I did not see her every day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What about Eugenie?
THE WITNESS:
Regarding Eugenie, there is a particular reason because she went to Esapan.  In the past, she failed her exams and her father wasn't convinced that she had failed, and her father went to petition the school and asked the --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking --
THE WITNESS:
-- the préfecture judge of studies to give him the result slips --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm not asking you about the result slips or about whether she flunked the exams or any of those things.  I'm asking you, did you have any reason to trace her movements in April of 1994?  Is there anything that would have made you the person to trace her movements?
THE WITNESS:
In April 1994, that person was not in Mugonero.  It was known that she wasn't in Mugonero.  Everybody used to see her because I knew the children of her family; we had grown up in the same area, and it was obvious that the person wasn't there.  So there was no special reason for me to track her movements, but for -- it had been a while that she wasn't seen in the area.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But you yourself had no cause to know where she was or wasn't? 
THE WITNESS:
In any case, there are things that are obvious.  If a person says that the Tribunal has its headquarters in Arusha, the people who will say so -- there are people that will confirm this because either they have heard it over the radio because not -- just about anything is said over the radio, so that person can confirm that the Tribunal is headquartered in Arusha.  This is testimony that somebody can give because either he heard it over the radio or because he heard people say that.  This is something that is of common knowledge without necessarily having had to be on the spot or in the location.  A person can say that the Tribunal is based in Arusha without having been to Tanzania.  That is how I can say things about Eugenie.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are not answering my question, Mr. Witness, and I'm asking a very simple question.  You, a 
17-year-old youngster, who was looking **********************, would you have a reason for knowing where Eugenie, or any other girl at that time in age, how they were spending their days in April 1994?  That is all I'm asking.  Did you have any reason?  There's no likelihood that the radio was broadcasting where Eugenie is residing or staying in Arusha so that you would know by radio.  I'm asking whether you know, if you had any reason to track her down so that you can now remember 10 years later where you had seen her.
(Pages 43 to 53 by Leslie Todd)




	1315H
THE WITNESS:
If -- I think we understand each other well.  I have said that Eugenia used to live in Kigali.  I don't know what she was doing.  I haven't said that I knew what that person was doing, but I'm telling you that she was residing in Kigali.  When she failed her studies, she went to Kigali.  I don't see what is surprising about this.  Well -- but if I had to say that I knew all that she was doing, I would be saying too much.  I've heard people mention this; I didn't go with her to Kigali.  I even told you that I didn't even know the neighbourhood in which she was residing in Kigali.  So, once again, I think we should reach an understanding.  I didn't -- during that entire period, I didn't spend all my time **************** ************************ only for some time.  I was a student.  I used to pass by their residence.  I knew her father and her mother.  I don't think there is anything surprising about this.  I even knew where some of her brothers and sisters were. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, the question you are being asked is this:  This person who was -- who you say was now living in Kigali, if this person came to Mugonero on a particular day in April, you wouldn't know, would you?  Let's say that person came on the 10th, 12th, 13th, 14th or 15th, you would not be in a position to know on any specific date that that person left Kigali and came to Mugonero, or any other place in Gishyita, would you? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I am going to explain a bit.  In 1994, without losing sight of what happened in Rwanda, it was difficult for a person who was in Kigali to leave Kigali and come to Ngoma.  I know, first of all, that there are Hutu who didn't have any problems, who were in Kibuye, who couldn't leave Kibuye, and who remained in Kibuye throughout months and months.  So if -- I'm told that somebody left Kigali to come to Mugonero and I said this wasn't -- isn't true, well, I think it wouldn't be surprising, if somebody says he can't bear testimony to that.
JUDGE SHORT:
If you knew somebody who was in Butare, and that person on a specific date in April came to Mugonero, you wouldn't know, would you?    
THE WITNESS:
In that respect, I will also give you an answer.  Butare is at quite a distance from Mugonero, and there were no vehicles that were moving about.  The situation was difficult.  If I say that I don't know about this and that I can't testify to this, I think the person who will say the contrary would have his or her reasons for saying so.  But what I would like to say is that those who were in Kibuye could not move from Kibuye right up to Mugonero.  Those people stayed in Kibuye.  I think it is clear.
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you saying that it was impossible during April for people to move around, let's say, from Kigali to Mugonero or from Butare -- it was impossible -- and that is the basis for your saying that these people could not have been in Mugonero on those dates?
THE WITNESS:
This is the basis of my testimony.  Before that date, I never saw them.  In addition -- now, listen, I'm not going to dwell on this.  It was difficult that you leave a distant area like Kigali, but I can't say that this was impossible.  People probably had their means.  But you must admit that it was difficult, and I will limit myself to the fact that it was difficult for somebody to leave Kigali, Butare, to come to Mugonero, and I think I can testify to that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony.  Have a safe journey.  Thank you.

testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to put questions to you relating to the events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  Do you remember the manner in which you learned of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Can you tell the Court? 
A.	I learned of the death of President Habyarimana on the national radio when I was in our home.
Q.	How long after the event was this? 
A.	I heard of it on the same night.
Q.	How did you spend the day following the death of president? 
A.	We stayed at home, my family and I, because it was disturbing news that made us feel sad.
Q.	What was the security situation in your secteur? 
A.	During the first days, there were no problems.  We stayed at home, as we were asked to.
Q.	How did the situation change? 
A.	About a week later, or a week and a few days later, we heard gunshots and shells being fired by rifles or heavy weaponry.  There were people who came from Gisenyi; I would say criminals.  They had come to look for people to kill. 
Q.	Did they find them?
A.	Yes.  Some of our neighbours who had gone to seek refuge in the high mountains.  There were other people, for example, a Tutsi woman, who was our neighbour, married to a Hutu; she was killed.  And we went to appeal to the conseiller to come and see what had happened and to arrest the criminals, if necessary.  When the conseiller came, they went around him and they went and killed his wife because he was a Tutsi -- she was a Tutsi.
Q.	Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Which conseiller are you talking about?  What's his name? 
THE WITNESS:
The conseiller of our secteur was called *********************************8 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in April 1994, did you know a person called Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes.  I knew him; and even before that, I knew him.
Q.	How did you know him? 
A.	I knew him before as a trader.  Afterwards, he became the conseiller of the commune or secteur.
Q.	Did you know his family?
A.	I knew his wife.  She was a teacher.
Q.	Did you know what ethnic group his wife belonged to?
A.	Yes.  She was a Tutsi.
Q.	During the month of April 1994, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Do you remember how many times you may have seen him in April 1994? 
A.	I saw him on many occasions.
Q.	What were these occasions that enabled -- opportunities that enabled you to see him on several occasions? 
A.	This is why I used to see him often.  Before the war, I was ***********.  I also had a brother who was a trader.  He had various goods on sale in his shop.  But at the outset of the war, all activities were suspended.  But at some point, traders had to open their -- reopen their shops, and so we resumed our trade.  So it is in this context that my brother called on me to help him in his trade.  And we used to use the road that passed in front of Mika's house and which went on to other homes.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When was this, Mr. Witness?  When did your brother call you to help him in his trade? 
THE WITNESS:
It was one week after the death of President Habyarimana.  So my brother had to reopen his shop.  So when he went to open his shop, I went with him.  People needed to buy supplies, and so we resumed our work.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
This was the week when the trouble started in your area; is this correct?  Is that what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  It was one week after the death of President Habyarimana, after the aircraft that was carrying the president was shot down.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You said in your evidence earlier on, Mr. Witness, that at first there was no problem in your area, but after some days, the problem started and people -- criminals came from Gisenyi looking for people to kill.  Remember that? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that would be in the week you are opening trade, resuming trading, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that during the first week, there was security, there were no problems.  However, people could not move about.  One week later, we were asked to reopen the shops, and this is when we began to trade, and it is during this period that the criminals began to commit crimes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So it is after one week that the criminals began to commit crimes; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Let's say a week and some days.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
A week and some days.  And when were you -- when did you open trade? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that we resumed trade one week later. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you mean by "later"? 
THE WITNESS:
I said after seven days. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you are ***************************.  The president's plane was shot on the 6th of April.  At least that's what the other witnesses have said.  Are you saying one week later, the problem started about what date? 
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the date.  I am going to estimate it for you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, estimate. 
THE WITNESS:
When I say a week later, let us say -- let's take the 6th and let's add seven days.  So it would be seven days after the 6th that we resumed trade.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That would be 13th, correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did the criminals start their activities? 
THE WITNESS:
The criminals began -- or arrived, I would say, about after a week and a half. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After a week and a half.
THE WITNESS:
About a week and three or four days, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And when was it you were seeing Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw Mika when we resumed trade.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
From about the 13th of April? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, further on.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And where did you see him? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw him at his home.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
At his home.  Trading?  Was he trading? 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He was not trading? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  He wasn't trading. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you went to his home? 
THE WITNESS:
I arrived his home because my brother knew him.  This is my brother who was a trader.  And he stopped by to greet him.  I also greeted him because his residence was quite close to the shops, and we continued to ply our trade.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how many times did you see him, greet him? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to see him twice a day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Twice a day.  So on the 13th, you saw him twice a day; on the 14th, you saw him twice a day; on the 15th, you saw him twice a day; is that correct?  Is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
Every week, we could do two or three sessions -- three sessions, rather.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So every week, then, you would see him three times?  Twice or -- or twice every day, does that mean six times every week?  Is that what you're saying? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You would see him how many times a week? 
THE WITNESS:
Six times.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Six times.
THE WITNESS:
Morning and evening.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Morning and evening.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you referred to your conseiller who saw his wife being killed because she was a Tutsi.  Might we say that men who had Tutsi wives saw their wives under threat? 
A.	During this period, they were under threat. 
JUDGE SHORT:
The Professor has a smile on his face.  He knows he's asked a very leading question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's most leading.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, you know full well that was an improper question. 
MR. SONGA:
No, I did not know that, Your Honour.  I smiled because I met your gaze, and knowing how strict you can be about such matters, I expressed my fears in a smile. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Rephrase your question, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was saying that you referred to your conseiller who had seen his wife being killed.  Do you confirm that she was killed because she was a Tutsi? 
A.	I confirm it. 
Q.	Did you learn that other Tutsi women were under threat? 
A.	Yes.  I told you that we called the conseiller for help because a Tutsi woman had just been killed.  When the conseiller came to see what had happened and condemn the criminals, the criminals used this opportunity to kill his wife. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
A.	I thank you.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, these criminals, did they belong to any specific group?  These criminals who came from Gisenyi, were they members of a particular group? 
THE WITNESS:
Based on what I saw, I would say that they belonged to one ethnic group. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which one?  No, which one?  Which ethnic group would you say that they belonged to? 
THE WITNESS:
They were Hutu. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you see Mika Muhimana in May 1994? 
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell us how you saw him in May?
A.	In May, we often passed at that place during the week.  I saw him speaking with my brother, and since I was present, Mika told us that he had a problem regarding his wife and a young girl who lived under his roof, because he said that Tutsis were being hunted. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you be more precise by telling us what problem he had in regard to his wife? 
A.	Did you say "his wife"?  I didn't understand your question.
Q.	You said a while ago that Mr. Mika told you that he had a problem in regard to his wife.  So my question was whether he had told you what exactly this problem regarding his wife was. 
A.	Yes, he told us the problem.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mika didn't tell him.  Mika discussed this problem with his brother, who was a trader.  This is what he said. 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.  I shall rephrase the question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Were you able to find out what problem regarding his wife that he told your brother about? 
A.	Yes.  When they were talking, it was in my presence.  I was often with them, and I could know Mika said to my brother that people had kidnapped a young girl who lived under his roof and thus he had a problem because his wife might be killed.  I heard him with my own ears.  It is not my brother who told me.  I heard it myself.
Q.	Were you able to find out the name of the young girl who had been abducted?
A.	He told us that it was a young girl who was his wife's niece, but I don't remember the name of this young lady. 
Q.	To the best of your recollection, Mr. Witness, how many times were you able to see Mika in the month of May? 
A.	I told you that if we were to take the six times during which we passed through Gishyita, during these six times -- so I was saying that I could see Mika six times, and that on these six occasions, since we worked the entire month, up until the month of June, I would say that every month I saw him at least six times a week.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, is it your evidence that you saw Mika six times a week in April and May? 
THE WITNESS:
In the month of April, May; when we resumed trade in April, the entire month of May, and the month of June.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
From April to June, you saw Mika six times a week?  Is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, each week. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, April, where did you see him on these six occasions? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that for ************************************* ********************************** which we would ******************************************************************************************, I could see Mika in Gishyita while **********************************.  And upon our return, on our return, on our way back, since we were going to Kibuye, we would buy beer, and the ********************* would take advantage of our passage to ask us to buy them beer, and when we returned, we would deliver this beer to them.  So on my way to and on my way from, I used to see Mika.    
JUDGE SHORT:
I heard all of that.  My question is:  Where did you used to see him?  In front of his house?  In the commercial centre?  Where?  On all these six occasions, did you see him in the same place or you saw him in different places?  Could you explain exactly?
THE WITNESS:
I used to see him in various locations.  Sometimes it would be in the front of his house, in the company of his little child.  Or I would see him near the commercial stores which were close to his residence.  Or else I would see him on the crossroads, because when you go around the bend, you arrive at his residence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the age of his little child?  Can you give us his age?  Because you knew the family. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall the age of that child, but I know it was a little child you could lead by the hand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was he two years old, three years old, four, five?  
THE WITNESS:
He was aged under four. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, go on. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, in the morning, when you saw Mika Muhimana, do you remember the time, even roughly? 
A.	Since we started our activities at 7 a.m., I would say that I saw him between 9 and 10 a.m.
Q.	Would you be able to give us the same clarification with regard to the time in the evening, in the afternoon? 
A.	In the afternoon, we used to go home between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.  So it was within that period that I saw him.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief. 

Witness, I thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, what days of the week did you go to Gishyita?  What days of the week did you see him?
THE WITNESS:
If we left on Monday, we would rest on Tuesday; and if we left on Tuesday, we would rest on the Wednesday.  That is how our work was organised. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you didn't go on specific days of the week? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  After selling our wares, we used to go back home and rest for a day, to have enough time to buy the wares we had to sell the following day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And there wasn't a single day you went and didn't see him? 
THE WITNESS:
Whenever we went there, I used to see him, because my elder brother made it a point of duty to go and greet him, because they were friends and they were both traders.  So my brother used to greet him, and I myself would avail myself of that opportunity to greet him as well.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Your elder brother was a trader where? 
THE WITNESS:
My elder brother was a trader at Mugonero centre. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And every time you went, you went with your elder brother? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  We were always together. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did you walk or did you go by vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
My ***********************.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, when you saw him on the occasions that you saw him in his house, did you go inside the house or you saw him outside the house? 
THE WITNESS:
It was outside the house, on the veranda.
JUDGE SHORT:
So your evidence is that on the six occasions during the week that you saw Mika, you saw him outside, wherever you saw him?  In other words, outside his house, outside the commercial centre, or on the crossroads.  On each occasion you saw him outside in the open?  That's your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  At times I saw him in his house.  At times I saw him accompanied by his child, strolling in the commercial centre, among other traders. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, since you are very well acquainted with the family of Mr. Mika, can you tell us how many children did he have in April 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
I wouldn't say that I was very used to that family.  As you said, I knew Mika, he knew me, I knew his wife.  But I would say that he was -- he had closer ties with my elder brother.  I don't remember the exact number of children he had during that period. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you used to see him with his child, aged four years, under four; that's what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  That is what I said. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, do you remember the specific dates on which you saw him in April or in May or in June? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I cannot recall the dates.  We passed there on several occasions.  That is why I can't recall the date.  What I know is that whenever I passed that way, I used to see him, but I don't recall the dates. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your elder brother, is he living, who had close ties with Mika in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
We continued trading up to July.  The other members of the population went into exile, but we stayed on and we continued going about our commercial activities.  Later on, I got work, but my brother continued to engage in trade.  Later on, when I realised that people were being arrested, I fled into Zaire, and while in Zaire, I'd asked my brother to go with me.  He refused.  He had obtained permission from the préfet to continue trading.  Later on, I heard that he and his wife and children had been killed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right.  Please be brief in your answers to the questions asked by the Prosecutor. 


CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you did not live in Gishyita commune during April, May and June 1994?  Would I be correct in saying that? 
A.	You would be right.  I didn't live in Gishyita but I used to pass through Gishyita.
Q.	And the commune in which you lived, which is indicated in your personal identification details, is how many kilometres away from Gishyita commune, sir? 
A.	I used to live in*********** commune, which has a boundary with Gishyita commune.  From my secteur, up to the secteur where Mika was residing, was a distance of about 15 kilometres. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the witness has mentioned his secteur.  I would propose that it be expunged from the records.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he mention the name of the --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It wasn't translated. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He did.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He did, but he said -- it wasn't translated.  The translator was cautious enough not to repeat it.  So it's not on the record.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But I did hear it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the secteur mentioned will be expunged from the record. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, you said it was 15 kilometres or 15 minutes?  I'm sorry, I didn't hear your answer. 
A.	The distance was 15 kilometres.
Q.	Very well.  Now -- and your brother lived in your commune or he lived in Gishyita commune?  Where did your brother live at that time? 
A.	We lived in the same area. 
Q.	Very well.  So as you drove from********* commune to Gishyita commune, would I be correct in saying that you would have driven past the area of Bisesero?  Would you not? 
A.	No.  That is not true.  Gisovu commune shares a boundary with Lake Kivu, as well as Gishyita commune.  So there is a road leading to Cyangugu.  We usually take that road and it has nothing to do with Bisesero region.  So you can get to Gishyita without passing through Bisesero.
Q.	Very well.  Now, is it your -- would I be correct in saying, Mr. Witness, that one of the reasons why you were able to follow -- ************************************************************************************** was because ************************************************************************************************* at this time?  Were they not, sir? 
A.	No.  That is not true.  Since -- the reason why I engaged in commercial activities was the fact that my elder brother had asked me to do so for the simple reason that **************************** because of the war that was raging throughout the country.
Q.	And before the war started, is it not also true that a lot ******************************************** for the ********, before the 6th of April?  Is that not so? 
A.	Yes.  We were *************.  However, during **************, I wasn't engaging in commercial activities.  It was instead my elder brother who did so.  But after the war broke out, my brother had to call on me to give him a hand because he realised that **************** soon.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am only interested in you answering the questions that I put to you, and the question I put to you was very simple and I think you answered it.  Now, can you tell me when was it that the ************************************?  When?  Was it in March?  Was it in April?  If you recall, can you tell me when the schools actually went on vacation? 
A.	Let me try to remember.  The 6th of April was ************************************************************** the following week.  So it was towards the end of the holidays. 
Q.	And if I remember correctly, ********************************** for about three to four weeks, had they not, sir? 
A.	No.  **************** for more than two weeks.
Q.	So is it therefore your testimony, Mr. Witness, that ******************* had started around about the last week of March?  Had they not, sir? 
A.	Yes.  That is right.
Q.	Is it also the case, Mr. Witness, that the holidays were indeed nationwide?  Were they not, sir?  In other words, *******************************************************, were they not, sir, from the end of April -- from the end of --
A.	Yes.  At ****************************.  Those were *****************.
Q.	Isn't it the case also that those are ************** that you would have known, had first-hand knowledge about **************, because those were the sort ********** that you were involved in?  Is that not the case, sir? 
A.	Yes, quite.  I **************.
Q.	Now, when **********************************************, is it often the case that******* would return to their communes of origin, from their respective areas where they ****************?  It's to be expected, isn't it, sir? 
A.	Yes.  You are right.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying that you do not actually recall the particular dates when you saw or you claim to have seen Mr. Muhimana, either at his residence, at the commercial centre or at the crossroads?  You don't remember those dates, do you, sir? 
A.	You would be right in saying so, because I used to pass through there on several occasions, and I wouldn't be able to specify the dates on which I passed through that place, but if I had known that you were going to put such a question to me, I would have tried to think about the answer.  But since it's a long time ago, I can not remember the date.
Q.	So for all you know, all those dates could have been in one month, all those occasions could have been in one month, couldn't they, sir? 
A.	No.  It wasn't in one month.  I did mention April, May and June. 
Q.	I see.  Now, six times a week, when was the day -- is there a particular day in the week that you wouldn't see Mr. Mika, and if so, when was that?  In other words, did you see him Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Which of those dates did you see him on and which didn't you? 
A.	I haven't quite understood your question, Prosecutor.  You're talking of a particular day.  I don't know what you mean by a particular day. 
JUDGE SHORT:
If I understand his evidence, he said he went with his brother three times a week and he would see him on the way, when he was going, and then he would see him -- that's in the morning. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
And he would see him in the evening when they were coming back.  So that makes it six times a week.  He didn't go on specific days.  Judge Muthoga asked him whether he went on specific days of the week and he said no, that he didn't go on any specific day.  They rested on -- they went on one day, rested, went the other day.  That's my understanding of his evidence. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour is possibly -- you're probably correct, Your Honour.  I just have very brief notes here. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, can I ask you this?  Do you recall if you ever saw Mr. Muhimana on a Saturday, for example? 
A.	To tell you the truth, you're making my work very complicated.  I stated that we used to go there on one day and the next day we rested.  It is possible, but I am not in a position to specify that because we went there on several occasions. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, can I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you have your business on Saturdays? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  On Saturdays, we carried out our activities, and on Sunday as well, because in an event -- the event of we starting on a Monday, Saturday could have been a trading day.  What I recall is that we had a day of rest after every working day.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	In that case, Mr. Witness, you would agree with me that you must be the only Adventist that works on Saturdays; are you not? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness is definitely not the only one, but we don't expect every one to be working.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It would be interesting to find out what his response is, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Are you the only Adventist who works on Saturdays, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No.  I am not the only one.  I wouldn't be the only one. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You are not a hardcore Adventist, are you? 
THE WITNESS:
I agree with you.  I totally agree with you.  I am not a fundamentalist Adventist.

	1600H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I ask you, as you moved around at this time in the month of April, May and June from Gisovu to Gishyita, did you come across any roadblocks as you travelled with your brother?
A.	Yes, we often had to cross roadblocks.
Q.	And when you arrived at these roadblocks, how did you get past them?  What did you need to qualify you to cross a roadblock in your vehicle at the time, with all these goods presumably in the back?
A.	Could you please repeat your question? 
Q.	When you arrived at a roadblock on your way from -- either from Gishyita to Gisovu, or vice-versa, what, if at all, did you need to enable your passage through that roadblock?  Can you -- did you need anything in particular or did you just drive past?
A.	In order to cross those roadblocks, my elder brother didn't have to present any papers because he was from that region and everyone knew him.  Those manning the roadblocks would call him by his name.  Whenever they saw him, they allowed him to pass, so we had no problems in crossing those roadblocks.
Q.	Are you certain that what you and your elder brother transported at this time were ***************, or members of the Interahamwe and militia? 
A.	I have stated that we transported merchandise.  No one else was on board that vehicle.  I was alone with my elder brother.  Regarding Interahamwe, we never transported them.
Q.	So if you arrived at a roadblock with all the goods in your vehicle, how were those manning the roadblocks able to know that you were not transporting arms or grenades or machetes on your way to launch an attack in Bisesero?  They asked you no questions; you showed no papers.  How did that work, sir; can you tell me?
A.	We did not need any particular documents.  In the préfecture, we didn't need a pass.  My elder brother was known and we used to supply our items to everyone who wished to buy them, be it salt or sugar, so anybody who wanted to buy supplies could buy the supplies, and everyone was aware of what we were transporting.
Q.	So if any witness comes to this courtroom to tell us that he or she had reason to obtain a 
laissez-passer from the commune office or some travel document to enable passage between communes, then that witness would be lying, wouldn't he or she, following your testimony?
A.	We weren't witness to such a situation.  We used to leave our commune to go to another commune and nobody asked us to produce a laissez-passer.  If someone was asked to produce a 
laissez-passer before travelling, I don't know anything about it.
Q.	How did you become a witness in this case, sir?
A.	This is how I was called to testify in this trial:  A lawyer came to see me where I used to reside.
Q.	Who was the lawyer who came to see you where you used to reside?
A.	He is here; I can see him.
Q.	Do you know his name?
A.	He's a professor.
Q.	Right.  Now, I am going to have a document shown to you in a few seconds.  And before that document is shown to you, can you tell me, Mr. Witness, do you know the name of Mika Muhimana's wife in 1994, April?
A.	I cannot remember her name, no.  I don't recall it.
Q.	So even though you visited or saw him at his house some six times every week and he told you about his niece's problem, you never made it your business to find out what his wife was called, did you, sir?
A.	Probably that is why I said I don't -- I can't remember his wife's name, but he must have mentioned his wife's name.
Q.	When the President of this Court referred to you as being familiar with the family, why didn't you tell her that you were not exactly very familiar with that family, that you didn't even know the wife's name? 
Why didn't you? 
A.	Now, listen, there's a difference between knowing somebody and knowing the name of someone.  Those are two different things.  I used to see Mika's wife.   Even if today if she stood here, I would tell you she's the one, but I can't recall that name.
Q.	Did you see her on the veranda as well when you saw him six times a week?
A.	I didn't see her often, probably once or twice.
Q.	You saw her at least twice, didn't you, sir, at the time?
A.	Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where is Mika's wife at the moment? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know where she is.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have the document shown to the witness, please? 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you see the name on the document, sir?
A.	Yes.  Yes, I know the person.
Q.	How do you know this person?
A.	In the country while I was there, that person was a student.  I was a student myself, and she used to attend a school that was far away and I used to attend a distant school as well, but since we were from neighbouring communes, we knew each other.  That is how I knew the person.  And at a certain point, that person was appointed a teacher, **********************, and at another moment the person disappeared and I didn't know exactly where he or she went.  I saw him or her again subsequently.
Q.	And subsequently had to do with you being recruited to be a witness in this case, did it not, 
Mr. Witness?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	So what role did the person on this document play in having you recruited as a witness in this case, sir, this long-lost friend?
A.	I can't be aware of the role he played but he used to come along -- or he came along with the professor when they came to look for me where I was residing.
Q.	I see.  Did he convince you to come and testify for the Defence?
A.	I haven't understood you well.
Q.	Did he convince you to testify for the Defence in this case, Mr. Witness?
A.	No, he did not convince me.  They came; they explained to me that Mika was in detention here.  I also learnt about that.  And later, as I had seen him during that entire period, as I told you, I promised them that I was going to come to testify.
Q.	Have you seen that person since you arrived in Arusha?
A.	I haven't seen him.  No, I haven't seen him.
Q.	Thank you.  So, Mr. Witness, let me summarise your testimony this afternoon in the following manner.  You tell me whether or not you agree with this.  Listen carefully.  So you are -- would I be correct in saying that you are a man or a person who does not know Mika Muhimana's wife's name, even though you saw them on the veranda from time to time every week between April, May and June 1994?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, this witness did not say he saw them; he saw Mika and his child.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, no; I beg to disagree.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I beg to disagree.  He only saw that -- he saw the wife a few times.
JUDGE SHORT:
On two occasions.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On two occasions.  Not six weeks -- six times a week.  Six times a week he saw Mika, sometimes with his child.  He did not say he saw the wife every time, those six times. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, would I be correct in saying the following:  That you are a person who has testified to not knowing the name of Mika Muhimana's wife, even though you saw her on the veranda with him at least twice; you don't know how many children he has?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Even though Mr. Muhimana expressed his concern about her safety.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	You are also a person who -- you and your brother drive through roadblocks manned by Interahamwe with very little difficulty between April, May and June 1994.  You sometimes work on the Sabbath, even though you are an Adventist, and you ************************************************* and you've known him for some time.  Does that sum you up accurately?
A.	No.  I have testified that I knew Mika's wife but that I have forgotten her name.  That is different from saying that I don't know her. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.  May I just seek to enter this document as the next Prosecution exhibit, being the identity of one of the Defence -- or perhaps maybe the only Defence investigator, I'm not sure, but at least some Defence investigator in this case. 

Mr. Witness, I thank you for being so kind to answer my questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered as Exhibit P. 85, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 85, admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I do not have any re-direct.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, you said ********************* towards the end of March and were ************************* a week after the death of the president, but ************** at that time; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
When did *************? 
THE WITNESS:
In the area in which I was, *********************************.  There were very serious disturbances and nobody could ****************************.  And finally, there was exile.  You would understand that the ******************* and carry out the activities normally, at least, in the area in which I was. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So at least during April, May, June, ****************? 
THE WITNESS:
In my area, no.
JUDGE SHORT:
Would you know whether the ************** during this period when the war broke out? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, **********
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, when did you leave Rwanda, what month? 
THE WITNESS:
I left Rwanda in October.  In September I resumed duty.  I started working with the RPF government and my father continued with his business, and in October, I saw that my -- I realised that my security was not -- couldn't let me continue to work because I was a witness to several arrests, and I chose to go into exile.
JUDGE SHORT:
And from April to October, when you eventually left, you never heard what happened to Mika's wife?  You earlier said that -- you were asked whether you know whether anything happened to Mika's wife or where she was, and you say you don't know, right?  And from April to October --
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- your brother never told you anything about Mika's wife or you never heard anything about Mika's wife? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I learnt nothing about it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are through with your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, call the next witness, please. 
	(Witness ushered in)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and you will be referred to as Witness AR2 instead of your real name.  You also make sure not to disclose your identity.  Now you will be sworn in to tell the truth.
	(Declaration made by Witness AR2 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you see a document placed before you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm the information contained therein is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You also verify your signature at the bottom of the page?
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. This document is entered as Exhibit D. 90, 9-0, to be kept under seal.	
(Exhibit No. D. 90 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have the floor for evidence-in-chief. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I would like to request from you that you order closed session because the nature of the relationship between the witness and our client, as well as the nature of the questions that we are going to ask, are such as to elicit answers that may identify the witness and I would like you, madam, to grant my request.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, what's your response?  You are shaking your head, we have noticed.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, I haven't seen the personal identification details of this witness.  I don't see why my learned friend would require closed session.  She must be very proud to be here.  Moreover, the summary indicates that she's only a character witness.  So what's the nature of the evidence from a character witness that has to be in closed session?  That's our view on behalf of the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you tell us why you want her evidence to be recorded in closed session? 
MR. SONGA:
After hearing my colleague's answer, madam, I withdraw my request and we can proceed with the 
in-chief -- with the examination-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  Proceed.  
WITNESS AR2,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Did you know Mika Muhimana in 1994?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you.  When did you know her -- when did you know him?
A.	In 1995.
Q.	So we can take it that you got to know him after the events that occurred in Rwanda?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When you knew him, were you also aware of his ethnic origin?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us about it?
A.	He's Rwandan, of the Hutu ethnic group.
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which you knew him?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can we ask the witness to come closer to the microphone because we can hardly hear him -- her, I'm sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you come closer to the microphone, please?  Speak into the microphone, please.  Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I will ask the question I asked a while ago again.  Under what circumstances did you know 
Mika Muhimana?
A.	I met him in Zaire, in Uvira, and he was my neighbour.
Q.	Can we also know your ethnic group?
A.	I am Tutsi.
Q.	What were you doing in Uvira in 1995?
A.	It is at Uvira that my husband and myself had sought refuge.
Q.	And did Mika tell you he was at Uvira?
A.	He was there like other refugees.
Q.	Did you have good, neighbourly relations in Uvira?
A.	Yes, we had good, neighbourly relations.
Q.	What was the distance between Mika's house and yours?
A.	Our two houses were quite close.  Let's say his house was about 30 metres from ours.
Q.	Who was living in Mika's house?
A.	He was living with his mother as well as his two children, a boy and a girl.
Q.	And who was living in your own house?
A.	I was living with my husband and our housemaid.
Q.	And what became of your husband?
A.	He took ill and subsequently died.
Q.	Was that still at Uvira?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And for how long did you stay at Uvira?
A.	We got to Uvira in 1995 and we left it in 1996.
Q.	How was your stay in Uvira?
A.	We had a pleasant stay in Uvira, but sometime later my husband passed away, after which I had to observe mourning.  I didn't have any problem later, but subsequently the war broke out and I had lots of problems because people were after my life.
Q.	Which war are you referring to precisely?
A.	I am talking about the war between the FPR and the Bamunyamurenge and RPF.
Q.	When did you say the war broke out?
A.	That was in 1996.  Should I spell Bamunyamurenge?  B-A-U-N-Y-A-M-U-L-E-N-G (sic).
Q.	When the war broke out, were you still Mika Muhimana's neighbour?
A.	Yes, Mika Muhimana and myself were still neighbours.  But when the war broke out, the Zaireans wanted to kill me because they were targeting Tutsi and the Bamunyamurenge  They arrested me and put me in jail, as well as my daughter ***********.  Mika came, gave some money to a Zairean soldier.  ******************. 
Q.	And where did you go after your release?
A.	The soldier put me in a car, took me to my house, released all the persons, and those persons were saying that they were going home; they were returning home as well. 
Q.	Do you know why Mika gave money to this Zairean soldier?
A.	Zairean soldiers were killing Tutsi and Bamunyamulenge.  He appealed to this soldier, telling him to spare this woman's wife (sic), "I'm going to give you money," and then he gave him money in order to save my life.
Q.	After the war broke out in Uvira, how much longer did you stay there?
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	I'm going to ask it again.  You testified that the war broke out, a war pitting the FPR against the Bamunyamurenge, and that Zaireans were seeking to kill Tutsi and that you were arrested, but that thanks to Mika, you were released.  Now I'm asking, when the war broke out, for how much longer did you remain in Uvira?
A.	The war continued and later Uvira fell and we went to Ubembe.  We sought refuge in Ubembe.
Q.	With whom did you go to Ubembe?
A.	I went with Mika, his mother and his children, as well as other members of the population.  When we got to Ubembe, the Inkotanyi asked us to go back to our homes, but we proceeded to the forest, and later Mika sought us out and with assistance of a trader, we went to Kigoma in Tanzania.
Q.	You talked about Ubembe.  How far is it from Uvira?
A.	The distance between the two places is very long.  We covered that distance, it took us one week to cover that distance, tracking.
Q.	Can you estimate the number of persons that comprised that group with whom you left Uvira to go to Ubembe?
A.	There were very many of us.  You would understand that the war was raging and everyone was fleeing.  The road was crowded with people; there were some who fell from -- following their having sustained gunshots and there were others who were tired, so there were very many of us.
Q.	Were there other Tutsi amongst you?
A.	Yes, there were some, but I was able to know or identify the ethnic group of my domestic servant, who was Tutsi.  Otherwise, it was difficult to know the ethnic group of each and every one because people were fleeing.  But sometimes -- at times when a person was killed, it is only subsequently that we could know that he was Bamunyamurenge.
Q.	You testified that at a certain point you left Ubembe to go to the forest; did I understand you well?
A.	Yes, you understood me well.  Because we were compelled to retreat and we went to hide ourselves in the forest.
Q.	And where was Mika Muhimana at that time?
A.	When we were compelled to retreat, we lost each other.  He took a direction and we took quite another.  So I retreated with my children because we were being shot at.  Mika continued on his way with his daughter and I carried on with my child.  But later, he tried to retrace our route and he met a Burundian called************** (phonetic), who came and looked for us, and we went on together to Tanzania.
Q.	How many days did you spend in the forest?
A.	When we left Ubembe, we spent four days in the forest but later, we had a boat that helped us cross.
Q.	Can you remember the number of people who got on a boat that day to go to Kigoma?
A.	There were 10 of us.  It was a small canoe.  There were 10 of us in it.
Q.	Did you pay for this trip?
A.	Yes, we paid 150 dollars.
Q.	And who paid that amount?
A.	Mika.
JUDGE SHORT:
And how much did Mika pay to get you released? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know the amount he paid in dollars.  I did not ask him that question because a person who causes you to be released, you are not going to ask him how much he had to disburse for you to be released.  I saw him bring out money from his pocket and give it to the soldier.  He is the one who can tell you the amount.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How long did it take you to get to Kigoma?
A.	The journey took us two days.  We got somewhere on a small island and we rested there and proceeded the next day until we reached.
Q.	Were you apprehensive or were you scared while you were on your way or in the lake?
A.	Yes, of course, we were scared because when we were entering into the boat we were hearing gunshots and you can understand that for somebody who is not used to travelling by the lake or in big bodies of water, you would normally be afraid.  Personally, I wasn't used to such a journey, to travel by boat, so I was scared.
Q.	When you got to Kigoma, what did you do?
A.	We sought where we could stay, and a few days later we went to Dar es Salaam.
Q.	Did you stay in the same place?
A.	We stayed at two different places.  We stayed at one place and then we moved on and rented another place where we stayed.
Q.	And in Kigoma, were you still with your children?
A.	Yes, we were all together, including the old woman.
Q.	You testify that you left for Dar es Salaam; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How was the trip?
A.	From where? 
Q.	From Kigoma to Dar es Salaam. 
A.	We left Kigoma at about seven in the morning.  We arrived at Dar es Salaam at seven p.m.
Q.	Who is it you found in Dar es Salaam?
A.	We spent the night at a hotel, and the next day we found a house.
Q.	In your personal particulars, it is indicated that you are ******************************.  When did your **********************?
A.	I don't remember the date, but it ******************.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, would that information not disclose her identity?
MR. SONGA:
I do not know. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, go on. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, she is happily resettled in a European country.  I'm sure she's all right.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In any event, there isn't anyone who would do her harm who doesn't know her already. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I do not think that there is any great cause for alarm in regard to her security. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	At the marriage, did Mika know that he was marrying a Tutsi?
A.	Yes, he knew it.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, I'm sorry, I didn't hear the date on which they said they tied the knot.  When did this event take place? 
THE WITNESS:
In Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania.  I do not remember the date but I have the marriage certificate.  If you wish, I can send it to you later. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you have any children from your deceased husband? 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I thought you said you had two children. 
THE WITNESS:
I was with two of Mika's children, a boy and a girl.  They were not my children. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I see. 
THE WITNESS:
The children with whom I was during my exile were Mika's children; that is a boy and a girl. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you are still with Mika's children, a boy and a girl? 

THE WITNESS:
Yes, we are still together. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you were living with Mika -- or Mika's children were living with you whilst you were living with your husband.  Before your husband died, was Mika's children living with you? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  Mika's children lived with their father and Mika's mother.  I was with my husband, but I took the children, Mika's children, when we were going into exile, and afterwards I married him. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You took Mika's children in Rwanda or in DRC, in Zaire? 
THE WITNESS:
In Zaire.  I took them in Zaire.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was that before or after your husband's death? 
THE WITNESS:
This happened after my husband's death.  Before I was with my husband, we were alone.  Mika lived with his mother and his children.  We were neighbours.  When the war broke out, we went to exile together.  I was with Mika and his children and his mother.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How old are Mika's children? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't remember their ages.  Perhaps you might ask him.  I know the ages of the children that I had with him.  I do not know the ages of Mika's children, that is the older ones. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you also have children with Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How many?
THE WITNESS:
We had two boys. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Madam Witness, you have preferred to the children that you had with Mika.  How old are they today?
A.	The older is six years old and the younger one is four years old.
Q.	Madam Witness, when you arrived at Dar es Salaam, did you continue keeping Mika's children; that is, the ones that he had before he married you?
A.	Yes, I am with his children.  They are mine.  They have not stayed with anyone else apart from me.
JUDGE SHORT:
You say your youngest child with Mika is four years old, was born in the year 2000? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he was born on the 4th of July, 2000.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, were you in love with Mika when you married him?
A.	Yes, I loved him, and besides, I still love him today.
JUDGE SHORT:
Have you seen anybody marry somebody he or she was not in love with? 
MR. SONGA:
Not yet. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Are you still in love with Mika?
A.	I am still in love with him and, besides, I would like you to give me the opportunity to greet him.  I am appealing for that clemency.  I would like to greet him.
Q.	The Chamber will definitely be responsive to your request. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am through with my in-chief -- with my examination-in-chief.  

And Madam Witness, I thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Yes, Mr. Kapaya -- or Mr. Phillips, do you have any cross-examination? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No questions, Your Honour.  I wouldn't want to challenge the witness's commitment to her husband.  There are no questions.
JUDGE SHORT:
You don't question the depth of her love? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, it's not in contention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, what was the age of your younger child with Mika when he was arrested? 

THE WITNESS:
I was pregnant.  You arrested him while I was pregnant. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we can't accede to your request; it's an administrative matter.  You can apply to the witness support section and they would consider your request.  Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President.  Madam President.  I would like to thank you for your reply, but I would like to be sure that she greet her husband, if only here in the courtroom, before her departure.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We told you that it is beyond our administrative -- it is beyond our jurisdiction.  We can ask the witness to make a request to the WVSS.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, it's your responsibility to make the application on behalf of the witness and your client for the WVSS to consider an application for her to meet her husband.  It's not really a matter for the Chamber to deal with.  And the normal procedures will be taken.  We would be quite sympathetic ourselves if we were the ones with the permission to give, but it is not part of our job. 

Madam Witness, your husband's lawyer will make the application. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
JUDGE SHORT:
I guess you just want him to greet her here one or two minutes and then say goodbye, that is what --
MR. SONGA:
That's exact.  That's true.  You understood me, Your Honours. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That can be done.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That can be done, but not in our presence.  Let us go.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After we retire.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you very much.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After we retire.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you very much, Madam President.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The court management can keep the witness there for that time and for that purpose only. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Very well, Your Honours, we shall do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are done with your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony.  We wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you. 

It's five.  We will stop here and resume tomorrow morning.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, the position in relation to the remaining witnesses was not clear at the end of this morning's procedures.  We had DH, DS and DU and the Accused, but then my learned friend has indicated he wants to revert to his original, so if he can give us a more up-to-date information as to who he intends to put on the stand so that we have an idea.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I would like to thank my learned friend, Madam President.  All the witnesses that are here as we were briefed by the witness support unit, have been -- have already appeared before your Chamber.  The latest information I had was that there are witnesses who were supposed to arrive from Rwanda here, today but we don't have any confirmation in that respect.  In that respect, Madam President, in the event that some witnesses would arrive today, you would understand that it would be difficult for them to start appearing before you as early as tomorrow.  We are therefore confronted with that difficulty and we doesn't know how we're going to manage it.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The latest information is, Professor, that your witnesses have arrived.  So we have to wait until tomorrow.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
He still has expressed a hesitation as to whether or not, even if they have arrived this evening, he could put them on tomorrow.  So the issue is, can't we have the Accused?  At least he's here.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, I think that is not appropriate.  We would rather consider an hour's adjournment in the morning, start at ten.  That is enough for him to prepare one witness and then he can do the others later.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm obliged, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you make available your witness tomorrow morning at nine? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you have to meet these witnesses before they testify? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I need to meet them before their testimony.  All the more so as I never met them during the preliminary -- during the pre-trial phase. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So how much time do you need to -- when do you think we can start then?  I mean, what time of the day tomorrow can we start? 
MR. SONGA:
If the witnesses are available to me tomorrow morning, I think we can start hearing tomorrow afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, if you are able to see the witnesses this evening, would that suffice?  You would be able to lead your witnesses tomorrow morning. 
MR. SONGA:
The question you are putting to me is difficult, madam.  It is already five p.m. and I will need to spend some time -- some of the night on this, and I will have to be here tomorrow.  It will be difficult for me to achieve that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So tomorrow we resume at 2 p.m. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not 2:30.
