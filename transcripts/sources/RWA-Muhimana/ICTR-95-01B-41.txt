      MUHIMANA                                                                       THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   The trial commenced on 29th March 2004. In the course of 34 trial days, the Chamber heard 52
 2   witnesses, 19 for the Prosecution and 33 for the Defence.
 3

 4   Mikaeli Muhimana, also known as Mika, was born on 24th October 1961 in Kagano cellule, Gishyita
 5   secteur, Gishyita commune, Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda. He was appointed conseiller of Gishyita
 6   secteur in 1990.
 7

 8   The indictment, as amended on 21st January 2004, charges the Accused with four counts: genocide,
 9   alternatively, complicity in genocide; murder as a crime against humanity; and rape as a crime against
10   humanity. All of the alleged events on which these charges are based occurred between April and
11   June 1994, in the Bisesero area and in many locations in Gishyita commune, Kibuye préfecture.
12

13   I now move on to the factual and legal findings.
14

15   Under Count 1 of the amended indictment, genocide, the Prosecution alleges the participation of
16   Muhimana in several attacks against Tutsi civilians during the months of April, May and June 1994.
17   The attacks, which resulted in the deaths of numerous Tutsi victims, occurred in Mubuga church,
18   Mugonero complex, Uwingabo, Nyarutovu hills, Mutiti and Ngendombi hills, Kanyinya hills, Gitwa and
19   Muyira hills. The Prosecution also alleges the involvement of the Accused in the mobilisations of
20   assailants and the distribution of guns and grenades between 14th and 15th April 1994. Finally, the
21   Prosecution alleges that, in June 1994, the Accused lured the Tutsi civilians out of their hiding places in
22   Kibuye préfecture, with the promise of medication. However, instead of humanitarian aid, the Accused
23   brought armed assailants, who attacked the Tutsi civilians, killing more than 2000.
24

25   The Defence asserts that, between 8th and 16th April 1994, when many of the alleged crimes occurred,
26   the Accused did not leave his house, where he was mourning the death of his son, who had just died.
27   The Chamber has considered the Accused's alibi that he remained at home between 8th and 16th April
28   1994, mourning his son's death, but finds that the alibi does not preclude the possibility that the
29   Accused could also have been present at other places where, according to the testimonies of many
30   Prosecution witnesses, he participated in crimes. Indeed, the Chamber notes that a Defence witness
31   also saw the Accused near Mubuga church, the site of a massacre on or about 15th April, at a time
32   when, according to his alibi, the Accused remained exclusively at his home.
33

34   Having considered the evidence, the Chamber finds testimonies about the Accused's participation and
35   brutal attacks of Tutsi civilians at Mubuga church, Mugonero complex, Uwingabo, Nyarutovu hills,
36   Ngendombi hills, Kanyinya hills, Gitwa and Muyira hills, to be reliable and credible.

 1   The Defence witnesses' accounts of the attacks at these sites did not raise a reasonable doubt as to
 2   the credibility of the evidence regarding the involvement of the Accused in the events which occurred
 3   there.
 4

 5   It is not in dispute between the parties that in Rwanda, in 1994, the Tutsi were a group protected by
 6   1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
 7

 8   Applying the legal standards detailed in the written judgement, the Chamber finds the Accused
 9   committed the acts of killing, and/or causing serious bodily or mental harm to the members of the Tutsi
10   group:
11

12   By taking part in the attacks at Nyarutovu and Ngendombi hills, where he shot and wounded a Tutsi
13   man called Emmanuel;
14

15   By taking part in the attack at Mubuga church, where he shot at Tutsi civilians with his gun and threw a
16   grenade into the church, killing a Tutsi man called Kayihura and seriously wounded many others within
17   the church;
18

19   By taking part in the attacks at Mugonero complex, where he raped Tutsi women and shot at Tutsi
20   civilians with his gun;
21

22   By taking part in the attack at Kanyinya hill, where he searched for and attacked Tutsi refugees, and
23   shot a Tutsi man called Nyagihigi;
24

25   And, by taking part in the attacks at Muyira hill, where he shot at and killed the sister of Witness W, a
26   Tutsi;
27

28   In the course of these attacks, many Tutsi refugees died or were injured.
29

30   The Chamber finds that these attacks were systematically directed against the Tutsi group. Before
31   attacks occurred on the Mubuga church, Hutu refugees, who were intermingled with the Tutsi, were
32   instructed to come out of the church. Both Prosecution and the Defence witnesses testified that the
33   refugees who had gathered on Kanyinya and Muyira hills were predominantly Tutsi.
34

35   Factors such as the sheer scale of the massacres, during which a great number of Tutsi civilians died
36   or were seriously injured, and a number of assailants who were involved in the attacks against Tutsi
37   civilians leads the Chamber to the irresistible conclusion that the massacres in which the Accused
                                KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 3
      MUHIMANA                                                                      THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   participated were intended to destroy the Tutsi group in whole or in part.
 2

 3   The Accused personally targeted Tutsi civilians during these attacks by shooting and raping Tutsi
 4   victims. He also raped a Hutu young girl, Witness BJ, whom he believed to be Tutsi, but later
 5   apologised to her when he was informed that she was Hutu.
 6

 7   Consequently, the Chamber finds that the Accused intended to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi
 8   group.
 9

10   The Chamber therefore finds the Accused Mika Muhimana guilty of genocide, as charged under
11   Count 1 of the indictment.
12

13   The Prosecution also charged the Accused with complicity in genocide under Count 2. Insofar as the
14   Chamber has found the Accused guilty under Count 1, genocide, the Chamber makes no finding on the
15   count of complicity in genocide. Count 2 is therefore dismissed.
16

17   Under Count 3, rape as a crime against humanity, the Prosecution alleges the participation of
18   Mika Muhimana in numerous rapes of Tutsi women between April and June 1994. It is alleged that
19   Muhimana raped: Languida Kamukina, Goretti Mukashyaka, and Esperance Mukagasana in Gishyita
20   town; Colette, Alphonsine, and Agnes Mukagatare, in Mubuga parish; Mukasine Kajongi and
21   Amos Karera's daughters, other women named Mukasine, Murekatete, Johaneta, Teresa Mukabutera,
22   Eugenia, Witness AU, Immaculee Mukabarore, Josephine Mukankwaro, and Bernadette in the
23   Mugonero hospital; Witness AX in Gishyita town; Pascasie Mukarema and Felicité Kankuyu in
24   Nyakiyabo hill. The Prosecution also alleges that the Accused permitted a member of the Interahamwe
25   to abduct and rape Witness BG and that he offered Esperance Mukagasana to an Interahamwe named
26   Gisambo, to rape her.
27

28   The Chamber notes that both the Defence and the Prosecution in the present case endorse the
29   Akayesu definition of rape.
30

31   The Prosecution invites the Chamber to consider the disembowelment of Pascasie Mukarema, shown
32   by the evidence to have been effected by using a machete to cut her from her breasts to her genitals,
33   constitutes rape. In the light of the peculiar factual circumstances of this case, the Chamber deems it
34   useful to analyse the evolution of the definition of rape in international criminal law. The Chamber will
35   now provide a summary of its analysis.
36

37   The first judgement in which an international criminal tribunal defined rape as a crime against humanity,
                                  KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 4
      MUHIMANA                                                                        THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   and as an instrument of genocide, was issued on 2nd September 1998, in the case of Prosecution v.
 2   Akayesu, by Trial Chamber I of the Tribunal. In the present case, rape is charged against the Accused
 3   as a crime against humanity. The Akayesu judgement emphasised that "the central elements of the
 4   crime of rape cannot be captured in a mechanical description of objects and body parts," and defined
 5   rape as: a physical invasion of a sexual nature, committed on a person under circumstances which are
 6   coercive.
 7

 8   According to Akayesu, sexual violence, which includes rape, is considered to be any act of a sexual
 9   nature which is committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive.
10

11   Recognising that rape has been historically defined in national jurisdictions as "non-consensual sexual
12   intercourse," the Akayesu Trial Chamber found this description too mechanical, insofar as "variations
13   on the form of rape may include acts which involve the insertion of objects and/or the use of body
14   orifices not considered to be intrinsically sexual." As an example, the Akayesu Trial Chamber referred
15   to its factual finding that a piece of wood was thrust into the sexual organ of a woman as she lay
16   dying -- a physically invasive act of the victim's body, which it found to constitute rape.
17

18   The Chamber observes that the Akayesu definition of rape was endorsed by Trial Chamber I of this
19   Tribunal in Musema and Niyitegeka, and by Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for
20   the Former Yugoslavia in Delalic.
21

22   The Chamber further notes that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, in the
23   Kunarac Trial Chamber judgement, referred to the Akayesu definition of rape briefly. It made no
24   adverse comments on the definition and tacitly accepted it, but went on to focus on providing the
25   elements of rape.
26

27   An analysis of the Kunarac Trial Chamber judgement demonstrates clearly that it was dealing with the
28   elements of rape. The Kunarac Trial Chamber's articulation of the elements of the crime of rape was as
29   follows:
30

31   The actus reus of the crime of rape in international law is constituted by: sexual penetration, however
32   slight:
33

34   (a) of the vagina or anus of the victim by the penis of the perpetrator, or any other object used by the
35   perpetrator; or
36

37   (b) of the mouth of the victim by the penis of the perpetrator; where such sexual penetration occurred
                                KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 5
      MUHIMANA                                                                      THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   without the consent of the victim. Consent for this purpose must be consent given voluntarily, as a
 2   result of the victim's free will, assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances.
 3   The mens rea is the intention to effect this sexual penetration, and the knowledge that it occurs without
 4   the consent of the victim.
 5

 6   When the Kunarac Appeals Chamber stated that it concurred with the Trial Chamber's "definition," it is
 7   clear that it was approving the elements set out by the Trial Chamber. That was the issue before the
 8   Appeals Chamber. It was not called upon to consider the Akayesu definition.
 9

10   In analysing the relationship between the consent and coercion, the Kunarac Appeals Chamber
11   acknowledged that the coercion provides clear evidence of non-consent.
12

13   Similarly, the Chamber also recalls that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in
14   the Furundzija case acknowledged that "any form of captivity vitiates consent."
15

16   After having considered the jurisprudence on the definition and the elements of rape enunciated by both
17   ad hoc Tribunals, the Chamber is persuaded that coercion is an element that may obviate the relevance
18   of consent as an evidentiary factor in the crime of rape. The Chamber also agrees that the
19   circumstances prevailing in most cases charged under international criminal law, as either genocide,
20   crimes against humanity, or war crimes, will be almost universally coercion, must vitiate true consent.
21

22   The Chamber notes that the definition of rape, as enunciated in Akayesu, has not been adopted per se
23   in all subsequent jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals. For example, the Trial Chambers of the
24   Tribunal in Semanza, Kajelijeli and Kamuhanda described only the physical elements of the act of rape,
25   as set out in Kunarac, and thus seemingly shifted their analysis away from the conceptual definition
26   established in Akayesu.
27

28   The Chamber considers that the Furundzija and Kunarac judgments issued by the International
29   Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia which sometimes have been construed as departing from
30   the Akayesu definition of rape -- as was done in Semanza -- actually are substantially aligned to this
31   definition and provide additional details on the constituent elements of acts considered to be rape, as
32   opposed to the offence of sexual violence.
33

34   The Chamber takes the view that the Akayesu definition and the Kunarac elements are not
35   incompatible or substantially different in their application. Whereas Akayesu referred broadly to a
36   "physical invasion of a sexual nature," Kunarac went on to articulate the parameters of what would
37   constitute a physical invasion of a sexual nature, amounting to rape.
                                  KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 6
      MUHIMANA                                                                     THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Chamber is of the opinion that the conceptual definition of
 2   rape established in Akayesu encompasses the elements articulated in Kunarac.
 3   Having considered both Prosecution and Defence evidence, the Chamber finds that during the months
 4   of April and May 1994, the Accused committed rape. He did so by the following actions:
 5

 6   On 7th April 1994, in Gishyita town, the Accused took two women, Goretti Mukashyaka and
 7   Languida Kamukina, into his house and raped them. Thereafter he drove them out of his house naked
 8   and invited Interahamwe and other civilians to see what naked Tutsi girls looked like;
 9

10   During the first week after the eruption of hostilities, the Accused pushed Esperance Mukagasana on to
11   his bed, stripped her naked, and raped her. He raped her in his home several times;
12

13   On 15th April 1994, the Accused, acting in concert with a group of Interahamwe, abducted a group of
14   Tutsi girls and led them to a cemetery near Mubuga church. The Accused then raped one of the
15   abducted girls, called Agnes Mukagatare;
16

17   On 16 April 1994, in the basement of Mugonero hospital, at Mugonero complex, the Accused raped
18   Mukasine Kajongi;
19

20   On 16th April 1994, again in a room of the basement of Mugonero hospital, the Accused raped
21   Witness AU twice;
22

23   Still on 16th of April 1994, in the basement of Mugonero hospital, the Accused raped Witness BJ, a
24   young Hutu girl, whom he mistook for a Tutsi. He later apologised to her for the rape, when he was
25   informed by an Interahamwe that BJ was a Hutu.
26

27   The Chamber finds that the Accused also abetted the commission of rape on other persons. He did so
28   by the following actions:
29

30   a.      On 16th April 1994, at the same time and in the same area where the Accused raped
31           Mukasine Kajongi in the basement of Mugonero hospital, two soldiers, in his presence, raped
32           the daughters of Amos Karera in his presence while Amos Karera's daughters were raped, and
33           by his own actions in raping Mukasine, the Accused encouraged the two soldiers to rape Amos
34           Karera's daughters. This encouragement contributed substantially to the commission of these
35           rapes;
36

 1   b.       On 16th April 1994, while the Accused was raping Witness BJ in the basement of Mugonero
 2            hospital, two men, who accompanied him, were also raping two other girls named Murekatete
 3            and Mukasine. The Accused, by his actions, encouraged the other men to commit the rapes of
 4            Murekatete and Mukasine. This encouragement contributed substantially to the commission of
 5            these rapes.
 6

 7   c.       On 22 April 1994, the Accused allowed an Interahamwe named Mugonero to take Witness BG
 8            away so that he could "smell the body of the Tutsi woman." The witness was raped several
 9            times in Mugonero's residence over a period of two days. The Chamber finds that by allowing
10            Mugonero to take Witness BG home, the Accused encouraged him to rape Witness BG. This
11            encouragement contributed substantially to the commission of the rape.
12

13   The Chamber finds that the Accused knew that all these rapes were part of a discriminate widespread
14   and systematic attack against Tutsi civilians.
15

16   The Chamber finds that the Accused chose his rape victims because he believed that they were Tutsi.
17   Whether the victims were, in fact, Tutsi or Hutu is not irrelevant in the determination of the Accused's
18   criminal responsibility. The Chamber concludes, on the basis of the Accused's conduct, that he raped
19   his victims with the knowledge that the rapes formed part of a widespread or systematic attack on the
20   Tutsi civilian population.
21

22   The Chamber found insufficient evidence to prove the allegations that the Accused bears criminal
23   responsibility for:
24

25   (a) collective rape of Immaculee Mukabatore and Josephine Mukankwaro, who, according to the
26   Prosecution, were raped by Interahamwe at the same time that the Accused raped Witness AU;
27

28   (b) alleged killings, rapes and other atrocities, which the Prosecution alleges, were linked to a meeting
29   held in the Accused's residence which was followed by rapes in Gishyita on 7 April 1994;
30

31   (c) abetting the rape of Esperance Mukagasana in the Accused's house, by offering her to an
32   Interahamwe named Gisambo;
33

34   (d) the rape of Josiana, Mariana Gafurafura and Martha Gafurafura in Gishyita, following their

      MUHIMANA                                                                       THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   The Chamber finds also that the Accused bears no criminal responsibility for the rape of
 2   Felicité Kankuyu, because the evidence led by the Prosecution did not support the facts as pleaded in
 3   the indictment. The indictment was defective and has not been cured timely, clearly; and consistent
 4   notice of the material facts that the Prosecution intended to plead against the Accused.
 5

 6   The Chamber finds that the Accused bears no criminal responsibility for the rapes of Witness AX,
 7   because the Prosecution failed to plead the material facts of the time of the crime accurately, thus
 8   rendering the indictment defective. The Chamber examined the Prosecution pre-trial brief and the
 9   witness statements and found that this defect was not cured by clear and consistent notice of the
10   material facts.
11

12   The Chamber finds that the Accused bears no criminal responsibility for the rape of
13   Pascasie Mukaremera. In its factual findings, the Chamber has found that the Accused disembowelled
14   Pascasie Mukaremera by cutting her open with a machete from her breasts to her vagina. The
15   Chamber has carefully considered the Prosecution submission to consider this act as rape, and
16   concludes that such conduct cannot be classified as rape. Although the act interferes with the sexual
17   organs, in the Chamber's opinion, it does not constitute a physical invasion of a sexual nature.
18   However, the Chamber will return to consider this incident under its legal findings on murder.
19

20   The Chamber finds the Accused, Mika Muhimana, criminally liable for committing and abetting the
21   rapes, as part of a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population.
22

23   Consequently, the Chamber finds the Accused, Mika Muhimana, guilty of rape as a crime against
24   humanity, under Count 3 of the indictment.
25

26   Under Count 4 (Murder as a crime against humanity), the Prosecution alleges the participation of
27   Muhimana in several murders of Tutsi civilians between April and June 1994. It is alleged that
28   Muhimana killed, instructed to kill or participated in the killing of Languida Kamukina,
29   Goretti Mukashyaka, Esperance Mukagasana in Gishyita town; Kayihura at Mubuga church;
30   Colette and Alphonsine in Mugonero parish; the following women: Mukasine, Murekatete, Johaneta,
31   Teresa Mukabutera, Eugenia, Immaculee Mukabatore, Josephine Mukankwaro and
32   Bernadette Mukangorero, at Mugonero Complex hospital; Pascasie Mukaremera and Felicité Kankuyu
33   in Nyakiyabo and a Tutsi businessman named Assiel Kabanda in Bisesero.
34

35   Having considered both Prosecution and Defence evidence, the Chamber finds that during the months
36   of April, May and June 1994, the Accused committed murders. He did so by the following actions:
37
                             SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 9
       MUHIMANA                                                                    THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   On the morning of 15 April 1994, the Accused removed a grenade from a box and threw it into the
 2   Mubuga Church where Tutsi refugees were gathered. This resulted in the death of a Tutsi man by the
 3   name of Kayihura. By his actions, the Accused committed the murder of Kayihura.
 4

 5   On 16 April 1994, assailants killed Mukasine Kajongi and Amos Karera's daughters. The assailants
 6   acted under the instructions and with the encouragement of the Accused, who was present. By his
 7   words and actions, the Accused instigated the murder of Mukasine Kajongi and Amos Karera's
 8   daughters. This instigation contributed substantially to the commission of this murder.
 9

10   In mid-May 1994, the Accused told a gathering of Interahamwe that he was going to disembowel a
11   pregnant woman called Pascasie Mukagatare so that he could see what the foetus looks like in its
12   mother's womb. He then cut the woman from her breasts down to her genitals and removed the baby
13   who cried for some time before dying. After disembowelling the woman, the assailants cut off her arms
14   and stuck sharpened sticks into them. Having previously found that Pascasie died as a result of her
15   injuries, the Chamber finds that the Accused committed her murder.
16

17   In June 1994, the Accused participated in the killing of a Tutsi businessman named Assiel Kabanda,
18   who was hiding in the Bisesero hills. The Chamber finds that the Accused participated in the
19   commission of his murder.
20

21   The Chamber found insufficient evidence to prove the following allegations.
22

23   The Chamber found insufficient evidence to prove the following allegations that:
24

25   (a) on or about 7 April 1994, Languida Kamukina and Goretti were killed on the instructions, and in the
26   presence, of the Accused. Specifically, the Chamber found insufficient the evidence that the girls were,
27   in fact, killed.
28

29   (b) on or about 14 April 1994, Esperance Mukagasana was killed on the instructions, and in the
30   presence, of the Accused. Specifically, the Chamber found insufficient evidence that she was, in fact,
31   killed.
32

33   (c) on or about 15 April 1994 at Mubuga parish, two Tutsi girls called Alphonsine and Colette were
34   disembowelled and killed on the orders, and in the presence, of the Accused. Specifically, the
35   Chamber found insufficient evidence that the girls were, in fact, killed.
36

37   (d) on 16 April 1994 at Mugonero hospital, Immaculate Mukabatore, Bernadette Mukangorero and

 1   Josephine Mukankwaro were killed collectively by the Accused and members of the Interahamwe.
 2   Specifically, the Chamber found no evidence that the girls were, in fact, killed.
 3

 4   Furthermore, the Chamber finds that the Accused bears no criminal responsibility for the killing of
 5   Felicité Kankuyu, since he was not on sufficient notice of this allegation.
 6

 7   Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Statute, the Chamber finds the Accused, Mika Muhimana, criminally
 8   liable for committing and instigating the murder of civilians as part of a widespread and systematic
 9   attack against civilians.
10

11   Consequently, the Chamber finds Mika Muhimana guilty of murder as a crime against humanity, under
12   Count 4.
13

14   Mr. Muhimana, would you please stand up to receive the verdict.
15

16   For the foregoing reasons, having considered all the evidence and arguments presented by the parties,
17   the Chamber finds you, Mikaeli Muhimana,
18

19   Count 1. (Genocide): Guilty
20   Count 2. (Complicity in genocide): Dismissed.
21   Count 3. (Rape as a crime against Humanity): Guilty.
22   Count 4. (Crimes against Humanity) (Murder) as a crime against humanity: Guilty.
23

24

25

26   SENTENCING:
27

28   Having found the Accused guilty as stated above, the Chamber now considers the appropriate
29   sentence for the crimes for which he has been convicted.
30

31   Genocide and murder and rape as crimes against humanity rank amongst the gravest of the crimes.
32   The Chamber is no doubt that principal perpetrators of such crimes deserve a heavy sentence.
33

34   Mika Muhimana was a conseiller and a well-known person in the Gishyita commune where most of the
35   crimes were committed, and occupied a position of influence in the community. Instead of using, or
36   attempting to use, his position within the community to promote peace and reconciliation, he actively
37   participated in the atrocities.
                              SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 11
      MUHIMANA                                                                      THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   Mika Muhimana participated in attacks against Tutsi civilians who had sought refuge in churches and a
 2   hospital, traditionally regarded as place every sanctuary and safety. His involvement in such attacks
 3   constitutes an aggravating factor.
 4

 5   Mika Muhimana repeatedly raped and killed women, whom he believed to be Tutsi, with reckless
 6   disregard for human life and dignity. In assessing the existence of aggravating factors in relation to
 7   these acts, the Chamber considers the provisions of the Rwandan Penal Code in effect in 1994. At the
 8   time that Mika Muhimana committed these criminal acts, the Rwandan courts were directed to consider
 9   the following as aggravating factors in the crime of rape: where the victim is a child under 16 years of
10   age; where the crime is committed by a civil servant or a public official who has used his position in
11   order to commit the rape; if the perpetrator was assisted in the execution of the crime by one or more
12   persons; if the crime has caused serious harm to the victim's health.
13

14   The Chamber recalls that one of Mika Muhimana's victims, Witness BJ, was only 15 years old when
15   Mika Muhimana raped her. The young age of the victim is an aggravating factor.
16

17   The Chamber has found that others, such as Interahamwe, were present, assisted; or participated in
18   the following rapes committed by the Accused: Goretti Mukashyaka and Languida Kamukina, in
19   Mika Muhimana's house; Agnes Mukagatare, in the cemetery of Mubuga church;
20   Mukasine Kajongi and the daughters of Amos Karera, in the basement of Mugonero hospital;
21   Witness AU, in the basement of Mugonero hospital; Witness BJ, and Murekatete in the basement of
22   Mugonero hospital.
23

24   From the victim's perspective, to be raped in the presence of other people compounds the humiliation
25   and constitutes an aggravating factor. This factor exists whether or not the victim is physically raped by
26   several of the perpetrators. The Chamber finds this aggravating factor to exist in each of the above
27   mentioned rapes.
28

29   The Chamber also notes the particularly violent and cruel nature of the Accused's conduct. For
30   example, while raping Witness AU, he repeatedly banged her head against the ground.
31

32   After raping two young Tutsi women in his home, Mika Muhimana led them out, paraded them naked,
33   and invited onlookers to look at their naked bodies. This public humiliation is an aggravating factor.
34

35   The Chamber recalls the incident where the Accused used a machete to cut the pregnant woman
36   Pascasie Mukaremera from her breasts down to her genitals and remove her baby who cried for some
37   time before dying. After this disembowelling of the woman, the assailants accompanying Muhimana
                            SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 12
      MUHIMANA                                                                        THURSDAY, 28 APRIL 2005

 1   then cut off her arms and stuck sharpened sticks into her. This unimaginably savage attack upon a
 2   pregnant woman deserves condemnation in the strongest possible terms and constitutes a highly
 3   aggravating factor.
 4

 5   The atrocious nature of the crimes that Mika Muhimana committed against Tutsi women, calculated to
 6   degrade and humiliate them, is an aggravating factor which weighs on his sentence.
 7

 8   The Chamber finds that Mika Muhimana's active participation in the decapitation of Assiel Kabanda,
 9   and the subsequent public display of his severed head, constitute an aggravating factor.
10

11   Mika Muhimana's actions have left many dead and others traumatised or with physical disabilities.
12

13   The Chamber finds no mitigating circumstances.
14

15   Considering the Chamber's findings in relation to the seriousness of the crimes committed and also
16   Mika Muhimana's individual circumstances, the Chamber deems it appropriate to impose the maximum
17   sentence.
18

19   For the foregoing reasons, the Chamber now sentences you, Mika Muhimana, as follows:
20

21   For genocide, Count 1: imprisonment for the remainder of your life.
22   For rape, as a crime against Humanity, Count 3: imprisonment for the remainder of your life.
23   For murder, as a crime against Humanity, Count 4: imprisonment for the remainder of your life.
24

25   The sentences shall run concurrently.
26

27   Mika Muhimana's sentence shall be enforced immediately in accordance with Rules 102(A) and 103.
28   Mika Muhimana shall remain in the custody of the Tribunal pending transfer to the state where he shall
29   serve his sentence. If notice of appeal is filed, enforcement of the sentence shall be stayed until a
30   decision has been delivered on the appeal with Mika Muhimana meanwhile remaining in detention by
31   the Tribunal.
32

33   The trial of Mika Muhimana has now come to an end.
34

35   The Chamber would like to thank the learned counsel for the parties and the people who have assisted
36   in the judicial process, particularly the legal officers for the able and effective assistance and
37   contribution to the Bench.

 1   The Chamber would also like to thank the witnesses who have travelled to Arusha to tell their stories
 2   and to assist in understanding the truth and rendering justice. We thank you all, once again.
