MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to everyone present here.  The Court is in session now.  

May we have the appearances for the Prosecution, please?
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  The prosecution is represented by Ms. Kabisinga, Mrs. Madenga and myself.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Professor, may we have your appearances, please?
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President; good afternoon, Your Honours.

I am Nyairungu Mwene Songa.  I am lead counsel for Mika Muhimana.  I am assisted by my legal assistant to my left, Mr. Leopold Munderere, and to my right, Mr. Mathias Sahinkuye.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We don't see the witness in the witness stand.  Bring the witness, please.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, before the witness is brought to the court, I would like to request leave to present an oral motion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to request that you give a precise interpretation of Rule 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, because during the last session the Prosecutor raised an objection regarding an intervention of the Defence when it posed questions to the witness regarding the 6th April and the death of President Habyarimana.  

That objection was formulated as follows by the Prosecutor:  "Unfortunately I want to object to this line of questioning.  I have been trying to listen to him.  I have made an effort to listen to the statement of this witness on relevant issues in this trial.  I don't recall having asked questions regarding the president's death or any related questions."  

It happens that the statement of the Prosecutor was partial in the sense that he continues as follows: "If you take Rule 90(G) of the Rules of the procedure and evidence, that rule states that cross-examination shall be limited to the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief and matters affecting the credibility of the witness," and there is no doubt as to what those questions were with regard to the subject matter.  

Madam President, if you read Rule (G), that is Rule 90(G)(i), it states that cross-examination should not be limited only to examination-in-chief.  Quite on the contrary, it states that it can focus on three things: one, points mentioned in examination this chief; two, points relating to the credibility of the witness, and, three, points relating to the party that is cross-examining the witness on his statement.

The answer that was given verbally, orally by the president of this Chamber was that, "After deliberation, we will call on you, Professor, to limit your cross-examination to issues raised during examination-in-chief.  You cannot use the written statement of the witness to corroborate the position of the witness before the Chamber."  

We believe, Madam President, that to oppose the Prosecutor's statement to what I see read only part of this text, and on the other hand, the Defence of the Accused should be full and fair.  This would be prejudicial to the accused because we are aware that the charges against the accused relate to genocide, complicity in genocide, and crimes against humanity, which are charges relating to events that occurred from the 6th April, the date observed by all impartial observers as the date which triggered the tragic events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  That is why, Madam President, the Defence, respectfully requests the Chamber to give a good interpretation of this text such that it should be understood that cross-examination should not be limited only to examination-in-chief without prejudicing the rights of the Accused, which include, of course, the right to verify and test the credibility of the witness, and which also requires that the Accused should be able to defend himself at all stages of the trial, particularly with regard to charges, during both the hearings and with regard to statements made by the witness before the hearing.  

I thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to raise this motion.  I am confident that the Chamber will respond to my objection in line with Rule 90(G).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, what do you have to say? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the gist of our submission last week on the scope of cross-examination was to the effect that Defence counsel should try as much as possible to confine his cross-examination to issues which are immediately relevant to the case, and it was in the light of that that even in the previous status conferences, we said that the times given -- the length of the time that it could take to, say, examine the witness in chief should be respected, and likewise, I think it was agreed that Defence counsel should also try, as much as possible, to limit his cross-examination to matters raised  in examination-in-chief, and if it goes beyond that, he should try, also as much as possible, to limit whatever he wants to cross-examine on within the -- at least within the time which the Prosecution has spent in making its case.

Now, experience in the last week has shown, Your Honours, that actually cross-examination is taking sometimes unnecessarily long.  We had agreed, I think, at the previous status conference, that we should have at least a witness a day.  Now, on the basis of that, the prosecution has been bringing about five witnesses every week.  Now, last week we had a spill-over of three witnesses.  Now, for this we, we have five witnesses in Arusha already, so we have already eight witnesses for trial this week, and as we all know, this week we only have four days, that is between today and Thursday, because Friday is a public holiday, so if Defence counsel is allowed any unnecessarily wide latitude in cross-examination, we won't be able to achieve -- I mean to expedite this trial, to conclude the trial within the specified time.  

Your Honours, I think this is basically the gist of our argument, that cross-examination may extend to matters which are outside the examination-in-chief, but the time taken to probe into these matters should not unreasonably exceed the time the Prosecution has taken to present its case.  

Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

We will take a short break for deliberation. 
(Court recessed from 1415H to 1503)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session now.

We have deliberated and our ruling is as follows.  

The Trial Chamber is obligated by Rule 90(F) to exercise control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth and avoid needless consumption of time.  Consistent with it, the Chamber has an obligation to ensure that the trial is fair and that each party has an opportunity to present its case to the full.

The Chamber understands that Rule 90(G) requires that cross-examination is limited to subject matter in examination-in-chief; secondly, matters affecting the credibility of the witness, and thirdly, where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party to the subject matter of the case.

While a cross-examining party is free to put to the witnesses matters contained in his or her written statement, such examination must be relevant and/or intended to test the credibility of the witness.  

In all this, the Chamber is mindful of the provisions of Article 19(1) of the statute which, inter alia, requires that the trial be fair, expeditious, and the proceedings are conducted with full respect to the rights of the Accused and due regard for the protection of the witness and victims.  

In our ruling of last week, we disallowed cross-examination on matters which, in our opinion and judgement, were not relevant and did not arise from the examination-in-chief.

Mr. Issa, please call in the witness. 
(Witness AV entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  

You are reminded of the oath you have taken to speak the truth.  

Professor, now you have the floor for the remaining cross-examination, please.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS AV
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continiued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, counsel. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, during the cross-examination of Thursday, 1st April, Defence felt that it was in its duty to note a contradiction between the statement before the Chamber and the written witness statement of 13th November 1999 regarding the aftermath of the throwing of a grenade in the Mubuga church.  There was some controversy regarding the exact statement made by the witness before this Court.  Now that the transcript is available, I would request your leave to refer to such transcripts so that the truth, or the version of the witness, is known to all.  

If we look at page 45 of the transcript, Your Honour, from lines 21 to 24, we shall see the following: "How many persons were wounded inside the church"  -- we are referring here to the Mubuga church -- "to the best of your knowledge after this attack?"
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which page? 
MR. SONGA:
I'm quoting from page 45 of the transcript, lines 21 to 24.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Unfortunately, we do not have page 45.  We do not have page 45 in the English transcript.
MR. SONGA:
Perhaps the registry can be able to help us from the French version.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which line?  Could you repeat the question and answer?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I'm referring to the transcript, page 45, lines 21 to 24, and they contain a question and answer.  Question: "How many persons were wounded inside the church, to the best of your knowledge, after this attack?"  Answer: "Many people were wounded.  I was afraid.  I did not verify where.  There were many bodies, many people were wounded."  And during the session of 1st April there was discussion in a bid to ascertain whether the witness had referred to many bodies after this attack, and I wanted -- wished it to be noted that my notes were in keeping with the statement of that day.  Therefore, the Defence felt that it was necessary to point out this contradiction between the version before the Court and the version that is contained in the witness statement.  That is what I wanted to bring out, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have got the relevant portion.  Please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Perhaps to conclude with this point, I would like to state that in the statement of 13th November 1999, at the 6th page, there is mention of Kayihra.  Kayihra is deceased, and there were four other refugees who were seriously wounded, which is a version that is entirely different from that which has been disclosed to this Chamber. 

This means, Madam Witness, that the two versions -- it seems the two versions cannot be true at the same time.  There is a lie at some point, either in the witness statement of 13 November 1999 or in your statement before the Court.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I have an observation to make.  I believe that Defence counsel should spare us his submissions.  Instead of submitting to the Court on what he thinks are contradictions, he should point those things out and place them before the witness and ask the witness to explain.  I think that is the proper procedure to adopt.  You ask the witness, "In this statement you say so-and-so; yesterday you say so-and-so; where lies the truth?"  Now, Counsel, instead of doing that, is making a submission.  I think he should save that for his closing arguments.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, first you read the relevant paragraph in the written statement to the witness and then you confront her with her statement given in this Court last week.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I indicated to the registry, registry, the corresponding version in English, I have the French here before me.  This is on page 81.  Witness statement is of 13 November 1999, and this is on page 6 of that statement.  This is what is said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Page 6 of the English version? 
MR. SONGA:
For the English version, I think it is page 97.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you read out the relevant portion of the witness statement to the witness.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Here is the passage.  "On the 14th April 1994, there was no attack.  On 15th of April 1994, the Interahamwe continued to mill around and we had people shouting, weeping and screaming around the church while the attackers chanted.  At about 10 a.m., I heard a vehicle coming towards the church, and when I looked outside I saw Mika and a soldier in camouflage uniform and a black beret.  Both had guns slung over their shoulders.  They were standing by a blue Suzuki jeep.  I saw Mika bring out a carton full of grenades and put it on the church steps.  Like the other refugees, I knew that they were grenades only when Mika removed the pin from one of them and threw it through the church window, killing a certain Kayihra by reducing his head to pulp.  The shrapnel wounded four other refugees grievously, but I did not know their fate because I ran away to hide in the sacristy.  I also got shrapnel in my head and neck."  

I think I can stop there, Madam President, and to repeat what I have noted, that based on a declaration or a statement that has already been recognised by the witness, there is a version which mentions "bodies", referring to Kayihra, whereas before the Court, "many bodies" are mentioned.  Now, in regard to the Prosecutor's statement, I don't know whether the procedure forbids the notification of contradictory versions and whether logic permits that two contradictory things can be held as true.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please put this question to the witness and read out this answer given by her during her testimony before this Court last week.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I don't know whether the registry can help us to show to the witness the declaration or the statement as it appears in the Prosecution document.  I'm referring here to the statement of 13 November 1999, paragraph 3, and subsequently the transcript will be presented.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, now would you read out the answer given by her during her testimony before this Court last week?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the references that I have given are still the same.  I'm referring to page 45 of the transcript of 1 April, lines 21 to 24.  Question: "How many persons were wounded inside the church to the best of your knowledge after this attack?"  Answer: "Many people were wounded.  I was afraid, I did not see very much.  There were many bodies.  Many people were hurt."  

I have concluded Madam President.  Perhaps it is best to show the witness the transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, ask your question, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Do you acknowledge your statement dated 13th November 1999 as it appears in the bundle that has just been shown to you?
A.	I am going to tell you what I can repeat.  I don't do not know whether the interpreter has confused the wounded and the bodies.  I cannot accept this.  I said that there were four wounded people and that I saw Kayihra's body.  His head had been shattered.  I did not say that there were many bodies, I said that there was one body and four wounded persons.
Q.	If I understand you correctly, Madam Witness, this is the statement of 1st April that you put into question?
A.	What I said was badly interpreted.  I referred to wounded persons, not bodies.  In respect of bodies, I only referred to the body of Kayihra.
Q.	Madam, do you remember that on the 1st April there was a discussion on this matter, that is regarding whether there was one death or many bodies?
A.	You talked about it, but you did not give me the opportunity to provide an explanation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, she has answered your question.  Please move on to another area.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when we took leave of each other, you had started talking about the identity of the victims, and you were referring in particular to Agnes Mukagatare, who was in a the dispensary, according to you.  How did you know her?
A.	I knew her in the dispensary where she was working because I used to go there to receive medical care.
Q.	Do you have any other means of identifying her?
A.	I also knew her when Mika raped her on the 15th.
Q.	Do you have any idea how old she was at the time of the events?
A.	I do not know her age because I'm neither her mother, nor her sister.
Q.	Did you at least know where she lived?
A.	I do not remember exactly where she lived.  I saw her often at the dispensary, and I know her very well because I saw her at the dispensary.
Q.	Did you have any idea as to her family?
A.	No, I did not know her family.
Q.	Regarding the victim, Collette, can you tell us more about her?
A.	I knew Collette from Mubuga.  She was a normal girl.  I don't know anything else about her.
Q.	Not even her name?
A.	No.
Q.	How about Alphonsine?
A.	Alphonsine also came from Mubuga.  I knew her name, which was Alphonsine, but I did not know her surname.
Q.	What did she do for a living?
A.	All these girls were not employed.  They did not have work.
Q.	Do you have any idea where she lived?
A.	No, I did not know where she lived.
Q.	Anything about the secteur?
A.	I know that she lived in Mubuga because we met during mass, but I did not know the secteur from which she came.
Q.	Are you referring to the cellule?
A.	I did not even know the cellule.
Q.	When you witnessed the rape of Agnes  Mukagatare, you were in a hiding place, weren't you?
A.	Yes, I was in a hideout.
Q.	Can you describe this hideout to us?
A.	I was hiding in a wood that was close to the cemetery.
Q.	You state, Madam Witness, that you were five metres from the scene of the rape.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	Can you give this Court an idea of what five metres means to you?
A.	I only made an estimate when this question was put to me.  You might do the same.
Q.	The question is can you indicate, in reference to the furniture or objects that are within your view, what a distance of five metres might be.  We would like to you indicate to this Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, just give us the estimate from the place where you are sitting and to the place where it should be five metres.
THE WITNESS:
If I make an estimate, it would be from here to where the person who is wearing a uniform is standing, the security officer.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where is the security officer?  That one?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, exactly.  That is the person who is wearing a blue -- sky blue uniform.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I don't know whether a registry technician can tell us whether this distance is close to five metres.  Would it be possible for the Court to grant leave?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We have the sketch for the courtroom.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr Constant, do we have the sketch of the courtroom? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, I have the sketch and I have distributed it to all the judges.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, can you give us the estimate.  Use the tape and get the distance.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, we have the distance between the witness box and the where the security officer is standing is 41 feet, and that is about 12 metres.  Thank you.

MR. SONGA:
The statement by the registrar has not been translated, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you don't have -- 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, I said that the distance between the witness box and where the security officer is sitting is about 41 feet, and is that approximately 12 metres.  Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Has that been translated now?
MR. SONGA:
I have heard Your Honour, and that is why I would like to seek the Court's leave to ask one or two questions regarding the level of education of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, what was your level of education at the time of the events?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what is the relevance of this question to your case? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am aware that the units of measurement and distance are taught very early in schools and I would like to know whether, at the appropriate time, the sincerity of the witness could be tested.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This was just an estimate, Professor, and, Professor, believe me, if you ask me the measurement, I would not be able to give it to you.
MR. SONGA:
I don't believe you, Madam President.  I have always believed what you said, but on this occasion, I do not believe you, because you have been very, very wise in this regard.  Can we proceed, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, between where you were hiding and the place of where the rape occurred, how visible was it?
A.	I was hiding under a tree.  A tree in Kinyarwanda is nyanbobwa.  That tree is called nyankobwa in Kinyarwanda.  That tree doesn't have very leafy branches, and I could therefore see through the branches what was happening.  There was no obstruction of my view.
Q.	And could Mika see you from where he was?
A.	I do not know.  I do not know whether he saw me.
Q.	No, that is not my question.  I'm not asking whether he saw you; I'm asking whether he could see you?
A.	Yes, he could see me.
Q.	Were you running a risk of being seen?
A.	I could see him, and I told myself that if he had paid attention, he could have seen me, but he would have seen me if he knew that I was there, but he did not know that I was hiding in that place in order to try to scan the area and try to see me.
Q.	Witness, we are still talking about your hideout.  Was it limited to the tree?  Was it rather a small bush, or a tuft of trees?
A.	It was a bush, and in that bush was a tree.  It was a small bush and I could see him.
Q.	I don't know whether in Kinyarwanda a small bush and a small tuft of trees could mean the same thing.  Could you shed light on this matter, Witness?
A.	It was not a small tuft of trees, but it was a bush.
Q.	What, then, do you make of your statement of the 29th November 1999 in which you state that you were hiding in a tuft of trees?
A.	It may well be that the interpreter did not know how to properly translate that idea, but I am here now and I'm telling you the truth.  It was a small bush and not a tuft of trees.
Q.	Can I at least have you confirm your statement with the assistance of the registrar?  It is on page 99 of the English version, if I remember correctly.  Witness, do you recognise your signature on that document?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which statement?  The statement recorded by the investigators? 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Madam President, a statement of the 13th November 1999 signed by the witness on the 29th November 1999.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did you show the witness, the Kinyarwanda version?  

Madam Witness, you are looking at the Kinyarwanda version?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am looking at the Kinyarwanda version.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, is there a distinction between a thicket of trees and a bush?  Is that where the Defence issue is?
MR. SONGA:
Yes.  My problem -- and I think that is where I want the witness to clarify the matter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But that is clear, the issue of who is translating it, who was interpreting it, not necessarily the witness.
MR. SONGA:
I can concede your point, Your Honour.  We could always go into the implications in due course.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I don't know.  The subtleties that we speak sometimes are clearly imprecise as to the differentiation between bush and thicket, and so which - the English language or the French language might be very precise.  I don't know that the fact that one person has called it a thicket; and the other one has called it a bush, or even a stand of trees would be a major indication of lack of truth.
MR. SONGA:
I have already stated to you, Your Honour, that I concede your point, but that in due course we may go into the implications of the differences.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you stated that you saw Mika accompanied by many Interahamwe; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How many of them were there?
A.	I was unable to count the number.
Q.	In your opinion, what does "many" mean, or from when do you start saying that there were many?
A.	If there are people that you cannot easily count, then you can say that there are many.
Q.	For instance, more than ten?
A.	There were more than ten of them.  When we refer to a large number, it is obvious that we are talking about more than ten people.
Q.	How could you make out the Interahamwe?  How did you know that they were Interahamwe?
A.	I recognised them by their apparel and their conduct when they were escorting those people.
Q.	To you knowledge, who are Interahamwe?
A.	The Interahamwe are youngsters who committed crimes during the war.
Q.	How were they organised?
A.	Can you repeat your question, Counsel?  I did not quite understand it.
Q.	Are you saying that it was not translated to you?
A.	I did not understand the question you put to me.
Q.	But you heard it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please repeat the question.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who are the Interahamwe?
A.	They were youngsters who were committing crimes during the war.  They were youngsters committing crimes during the war.
Q.	What was their ethnic group?
A.	They were Hutu.
Q.	And was Mika an Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, he was an Interahamwe because he was committing crimes during that period.
Q.	You stated that Agnes unbuttoned her blouse and her skirt and Mika in turn put his gun to the ground and undressed; is that correct?
A.	I did not understand your question.
Q.	In your statement of the 13th November 1999, you stated that Agnes unbuttoned her blouse and her skirt and Mika in turn, after putting his gun on the ground, took the blouse; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  Mika pulled back the blouse.
Q.	But you make mention of a gun or a weapon he put on the ground.  What kind of weapon was that?
A.	It was a gun that was slung over his shoulders.
Q.	Can you say anything more than that?  Can you describe that weapon as you saw it?
A.	It was something that was slung over his shoulder, so it was therefore a gun that was slung over his shoulders, but I don't know the make of that gun.
Q.	Was that all he was carrying?
A.	Apart from that, he had a bayonet.  He was also caring a bayonet.
Q.	Did he keep holding it or did he also put it on the ground?
A.	Before taking off his trousers, he removed the bayonet and put it on the ground next to the gun.
Q.	Are you saying that Mika also took off his trousers as well as the bayonet that was hanging on his trousers?
A.	After giving his shirt to another Interahamwe, he undressed Agnes and asked her to lie on her clothes and then he removed his trousers and his vest.
Q.	I don't know whether it is because you don't see the difference between the statement of the 13th November when you said he pulled down his trousers.  Is pulling down one's trousers the same thing as taking off one's trousers?
A.	Normally when you want to remove your trousers, you pull it down.  You don't pull it up.  That is what is done.
Q.	So he pulled down his trousers with a view to taking it off?
A.	That is exactly what I mean.  That is exactly what you are meant to do.
Q.	Is that what he meant to do, or what he did?
A.	That is what I saw, and that is what he did.
Q.	But if he took it off, Witness, why did you state on 13th November that he pulled it down to knee level?  Is that what you mean by taking it off?  Do you want us to read your statement to you? 
A.	It is not necessary to show it to me because I know that statement.  Normally, when somebody wants to take off his trousers, he doesn't pull it up, he pulls it down, so I saw him pull down his trousers.  I did not state to you that I saw him putting his trousers anywhere, but what I told you was that he pulled it down. 
Q.	I am understanding you very clearly, and we take it, therefore, that your final statement is that he pulled down his trousers to knee level; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  I don't know what happened thereafter, but I saw him pull down his trousers to his knees.
(Pages 1 to 14 by Trevor Gerbes)




























	1600H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And, what was the position of his bayonet at that time, the bayonet that had been suspended to his trousers?
A.	I saw him take it off his trousers, and I saw him when he wanted to hit his victim.  Perhaps we'll get there, but maybe we should already talk about that part of my statement.
Q.	So, he did not put down one weapon but two weapons, his gun and his bayonet?
A.	Yes, the gun and the bayonet.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. You also state that the Interahamwe were waiting at a distance of about ten metres from where the rape occurred; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	You also state that you could not see what Mika was doing; is that correct -- that they could not see what Mika was doing; is that correct?
A.	I am unable to confirm that I saw what they were doing, because I didn't know exactly their position.  I don't know whether they were in a position to look behind them to see what was happening.
Q.	Witness, I would like to draw your attention to your statement of the 1st of April.  During the last session heard by this Chamber, and this is what you stated: "From where I was, I could see the place where Mika raped the girl because there was a small bush between me and the location of the rape, and I could easily see them and hear what they were saying."  

The question:  "The men accompanying Mika, could they see what Mika was doing?" 
"No, they couldn't see that because they were a little withdrawn."  

I am reading the French transcript, Madam President, and I crave your indulgence for that.  Maybe the Registrar could find the English version of that transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Songa, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Once more, Madam President, my aim is to point out disparities between the two versions, that is what is stated before the Chamber and what is found in the written statement.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do we take it that you could not know whether they could see what was happening between Mika and Agnes?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Each Interahamwe left with his partner, is that correct?
A.	That is what I meant to say.  He was their leader.
Q.	My question to you is this, did each of the Interahamwe leave with his partner?
A.	They all did not have partners.  There were only six girls, whereas the Interahamwe were a very many number.
Q.	But that is your statement, Witness, and you said, first, "Each Interahamwe took a girl and each left with their partner and that is when I decided to return to the church."  That is your statement.
A.	That is what I stated.  They could not leave with girls who were not there.  I talked of six girls.  I did not refer to more than six girls.
Q.	Was the statement read out to you?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But Mr. Songa, the statement is not in conflict at all.  All he says is six girls left with one Interahamwe. There is no suggestion in the statement that all the Interahamwe present had each a partner.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I didn't think you were going to try to assist those who drafted the statement.  The subject of the sentence was the Interahamwe and not the girls, but I see no -- 

Madam President, I often concede to such errors.  We could ask the witness to state what she saw and what was stated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you show this part of the statement to the witness? 
MR. SONGA:
(Complying)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please read out the relevant sentence of the written statement to the witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the --
MR. SONGA:
It's page 114 of the statement taken by the Prosecutor and line 1 of the first paragraph.
THE INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters don't have the English version.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the K-number of the page?
MR. SONGA:
In Kinyarwanda?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.
MR. SONGA:
The Registrar has taken my statement and I don't know how I can catch up      

MR. MJUI:
K0284241.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q. Madam Witness.  
MR. SONGA:
     if I may, in the meantime, get my document from the registry, please, I'll be very pleased.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please return the document to the counsel.
MR. SONGA:
I do not know whether I should conclude on this point, however, in the Kinyarwanda version the sentence  is (Kinyarwanda spoken), and so on and so forth, I do not think that this version has been contested.  Madam President, with your leave, I shall try to arrange my papers and I continue.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that it was at this time that you decided to return to the church by crawling, and you continue, "I was able to crawl forward on my stomach and I went back to the church."  Are all these statements correct?
A.	Everything is correct.
Q.	Madam Witness, how much time did you take, how many minutes did you take between your hideout, which was near the cemetery, and the church?
A.	I was not able to evaluate the time.  I wasn't wearing a watch, and I did not have peace of mind.
Q.	This explanation, regarding the absence of a watch on your person, should have been valid on the day when the events took place, not at the time when you are giving testimony.  

What time was it when you decided to crawl?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
It was in the afternoon, but I could not give you a particular time.  I know it was in the afternoon.  It was not in the morning.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I find that you have already answered the question so we shall not insist.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What happened when you arrived at the church?
A.	When I arrived at the church I tried to climb through the window that opens into the sacristy and all of the sudden I heard a gunshot.  People dragged me and helped me to get into the church.  And I saw a projectile next to the church and people immediately helped me to enter the church.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that the Interahamwe saw you and shot at you but the bullet did not hit you; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How did you know that the bullet was fired by an Interahamwe?
A.	Nobody else was killing us during that time.  It was only Interahamwe who were killing.  Those Interahamwe wanted to kill us.  They did not want to save us.
Q.	And where did the bullet end up?
A.	This bullet reached another building.  I heard the bullet whistle, but I could not -- I heard the bullet whine, but I could not tell you where it impacted.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that you crawled.  Based on a diagram that we are going to submit to you, you left the church to go to the dispensary, however, you got blocked in the cemetery by Mika's men.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the diagram requires some explanation and also requires that the witness help us to draw her itinerary In the Prosecution document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this diagram was prepared at the insistence of this witness?
MR. SONGA:
I do not know for what purpose the whole Prosecution exhibit was prepared.  I imagine that it was for the parties. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you shown this diagram to the witness?  You have not shown this diagram to the witness and you have started asking questions of her?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we wanted to show the diagram first.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We should know what you are referring to, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I am referring to document 156.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what do you want to ask the witness, Professor, confirm this drawing?
MR. SONGA:
The Defence -- the concern of the Defence, Madam President, Your Honours, is that, if you look at this sketch and the explanations thereto that appear on the following page, you would situate the church at number 11 and number is -- 11 refers to the Mubuga Catholic Church.  The destination of the witness is the dispensary, which is under point 15, that is the destination. However, the witness is blocked by Mika's attack at point 8.  I would like to show her this and I would like her to explain why she went to number 8, why she followed this itinerary, whereas her destination was point No. 15, which is the dispensary.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But that presupposes she accepts that this is a correct accurate representation of the state of the position, because it is not her drawing, it is a drawing by somebody else and they may not reflect to her whether she gave the correct position.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we are willing to indicate all these locations to her but we would like to ask the question, why this itinerary, while we know that the destination is from 11 to 14, how did she get to point 8?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you willing to have this diagram explained by you to actually enable us to understand your itinerary between the church and the dispensary going through the cemetery?
A.	Show it to me and ask me why I followed this trajectory.  I can explain it to you.  I have problems with my eyes.  I do not see well.  I do not see what is on the sketch very well.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with your leave, my technician, quote, unquote, might explain the diagram to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think a technician will be able to explain the diagram to the witness and you can ask the precise question, Professor, instead of going round and round.
MR. SONGA:
Before I go any further Madam President.  I don't believe I have been understood.  The technician I refer to is a Defence technician and not a registry technician.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, whatever the position, I think if the witness doesn't understand, it is pointless and useless to ask her questions she doesn't understand.  But the witness has said quite clearly she can explain why she moved from point 11 to point 8 to point 15, as indicated on defence exhibit.  So if the witness is given an opportunity to explain, that might simplify matters.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's what I've asked, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I thank the Prosecutor for his intervention.  We shall, therefore, ask Madam Witness, since she does not deny the sketch, we would ask her to tell us why she followed this trajectory, when we know that she was leaving the church for the dispensary, why did she go to the cemetery?
THE WITNESS:
I was looking for a safe track.  There were Interahamwe everywhere, when I took the road to the dispensary I heard people who were shouting.  There are roads going to the dispensary, there are two roads leading to the dispensary, so I came back on my tracks to pass through the woods to go to the dispensary and at that particular time I came up against Mika's attack, so I was blocked.  I was therefore unable to go to the dispensary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, before you proceed, we may remind you the last working day of the last week you asked for 20 minutes and now you have gone almost one and a half hours, so how long you are going to take before you finish your cross-examination?
MR. SONGA:
If the witness is as precise as I am, we might be able to finish in 45 minutes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did you say, 45 minutes, Professor?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor we have deliberated and we intend you have to limit your cross-examination.  At the moment we take a short break for 15 minutes and after that you will be allowed 20 minutes. We will take a short break for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1640H to 1655)
  MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings in the courtroom are resumed. 

Professor before you proceed with your cross-examination, we will remind you that, according to the logistical distribution, the Prosecution has taken 37 minutes for his examination-in-chief and you have, so far taken, two hours and 25 minutes.  Now you have 20 minutes to go.  Please, proceed with your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
May I respond to your finding, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
The way in which you approach the matter is likely to prevent any defence, whatsoever, since the Prosecutor may use one minute, since he has the whole accused file, and we would not be able to defend ourselves.  But I also understand the relevance of your approach, and I shall do everything in my power to respect that, Madam President.  With your permission I shall begin immediately.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state in your signed statement of the 29th of November 1999 that what saved your life was that the Interahamwe, before killing the refugees, asked each of them to stand up and undress; is that correct?
A.	That was my statement.
Q.	Explain to us how that could have saved your life?
A.	When the Interahamwe arrived, they spoke to people and they said, "Stand up."  They asked you to undress, so that they would take your clothes.  "I was not wearing anything.  Nobody asked me to stand up.  They asked somebody who was next to me to stand up.  He stood up.  He was attacked with a machete and his blood sprayed on me and everybody who was attacked with a machete covered us with their blood.  And the Interahamwe did not know whether I had been attacked with a machete or not."
Q.	You have just stated that you were not wearing anything on your person, but the statement was that you understood that the Interahamwe wanted your clothes and you completely removed your clothes.  Is that what saved your life?
A.	It is the good Lord who saved me.  It is not because I had hidden myself better than the others.
Q.	So, having understood that the Interahamwe were looking for clothes, this saved your life?
A.	I was saved not because I had taken my clothes off but, rather, because the Interahamwe were unable to identify me.  I was stained with blood.  I cannot attribute my survival to the fact that the Interahamwe wanted my clothing.
Q.	You state that on the 18th of April 1994 you saw women watch the church and the bodies; is that correct?
A.	They were sitting in front of the church to see who was going to raise their head to convey information that somebody was still alive.  They were not there for anything else.  They were there to see if anybody would show any sign of life.
Q.	So they were not in fact guarding the church?
A.	They were guarding the persons who were in the church or the bodies and not the church itself.  They wanted to ensure that nobody was alive any longer in the church, and if they had noticed that anybody was alive they would give information that there was somebody who was still alive in the church.
Q.	Amongst these women was a certain Rosalie.  Who was Rosalie?
A.	Rosalie is a farmer who resided quite close to a gentleman who hid me during the war.  This woman was my neighbour, she knew me.
Q.	She shouted out your name.  "I saw the witness, I saw the witness."  Do you confirm this?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	She went to give news of you to the party organised by Sikubwabo; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Who told you that there was a party organised by Sikubwabo?
A.	I learnt of it when I was in my hideout with the people who took me in.  I explained how Rosalie had cried out my name.  I told them that I had seen Rosalie leave and sometime later the Interahamwe came and these people told me, 'These are the people who were in Byerahungo where Sikububo invited people to congratulate them on the massacre at the church.'"
Q.	So at the time of events you were not aware there was a party by Sikububo?
A.	I did not know of this.  I learned of this when I arrived at this residence where I was told about it.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that you used this opportunity to move towards the centre of the church, where you hid under the body -- dead bodies; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And then these women, accompanied by a drunk Interahamwe, came to the alter where you were hiding?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	The Defence question is, -- the Defence question is -- and you must clarify this, Madam Witness -- were you at the centre of the church or were you at the alter?
A.	When Rosalie saw me I was at the alter.  I went toward the centre of the church when I realised Rosalie noticed me.  When I saw her leave I told myself that she was going to report to some people.  At that time I left the alter and I went towards the middle of the church, where I sat on the bodies.
Q.	You are contradicting the entire version as it appears in the statement.  It is when Rosalie went to alert Sikububo at the party that you took the opportunity to move towards the centre of the church, and when those who were alerted came back they searched the alter where you were still hiding under bodies.  My question is, were you at the centre of the church or at the alter?  We're no longer referring to Rosalie at this point.
A.	I went towards the middle of the church when I realised that Rosalie would transmit the information.  I left the alter and I went to the middle of the church and I sat on the bodies.
Q.	When the search was conducted were you at the centre or at the alter?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor --
THE WITNESS:
When they came to search I had left the alter.  I was in the middle of the church.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, my insistence is due to the fact that the statement says, during the search she was lying at the alter.  So I would like it to be noted that there is a contradiction.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You were running towards the sacristy; is that correct?
A.	I went towards the sacristy after the departure of the assailants.  When I left the beginning -- the middle of the church when I was sitting on the bodies.
Q.	When Kayishema arrived, what were you doing?
A.	After his arrival I saw many cars, vehicles come.  I thought that they were coming to remove the bodies, because when they killed us there were mechanical implements for digging holes.  And I told myself that they have come to remove the bodies and I was afraid that they would carry me along with the bodies.  I stood up and father Marchal shouted my name.
Q.	When Kayishema came -- my question was, what were you doing?  In which direction did you go?
A.	I was still at the sacristy.  I was at the place near the sacristy.
Q.	Did you go to the sacristy before the arrival or after the arrival of Kayishema?
A.	I went towards the sacristy before the arrival of Kayishema.
MR. KAPAYA:
I don't see where counsel is leading to in crossing the witness that Kayishema.  Kayishema's case ended a long time ago and Kayishema is serving his sentence somewhere in this world.  So I don't understand why we spend time talking about Kayishema when the trial concerns Mr. Mika Muhimana.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, what do you have to say?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, it is not the Prosecutor's place to say things like that.  He, who all through this case has named Mika without giving him the opportunity to defend himself.  In addition, I would like to state that my question is due to the fact there are contradictions that may impugn the credibility of the witness.  I think that the Prosecution should avoid taking initiatives that seem to us to cause us to waste time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, proceed.
MR. SONGA:
I do not know whether my question was answered because of the Prosecutor's objection upset me.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You heard, when Kayishema was at the Bank Popular, you heard people say that the Gishyita people deserve a reward; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How far away were you to be able to hear this statement?
A.	It was quite close, but I did not estimate the distance.  I could see him and I heard him speak.
Q.	Madam Witness, this is between 6 and 7 p.m. on the 18th of April, you are in the sacristy and Father Marchal shouts, "I have seen the witness.  I have seen the witness."  Is this correct?
A.	This is correct.
Q.	This is the same shouts as in Rosalie's case.  Did Father Marchal have access to the sacristy?
A.	He could see me.
Q.	Would you please answer the question?  Did he have access to the sacristy?
A.	I do not know, but he could see me.  I am talking about him because I saw him and I heard him say this.
Q.	You state that the Interahamwe with red eyes arrived, is that correct, Madam Witness?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How did he reach the sacristy?
A.	I did not say that the Interahamwe reached the sacristy.  It is a soldier who came to the sacristy who was in charge of cutting up the Tutsi.  It is this soldier who had red eyes.  The Interahamwe came into the church at the same time as Rosalie.  In the sacristy it was a soldier who was in charge of cutting up the Tutsi who found me there.
Q.	I shall read your statement, Madam Witness.  "Between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., when I was still in the sacristy and I was trying to find a way to run away, Father Marchal saw me and shouted, 'I have seen the witness.  I have seen the witness.'  Immediately an Interahamwe with red eyes arrived and he asked me to stick out my chest and I obeyed him."  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, this was my statement.
Q.	At the time when he was going to pierce your heart, miraculously the lights went out and the sword did not reach you.  Is this your statement?
A.	That was my statement.
Q.	Had he started making the blow or not?
A.	Yes.
Q.	I did not understand.  Had he started making the blow?  I did not understand.
A.	He had already raised his arm and unsheathed the knife but he was unable to reach me with the knife.  There was a power outage, I shivered and the knife passed close to me.
Q.	Was it dark or light?
A.	When there is a power outage there is darkness.  There is no light.
Q.	All right, having taken advantage of the power outage you went out; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you stated that you met Father Marchal.  How did you recognise him?
A.	I just saw him in front of me when he was shouting my name.  And when I came out I remembered what he was wearing.  It is somebody that I knew.  I did not need to ask anybody who he was.
Q.	Was he an Interahamwe?
A.	I am not accusing him of being an Interahamwe, because I did not see him kill anyone.
Q.	Why did he shout when he saw you?
A.	He shouted but he did not come inside to attack me.  
Q.	Once you arrived at the main door you state that you picked up a machete and you began to scream as you ran away; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Madam Witness, so why did you pick up the machete?
A.	I picked it up to pretend that I was an Interahamwe, so that the assailants would not take me for a Tutsi.  Because Marchal was calling and encouraging people to search for the Tua (phonetic) that he had just seen and I wanted to play this game to fool the Interahamwe.
Q.	Were there many women Interahamwe on that day?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Did you see any on that day?
A.	I saw them, even those who were watching us were Interahamwe because they were trying to find out who was going to show any sign of life in order to kill them.  They were there for Interahamwe.
Q.	You state that while you were running away you saw a woman who was in pain and you took her clothes that you put on; is that correct?
A.	It was a young girl, I said it was a young girl and not a woman.
Q.	How were you able to make this distinction?  Did you know her?
A.	I knew this person, but I have forgotten her name.
Q.	Where were you at that point?
A.	I was coming down from the church.  I had just crossed towards the convent.  I went towards the primary school in a place called Mystery and immediately I realised that some persons had been killed near the road.
Q.	You state that you continued running away and then you found a person called Sabusheshe who was a great killer; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you have any means of identifying this person?
A.	Are you referring to Sabusheshe? 
Q.	Where were you when you met him?
A.	I saw him when I immediately came down -- immediately I came down to the road.  He examined me with his torch and I said, "Please, have pity on me."  And when he realised that it was me, using his torch, he shut up.
Q.	And how did you recognise him?
A.	I identified him because I knew him well before.
Q.	Without a torch?
A.	I didn't have a torch, but when I arrived at the road, when I reached the road, I caught him by the chest and when he was very close to me I knew who it was.
Q.	Madam Witness, are you referring to the roadblock guarded by Interahamwe where you met Xavier?
A.	Savier or Xavier was a watchman for the reverend sisters.
Q.	Was he an Interahamwe?
A.	He was not an Interahamwe, because I didn't see him killing anybody; and indeed he helped me.  He didn't kill me.  I would not say he was an Interahamwe.
Q.	And without him being an Interahamwe, how could he help you cross a roadblock set up by the Interahamwe?
A.	Listen, sometimes Interahamwe became human.  Perhaps they pitied me.  I do not know in fact why he didn't kill me; perhaps it was the good Lord who inspired him not to kill me.
Q.	Do you wish to say that Xavier was in fact an Interahamwe?
A.	He was not an Interahamwe because I did not see him kill anyone.
Q.	Why do you say it was because of the good Lord that he did not kill you ?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She said perhaps.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Was Xavier alone at the roadblock?
A.	He was not alone, he was with other persons.
Q.	Where was this roadblock?
A.	The roadblock had been set up on the small road that leads towards the convent and towards the dispensary where the teachers' houses were; that is the teachers of the ENT school.
Q.	How far is it from the church?
A.	I was not able to measure the distance.
Q.	Were you able to estimate the time from when you left the church?
A.	It was difficult for me to measure the time, because I was confused.  I was in a difficult situation, and I was not able to do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your time of 20 minutes is over.
MR. SONGA:
I have only four more questions, Madam President, only four more.  I think I shall be able to finish them within five minutes.  Madam President, you must notice I made an effort.  Such effort may be rewarded.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Due to your effort we guarantee you five minutes, okay.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you once more for your generosity, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state take you took refuge in a certain Mpamera's (phonetic) house?  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you know Mpamera's house before?
A.	Yes, he was my neighbour, so I knew his home.
Q.	So you might tell us what is the distance between the church and Mpamera's residence?
THE INTERPRETER:
Will the Defence please repeat his question for the interpretation?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I was saying that since you knew Mpamera's well before, Madam Witness, you should be able to give us the distance between the church and Mpamera's house?
A.	I was not able to measure this distance.
Q.	Today, now that you are giving testimony before the Court, are you able to estimate this distance?
A.	It's a long time since I went to this place, because I don't live there, so I cannot make an estimate.
Q.	Do you confirm that Mr. Mpamera confirmed your departure on the 29th of May for Zaire?
A.	Yes, I confirm this.
Q.	Were you the only person that was hiding at Mpamera's house?
A.	I was not the only person, there were nine of us in total.
Q.	Do you confirm that you spent two months in Mpamera's?
A.	Yes, I confirm this.
Q.	In your statement of 7 February you state that you saw Mika.
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Do you remember the date?
A.	I do not remember the date.
Q.	Do you remember the time of the month?
A.	I think that it was in the month of June, but I do not remember the date.
Q.	You state that during that time you learned that Rwandans were going to this island to ask inhabitants of the island to kill Tutsi targets in exchange for goods; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, Madam Witness, I'm going to ask the very last question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you learn that there were other cases or just one case had happened on the island?
A.	We could see the bodies of people who had been killed and there is a gentleman of the Jswe island who disappeared and following the situation I no longer went often to the hills, but I saw bodies of killed Tutsis.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, it was not prudent of me to state this was the last.  I will ask one last one.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	If you say that somebody -- if he was killed, is this somebody who came from that island or somebody else?
A.	It was refugees, people who had taken refuge on the island who were the target of killings, and so it was a refugee.
Q.	I would be eternally grateful to you if you were able to give the name of this person, both for this and for your entire testimony, Madam Witness.
A.	You want to know the name of the victim or the name of the person who told me about it?
Q.	The victim, Madam Witness.
A.	I did not know their names.  I saw bodies and I could note that they were refugees, but I did not know their names.
MR. SONGA:
I promised to thank you, to be eternally grateful.  I will just thank you for your willingness.  

Madam President, thank you for your patience.  I shall close with my cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you Professor.  

Any re-examination?
MR. KAPAYA:
No re-examination, Your Honour.
(Pages 15 to 28 by R. Lear)


















1730H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you testified that on the 15th of April, around 10 a.m., you were located inside the church when Mika came with a box of grenades, and that he threw one of the grenades into the church.  You were also asked whether Mika came -- actually entered the church, and you said that he did not get inside the church.  Are you able to give an estimate of distance between where you were located and where you allege Mika was standing when he threw the grenade?  Are you able to give an estimate of the distance between where you were and where you say you saw Mika standing before you say he threw the grenade?
A.	I think that it would be difficult for me to make an estimate of the distance.  However, Mika was behind the window near -- quite near the steps and I was at one end of the church. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for having come to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to exit. 
(Witness excused)
MR. KAPAYA: 
Your Honours, while the Witness is being escorted, can I make the application which I intimated to you I would make in the course of the proceedings? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, Your Honour.  We have two witnesses, BI and BG, who are ready to testify immediately after this witness.  Now, BI has certain problems.  If you look on item 7 on his personal particulars, you will see that he holds a certain position in his country, and before he came here he had -- he had done some matters -- he has collected some money from people in his area for purposes of the genocide anniversary which is taking place the day after tomorrow, that is, on the 7th.  So the witness has requested that we take his testimony today so that he may be able to leave on -- so that he may be able to leave and then -- so that he may be able to leave before the 7th and attend the ceremony on the 7th.  Alternatively, Your Honour, if it is not possible to take his testimony, we request that he be released from giving evidence this week so that he goes back and then comes back after, say, a week or two.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you have another witness, BG, ready? 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, we have BG ready, Your Honours, and five others.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I would like to point out that this change in the schedule was brought to our attention by the Prosecutor only at 1 p.m., and we really are not ready to hear BI.  However, we are ready to listen to BG.  I believe the Prosecutor should be attentive to the efforts made by the Defence so that we follow the schedule and avoid such surprises that throw us off balance.  

We of the Defence are willing to allow BI to be heard subsequently because the anniversary of the genocide should not be considered as an unexpected event because it has been on the schedule for long.  And since the end of December, I have been asking the Chamber to bear in mind that I am parliamentarian in my country, but I have never been allowed to take a day off, and I have been asked to be permanently at the disposal of the Court.  

I would be ready to have BG followed by BJ, and BI could appear subsequently. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, as you proposed, let this Witness BI be examined next week. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, call Witness BG. 

Mr. Kapaya, this will be PW 6?
MR. KAPAYA:
It will be PW 6, Your Honour.

I am sorry, Your Honour, he's - she's going to be PW 8.
MR. CONSTANT:
Your Honour, from the point of view of the registry, this is Witness PW 5.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. MADENGA: 
With your leave, Madam President, I will say good afternoon; good afternoon to all the colleagues in Court.  While we are waiting for the witness to be brought, we just made a spelling list of common names.  I think it has been distributed to relevant parties.  And I would also like the registry to distribute the protected information of Witness BG, who is Prosecution Witness No. 5.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Good evening, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:

testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, a very good afternoon to you. 
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	Thank you.  In front of you is a document containing your protected witness information.  You will recall you have already confirmed your personal details.  I want to draw your attention to the signature.  Can you confirm that you appended your signature to this document we are looking at?
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, that is indeed my signature.
Q.	Thank you. 
MS. MADENGA: 
The follow-up question was:  Can she also confirm that those are the personal details relating to her?
THE WITNESS:
If you will allow me, I will take time to read all the particulars contained on that document on this page. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please do. 

THE WITNESS:
I observe that the information on this page contains my identification.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, madam. 

With your leave, Your Honour, the Prosecution would want to tender this document as Prosecution Exhibit No. 8.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Information sheet of Witness BG is entered as Exhibit P. 8, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 8 admitted, under seal)
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you at any stage in 1994 seek refuge at Mugonero complex?
A.	Yes, I sought refuge there.
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you sought refuge at Mugonero complex?
A.	We sought refuge in Mugonero complex because of the prevailing situation in which Tutsis were threatened and Tutsis (sic) were tracking them down, even in their homes. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Can you tell the Court who was tracking Tutsis?
A.	It was the Hutus who wanted to kill the Tutsis.
Q.	Do you know why the Hutus wanted to kill the Tutsis?
A.	I don't know the reason.  We had already seen them killing others. 
Q.	Do you recall, in terms of deaths, when the Hutus started killing the Tutsis?
A.	I believe the killings did not all start at the same time; for instance, in Mugonero they started on the 16th of April, but  -- while, before that date, the killings had started elsewhere.  I would say that the signal for the killings was given in Gishyita on the 8th, and it was from that date that we saw people coming and telling us that they had been attacked. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I want you to explain to the Court the ethnic makeup of those people who were coming claiming that they had been attacked. 
A.	The people who were fleeing and saying that they were being attacked belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	When you sought refuge at the Mugonero complex, who was with you?
A.	I was with my two children, and we met many other people there.
Q.	Can you tell us what was the ethnic group of your children?
A.	They were Tutsi.  They were Tutsi.
Q.	How old were your children at the time you sought refuge at Mugonero complex?
A.	The eldest was age seven and the youngest was age three. 
Q.	Can you also tell us what subsequently -- tell us what happened to your children, age seven and three at that time?
A.	Since the massacres had spread and people had already understood that the Tutsis were being targeted, one Hutu woman who was my friend thought that I was at risk of being killed with my children and she came to see me on several occasions.  But she could not find me because at the time it was -- you couldn't find somebody in a crowd of refugees.  People told me she came to look for me, and since people were being killed easily, they came to tell me that our survival could not be guaranteed, and she asked me to entrust my children to her.  I entrusted my children to her as someone who was a friend and in whom I had confidence.  

So I told myself, if they survive, the children will also survive, but if they are killed, I can't do anything else.  I can't go with you, I said, because I am an adult.  I told her to come to me and that if it was possible, I could entrust them to a friend.  So she left with my children because, as you know, there were people who were kind.  There were still some people who were kind.  She left with my children subsequently.  She did not know what happened to me.  She didn't know whether I was alive or dead, and after the war and after the genocide I was lucky because I survived the events, and I was lucky to see that my children were still with her and she returned them to me.
Q.	Thank you, madam, for sharing that story relating to your children.  

I want now to focus with you on the 16th.  You mentioned that there was an attack on the 16th of April.  Can you please tell the Court what happened on the 16th of April?  Who attacked the complex?
A.	The Mugonero complex is quite big, and a large number of people had assembled there.  Since the killings had started on the 8th, people who had come from various locations around that complex had gathered there in large numbers.  You'd understand that from the 8th to the 16th, a large number of people had sought refuge in that complex.  So, on the 16th of April, in the morning, a large number of people, many Interahamwe, came and they were led by Bourgmestre Sikubwabo, Conseiller Mika, as well as many other Interahamwe leaders.  There was also Dr. Gerard; in brief, a lot of influential people.  That morning, at 8 a.m., they came on board several vehicles, and before they got to the hospital, very close to the hospital, where the headquarters of the Adventist Church was situated, they parked their vehicles there, and the refugees -- informed those who were there, "Come and see what was happening."  People were coming close.  And we went closer to see what was happening and we noticed that on board the vehicles, the various personalities alighted, mainly Sikubwabo, Mika and -- you will understand that a large number of people -- a large number of attackers took part in that attack.  They came in large numbers. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  

I want to take you back to the evidence which you have just told the Court.  You mentioned that there was a large number of refugees.  Can you approximate how many refugees were there?
A.	To tell you the truth, I did not count the number of refugees.  If I give an estimate, I would say that there could have been 50,000, a bit more or less.  I did not count them, but if you tried to make an assessment of the size of the complex and the capacity it had to contain people, I would say that there couldn't have been less than 50,000. 
Q.	You also mentioned that they came from various locations.  Were you able to establish some of the locations they came from?
A.	They came from various locations, Nyariabwo (phonetic), Matamo (phonetic), Kibingu, Mubuga.  They came from all the surrounding secteur around Mugonero complex.
Q.	Let's talk about the Interahamwe.  You said they were led by Mika.  Who is Mika?
A.	I knew Mika in his capacity as conseiller for Gishyita secteur.
Q.	For how long had you known Mika?
A.	I have known Mika since 1992.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know the surname of this person you are referring to as Mika?
A.	His surname is Muhimana.
Q.	At what stage did you see Mika leading the Interahamwes?
A.	I saw Mika Muhimana on several occasions.  I saw him in the first Interahamwe attack targeting the Mugonero complex.  I saw him in attacks launched on the Bisesero hills on several occasions.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Let's go back to when you saw Mika leading Interahamwes at Mugonero.  How close were you to Mika Muhimana when you first saw him?
A.	I wouldn't be able to give an estimate of the distance, but I was in the hospital parking lot under a tent, and that is where I saw him.
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
A.	It was at the headquarters of the Adventist Church.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

From that distance, I just want you to describe to the Court, in terms of vegetation, was there anything between where you were and where you first saw Mika?
A.	There was nothing obstructing my view.  It was on the road; there was no forest so the visibility was quite good in that area. 
Q.	Now, this person you are referring to as Mika Muhimana, can you identify Mika Muhimana?
A.	I saw him immediately I entered this courtroom.
Q.	Where is Mika Muhimana sitting?
A.	He is sitting to my left from where I am sitting.
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	He is wearing a black cap.

MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, I notice that the witness is distressed.  Maybe, if I can ask the Court's assistance to ascertain whether she is in a position to continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness?  Madam Witness, are you okay?
THE WITNESS:
Please, give me a short while to regain my -- to come back to myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you okay now? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I believe I can continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor, please continue. 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, I will distract the witness's mind to other issues and I will come back to this issue later.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has also identified the Accused in the court. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, let's now move to details of the attackers.  Can you describe to the Court whether they were armed or not armed?
A.	They were armed.
Q.	Now, can we specifically talk about Mika Muhimana.  Was Mika armed or not?
A.	He was armed.
Q.	Did you see what Mika was carrying?
A.	Yes, I saw him.  I saw what he was carrying.
Q.	What was Mika carrying?
A.	He was armed with a gun.
Q.	What then happened when you saw Mika armed with a gun?  And you have already indicated that he was leading the Interahamwe.  Can you describe to the Court what you personally saw?
A.	Mika was armed with a gun, and he slung the gun over his shoulders when he alighted from the vehicle.  When they arrived in that area, there were many Interahamwe who were arriving there.  They did not immediately shoot at the refugees; they assembled, and after that they fired.  
You asked me a question about arms.  Some were armed with guns, others with machetes, others with spears, others were carrying clubs with nails; and these are the arms they used to kill people with. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Now I want you to tell the Court what happened to you during the course of the attack?
A.	They fired.  We were not at all surprised at that.  We were expecting that they would also attack us.  It was necessary to run.  We couldn't go very far because the area was surrounded.  There was no hiding place.  I went to the church, which was very near the hospital.  That was a chapel in the complex.  The Interahamwe came and they fired.  They forced open the doors and windows, threw grenades into the building and we were wounded by shrapnel.  And when they came in through the door, I managed to pass out through a small door behind the church.  

I didn't know where to go.  I came out and I went to the hospital.  They were raining bullets on us.  I went into the hospital.  I stayed in there.  Many gunshots were fired throughout the day from 8 a.m., and if I were to go -- I could go back a little.  And when I went into the church, since we were with men, we tried to defend ourselves with stones.  We threw stones, and apparently they were afraid, and I believe they were waiting for others to join them.  And since you cannot confront bullets with stones, I therefore had to leave that area through the small door.  They shot at people and they died in large numbers.  There was a lot of blood everywhere.  They even threw petrol in that area and set it on fire.   But since there was a lot of blood all over, the fire was put out.  In any case, it was a very, very difficult situation to cope with.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  I understand it was a very, very difficult situation.  

I want to take you to where you said you were wounded.  Can you tell the Court what injuries you personally sustained?
A.	I was wounded on the left leg.
Q.	How did you leave Mugonero complex; at what stage, during or after the attack?
A.	We stayed in the complex in the midst of the bodies, and at about one o'clock in the morning, since they had come back -- I think that they had gone to rest -- I took advantage of the calm to leave the complex.  I climbed towards the Gitwa hill where I passed that night.  When it was close to morning, I continued towards Bisesero.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I appreciate that in that situation, it is difficult to recall dates, but can you approximate the date you went to Bisesero?
A.	It was on the night of the 16th to the 17th of April.  It was on that night that I climbed towards Gitwa.  I did not stay there the whole day because I had arrived towards morning, and I immediately continued towards Bisesero on the date of the 17th of April.
Q.	Why did you choose to go to Bisesero?
A.	Even if many people had taken refuge in the complex, people were saying that others had taken refuge in Bisesero.  People thought that the assailants would not come to turn the people out of the bush.  There were many hills.  We thought that it was far and that the assailants would not come.
Q.	Did you find it safe in Bisesero?
A.	I did not find any safety in Bisesero.  The situation did not change.
Q.	In fact, you indicated earlier on that the second time you saw Mika Muhimana was in Bisesero.  Do you want to explain to the Court the circumstances under which you saw Mika Muhimana in Bisesero?
A.	I saw Mika in Bisesero with attacks in the same way as the ones I saw in Mugonero.  I saw him several times.
Q.	Do you recall how many times you saw Mika Muhimana in Bisesero?
A.	No, I would not be able to determine how many times I saw him.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what Mika Muhimana was doing on the several occasions you saw him in Bisesero area?
A.	The people who were leaders came with assailants.  They had come to kill.  They did not come to save lives.
Q.	Did you see any of them killing?
A.	All these persons did not leave without having killed.  In Bisesero, there were many people, and these people did not die of disease; they were killed. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  When you talk of "many people," can you explain to the Court their ethnic makeup, the people who were in Bisesero?
A.	They were of the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	Can you also tell the Court their ages?  Did you observe their ages?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you are referring to the ages of the refugees?
MS. MADENGA: 
The refugees. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How will the witness know their --
THE WITNESS:
There were people of various ages.  There were children; there were old people.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Madam Witness.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you know a person by the name Mugonero (phonetic)?
A.	Yes, I know this person. 
Q.	How do you know this person called Mugonero?  Can you clarify to the Court who is Mugonero?
A.	Mugonero was an Interahamwe.  He was a big Interahamwe.  They had their organisation.  He was amongst the great Interahamwe who led a team.  This Mugonero that I know was in the company of other Interahamwe, and this was on the 22nd.  I cannot forget this date.  They found us in Bisesero; this is high up in the mountains.  That is where we were hiding.  We were hiding from the attacks, and we were going to -- towards the summit, and there we also encountered the attacks, so we had to hide in a bush.  We were constantly afraid of being found.  

On this day of the 22nd, it was in the afternoon but I cannot determine the hour, but I might say it was around 3:30 p.m.  They rousted us.  We were eight persons, if I remember correctly.  So they found us out and they made us -- they made us climb to the summit.  I did not know these Interahamwe; there were many.  They brought us close to a road and they asked us to sit down there.  We were not going to do anything else -- they were not going to do anything else, apart from kill us.  They asked us to stretch out.  They wanted to make their task easier.  

This Interahamwe, Mugonero, I was able to know his name.  He asked and he said to Mika to give me to him so that he would rape me.
MS. MADENGA: 
Your Honour, at this stage I also notice that the witness is very upset and distressed.  Maybe we can also give a short break to regain her composure.  In fact, Your Honour, I notice that the witness is crying, and similarly she doesn't have a handkerchief.  So, with the leave of the Court, if I can ask registry to --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Give the witness some tissues.  
MS. MADENGA:
And also, Your Honour, assessing how things are going, I think I will make a request that a member of the witness support group be allowed to sit with the witness because I can see that she is very traumatised.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you okay?  Do you need somebody from the witness support section to be beside you?
THE WITNESS:
If it is possible, I would like somebody from the witness support section to come.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor Songa.  What do you have to say about the presence of the -- of somebody from support section?
MR. SONGA: 
We have nothing to say on the matter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let somebody come from the support section and be seated beside the witness.

Madam Witness, can we proceed with your evidence now?

It has been communicated to us that the witness wants a short break for ten minutes, so we take a short break for ten minutes. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Court recessed from 1720H to 1740H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the court are resumed.  

Madam Witness, can you proceed with your evidence?  

Mr. Issa, please, mike.  

Can we proceed with the evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
I think we can continue.  If I have a problem, I will point it out.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to welcome you.  I also want to thank you for your strength.  I also want you to know that I appreciate it is very difficult, but it is also very important for the Court to know exactly what happened.  So I will take you back to the stage where you indicated that Mugonero asked Mika to take you and rape you.  Who else was in the company of Mugonero?
A.	Mugonero was in the company of Mika and other Interahamwe.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Do you recall what Mugonero actually said when he asked for Mika that he wants to take you?
A.	This is what he told him.  He said he wanted Mika to hand me over to him so that he should smell the body of a Tutsi woman.
Q.	Do you know what he meant by that, what Mugonero meant by wanting to smell the body of a Tutsi woman? 
A.	He precisely meant that he wanted to rape me.  He did not know me.  He wanted to rape me.  He wanted to taste the body of a Tutsi woman, as he said.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  What did Mika say when Mugonero presented that request?
A.	He wasn't going to tell him anything else.  He allowed me to take -- he allowed him to take me.  He took me away.  Mugonero could not claim the right to take me without permission from the chief, so he had to first of all talk to the chief.  And when he made his request, Mugonero took me away and the others were killed.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Who killed the others?
A.	They were killed by other Interahamwe who were accompanying Mika.
Q.	When the refugees you mentioned were being killed, what was Mika doing?
A.	He wasn't doing anything.  They had come to kill.  Those refugees were killed. 
Q.	You have already mentioned it, but for clarification, do you recall how many people were killed -- the refugees?
A.	I do not quite understand your question.  Are you referring to the refugees who were with me or the refugees who were killed on that hill?
Q.	I am specifically referring to the refugees who were with you when you were discovered by Mika and the Interahamwes, including Mugonero.
A.	There were eight of us.
Q.	And those who were killed, they were killed by whose order?
A.	They had received the orders to kill well before then, but since we were in front of a very influential person like Mika, he did nothing to stop the killings from being committed.  Those people were killed in the presence of Mika.  In any case, it is difficult for me to say so.  I didn't see exactly how each of them was killed.  They -- all I know is that they were groaning in pain and they died. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You also indicated that Mugonero took you.  Where did Mugonero take you to?
A.	He took me to his house in an area called Muramba in Gishyita commune -- Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Can you approximate, in terms of the time you took, how far that place was from Bisesero to where you were captured in the place in Gishyita?
A.	I don't quite remember.  On our way we met Interahamwe.  What I know is that we arrived in his house at night.  I believe it was about 8 p.m.  It was night time and wasn't clear. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Did Mugonero say anything to you when he took you from Bisesero to his place in Gishyita?
A.	He did not speak to me on our way.  He did not know me.  He led me.  He gave me his spear to carry for him. 
Q.	Did you carry the spear?
A.	Yes, I carried that spear.
Q.	Madam Witness, I just want you to tell the Court, how were you feeling when you carried Mugonero's spear. 
A.	I don't think it is easy for me to make my situation clear.  I felt that my days were numbered.  I understood that he was going to kill me with that spear, but I was obliged to carry that spear.  
Q.	(Microphone overlapping)?
A.	I didn't feel safe at all.
MS. MADENGA:
I am sorry, Your Honour, I did not realise that the translation was still ongoing.  I just indicated to my witness that I appreciate her sharing that experience with us.  

Now I want to proceed and explain to my witness that I appreciate that it's very difficult, but I want her to describe in her own words what happened from the time they arrived at Mugonero -- Mugonero's place.
THE WITNESS:
We therefore left.  We arrived at the hour I indicated.  When we arrived in his house, he asked me to undress in order to sleep with him.  I first of all refused.  You cannot sleep with somebody you don't know and you have never loved.  And he told me that if I refused, he was going to pierce me through and through with the spear.  He did what he did.  That is how it happened.  He therefore did what he had all along wanted to do. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  What were you wearing?
A.	I was wearing ordinary clothes, as people wear in Rwanda: a skirt, a shirt or a pullover. 
Q.	How did Mugonero undress you?
A.	Try to understand how somebody can undress another who is unwilling.  He undressed me brutally.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, I understand.  Do you recall what Mugonero was wearing?
A.	I do not recall what he was wearing.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  We will proceed.  Did Mugonero proceed to have sexual intercourse with you?
A.	Yes, he had sexual intercourse with me.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  It is also important for me to know how many times he had sexual intercourse with you on this day.
A.	He had sexual intercourse with me on three occasions.
Q.	For how long did you stay at Mugonero's place?
A.	I stayed there for three days.
Q.	I know it's difficult to recall, but I want to find out from you whether you can recall the dates when you were at Mugonero's place?
A.	As I stated to you at the beginning, the date of the 22nd was the darkest -- one of the darkest days in my life.  So I stayed there on the 22nd, the 23rd, and I left that place on the night of the 23rd and the 24th.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, I also want you to tell the Court whether this -- we were talking of the first night, when you said Mugonero had sexual intercourse with you on three occasions.  After this incident, did Mugonero have sexual intercourse with you?
A.	During the three nights I spent in his house, as I pointed out to you, he had sexual intercourse with me. 
Q.	Can you also tell the Court how you spent the days at Mugonero's place.  Who were you in the company of from the 22nd to the 23rd?
A.	Are you asking me how I spent the days?  You should understand yourself the conditions under which I was living.  I was visiting that place for the first time.  I was in the house of somebody I didn't know.  He didn't take me to his house because he loved me.  He left me in his house.  He left very early -- the assailants usually left very early to go and kill people -- and before leaving he locked me in his room.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness, I understand; and you indicated those were your darkest days.  So I also want to know from you, when you say, "He locked me inside," were you allowed to leave the room?
A.	I never left that room.  I could not do that, by the way.  Even when he was going out to carry out attacks, he left Interahamwe in the house to keep watch over the house.  So I could not leave that room because I didn't know where to go.  So I therefore could not leave the room to go outside. 
Q.	Thank you very much, I understand.  Can you also tell the Court how you sustained yourself in terms of sanitary requirements?
A.	I lived under very, very poor conditions.  Because there was no health care during the war, I could not receive health care.  I could not afford health care.  I don't know whether you want to know how I was treated during the war or before the war.  Please explain this issue better.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Let me clarify that issue.  I am looking at the period 22nd to the 23rd of April where you said you were locked in a room by Mugonero.  So my question was, when you were locked and you couldn't go anywhere, how did you manage to sustain yourself in terms of -- if you want to go, like, to the toilet, what would happen? 
A.	Given the situation at the time, everyone knows that the brain works in accordance with the situation in which the person is.  To tell you the truth, I didn't go out during the day, but when he came in the middle of the night, I do recall that during the three nights I spent at his house I asked him once to allow me to go to the toilet. 
Q.	Did you also -- did you get food during the course of your stay at Mugonero's house?
A.	It was not easy to eat because I was worried.  At one time I remember that Mugonero's mother came, knocked on the window, and I opened it.  Mugonero had told me that somebody was going to provide me with food, and I thought that that was the person who had come, so I opened the window -- a window which was, by the way, quite large, quite big, and it was positioned in such a manner that I could receive something that was handed out to me.  I opened, and I asked the old woman where she was coming from, and she told me she was Mugonero's mother and she handed a bowl to me.  I believe she came on one or two occasions.  Those are the circumstances under which I lived. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:

Madam President, I think it's an appropriate time to stop.
