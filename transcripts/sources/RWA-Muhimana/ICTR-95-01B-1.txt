10       MR. PRESIDENT:
11             Would the Registrar read the indictment.
12       MR. SPENCER:
13            Your Honour, before the Registrar begins, I have
14            one preliminary matter. In the first amended
15            indictment, Paragraph 10, the beginning of the
16            second sentence, this is the English version.
17       MR. PRESIDENT:
18            Yes, Mr. Spencer.
19      MR. SPENCER:
20            The word "lead" should be the past tense "led".    It
21            is led by the Ministry of Defence.
22       MR. PRESIDENT:
23             In second line ?

 1            sentence, it should say "it is led by the Ministry
 2            of Defence rather than " is lead by the Ministry of
 3            Defence?    It is clearly a grammatical error,
 4            typographical error.
 5       MR. PRESIDENT:
 6            Yes.
 7       MR. SPENCER:
 8            And also, Judge, I discussed with the Registrar
 9            that it may not be necessary to read the entire
10            indictment since only part of it applies to this
11            particular accused. I don't know whether you want
12            me to go into that further or not.
13       MR. PRESIDENT:
14            No, I think that's understood.
15       MR. SPENCER:
16            Thank you, Your Honour.
17       MR. PRESIDENT:
18            Only those portions that refers to him is necessary
19            to be read.

 2            I think this is a very minor amendment.

 7              buildings.   This practice, which was
 8              widely known, was based on the fact that
 9              in the past Tutsis who had sought refuge
10              in such places had not been attacked.
11              Thus, during the period of time relevant
12              to this indictment, groups of people
13              seeking refuge in the same area were most
14              likely predominantly -- sorry,
15              predominantly Tutsi.

17              Number 14.   Also, during the times
18              relevant to this indictment, the Rwandan
19              government required all Rwandans to carry,
20              at all times, identity cards that
21              designated the bearer's status as Hutu,
22              Tutsi, Twa or "naturalized".   Individuals
23              seeking Tutsis could identify their
24              targets simply by asking individuals to
25              show their identification card.

17   MR. PRESIDENT:
18                    For purposes of the record, I would like
19                    to indicate that there is simultaneous
20                    interpretation in French and Kinyarwanda
21                    with regard to this indictment.
22
23                    Mr. Muhimana, we understand that you
24                    received a copy of this indictment in
25                    Kinyarwanda.   Is that correct?   Can he put

 2   THE ACCUSED:
 3                    Yes, I received it.
 4   MR. PRESIDENT:
 5                    Yes, very well.    And you understand what
 6                    it says?
 7   THE ACCUSED:
 8                    Mr. President, your Honours, I do not know
 9                    how I can express myself.    I do not quite
10                    understand the situation.
11   MR. PRESIDENT:
12                    Just one moment.    Tell him one moment.
13                    Ask him to wait while I say something to
14                    him.
15
16                    I wish you to give me a direct answer to
17                    the question that I put to you, not to
18                    give me a statement.    You said you have
19                    received the indictment in Kinyarwanda.
20                    That is a language you say you understand.
21                    Is that correct?
22   THE ACCUSED:
23                    Yes, I received a document, the
24                    indictment, in Kinyarwanda.

 1                    And you read it?
 2   THE ACCUSED:
 3                    Yes, I read it but I was not able to have
 4                    counsel with whom I should have examined
 5                    the document because I do not quite
 6                    understand it.
 7   MR. PRESIDENT:
 8                    You don't understand Kinyarwanda?
 9   THE ACCUSED:
10                    I understand the Kinyarwanda language but
11                    since these matters related to law, I did
12                    not have someone with whom to examine the
13                    points of law contained in the document.
14                    I do not know whether I can continue and
15                    express my opinion.
16   MR. PRESIDENT:
17                    The issue we are dealing with today is
18                    merely the issue of your plea as to
19                    whether you are pleading guilty or not
20                    guilty.   There is nothing really
21                    complicated about that.
22   THE ACCUSED:
23                    I do not understand the points in the
24                    indictment because they are legal matters
25                    and I did not have anyone to explain them

 2   MR. PRESIDENT:
 3                    Just a moment.    Just a moment.   Mr.
 4                    Kiritta, did you have an opportunity to
 5                    discuss the issues with the accused?
 6   MR. KIRITTA:
 7                    I did, but I think that the problem arises
 8                    from the fact that the indictment as it
 9                    stands is very complex.    It gives the
10                    background of the problems in Rwanda, it
11                    gives particulars of certain instances,
12                    but what I think should be done, each
13                    count should be put to him and ask him to
14                    plead it, to plead to it.
15   MR. PRESIDENT:
16                    Yes.   Well, we're coming to that but we
17                    are trying to see if there is some
18                    understanding as to what took place.      We
19                    are going to come to the actual pleading
20                    of the indictment but we are just trying
21                    to establish --
22   MR. KIRITTA:
23                    I am not his defence counsel.      I am just a
24                    duty counsel.

 1                    Yes, I understand.
 2   MR. KIRITTA:
 3                    I did advise him that if you go to court
 4                    and the indictment is read to you, you
 5                    should just say "not guilty", but as I see
 6                    it, I think it's rather complex for him to
 7                    understand exactly what this thing is.
 8   MR. PRESIDENT:
 9                    Yes.   But, of course, it is just a matter
10                    of plea and if he is pleading not guilty,
11                    there is no problem, really.
12   MR. KIRITTA:
13                    Yes, but I would suggest that it can't be
14                    put to him.
15   MR. PRESIDENT:
16                    Very well.    Thank you very much.
17
18                    Please ask the accused to come up.       Please
19                    ask the accused to come up.
20                    We are not getting any interpretation.
21   THE ACCUSED:
22                    I am not in a position to enter a plea in
23                    the absence of my counsel.     I would
24                    request that I be assigned counsel, and

 4                    examine together the indictment in a
 5                    manner that I should have liked.
 6   MR. PRESIDENT:

14                    I wrote, I wrote to ask for -- to ask that
15                    the list of counsel be given to me so that
16                    I should be in a position to choose

18                    of counsel was not given to me.

20                    Mr. Registrar, can you help us here

22                    given a list of counsel about a week ago.

 2                    I had is that the Accused was ready to

 4                    assistance of the duty counsel, Mr.

 8                    that.

13   MR. PRESIDENT:
14                    Mr. Muhimana, today we are not dealing
15                    with any complicated legal issues.     We are
16                    simply dealing with your plea.     If you are
17                    pleading not guilty, then there is no
18                    issue that arises.
19   THE ACCUSED:
20                    I cannot plead guilty or not guilty
21                    because I do not understand the
22                    indictment.    I would consequently ask you
23                    or request you to give me a list of
24                    counsel so that I should be able to choose

 3                    Well, you have had the benefit of duty
 4                    counsel.   You have had the indictment in
 5                    Kinyarwanda, and I feel it's important
 6                    that we move the process forward, so we
 7                    are going to take your plea.    It's up to
 8                    you what you want to do.     If you won't
 9                    plead, then we will enter a plea of not
10                    guilty with respect to the Counts.
11   THE ACCUSED:
12                    As far as the duty counsel is concerned, I
13                    must confess that we never had the
14                    opportunity of studying the indictment per
15                    se.   I've always insisted and requested

 6                    I was only asked to go to the detention
 7                    centre and talk to him about today, and I
 8                    did that three times.    And I did explain
 9                    to him that you only wanted this morning
10                    for the plea to be taken.

 1   MR. PRESIDENT:
 2                    I'm going to bring to your attention the
 3                    requirement of the rules, Rule 62, Initial
 4                    Appearance of the Accused, and I'll read
 5                    to you 62(iii):
 6
 7                    "The Trial Chamber shall:   call upon the
 8                    accused to enter a plea of guilty or not
 9                    guilty on each count; should the accused
10                    fail to do so, enter a plea of not guilty
11                    on his behalf."
12
13                    You have refused to plead on Count 1 and
14                    therefore the Chamber has entered a plea
15                    of not guilty on your behalf.
16
17                    Judge Dolenc wishes to ask you a question.
18   JUDGE DOLENC:
19                    Which particular part of Count 1 which was
20                    read just now by presiding judge you
21                    haven't understood?   Which particular part
22                    of this Count 1 you haven't understood?
23   THE ACCUSED:
24                    What I do not understand with respect to
25                    this indictment is that I requested that I

 2                   him I should be able to study the -- the
 3                   issues raised in this indictment,
 4                   otherwise -- otherwise, I cannot enter a
 5                   plea because I do not know what it is all
 6                   about.
 7   JUDGE DOLENC:
 8                   Just this, then you have understood but
 9                   you don't know what is the legal -- the
10                   legal significance?
11   THE ACCUSED:
12                   That is the reason why I am asking you to
13                   assign to me counsel because I cannot
14                   enter a plea so long as I do not
15                   understand what it is -- the indictment is
16                   about.    This is also an opportunity for me
17                   to request that all documents to be
18                   transmitted to me should be transmitted in
19                   the Kinyarwanda language which I
20                   understand.    I would also request the
21                   court that whenever I will appear before
22                   this court, I should be able to choose an
23                   interpreter.

17                    counsel to explain to me, I cannot enter a
