MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session now. 

May we have the appearances for the Prosecution, please?
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours, good afternoon, members of the Defence.  The Prosecution is represented by Mr. Phillips, myself, Mrs. Madenga and Ms. Kabasinga.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Yes, for the Defence, please? 
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon to my learned colleagues of the Prosecution.  This is Nyabirungu Mwene Songa, lead counsel for Mikaeli Muhimana; Mr. Richard Kazadi Kabimba, co-counsel; Mr. Léopold Munderede and Mr. Mathias Sahinkuye, legal assistants.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

The Accused Mika Muhimana has been examined by Dr. Chamba yesterday, that is 13th of April.  We received his medical certificate.  He's been declared fit, physically fit, to attend the Court.  The Accused is present in the Court so we proceed with the hearing. 

This is Witness AW, Prosecutor? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we proceed to --
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we have a small problem with this -- the statements of this witness.  The statement which is in the witness bundle that was transmitted by the Prosecution is the statement of 12th of December 1999.  However, we were able to discover that there is another statement of 9th October 2002 which provides information to the effect that the statement made -- the witness made an oral statement in February 2002, and that he appeared in The Hague in the Musema case.  Our problem is that we do not have the statement of February 2002, and regarding his appearance in the Musema case at The Hague, in this latter regard, the Defence only has a version in English. 

Madam President, I do not know how to assess this situation.  However, Defence would have liked to have all these statements and the requisite time to peruse them.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  We have the statement of October 9, 2002, in English.  And Mr. Prosecutor, would you please clarify the position, whether you have it in French or not?
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank, Your Honours.  It's true the witness has made two statements.  One was dated 1st December 1999, which was disclosed 14th March 2002 to the Defence.  The other one is dated 9th October 2002 and was disclosed to the Defence on 5th December 2002.  We -- the one in -- dated 9th October is not contained in the witness bundle, but on 5th December 2002 when it was disclosed to the Defence, it was disclosed in both languages; that is French and English. 

Now, as regards the allusion to the witness that there is another statement dated February 2002, actually, in prepping the witness, I found out that such a statement does not exist.  In all probability, the witness could have been referring to the 1999 December statement.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, is this clear? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  But we did not get the Prosecutor's answer regarding the transcripts of the Musema case at The Hague. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  Actually we obtained part of the transcript yesterday, in the -- that referring to one witness, CB, who testified in The Hague on -- during the Musema appeal.  Now, this witness -- this particular witness testified in the Musema appeal as Witness EB, and we got the transcripts today, today morning, and I believe we have disclosed them to the Defence today.  They were faxed to us in English.  They were only in English, because the proceedings there were conducted in English, and I understand that Mr. Co-counsel to Mr. Songa speaks English quite well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So that has been disclosed to the Defence today, in the morning?

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  The other statement was disclosed yesterday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcript.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  The transcript was disclosed to the Defence today, but it's very short.  And we are not as such relying on it.  It's not part of the Prosecution's case, unless it arises in cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, is that clear?  You have the transcript in English.  They have been disclosed to you in the morning.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  We received a 78-page document at 1 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But anyway, the Prosecutor is not relying on that transcript. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have no knowledge of that.  He said nothing on the subject. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He personally did say.  You didn't hear him.  So --
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I was saying that the Prosecutor did not promise not to use this document.  We did not hear him say that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He did say that he would not be using the transcript.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, what I said was that it doesn't form the -- the basis of the Prosecution case, but if it arises on cross-examination, then we have to pursue the matter.  And at any rate, transcripts are public documents.  We have no obligation as such to disclose to the Defence because they are available as and when the Defence needs them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In any event, how long is the transcript? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It runs to 78 pages, but it's divided into two witnesses.  So half of it is -- it comprises of two witnesses, CB and EB.  EB transcripts run to about 20 or so pages, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, we proceed to record your evidence under your pseudonym, AW.  Since you are a protected witness and we are sitting in the open Court, please avoid mentioning your name, place of residence, or any other information that may lead to your identification.  You shall speak the truth and for that you take solemn declaration. 

	Yes, Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
	(Declaration made by Witness AW in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, please, this is the medical certificate.  Please put it in safe custody. 

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
WITNESS AW,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, sir. 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, this is Prosecution Witness 9 before this Court? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, it's PW 9.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
PW 9, thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Sir, is there a document before you, a piece of paper, that contains your personal particulars? 
A.	I see the document, but I can neither read nor write. 
Q.	Do you recall that sometime over Easter, you and I, with the aid of an interpreter, went through this document and concerning the particulars which are shown in that document? 
A.	I remember that we discussed it and I agreed that the contents of this document were accurate.
Q.	And did you sign it to that effect? 
A.	Yes.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I tender the document containing the personal particulars of this witness as Prosecution Exhibit P. 12. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P. 12? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, P. 12, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's so entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 12, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 12 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you questions concerning the events that took place in Rwanda in April 
	-- in 1994.  You understand that? 
A.	Yes.  I understand you.
Q.	Right.  Now, were you resident in the Bisesero region of Rwanda in 1994, Mr. Witness?
A.	That is correct.  I was resident there.
Q.	Do you recall that violence erupted in Rwanda following the death of the president on the 6th of April, 1994, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I recall it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, it was a kind of leading question.
MR. KAPAYA:
I thought this matter was not in dispute.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Anyway, you shouldn't lead anyway.  You please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right, now, Mr. Witness, what form did that violence take? 
A.	After the death of President Habyarimana, which happened on the 6th of April 1994, and which we learned of on the 7th of April 1994, I had gone to Gishyita to buy banana beer.  When I arrived, I realised that Mika had had a roadblock set up and Mika and Sikubwabo caused the arrests of Nkundiye and Mulindahabi.  And at this roadblock, I found Munyansanga, Ruhindura, and other persons.  Kabanda told us, "You will not be able to cross this roadblock immediately."  We went back and we went towards Bisesero.  On the 8th, Mika Muhimana led an attack to -- on Bisesero.  He arrived in a red minivan that belonged to the commune.  He was also accompanied by five Interahamwe and they launched an attack on Nyarutovu after parking their vehicle in Kiziba.  They killed Rwakayiro, Gasana, the women and the children.  And Mika had a megaphone and was saying, "You must kill them.  You must exterminate them and get them out of the forests." 
Q.	After you had -- while in Gishyita following your knowledge that the president had died, when you went back home, did you remain at your residence on the 7th, or did you go some other place? 
A.	We stayed at the house, but in the mornings, we went to spend the night in the forests, and at that time, our houses had not yet been destroyed.  I saw this person again during the attack that was launched against Rugona.  On that day, he arrived in Interahamwe.
Q.	Just a minute.  Now, when you say that you and -- when you referred to "we,"  who are the other people who were staying with you at your residence at Bisesero?
A.	The persons were my Tutsi brothers.  During that period, they were still alive.  But in the course of time, they were killed. 
Q.	Did you have a family, Mr. Witness?   
A.	I had a wife and six children.
Q.	Now, you testified that on the 8th of April, you went to Nyarutovu hill.  Can you tell us how far Nyarutovu hill is from Gishyita town? 
A.	If you leave Gishyita -- or, rather, when you are at Nyarutovu, you can see Mika's house, and when we were at Nyarutovu, we were able to see the vehicles that were parked quite close to Mika's house.  I would not be able to give you an estimate of the distance between Gishyita and Nyarutovu because there are roundabout pathways that lead to from one place to the other.  But in any case, the distance was not very large.
Q.	That distance, how long can you cover it by walking? 
A.	It is a distance that can be covered by -- in 30 minutes' walk.
Q.	Now, do you know a place called Kiziba or Mukiziba?
A.	I know Kiziba.  It is a location on the frontier between the secteur that was led by Mika and the secteur that was controlled by a certain Muhirkwa (phonetic).
Q.	If we take these three places Gishyita town, Nyarutovu hill and Kiziba, how are they located in relation to each other? 
A.	Gishyita is on the road that links Kibuye to Cyangugu, and it is at this place that the communal office is located.  Regarding Kiziba, Kiziba is at the far end of the cellule that links Musenyi to Bisesero.  And after these two places, you have Nyarutovu.
Q.	So is it correct to say that Kiziba town is located between Gishyita and Nyarutovu hill? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, let's talk about your going to seek refuge on Nyarutovu hill on the 8th of April.  What time, do you recall, sir, that you went to that place? 
A.	It is from 11 a.m. that an attack was launched on Nyarutovu, and this attack lasted until 4 p.m.
Q.	No.  What time did you get there? 
A.	As concerns the time at which I reached that locality, it was at about 1 p.m., and people were saying that we needed to fight back at the thieves.  We thought they were thieves whereas it had to do with assailants that were attacking the hill.
Q.	Did you find other people that --
A.	There were many Tutsis who were trying to fight back the assailants, thinking that they were thieves, whereas they were assailants that were led by Mika to kill Tutsis.
Q.	Now, you have made reference to Mika coming to that place.  Can you tell us how he came to that place, to the Nyarutovu hill?
A.	He came on board a Toyota car with Sikubwabo and five Interahamwes, and that car belonged to the commune.
Q.	Can you tell us the colour of that commune -- sorry, of that car? 
A.	It was a white car.
Q.	Was that the first time you saw that car on that day?
A.	When the attack was launched against that locality, it was the first time that I was seeing the vehicle coming there.
Q.	I mean, before you saw it coming to Nyarutovu hill, had you seen it on the days before April, before April, '94, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I knew that vehicle because it was used by the commune, and it was used to transport the bourgmestre and other employees of the commune.
Q.	You said that Muhimana came with Charles Sikubwabo.  Who is Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	He was the bourgmestre of the commune and he was a soldier that was -- had the rank of adjutant.
Q.	And who were the other occupants of that car, Mr. Witness? 
A.	In the car, there were five Interahamwes, whose names I did not know.  There were also communal policemen, including a certain Boniface, Rwigimba, Munyansanga, Ruhindura, and all those persons took part in an attack that led members of the population.  They encouraged the people to seize the cows or cattle of refugees and encouraged them to kill the people.
Q.	Now, had you seen the five policemen, that is Boniface, Munyansanga, Ruhindura and Rwigimba before that date?
A.	I knew them normally.
Q.	Now, when you saw them arrive, how far were you or how close were you from -- how far were you from them?
A.	The distance separating us wasn't long.  That's about 50 metres between us.
Q.	Now, could you say whether any of them was armed, and if so, by what type of arms? 
A.	I couldn't tell the make of guns.  In any case, Mika, Sikubwabo and all the policemen were equipped with guns and grenades.
Q.	Now, do you recall what type of weapon Muhimana was armed with?
A.	He was carrying a gun, but I cannot tell the difference between this gun and that.  He was carrying a gun.  He was firing on us.  And besides, he had a megaphone and was encouraging the assailants to exterminate us, and he also asked to us come out of our hiding places.
Q.	Now, let's talk a little bit more about this megaphone.  What exactly did you hear or what approximately -- what words did Mika use when he addressed you? 
A.	He said the following:  "The Inyenzis must be exterminated.  They must be flushed out of all the forests." 
Q.	And can you tell us why he was saying that?  Do you know the reason? 
A.	They did not want the Tutsis to live in their country.
Q.	Do you know, Mr. Witness, why they didn't want them to live in the country? 
A.	Since 1959, up until 1994, they had adopted the same attitude.  They did not want Tutsis to live in the country.  They wanted to keep the country to themselves, alone.
Q.	Right.  After Mika and company had arrived at the foot of Nyarutovu hill, can you tell us now what you observed?  What followed next? 
A.	In the evenings, the assailants went away and they launched an attack on Rugona.  And when they launched that attack on Rugona, they were accompanied by many Interahamwes, and Sikubwabo, who was a bourgmestre, was with them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm still at Nyarutovu hill.  You haven't -- my question I asked you was how -- was how the attack was launched.  Can you describe to the Chamber how the attack was launched on Tutsis who were seeking refuge on Nyarutovu hill?
A.	This is how the assailants came.  They left the vehicle, their car, at Kiziba, and Mika said, "You should exterminate the Tutsis in all the forests."  And the assailants, numbered about 3,000, they killed women and children.  As for men, they killed Birara, Rwagasana, Rwakayiro and other persons whose names I can no longer recall.
Q.	Could you --
A.	And when they came on the Nyarutovu hill, we continued to Bisesero, with the refugees, that is.
Q.	Can you, Mr. Witness, for the record, repeat the names of the people you recognised who were killed during the attack at that hill? 
A.	They were Birara, Rwagasana, Rwakayiro.  I can't recall the names of all the victims. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rwagasana is spelt R-W-A-G-A-S-A-N-A.  Birara is spelt B-I-R-A-R-A.  Rwakayiro is spelt 
	R-W-A-K-A-Y-I-R-O.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Right.  After the Nyarutovu attack, can you tell us whether you were able to see Mr. Muhimana again, and if so, when? 
A.	I saw him again on the Rugona hill, R-U-G-O-N-A.  And on the Rugona hill, he launched an attack in the company of many Interahamwes and Sikubwabo.
Q.	Now, can you tell us when -- or can you tell about how many days after you had seen him at Nyarutovu hill when you saw him at Rugona again? 
A.	I didn't keep count of the days, but from that day, he didn't stop launching attacks on Bisesero.  He always came there with many Interahamwes.
Q.	Could it have been after a week or two weeks, a month, after you saw him at Nyarutovu hill? 
A.	He used to launch the attacks every day from the 8th of April, and all those attacks were launched against the Bisesero region until the French arrived.  And after the French arrived, he fled.
Q.	Now, let's talk about the Rugona hill attacks in some detail.  Can you tell us what time you saw Mika coming at that place, about what time? 
A.	He launched attacks on Rugona hill.  I will tell you where I saw him launch the attacks, in order to enlighten you further. 
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you tell us the time he came and how he came to that place? 
A.	I saw him five times, and I will tell you about all the hills on which I saw him launch attacks. 
Q.	We are still talking about Rugona.  We want to establish, firstly, the time.  What time did you see him come?  Was it in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening? 
A.	The attack was launched in the morning.
Q.	And how did he get there? 
A.	He launched one attack on Rugona, in the company of Sikubwabo and the many Interahamwes.  We used to hide in the Rugona forest.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, what is the distance between the Nyarutovu hill and Rugona hill?  Can you give us the distance between the two hills? 
THE WITNESS:
If you take shortcuts in the Bisesero region, if I can estimate, I think there are about four kilometres separating those two locations, even though I did not measure the distance between those two locations.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, sir, can you tell us the means Muhimana used to come to Rugona hill?  Did he walk? 
A.	Well, they came on board a vehicle.  They left the vehicle on the road because Rugona is a hill, and they came up and killed the Tutsis who were hiding there.
Q.	How many people were in that vehicle? 
A.	There were many assailants, but they were carrying in that vehicle influential figures, and I could recognise Sikubwabo and Mika and they were sensitising the population to try to scour the forests.
Q.	Now, how close were you when you saw them arrive?
A.	If I can give an estimate, there was a distance of about 20 to 50 metres, even though I did not measure that distance.  We were hidden in the forest, but I could well see them.
Q.	Now, in the course of their search in the forests, what did you observe?  Was there anything significant that you observed, Mr. Witness? 
A.	We saw Mika take a woman named Mukaremera, Pascasie, who was pregnant.  And when she (sic) took this woman, he was in the company of Interahamwes, and these Interahamwes took her along and entrusted her with Mika.  Mika took a machete, and he cut that woman into pieces, from the bosom right down to the genitals, to see how the child that was in the woman's womb was behaving.  And he removed the baby, who cried for sometime, and up until the time that the baby died.  Subsequently, the assailants cut the arm of the woman and they sharpened a stick that they inserted into that arm --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Into her vagina, rather.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, sir, who discovered Pascasie Mukaremera in the woods?
A.	It is Mika and the Interahamwes who were with them, as well as Sikubwabo.  That woman was a farming --
Q.	Now, when this lady was discovered, how far were you from her? 
A.	I have told you that the distance between us was between 20 and 50 metres, because I was hiding behind a rock that was there.
Q.	Now, when this lady was taken before Mika, did Mika say anything?  Did you hear him say anything? 
A.	Mika said, "I'm going to cut this woman, to disembowel this woman, to see the position of the foetus in its mother's womb." 
Q.	After he had said that, what, Witness, did you observe? 
A.	Mika took a machete and he cut off this woman into pieces, beginning from her breast, right up to her genitals, and then he removed the baby from the mother's womb and put it beside its mother.  The baby cried for some moments and then died.
Q.	When the -- when Mika was cutting this lady, as you say, was the lady standing or in what posture was she? 
A.	Mika had made this woman to lie down on the ground.
Q.	And after the lady was disembowelled, what happened to the rest of her body?  Did anything happen to the rest of her body? 
A.	Her hands were cut off, and then a stake was sharpened and it was used to pierce her arm.  
Q.	Could -- I didn't quite get what the stick was used for.  I didn't quite get your response, Mr. Witness. 
A.	After sharpening the stake, her arms were cut, and then that stake was inserted into her arms, into her hands. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The answer is still not clear.  

Mr. Witness, can you repeat your answer, please? 
THE WITNESS:
After disembowelling Pascasie, the assailants sharpened stakes and they cut the -- cut off the hands of the victim and they forced into those hands that stake.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right.  Was that lady -- was anything done to the lady's private parts, Mr. Witness?  Did you see anything being done to the private parts of that lady? 
A.	When that woman was disembowelled, this was done right down to her genitals.
Q.	Right.  Now, had you known Pascasie Mukaremera before that day, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I knew her well before.
Q.	Can you tell us what she was, where she lived, what she did for a living? 
A.	She used to live in the Bisesero region and was a farmer.
Q.	Can you tell us her age?  Roughly how old was she? 
A.	You see, she wasn't my wife.  In my opinion, she was a woman who have put on some age.  She was about 40.  But I can only estimate her age because I did not check her identity card.  I wasn't there at her birth.
Q.	Can you tell us whether she was married, and if so, to who? 
A.	I do not remember her husband.  I do not know his name, even if I know the lady.  I mean, it's been ten years since those events occurred.
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  Now, after the Mukaremera incident, can you tell us what else you observed, if anything, at Rugona hill? 
A.	Subsequently, they flushed out a woman whose name is Mukakankuyu, who was a teacher.  Her name was Felicite Mukakankuyu.
Q.	Could we get the spelling of the surname, please, of this lady?  This --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-U-K-A-N-K-U -- Felicite Kankuyu, K-A-N-K-U-Y-U.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Right.  How long was it after the Mukaremera incident was this lady discovered? 
A.	I wasn't wearing a watch, but if I can make an estimate of the time, it was a few moments after Mukaremera was killed.
Q.	Could it have been an hour, two hours, more or less?  Can you give us --
A.	By my reckoning, about an hour had passed, because they continued to look out for refugees in that forest.
Q.	And how far was she discovered from where you were hiding? 
A.	I was still where I had been hiding when the Mukaremera had been flushed out, so the distance I mentioned to you would still be the same, but it would still be an estimate because, as I said, I didn't measure it.
Q.	So when this lady was found out, can you describe to the Chamber what you observed, what happened? 
A.	After having found her out, they shouted, "We have just discovered Felicite Mukakankuyu."  And Mika and Sikubwabo asked the assailants to bring her to them.  And they handed her over to Mika and Sikubwabo.
Q.	All right.  After she was handed to Mika and Sikubwabo, can you tell us what happened, what you observed? 
A.	Sikubwabo raped her, after having undressed her, so Sikubwabo immediately raped her.
Q.	Can you describe to the Chamber how Sikubwabo raped this lady? 
A.	He took her.  Then she -- he threw her down and then he brought down his pants right to the knees and then climbed on her.
Q.	While this act was taking place, where was Mika?  How far was he from Sikubwabo? 
A.	He was about five metres from there, and he was with those Interahamwes.
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, how long it took Sikubwabo to rape that woman, if you can give an estimate? 
A.	It took about ten minutes.
Q.	After Sikubwabo had raped her, what happened?  What else did you -- what else did you observe? 
A.	Sikubwabo called Mika.  Mika undressed, and he also took advantage of the woman. 
Q.	Can you tell us, do you recall, what words or what words used -- what words Sikubwabo used to tell Mika to rape this lady? 
A.	He told him, "Come and have intercourse with this woman who was a teacher," and Mika came and also raped the woman.
Q.	Can you describe to the Chamber what you saw Mika do to that lady? 
A.	Mika pulled down his trousers and raped her.
Q.	Did you observe any act of sexual intercourse between Mika and that woman? 
A.	After that act, which lasted ten minutes, Mika called other Interahamwe who were with him, and those Interahamwe also raped her.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us for how long you observed Mika rape that lady? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He said ten minutes. 
THE WITNESS:
That is right, ten minutes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I thought you were trying to get the witness to tell us exactly what happened, I mean what Mika did, without, of course, leading the witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  I observed that also.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you describe the act which you say -- the act of rape Mika performed on this lady?  Can you describe what you saw take place? 
A.	Mika took that woman, he undressed, pulled down his trousers, and he had sexual intercourse with that lady, just as Sikubwabo had done. 
Q.	Right.  Now, after Mika had raped that lady, what else -- what followed?  Can you tell us what happened? 
A.	He called the Interahamwe who were there, and all those Interahamwe raped that woman.
Q.	Do you recall the words Mika used to call those Interahamwe to rape that lady? 
A.	This is what he told them:  "After raping her, kill her, because she's also an Inyenzi, like every other Inyenzi".
Q.	Did you observe any Interahamwe rape that lady? 
A.	All the Interahamwe who were with Mika raped her.
Q.	Can you tell us how many you saw rape this lady?  How many Interahamwe you saw? 
A.	There were five of them.  So there were in all seven.  That is five Interahamwe, Mika and Sikubwabo.
Q.	Can you describe to the Chamber how the five Interahamwe went about raping this lady? 
A.	Let me explain to you what I saw.  I have told you how Sikubwabo and Mika raped that woman.  They took turns in doing so.  First Mika, Sikubwabo, and then their Interahamwe.
Q.	Did you see the Interahamwe undress? 
A.	As was with -- the case with their leader, the Interahamwe also undressed.
Q.	Now, after the --
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, hold on. 

Witness, you say that this woman was raped because she was an Inyenzi.  Who or what is an Inyenzi? 
THE WITNESS:
The Inyenzi were the Tutsi. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us what happened after the seven people had raped this lady? 
A.	After doing that, the Interahamwe took pieces of wood and thrust them into that lady's genitals until she died.
Q.	When this act of thrusting the wood in her genitals was taking place, can you tell us whether Mika was still around? 
A.	Yes.  Mika and Sikubwabo were still there, standing.  I know them very well.
Q.	Now, had you known Felicite Kankuyu before that day, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I had known her well before then.  She was a teacher in the Bisesero region.
Q.	Can you tell us whether she was married, where she was living, what school she was teaching, if you can? 
A.	She was teaching in a Bisesero school in Nyarutovu cellule, and she was resident in Bisesero.
Q.	Now, how long had you known her before that day? 
A.	She had been teaching in Bisesero for a long time.  She was married, and she had children.
Q.	Now, after the Kankuyu affair, did you see Mika again in Bisesero area? 
A.	Yes.  I saw him again on Kanyinya hill.
Q.	Can you tell us how far, how long it takes, to walk from Kanyinya to Rugona hill?
A.	That distance can be covered in 20 minutes, walking.
Q.	Can you tell us how long it was that you saw him at Kanyinya after the Rugona incidents? 
A.	I told you that they regularly launched attacks.  So I cannot tell you whether it was two or three days later.  There was attacks.  However, he came to Kanyinya accompanied by Ruzindana, Obed, and two soldiers.
Q.	Who is Ruzindana, Mr. Witness, and do you know the names of the two soldiers?
A.	I do not know the names of the two soldiers, but I would say that Ruzindana was a trader who had business both in Kibuye and in Kigali.
Q.	How -- what means they used to come to that place? 
A.	They came on board a vehicle. 
Q.	Whose car was it, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I believe it was a vehicle that had been requisitioned from a trader, and it was red in colour.
Q.	Could you tell who was driving that colour -- that vehicle, sorry? 
A.	It was driven by Ruzindana.
Q.	When they came to that place, can you tell us how far you were, how far you observed them come? 
A.	When they arrived, they moved closer to us.  We spoke with Mika.  Mika asked us whether we knew who was attacking us, and we answered, saying, "It's you, Mika, and you, Ruzindana."  And he said, "It is Saturday.  On Saturday, you should all assemble."  It was a Saturday.
Q.	When he was speaking this word -- these words, how close were you from him?  
A.	They were very close to us.  On that day, he wanted to assess the situation, to know the number of refugees who were there, in order to be able to exterminate us.
Q.	So can you tell us the words he used, how -- what did he tell you? 
A.	He asked us, "How many of you are here?  How many Tutsis are here?"  We said all the Tutsis had been exterminated.  He asked us whether there were handicapped persons.  We said yes.  And he added, "Assemble on Monday.  The Red Cross will bring drugs and assistance."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us how close you were to the Accused?  Just give us an estimate. 
THE WITNESS:
The Accused was below, on the road, and we were further up the road, on the road.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you give us a distance in metres? 
THE WITNESS:
It could not have been more than five metres. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	After he had spoken those words, did any of you -- did anyone from your group respond? 
A.	We did not respond.  We were telling ourselves that he wants to assemble us in order to exterminate us, so we did not respond.
Q.	So come the Monday that he said help was coming, did you observe him come on that Monday to bring the help he said he would bring? 
A.	On that day, he came with eight trucks and eight buses, full of Interahamwe, and other displaced -- and other persons who were moving about on foot. 
Q.	Could you tell us where that place was when you saw him again? 
A.	I saw him again on Muyira hill, where he was launching an attack by a group of soldiers and Interahamwe.
Q.	Now, before we -- before we move to Muyira hill, Mr. Witness, you have testified here that Mika attacked you at Nyarutovu hill and then you saw -- attacked you again at Rugona hill.  Now, where do you get the bravery at Kanyinya hill to go so close to him?  Weren't you scared of him, that he could kill you?  
A.	We were in a desperate situation.  When he called us, we came close to him, and we told ourselves, if he wants, he can kill us.  We knew him.  We were desperate people.
Q.	Right.  Now, let's move to the Muyira incident.  When was this --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, just a short clarification.  He said that the -- Mika arrived with eight trucks and eight buses.  So the vehicles -- how many vehicles were there?  It's 15 altogether? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, maybe the witness will clarify in due course, because he's now talking about a different -- a different incident.  This is what I was going to explore now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's move to the Muyira incident.  How long was it that you saw him here after the Kanyinya affair, after you had seen him at Kanyinya hill? 
A.	That was a few days later.  The dates mentioned, that is the 13th and the 14th, are the dates for that event.
Q.	And what makes you recall the 13th and 14th of May? 
A.	I recall the dates because the UN -- I mean, the French arrived.  They were in Gishyita.  They were resident -- they were residing in his secteur.
Q.	Now, can you tell us how Muhimana arrived at Muyira hill on the 13th of May, '94? 
A.	He came with many Interahamwe drawn from everywhere, and he launched the attack in Muyira, where we had assembled.  We could see them as they were coming on Gishyita road.  When they were climbing uphill, we could see them, so we could go and hide in Muyira, because there was a forest there.
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell us how he arrived, with whom, who accompanied him, if anybody, and in which direction?
A.	They came from the Bisesero secteur.  Where we were was Rwankuba secteur.  They crossed the border between Gishyita and Gisovu.
Q.	Can you tell us who accompanied him? 
A.	He was accompanied by very many people, about 3,000 people.  There were very many of them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us how these other people came to that place, to Muyira hill? 
A.	They came on board trucks and buses, while others came on foot.
Q.	Can you tell us how many vehicles you recall to have seen on that day, and the type and make, if you know? 
A.	They came on board eight trucks and eight buses. 
Q.	Do you know who owned those buses and the trucks? 
A.	The buses belonged to the state.  However, during that period, they were used for transporting Interahamwe.  As regards the Interahamwe, they used the trucks used by Chinese who were building the road of Cyangugu and who were tarring that road.
Q.	Apart from Mika Muhimana, can you tell us whether there were other attackers or the other people you could recognise? 
A.	I could recognise Vincent Rutaganira, the conseiller of Mugugo (phonetic), the bourgmestre of Gisovu, known as Ndimbati.  And the so-called Musema, who was the director of the Gisovu tea factory.  And Ruzindana who had come from Muramba.  All those people brought attackers.  There were other conseillers of neighbouring secteurs.
Q.	Did these attackers come from one direction or they came from different directions? 
A.	They came from different directions.  Some came from Rwankuba; that's from Bisesero, from the Gitabura secteur.  And they surrounded us.
Q.	Could you tell us whether they were armed? 
A.	They were armed with guns, grenades, machetes, stakes which were sharpened bamboos.
Q.	Did you observe in particular whether Mika was armed? 
A.	Mika was armed with a gun.  He always carried his gun.
Q.	Can you tell us, Mr. Witness, whether an attack was launched, and if so, from what time to what time? 
A.	Those attacks continued until he fled to Congo.
Q.	I'm still on the 13th of May, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell us what time the attack was launched on that day? 
A.	They launched attacks from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and during that period, they killed.
Q.	Could you tell us how many -- how many people -- could you give us the number of the people you saw killed? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you an estimate of the number of people who were killed.  There were many corpses.  Either you were killed with a machete or you were killed with a gun.  There were many corpses.
Q.	After the attack, did you -- did you remain there?  Did you remain on Muyira hill, Mr. Witness, on the 13th? 
A.	In the evening, I could go home to get something to eat, and then would return to Muyira in order to be able to see them arrive, and then go into hiding in the bushes.
Q.	So the following day, the 14th, in the morning, where were you? 
A.	I had returned to Muyira from my home in (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	Can you tell us what happened on the 14th when you went back to Muyira hill?
A.	We were once again attacked, and we went to hide in Muyira forest.
Q.	Who attacked you this time? 
A.	Attacks were led by Ndimbati, Musema and Mika.  All the people whom I listed were there.
Q.	Can you tell us how they came there on that day? 
A.	They returned on board vehicles which they left on the roads in Kiziba, and they ran up to flush out people, and returned to their vehicles.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, did he say the name of the place where he used to live? 
MR. KAPAYA:
He mentioned generally the hill.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This is protected information and it will be deleted and be kept under seal. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, on the 14th, how did Muhimana arrive at that place, at Muyira hill? 
A.	He came on board vehicles, vans and buses.  There were many other vehicles.  He was almost always amongst the assailants.
Q.	Now, how close were you when you saw him? 
A.	I told you that we were not able to estimate the distance.  All I know was that he was quite close to us.  We were trying to run away, but we came up face to face with the attack of Ndimbati, Muhimana or other conseillers whom I have mentioned.
Q.	Now, on this date, can you tell us what time the attack started? 
A.	The attack started at 6 a.m., to end at 6 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you say that this attack was on 14th of April? 
THE WITNESS:
This was the 14th of May.  It is on this date that they launched the attacks.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	On this -- on the second day, can you tell us whether more people were killed, or less, compared to the attack on the 13th of May? 
A.	I told you that I did not count the persons who were killed.  When he -- they promised to bring us the Red Cross, many people had been killed, including -- especially men.  They had come to evaluate our number, when he came to -- when he promised to bring the Red Cross as well as assistance.
Q.	Fine.  Now, you testified, sir, that you were married with -- and had six children.  Can you tell us what happened to your wife and six children? 
A.	I don't know when -- where my wife was killed.  When the attacks came, people ran in all directions.  I do not know where the members of my family were killed.
Q.	Now --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you do not know how your six children were killed? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know where my six children were killed.  When the attacks came, people ran away in all directions.  All my children died.  I do not know where they died. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, was there a time when an investigator of the ICTR asked you to show him the various places you have mentioned in your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  I went to show them the various places.
Q.	Do you recall when this took place? 
A.	It was towards the end of March that I went to show them where these events took place.
Q.	Do you recall the various places you visited with the investigator? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he say it was towards the end of March? 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what he said, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  March 2000?  What was the year? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to the time when I went to show these various places to the investigators? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS:
It is in the month of March of this year, this present year. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
2004? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this year, last month.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, do you recall the specific places you and the investigator visited, the specific places you showed him? 
A.	I went to show them Rugona hill, Kanyinya, Muyira, Nyarutovu, and Gishyita.
Q.	Now, do you know the person -- the name of the person you went with, the name of the investigator? 
A.	It was a white man, but I do not remember his name.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I request the registry to show the witness the photograph on page 193 of the Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, and I want to ask the witness whether he can recognise the person who is shown there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to page K0286193? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Issa, please, show the photographs to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
It is this person with whom I went.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Let the record reflect that the witness has identified the investigator on page 193 of the P. 2 as the person he went with to show the various places.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when -- when did you know Mr. Muhimana for the first time in your life, if you recall? 
A.	I knew Muhimana for the first time when he finished his studies, at the time when he began his trading in Gishyita.   Afterwards, he became a conseiller of the Gishyita secteur, in his commune of origin.
Q.	I understand that you lived in two different places.  How -- how come that you knew where -- where he lived, what he did for a living? 
A.	We used to go to the same place -- when we used to go to the communal office, we passed near to his house.  We used to go and take communal equipment near his place.
Q.	Were you personally known to him, or was he somebody you were acquainted with? 
A.	We did not know each other, but I knew him.  I could go to his cabaret to drink beer.
Q.	Now, can you describe how he looked like when you last saw him? 
A.	Do you want me to show you -- point out Mika from amongst all these people here present? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I see him at the back of the room.  He is sitting next to another man.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you describe the --
A.	I see him at the back, behind all the others.  He is wearing a tie, a striped tie, and he is fair-skinned.
Q.	What's the colour of the tie? 
A.	I see that his colour -- his tie is red and white stripes.  He is to the left of the witness box.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, may the record reflect that the witness has recognised the Accused?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has recognised the Accused.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	One final matter, Mr. Witness.  I want to revisit the incidents concerning the members of your family.  Can you tell us when you last missed your wife, when you last saw her? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, would you please repeat the question?  I did not understand it correctly. 
Q.	When did you miss your wife?  Was it in April, May, June, of '94?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wife and children too.
MR. KAPAYA: 
	And children.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why do you, Mr. Prosecutor, want to ask him a negative, when he missed his wife?  Why don't ask you him when he last saw him wife? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I tried that the first time, Your Honour, and it didn't quite --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You didn't give him time to respond.  Was missing and last seeing; last seeing is a more positive attribute. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Fine, yes.  Let me put my question that way, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you last see your wife? 
A.	I cannot say for sure.  I cannot give you the exact date.  It's a long time ago.  It was ten years ago.  My wife died in the month of May.  All the children were already dead. 
Q.	So when did your children die? 
A.	I have told you that I am unable to give you details of the date, but in the month of May, they were all dead.
Q.	One more question on that issue, Mr. Witness.  Did your six children die at the same time or they died in different periods? 
A.	They died at different times.
Q.	Could you tell us how many died first and how many followed, if you recall? 
A.	Two of them were at their grandparents' home.  The other four lived in my home.  My wife died with two children.  The other two died on another occasion.
Q.	Can you tell us whether the six children and your wife died in the course of the attacks -- in which attacks your six children and wife died?  In which attacks? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why don't you ask the witness how they died?  I mean, has the witness said they died in any of the attacks? 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what he implied, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	How did they die, Mr. Witness?
JUDGE SHORT:
When and how?

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask him first whether he knows how they died.  If he does, then ask him how.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know how your children died? 
A.	They were killed during the attacks.  There were very many assailants in Bisesero and were hunting Tutsi.  It is these assailants who killed them.  They died in Bisesero secteur.  How do you want to tell me the circumstances under which they died? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Your Honours, that's all I had from this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the Defence counsel, counsel on your left, who is representing Mika Muhimana.  Understand the question and reply the -- reply very briefly. 

Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not getting the translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"What distance was there between your cellule and the centre of Gishyita?"
THE WITNESS:
To estimate the distance between these two places -- I do not know whether you have already been to this these locations.  I do not know whether you will be able to understand the distance that I will give.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Try, Mr. Witness.  I will try to understand. 
A.	To give you an estimate, if you have never been at this place, you will not agree with me, but if you want to know the distance, I would ask you to go to the location to measure the distance. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you are here to help the Court.  You answer the questions you are asked as best as you can, all right? 
THE WITNESS:
All right. 
MR. SONGA:
I shall repeat the question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What was the distance between your cellule and the centre of Gishyita? 
A.	To give you an estimate, I will give you the secteurs that separated these two locations.  There is Nyarutovu, Nyarutovu secteur, which is adjacent to that of Musenyi.  This is followed by Kigarama secteur. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just stated something that might reveal his identity. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If he has revealed his identity, that will be deleted from the record and kept under seal. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May we proceed?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know Mika Muhimana before the events of April 1994? 
A.	In regard to this question, I explained that when the Prosecutor asked me the question, I told him that I knew Mika when he finished school, just when he started trading, and at the time when he was elected conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  I knew him very well.
Q.	When did he finish his studies? 
A.	I did not pay particular attention to the time when he left school, but I know that he started his trade when he was still young.  It was after his studies that he started trading in Gishyita.  In due course, he ran as a candidate for the conseiller, and the population voted him.
Q.	Do you confirm that he went to secondary school? 
A.	I do not know whether he went to secondary school, but I know that he went to primary school in Gishyita.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember having made a statement before the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on the date of the 9th of October 2002? 
A.	Please repeat the question.  I did not understand it.
Q.	Can you remember whether you made a statement to the investigators of the Tribunal on the 9th of October 2002? 
A.	Different persons came to meet us and asked us questions.  I do not remember this date very well, but I know that questions were put to me on various occasions.
Q.	Could you remember whether you were able to answer questions from investigators in 2002? 
A.	Yes.  I think that I answered the questions that were asked of me, and in all my answers, I said that Mika had participated in the killings. 
Q.	Do you think that it is possible that you answered questions investigators put to you in October 2002?
A.	Whether questions were put to me or not, I am telling you that in all my answers, I accused him of doing what he did.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, could we show the witness his statement of the 9th of October 2002? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness, we believe, is unable to read and write.  That's what he said in the beginning.  But showing this statement to the witness will serve any purpose?

1600H
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, this is a statement that I would like to use.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, ask him specific questions about the statement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Put the portion of the statement to him.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The first passage of the statement to which I wish to refer is the third paragraph of page 3 of his statement where he says the following.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which statement?  The statement of October 2002? 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Madam President, and if the paragraphs are correctly arranged, I might say that this is the third paragraph where the following is said: "I know Mika.  I have known Mika for a long time, precisely after secondary school." 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question, Mr. Witness, is this: what did you mean by secondary school?  Had he just finished secondary school?
A.	I told you that I can neither read nor write, and it is not I who wrote down this statement.  It is the investigators who did this.  I did not say what you have just said, I just say that after his studies, Mika started trading.
Q.	We understand you, Mr. Witness.  The statement bears your signature.  What is your signature on this document worth?
A.	This signature authenticates my statement, and I have told you that everything that I said regarding Mika is true.  I do not know what the Defence counsel is looking for.  Mika was not asking him to employ him.  I did not ask him to present his certificates.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know the composition of Mika's family?
A.	I was not in charge of finding out the members of Mika's family, but I did know that he had a family.
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you describe it to us?
A.	I am not supposed to carry out a census of Mika's family.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, if you know the members of his family, please answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
Mika has had a large family.  I can't give the number, nor the name of the members of his family. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Was Mika married, or is he married?
A.	Mika was living with a woman called Savera (phonetic).  He used to live with a woman in his house.  Otherwise, I don't know any other woman that was married to Mika.
Q.	I do not know if I have understood you well.  Can you tell me his (sic) other name?
A.	Well, that woman was a Tutsi.  That was her ethnic group.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you also know people who used to live in Mika's house?
A.	That lady had her junior sisters and nieces living with her.
Q.	Mr. Witness, where did you make your statement of 12 December 1999?
A.	Do you want to know the hill or the location where I made the statement, or the persons who asked me the questions that I answered in that statement? 
Q.	My question has to do with the location?
A.	I understand, therefore, that you want to know the name of the location.
Q.	That is correct?
A.	It was at Ngoma that I made the statement.  The investigators found me at Ngoma, N-G-O-M-A.
Q.	Who brought them into contact with you?
A.	The investigators, themselves, came looking for survivors in order to find out from them what happened at Bisesero.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to commit to paper a name so that the witness can tell me what relation exists between him and that person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Issa, hand the name to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that I can neither read nor write.
MR. SONGA:
The registry will help you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, can you read the name?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I'll read what is written. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor you want to know the relationship of the witness with the name on the paper?
MR. SONGA:
That's correct, Madam President, but he does not need to call out the name.
THE WITNESS:
There is no relationship between that person and myself.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	But did you know that person?
A.	That person is ************************************************ and he was the person that was in ******** ******************** that Mika had control over.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, can we tender that sheet of paper as an exhibit? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Before you go on, how was the witness able to identify the name, Mr. Issa? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
His name was read out to the witness.

The name on the piece of paper is entered as Exhibit D. 15 under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 15 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Show it to the Prosecutor.

Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You stated, Mr. Witness, on 12 December 1999, that on that morning of 7 April 1994, you had gone out with your neighbours to go to Gishyita near the commune office to buy banana beer ************** **********; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.  That is where we used to go to buy banana *******************
Q.	What was his ethnic group?
A.	Whom are you referring to? 
Q.	That neighbour, Mr. Witness?
A.	Those persons were Tutsi.  They were seven in number.
Q.	Can you give us their names, but if you think that that may put your safety or security at risk, we can always write their names down on a sheet of paper?
A.	No, if I am given leave, I will give you the name of those persons, because all of them have been killed.
Q.	Can we have those names?
A.	There was *****************************.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, just a moment.  Mr. Witness, those persons were your neighbours? 
THE WITNESS:
We all originated from Bisesero.  They were my neighbours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are still residing in the same place? 
THE WITNESS:
Right now, I reside at the Gishyita secteur because I couldn't live in that forest alone any more.  I left that location and I went to reside in Gishyita.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, disclosing the names of the neighbours would identify him, and as you know, the witness is illiterate, he cannot write or read, so we should go to the closed session for a while.
MR. SONGA:
And why can't we possibly give him a piece of paper on which an interpreter can help him write down the names that he will be giving him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We think it's more appropriate to go into closed session.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We go into closed session.  Mr. Issa, please arrange closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of transcript [page  29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 25 to 28 by Trevor Gerbes)




















MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now we are in open session, so be careful not to tell the name of your neighbours or disclose any other information that may lead to identify you.

Professor, you may proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I was making reference to the statement of 9 October 2002, paragraph 4 thereof. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you declared on 9 October 2002 that you had gone out in the morning of 7 April with two other persons whose names you could no longer recall, at least the name of one of them; is that correct?
A.	Can you repeat your question? 
Q.	I will refer you to your own statement of 9 October 2002 where you said that in the morning of 7 April you had gone out with two persons, one of whose names you could no longer recall; is that correct?
A.	On that matter I would like to say that the persons I used to meet on the way when we went to buy beer, they are people who came from Gisovu that I didn't know.  I do not think that you have to dwell on that matter, because it doesn't have any grounds.
Q.	It has a basis for me, Mr. Witness, because we would like to know how you went out that morning of 
7 April?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are not to make comments on the questions asked by the learned defence counsel.  You will answer to the question to the best of your knowledge.  

Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked a question, and you went on to make comments.  We would like to hear your answer.
A.	I have told you that I left my house in the company of Michel and on the way I met Charles and several other persons whose names I do not know.  There were many of us on the road when we were going to buy banana beer.
Q.	And where did you come up with the figure of seven neighbours, Mr. Witness?
A.	The Bisesero secteur was inhabited by many people who used to take the same road as myself to go and buy beer.  Members of my family were many more than the number that I gave you or the number on which you are asking questions.
Q.	Now, what can we retain?  So what is the truth, seven persons or two persons with whom you were on that morning of 7 April?
A.	Those seven persons, I met them on the way.  Otherwise, when I left my home I was with the persons whose names I have given you.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Where was Kabanda's residence?
A.	Kabanda's residence was found in the cellule further up Musenyi in the Nyarutovu secteur in the cellule that was opposite that of Uwingabo and that of Kigarama and the -- cellule. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness gave the name of his cellule.
MR. SONGA:
You stated on 12 December '99 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If the witness has mentioned the name of his cellule, please, it can be deleted from the record and kept under seal.

Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	On 12 December 1999, you stated that when you reached the Gishyita trading centre, a young boy named Bosco, who had been sent by Assiel Kabanda, came and told you that the latter person, is that Kabanda, wanted to talk to you; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that was my statement.  Kabanda was in that centre.  He called us and told us he wanted to tell us something.
Q.	And who is Bosco?
A.	Bosco was a young man who was *****************************, and he is the one that Kabanda gave the message that he wanted to communicate to us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
I am obliged, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you know Bosco before April 7?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Where was he resident?
A.	He had his business close to Kabanda's house.
Q.	Did he live where he carried out his business?
A.	He -- or he used to live in his parents' house, but from time to time he spent the night in his shop.
Q.	What was his parents' address, if you please?
A.	Do you want to repeat your question? 
Q.	What was Bosco's parents' address?
A.	His parents used to reside in the Musenyi secteur.
Q.	Which cellule?
A.	In the Gwabirembo cellule, G-W-A-B-I-R-E-M-B-O -- Gwabirembo.
Q.	You declared on 12 December 1999, Mr. Witness, that you went to Kabanda's shop where he advised you to go back home because the Tutsis, like the two agricultural officers, Nkundiye and Mulindahabi, had been just been locked up by their bourgmestre, Sikubwabo and Mika; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct, and besides, Mika is right behind you.  You can ask him the question as to whether he was not the one who locked them up.
Q.	Well, that is not provided for by our trial.  Mr. Witness, was Kabanda a trader in Gishyita?
A.	He was a trader because he had houses in Gishyita and most of his businesses -- he had them or he carried the business in Gishyita.
Q.	When you say, Mr. Witness, that the Tutsi, like the two agricultural officers, or agronomists, had just been locked up, do you want to say that he mentioned other Tutsis that were locked up that morning?
A.	Those -- it was those two who had been detained and were subsequently killed.
Q.	Now, was Kabanda's shop opened at that particular time?
A.	I have explained to you that Kabanda's property was at Gishyita.  Kabanda had farms where he farmed.  He was more of a trader, and he had built houses at Gishyita and that is where he resided.
Q.	I would like to ask a question --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, where was the shop?
THE WITNESS:
I do not know if, in describing the location of that shop, you would know where it was, because you have never been there.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Was the shop close or far from Kabanda's house?
A.	The shop was in the Gishyita secteur, whereas Kabanda used to reside in the Bisesero secteur.
Q.	What did Kabanda tell you exactly as concerns the two agronomists or agricultural officers?
A.	He told us the following: "You are Tutsis, and Sikubwabo and Mika have erected a roadblock in the entrance of Bisesero." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, is this a convenient time for a short break? 
MR. SONGA:
That's correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will adjourn the Court for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1630 to 1658H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.

Yes, Professor, please continue with your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am going to request leave from the Court to backtrack somewhat regarding a question that was put.  Madam President, we asked the witness to place on a piece of paper a name, and we requested that this piece of paper be tendered as an exhibit.  We would like to compare the information that appears on that piece of paper to the Prosecution document.  With the assistance of the registry, I am of the opinion that the witness may be given the information sheet that was filled at the beginning of his statement, and on that information, the particulars under point 14 of the particulars, entitled "Name and address of a friend, a parent or a relative", there is a name given which seems to be the very one that appears on the paper that was tendered as an exhibit.  This is in reference to the particulars that appear on the statement of 12 December 1999 -- as I said, point 14.  If the interpreter can read out this information.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to the protected information sheet? 
MR. SONGA:
The form that introduces the witness statement.  That is the statement of 12 December 1999, point 14.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you want to confirm the witness with this statement? 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.  I would like him to look at the information and answer the question regarding whether the name that appears on the paper is unknown to him or whether it is part of the people that he knows.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, what the witness told you when you asked him this question is what is contained there.  He told you the person named there was ****************************.  Now, you asked him whether he was related to that person and he said he was not related to that person.  That question asked for the name and address of a friend, a relative or an acquaintance.  Now, the fact that somebody is not related to another one doesn't stop him from being a friend or being an acquaintance, so I can't see what is the conflict that you want to put forward

Did you, Professor, get what I said? 
MR. SONGA:
I did understand you, Your Honour.  With all due respect, I would like to point out that under point 14, what is asked is the name and address either of a parent, a relative or a friend.  The witness should therefore tell us the type of relation between the name that appeared in the exhibit tendered, that is whether it is a friend, a parent or a relative.  In what capacity has he been mentioned in the identification sheet? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, professor, please proceed.  Mr. Issa, please show the name to the witness -- the statement to the witness.  

Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness in this respect?  

Mr. Issa, please switch off the witness's microphone.  

Professor, can you repeat your question?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, a little while ago you were shown a piece of paper bearing a surname and a first name.  The question was what sort of relationship you had with the person who bears that name?
A.	I told you that I can neither read nor write, and somebody who can read out to me the name that appeared on this piece of paper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, can you please read out the name to the witness?

Mr. Witness, don't mention the name of that person.  This person whose name is given was read out to you by the interpreter is related to you?  Was he your relative, a friend or acquaintance?
THE WITNESS: 
I have no acquaintance with this person.  He is not my friend and he did not give me cows.  However, he is the**************************** and stood  -- he said that he could be contacted in regard to myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, in this paragraph of your information sheet, he is either your friend or relative or acquaintance.  His name was given because he was either your friend or your relative or acquaintance.  What do you have to say? 
THE WITNESS:
He's neither my friend, nor my relative, nor my acquaintance.  However, he said that if the investigators wanted to see me, they could pass through him because he is the *********************** *************************** in I live.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, you have the answer.

MR. SONGA:
We take due note of the contradiction between this denial and what he stated in his identification sheet.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, Your Honour.  What contradiction?  What is the contradiction? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, there is no contradiction.  He has repeated his answer he has given in your previous -- to your previous question.  He said this man is not related to him, neither his friend, nor his relative nor acquaintance.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, with all due respect, what was the object of point 14?  It was to state whether a person was a friend, relative or acquaintance, or else his name should not appear there, but I do not think this is the time for closing arguments, just yet.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you go to closing argument, Professor, you have received a full answer from the witness, which is that this name is included there because if the investigator wanted to reach him, he could be reached via that person.  That is the witness's understanding of why the name is there.  I mean, you can give it whatever interpretation you want, but that is the interpretation the witness is giving to it.
MR. SONGA:
That's correct, Your Honour.  That is why I state that we may go on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Before our break, Mr. Witness, we were dealing with the question of the location of Kabanda's store and his home.  Can you at this time give us the distance between the store and the home of Kabanda?
A.	I think that you want to come back because I had already given you my answer.  I told you that Kabanda's store was in Gishyita secteur and he, himself, lived in Bisesero secteur, which means, Counsel, that you just want to pull us back.
Q.	I shall ask the question again.  Can you evaluate the distance between the store and the house?
A.	I have repeated my response by telling you that his store was in Gishyita secteur and he, himself, lived in Bisesero secteur.  There was a certain distance and I answered the question at length, and I think that you want to bring me back.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement of the 9th October 2002, you state that you met Kabanda at his home; is that correct?
A.	Kabanda was in the houses that belonged to him.
Q.	Would you please answer the question.  Do you acknowledge that you stated that you met Kabanda at his home?
A.	The houses belonged to Kabanda and I met him in Gishyita.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did you meet -- you met Kabanda on 10th of April.  Where did you meet him?
THE WITNESS: 
I met him in Gishyita in the houses that belonged to him and where he plied his trade.  However, he went back to his home.  He had various properties, various houses that he leased and others wherein he ran his business.  He also had farms that he cultivated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just answer the question.  Where did you meet him on 7th of April.
THE WITNESS:
I met him in Gishyita.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where his house is located?  In his house? 
THE WITNESS:
He had houses in Gishyita, but that is not where his home was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would I be right in stating that you did not meet Kabanda at his home?
A.	His residence was in Bisesero, that is where his wife and children were, but in Gishyita, that is where he plied his trade and that is where he spent the whole day and he went back in the evening to Bisesero.  So he came to Gishyita to see how his property was doing, and that is where he had farms that he cultivated and that is where he kept all his property.
Q.	With the leave of the President, I shall read an excerpt of this statement of 9 October 2002.  I am referring to page 3 and therein to paragraph 5, which begins as follows: "We found Kabanda at his home where he informed us that Mika and Ruzindana had caused a block to be set up near the school and that they had arrested Nkundiye and Mulindahabi, who were two agronomists of the secteur.  Kabanda asked us to go back home and that is what we did."  When you said "home", did you actually mean "store"?
A.	Yes, I was alluding to the store.  I could not confuse the owner of the house with other people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, the English translation is "house", not "home", and those are two different concepts.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have the answer.  Please move on to another question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your statement of 12th December 1999 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your statement of 12th December 1999, you state that before you came across young Bosco, you had, yourself, noticed that a roadblock had been set up at the junction before the Gishyita primary school and you had noted the presence of Mika around this as well as the presence of two communal policemen; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  There was a policeman called Munyansanga and another called Ruhindura.  They were in the presence or in the company of Mika.  This roadblock was at the Kibuye-Cyangugu junction and they were looking for any person called an Inyenzi, that is a Tutsi.
Q.	Had you crossed this roadblock?
A.	I was not able to cross this roadblock because that is where Kabanda had advised us not to cross the roadblock, and we went back.  Kabanda told us that Mika might kill us.
Q.	Did you notice what the roadblock was used for?
A.	All vehicles that passed were searched and Tutsis were sought on board these vehicles.
Q.	So I might understand that you saw people arrested at that roadblock?
A.	When you stand in front of Mika's house, you can see what is happening on this roadblock.  You can see all the passers-by.
Q.	Did you see persons being arrested at this roadblock?
A.	Apart from myself, since the death of the president of the republic, there were roadblocks everywhere.  Was this not the situation everywhere in Rwanda? 
Q.	Did you see this roadblock with your own eyes?
A.	Yes, I saw it with my own eyes where it was located opposite the primary school when you are on the road leading to the communal office.
Q.	I'm going to read you an excerpt of your statement of 9th October 2002. I am referring to page 3 of this statement.  "We met Kabanda at his home where he told us that Mika and Ruzindana had caused a roadblock to be set up near the school and that they had caused the arrest of Nkundiye and Mulindahabi."  According to your statement, it is Kabanda who told you that Mika and Ruzindana had set up the roadblock; is that correct?
A.	I told you that this is not correct.  Bosco made us go back when Kabanda saw us.  I explained to him.  As I explained, he said that -- and I say you should not go back.  Please go on with other questions.
Q.	No, you must not tell me what to do.  I would like to know whether you saw the roadblock with your own eyes or whether you heard of it from Kabanda?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please answer the question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor.  In fairness to the witness, you ought to keep your mind focused on both statements, because in the statement of 12 December 1999, that position is very explicitly explained, and, therefore, really, it is unfair to deal with it only on the basis of the one statement that does not include the fact of prior knowledge of the road block.
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that I was about to arrive at this roadblock and Kabanda informed us, unless you have other questions to ask me regarding that.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, while taking account of your remarks, I would like to state that I have both statements here before me and that I am trying to exercise equity in regard to the witness.  May I continue?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Continue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	At the same time, Mr. Witness, in your statement of 12 December 1999, you state that you went back in the company of Kabanda to Bisesero and you went without incident and everybody was able to return to his home; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  Up there people had not started attacking us yet.
Q.	And this remained true till the morning of 8th of April, the next day?
A.	On the following day, people launched an attack in Kiziba.  He had a megaphone and he said, "Let us exterminate this Inyenzi, let us flush them out in the forests."
Q.	May we consider that up until 8th of April, nothing particular had taken place; there had been no killings in Gishyita or in Bisesero?
A.	Apart from the two men who had been arrested in the morning upon the death of Habyarimana, that is Nkundiye and Mulindahabi, it is only on 8th of April that the attacks were launched, but in Bisesero, and where I wasn't, people were exterminated.
Q.	You state that on the next day, 8th of April at 8 o'clock, Sikubwabo, Mika and Interahamwe, wearing uniforms that was usually worn by medical personnel, launched an attack in Bisesero.  Mika and Sikubwabo were armed with guns and the former was carrying a megaphone; is that correct?
A.	Mika had a megaphone and he had his own gun, and Sikubwabo also had his own gun.
Q.	Did Mika also have grenades?
A.	Yes, he had them.
Q.	Could you describe how he bore or how he was carrying his gun?
A.	He was holding it with arms and not with legs.
Q.	And how was he holding the grenades?
A.	He had grenades in his pockets and when he arrived close to a crowd, he pulled the grenade from his pocket and threw them and people were thus exterminated.
Q.	What sort of pockets were these?
A.	The pockets of his jacket and the pockets of his trousers.
Q.	How did he hold the megaphone?
A.	He had the megaphone on board the vehicle.  When he got -- boarded it coming from  Kiziba -- on going to Kiziba, rather.
Q.	So when he came down from the vehicle, he was not bearing a megaphone?
A.	When he came up after having said that the Inyenzi must be exterminated, he left the megaphone in the vehicle.  He asked people to keep the megaphone.
Q.	When he spoke into the megaphone, he had not already yet come down from the vehicle?
A.	He was still next to the vehicle and he called people of Gishyita and Musenyi saying, "Come up.  The Inyenzi have attacked.  Track them in the forests." 
Q.	Your answer is not very clear.  I'm going to put the question to you again.  When he used the megaphone, was he in the vehicle or he had come down from the vehicle?
A.	He stood next to the vehicle.
Q.	When he stood next to the vehicle, he had his gun, his grenades and the megaphone?
A.	Yes, he had these weapons when he chased us in the bush.  He threw grenades at us and he fired at us.
Q.	Mr. Witness, how were the Interahamwe dressed?
A.	Some had white clothing.  Others had civilian clothing.  There were many.
Q.	Still with reference to your statement of 12 December 1999, were the Interahamwe in uniform or not?
A.	I have told that you the Interahamwe were wearing red clothes as well as doctors' aprons.  Others had civilian clothing, there were many.
Q.	So there were no uniforms?
A.	If a person is wearing an apron, can he not also wear trousers or shorts? 
Q.	What comprised the uniform of the Interahamwe, the aprons?
A.	I am talking to you about what I saw.  If you deny it, ask Mika.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have told you so many times not to comment on the questions.  Please answer the question as you know.  

Yes, Professor, please repeat your question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was asking you to state whether it was the aprons that were the uniform of the Interahamwe?
A.	I told you that Interahamwe were wearing these white clothing.  Others were wearing red clothing, and yet others were wearing civilian clothes.  Some came from Gisenyi, others from Cyangugu, who had come with Yusuf, who was a Moslem.  All these Interahamwe were in civilian clothing.
Q.	How many Interahamwes were there?
A.	If I make an estimate, I think there were about 3,000 of them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to refresh your memory and to say that we are talking about the 8th April.  On 8th April, did you see 3,000 Interahamwe? 
A.	I did not count them.  If I am making an estimate, I would reckon that they had between 300 and 30,000.  I didn't count all those who were there present.
Q.	You are saying between 300 and 30,000?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  What led you to believe, Mr. Witness, that the uniforms had come from a health establishment?
A.	The clothes they were wearing -- well, they killed at Murama and at Ngoma, and after having killed people, they took away those clothes.
Q.	Even the red clothes?
A.	Those red clothes I think had been prepared way ahead, so that blood is spilled on the red clothing.
Q.	I'd like, Mr. Witness, to conclude my questioning on the uniforms by asking a question.  When you say that they were clothed in red and white clothes, were there some people who were wearing red clothes and others white clothes, or each Interahamwe was wearing clothing that had both red and white colours?
A.	I am going to clearly explain things to you.  I'm saying that the various attacks here were led by different people.  For instance, those who came from Kizibaziba met at Bisesero with those who had come from Nyarutovu.  All those people had a leader, and they identified themselves in order not to kill themselves.
Q.	The attack of 8 April in Bisesero, where exactly did it take place?
A.	That attack took place on the Nyarutovu hill in the Nyarutovu cellule.
Q.	Where did the attacks come from?
A.	The attack that was led by Mika came from Gishyita, and the attack that was led by Muhirwa, who was a conseiller, came from Mukiziba, and the attack that was led by Rutaganira met with the other attacks at Kizibaziba.  As for Ruzindana's attack, he met with the attack of Ndimbati and those of Musema at a location called Gitabura.
Q.	Did you see those various groups with your own eyes?
A.	From the very beginning, I told you that the war ended when I was at Bisesero.  I am talking to you about what I saw.  I'm talking about a factor of which I was an eyewitness.
Q.	Did you hear some assailants give orders?
A.	In the evening when they were going back, they used to meet at a specific area in the Bisesero hill, and some persons would say, "Tomorrow we must come back, and you should exterminate those people." 
Q.	And when they used to go back, did they meet at Bisesero, or it is when they left Bisesero that they met?
A.	When they used to return from the forest, they would give themselves a signal to return and they would meet near the vehicles and they would use whistles, and when they used to rally, their leaders, like Sikubwabo and Mika as well as the bourgmestre, Musema, they would say that they would have to meet the next day and surround the hills in order to systematically eliminate those who were found on those hills.
Q.	And on the morning, on that 8 April, did you hear anybody give orders?
A.	On the 8th, they came to Kiziba and they went up killing people and they came together at Gishyita in order to attack Bisesero, and from the high hills of Bisesero we could see them as well as their vehicles, and when they used to come up, we used to see them.
Q.	How long, Mr. Witness, did you maintain the distance separating you from Mika?
A.	Are you talking about a distance between my house and Mika's? 
Q.	No, I am talking about the distance between you and Mika?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
At what time and at what place, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:  
We are talking about on the 8th April when the assailants came at 8 a.m. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What was the distance between Mika and yourself, Mr. Witness?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mika would be mobile, and the witness would be hiding, so it's at what hour do you want the distance that you ask, or when doing what act?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	At 8 a.m., to begin with.
A.	Are you asking me the question, or do you realise that you are the one who is answering questions?  On that day of 8 April, I said that we went down the Nyarutovu hill and Mika was talking to us through the megaphone.  He was at Kiziba and he was calling on people to exterminate others.  If you ask me the distance, I have told that you I did not measure it.  I told you that I was at a distance of about 30 to 50 metres.
Q.	How did Mika reach the location?
A.	He came on board a communal vehicle and he was in the company of Sikubwabo, and five Interahamwe.
Q.	Who was driving the vehicle?
A.	It is Sikubwabo who was driving the vehicle.
(Pages 30 to 41 by Trevor Gerbes)

	1745H
BY MR. SONGA: (continuing)
Q.	What was the distance between you and that vehicle? 
A.	He was climbing to meet us in the hills.  We were at Nyarutovu and they climbed until they reached an area where they started shooting at us.  After that, they captured Rwakayiro and Rwagasana.  They killed people and they seized cattle. 
Q.	What was the distance between you and the location called Mukiziba? 
A.	I have told you that I did not measure the distance.  I have told you that I was a metre or up to 50 metres from Mukiziba where they climbed when they were killing people on their way. 
Q.	You said, Mr. Witness, that they parked their car at a location called Mukiziba.  Between the location where they parked their vehicle and where they launched the attack, was there a distance? 
A.	I have said that it was between one and 50 metres.  I talked to you about an area where Birara, as well as Rwagasana -- probably if we were in that area, we would be able to measure the distance. 
Q.	You say that when Mika was broadcasting his messages, how was he? 
A.	I knew Mika well before.  I knew him when he was in the company of Sikubwabo.  I have identified him to you here in the courtroom.  Ask me others questions.  I think on that matter, I have given enough explanations.  I have told you that he was talking through a megaphone and he was calling on people to kill and exterminate the Tutsis, and I think I have talked about this at length. 
Q.	Was he the only person who was broadcasting messages? 
A.	He is the one who was holding the megaphone and he had the right to give the message.  He was the conseiller of Gishyita and he was an influential figure amongst the Interahamwe.
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that amongst the attackers, there were four communal policemen, including Boniface.  Who is Boniface? 
A.	Boniface was a communal policeman, and at a certain time he was the conseiller of the Bisesero secteur. 
Q.	On that 8th April 1994, was he still a conseiller? 
A.	It would appear that he still acted in that capacity because he was the communal treasurer and he had a gun. 
Q.	I do not understand.  Is a communal treasurer the same thing as the conseiller of secteur? 
A.	The treasurer is like a policeman because he collects taxes of the commune, or council taxes, as it were. 
Q.	So should we retain that on the 8th of April 1994, Boniface was a communal treasurer? 
A.	He was like a policeman in any case.  He would arrest and lock you up in prison.  He was a policeman like any other.  Even if he was the treasurer, he also acted as a policeman. 
Q.	Who is Munyansanga? 
A.	Munyansanga originated from the Bisesero secteur.  He was also a policeman.
Q.	And Ruhindura? 
A.	He was equally a policeman in the Musenyi secteur. 
Q.	Who killed Ruhindura? 
A.	Ruhindura died in the attack that was launched at the Bisesero hill.  When they launched the attacks, they were killed in turn.  It is the Tutsis who killed him. 
Q.	What weapons did the Tutsis have? 
A.	They used stones, sticks and machetes to defend themselves. 
Q.	You stated that there were about 3,000 Tutsis.  Where did they come from? 
A.	The Tutsis came from all the eight secteurs of Gishyita commune.  The Tutsis who resided in that secteur all left and fled towards Bisesero.  Of course, I am referring to those who weren't killed. 
Q.	Where were you placed in this crowd of 3,000 Tutsis? 
A.	How can I tell you where I was?  I didn't stay on the same spot.  The whole day we were running in that bush, in all those bushes. 
Q.	Can you explain to us how you struggled to fight back the assailants, as well as your flight were conducted?
A.	When the assailants approached us, we used to lie on the ground.  They would shoot bullets, these bullets would pass over our heads, and we would pick stones to shoot at them.  And when those assailants used to realise that there were many stones towards where they were, they would withdraw and flee. 
Q.	Can you confirm that the attacks of 8th April began at 8 a.m. and would end at 6 p.m.?
A.	I am telling you that the attack began in the morning to end in the evening.  Each time they attacked us, it was to kill people; that was their only objective.  Even in the evening, they used to kill people.  So I cannot tell you at what precise hour they used to stop, but I can tell you that those people participated in the massacre.  But as for the time, be it in the morning or at night, those assailants used to kill people. 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, I know you are conscious of the fact that you have been at it for quite sometime.  We would wish you to wind it up in the course of the day. 
MR. SONGA:
You can count on me, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your statement, Mr. Witness, your statement of 9th October 2000, you state that on the 7th of 
April 1994, you were at home when you heard shouts originating from the Bisesero secteur, which wasn't far from your cellule, and with people from the other cellules, you decided to go and see what was happening there; is that correct? 
A.	People cried out saying that thieves were attacking them.  People shouted, they went to see what was happening, and when we reached the place, we realised that it was rather a plan that was hatched in a bid to kill Tutsis and that it wasn't thieves, and I think I explained this to you. 
Q.	I am asking the question because there's a problem with dates.  In the statement of 12th 
December 1999, you stated that on the day of the 7th April and that -- rather, well, now I am asking this question -- I mean, how did those events of 7th April occur? 
A.	On that matter, you are referring to a statement that I am not aware of.  I am telling you that I was asked questions several times, and what's the relation between that statement and other statements which you refer?  Rather, tell me on what date I said this and ask me for explanations.
Q.	That is what I just did, Mr. Witness.  On the date of 9th October 2002, you stated that on the 7th of April you heard noise around Bisesero and you went out to try to find out what was happening.  I gave you the date of your statement, and I gave the date that you referred to in your statement as a date on which attacks were being launched. 
A.	I told you that the attacks began on the 8th, and we are talking about the attack that was led by Mika, but what you are referring to in the statement concerns the shouts that we heard, and we went to see what was happening because when people told us that there were robbers or thieves, we went and realised that there were, rather, assailants who wanted to exterminate us.
Q.	When you were moving towards Bisesero and that you reached Nyarutovu, you saw several people in the valley.  Were there civilians?  There were civilians, soldiers and Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	On that point, the valley in question, I think you are referring to Mukiziba, where policemen and other assailants had rallied or come together. 
Q.	Please, help us to make a difference between Mukiziba and Nyarutovu hill, itself.
A.	I have explained to you on that matter by saying that it would be preferable for us to be on the spot to understand the configuration of the area.  When you are at Nyarutovu, you have Mukiziba below and you can see Mukiziba.  There is no obstacle between those two locations.
Q.	Did events that you situate on the 7th of April in your declaration of 9th October 2000, are they the same events or are they different from what you described to us for the date of 8th April? 
A.	I have explained to you that on the 7th, following the death of Habyarimana -- I told you that he died on the 6th, and that on the 7th, we went to buy banana beer and realised that Mika had erected an obstacle or roadblock on the road.  I don't think you have to dwell on this because I have already furnished you with explanations thereon. 
Q.	You continue with your declaration of the 9th October 2002 by saying that, "When they reached Kinyirabito, we started shooting stones at them."  Is that correct? 
A.	That is what happened.  The assailants had started shooting at us.  They started by killing Birara, Rwakayiro and Rwagasana.  It is at that point that the refugees called for help and they went to confront the assailants that were shooting at us. 
Q.	Now, the people who were in valley, were they the same as those who were at the foot of Nyarutovu?
A.	Please listen, we are not talking about a valley; it is rather Mukiziba.  You should try to understand that it has to do with Mukiziba, whereas we were standing at the Nyarutovu hill, and on that hill, there were Tutsis, whereas the Hutus were coming up from Mukiziba and they were coming to kill us with machetes and guns.  It is at that position that the person in question said, "Exterminate them." 
Q.	Who is Birara, Mr. Witness?
A.	Birara was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Is that all you can say in identifying him? 
A.	Are you talking about Birara?  Well, I would tell you that he was a Tutsi; he was a farmer.  He fell during the attack that was led by Mika and Sikubwabo and the Interahamwe that I mentioned to you. 
Q.	And who was Rwagasana?
A.	He was also a Tutsi. 
Q.	What was his occupation?
A.	He was also a farmer.
Q.	How did you know him?
A.	All those people were my neighbours.  We lived in the same secteur. 
Q.	Did you know them before the attack? 
A.	I knew all of them. 
Q.	Did you see the murders with your own eyes?
A.	I was an eyewitness of those murders on the occasion of the attack that was led by Mika, the bourgmestre, the policemen, at the time Mika was speaking into his megaphone. 
Q.	As you witnessed the events, do you know who killed Birara? 
A.	Rwakayiro was killed by Mika.  He is the one who shot him down in a coffee plantation on the Mukiziba hills.  At Kibaba, he threw a stick.  He was shot at and he fell and was killed with machetes.  Well, Mika was the person who was leading the Interahamwe, and I saw him with my own eyes. 
Q.	When Rwakayiro and Birara were being killed, was Mika still holding the megaphone?
A.	He had put down his microphone in his vehicle, and the assailants moved towards us, shooting at us, but before they had called on people using the megaphone to exterminate us, he emphasised that point. 
Q.	Were you able to see how Rwagasana was clothed, for instance? 
A.	Well, well, if you have somebody, can you fail to identify his clothing?  He was wearing a shirt, a jacket and a pair of trousers.  He was also wearing a pair of trousers and a jacket.  He was wearing the same clothes, but it would appear as if you are trying to make an inventory of the clothes that they were wearing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Question of relevance to the Accused.  How are these questions related to the Accused? 
MR. SONGA:
I am trying to ascertain if he was actually an eyewitness to the events that he is talking about. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Unless he has previously told you what clothes each of these persons -- unless other witnesses have told you what clothes these people were wearing at the time -- in respect, I don't know how that would help your cross-examination, whatever the answer.  If he said they were dressed in overcoats, how does that affect the Defence?  If he said they had no shirts, how does that affect the Defence, unless he has previously, in another statement, said they were wearing green clothes or they were naked or something different?
MR. SONGA:
For instance, all the victims were dressed in the same way.  It is interesting to find out how they were dressed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But Professor, like now we are -- all the main people in this room are wearing --  are dressed in the same way.  We have got robes on, most of us have shirts.  How does that make a difference?  That is the point I am making, unless there is testimony that he has said previously that they were dressed differently; then you can go into finding out that he is not being credible because on one occasion he has said they were wearing green clothes, and on the next occasion he is saying they are wearing red clothes.  But when he says they were wearing trousers, shirts, coats, it is not particularly a great signification. 
MR. SONGA:
I understand your remark, Your Honour, and with your permission, we can proceed. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That would be very nice. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How did you survive the Nyarutovu attack? 
A.	I tried to flee.  Everybody was just running away, if you could -- and you only died when your time came.  I don't know whether you want to dwell on that question.  If I didn't want to die -- if I wanted to die, I would have stayed there, but I didn't want to and I ran away.
Q.	In your statement of the 12th of December 1999, Witness, that is what you state:  "As a matter of fact, as from the 8th of April 1994, the attacks were led by two teams; the attackers coming from Gisovu who were led by Ngirumpatse, Musema, and who were escorted by communal policemen from Gisovu and prison superintendents, as well as the Hutu population of Gisovu.  

"Then there was the second group which came from Ngoma, Gishyita, and were led by the trio, Sikubwabo, Ruzindana, Mika, and it included many Interahamwe."  Is that correct? 
A.	I believe that all the hills you have just mentioned -- well, when you think of all those hills, particularly during the period of mourning, as this is the case now, it is very difficult.  I spoke to you about attacks I witnessed.  I believe you should instead put other questions to me.  These are not questions you should be putting to me, Counsel. 
Q.	Please allow me to ask those questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it is not for you to decide which questions should be put to you or which questions shouldn't be put to you.  You just answer the question asked by the Defence counsels.  

Yes, Counsel, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, in the statement I have just read out to you, you make mention of two groups of attackers.  However, in the statement of the 9th of October, we read the following at the end of page 3, beginning of page 4:  "Very early in the morning of the 8th of April, all Tutsis in Bisesero secteur went to seek refuge on Muyira hill.  There were thousands and thousands of us who assembled there.  At about 
8 a.m., the assailants attacked us on that hill.  They were more numerous than the day before, and they were coming from Gishyita, Ngoma, Gisovu and Mubuga secteurs," and you mentioned those of Gishyita.  You mention those of Mubuga secteur and you also make mention of those from Gisovu, and lastly, those from Muramba and Ngoma.  Which group of assailants are you referring to, since we have two in one statement and in another four?
A.	Let me explain the situation clearly.  As regards the groups, there was one group led by the conseiller and each conseiller had his group.  There was also another group led by Mika and Sikubwabo, and secteurs were distributed to them and they passed through those secteurs.  We were therefore attacked by assailants from Gishyita and assailants led by Ndimbati.  These were very influential people.  They were assisted by prison superintendents, communal police, and they shared out secteurs amongst themselves, secteurs to which they passed. 
Q.	Witness, did all the assailants arrive at the same time? 
A.	They came, they met at various locations.  Each person left his secteur with his group.  For instance, Sikubwabo would come with Mika in a vehicle.  Ruzindana came from wherever with assailants and passed through Ngoma, where he gathered other assailants.  I believe I have given sufficient explanation on this question. 
Q.	You state, Witness, that you heard, after the war, that Mika and Sikubwabo decapitated Kabanda.  Who told you that? 
A.	It was not after the war that I received that information; it was during the war.  It was during the war that Kabanda's head was cut off by the assailants and brought downhill and hung up.  We saw the body in a forest where the assailants had abandoned it. 
Q.	Did your informants tell you who decapitated Kabanda?
A.	It was the assailants led by Mika and Sikubwabo, and Kabanda's head was brought to Gishyita and exhibited.  And the leaders of the attack showed -- they heard people saying, "We have killed Kabanda." 
Q.	And who told you that the police officer Charles had seen his genitals cut off. 

MR. KAPAYA:
My Lords, may I -- the issue of the death of Kabanda and the police officer, I think we have led witnesses who have direct evidence on these issues, and counsel may wish to reserve his 
cross-examination on those issues on witnesses who will testify to seeing the decapitation of Kabanda, and Charles, other than this witness, who just says that he heard about these things.  I don't think the value -- the probative value of his testimony in this regard --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is up to Defence Counsel how to recognise his cross-examination, Mr. Kapaya, and this is in the statement of the witness.  

Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you learn -- did you receive information regarding the person who cut off the genitals? 
A.	It was Mika who did it, and he hung them up on a pole in front of his door, in order to prove that he had been courageous in killing Tutsis. 
Q.	Are you stating what you saw yourself? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Answer, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
As regards that question, when Charles's genitals were cut off, it was Mika who did that and the genitals were hung up on a pole in front of Mika's home.  Nobody else cut off the genitals or, rather, the penis of Charles; it was, rather, the assailants led my Mika. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you see it yourself?
THE WITNESS:
That person was arrested in Bisesero, on the hills where we were trying to flee to.  Everyone was fleeing in various directions, and I state that it is Mika who led the assailants.  Otherwise, Charles's penis would have been hung up in Ngoma or elsewhere, but it was hung up in Gishyita, precisely because it was cut off by the assailants led by Mika, and these are the people who cut off his penis and hung it very close to his house in his secteur.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you see this yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw the penis.  It was the investigator who brought it down and when -- we showed the investigators where it had been hung up on a pole. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question is very simple.  Did you see the assailants led by Mika, yourself?
THE WITNESS:
When Charles was flushed out, it was the assailants led by Mika who arrested him.  We were fleeing across the hills, but whenever someone was arrested, you could not know exactly who had arrested him, but initially, we had seen Mika among the attackers during that attack. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you a witness to the act on Charles by the assailants led by Mika?
THE WITNESS:
We witnessed Charles's arrest, and Mika was among those who arrested him and took him away. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, in your statement of the 9th of October 2000, regarding the genitals of  the communal police officer known as Charles, this is what you stated, and we are on page 4 of the statement: "Similarly, I heard that they cut up the genitals of a communal police officer of Gishyita known as Charles.  The genitals were hung up on an electric pole."  This is not a statement from somebody who witnessed the event with his own eyes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness has said that he witnessed the arrest and the taking away, and not the cutting or the hanging.  Judge Khan has done whatever she could to try and get him to say whether he actually saw them hung.  The witness -- all he could say he saw was the arrest of Charles and his taking away.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you for that clarification.   
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you state that you heard that two agricultural officers were also killed in Gishyita by Mika; is that correct? 
A.	I have the impression that I have given you ample explanation on this point.  When the roadblock was set up, all Tutsis were arrested, and that is where the agricultural officers Nkindiyamurinda were arrested.  That is the truth.  It was those people who killed them.  They should have helped us by showing us where, in which latrine, they had thrown the bodies so that we could exhume them and bury them in dignity. 
Q.	In your statement of the 12th of December 1999, you state that around mid-May 1994, while you were in a bush in Rugona, Sikubwabo and Mika, at the head of about a hundred Interahamwe, flushed out a lady known as Mukaremera; is that correct? 
A.	As regards Pascasie Mukaremera, I explained to you that Mika scored -- rather, he cut up that woman from the stomach down to the genitals, and he took out the baby and placed the baby near the body.  The baby cried for sometime and then died.  And I also stated that that lady's hands were cut up and there were stuck on sharpened sticks.  I explained this point amply.
Q.	How do you know that, Witness?
A.	I have explained to you that I knew her because she was from Bisesero secteur, and it was from that secteur that her husband hailed. 
Q.	What was the name of her husband, please? 
A.	Since I knew only that woman, and bearing in mind the fact that she hid very close to us, the husband's name was unknown to me because she was from Gishyobwa (sic) secteur -- from Gitabura secteur. 
Q.	You stated that Mika prescribed the conduct to be kept by the assailants.  The assailants led her after flushing her out of the bush.  They took her to where Mika and Sikubwabo were, and the assailants were shouting, "There they are, let us arrest them."  What was she doing when she was arrested? 
A.	Are you referring to that lady?  The woman was crying.  When somebody is being killed, the person would cry and beg for mercy. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you please answer the question?  Help us by answering the question. 
THE WITNESS:
She was hiding in a bush.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question was: "Where was she hiding?"
MR. SONGA:
I have not understood what Madam President just said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We said -- that between the answer and question --
MR. SONGA:
That's okay, Madam President.  Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You added that you heard Mika speaking to Sikubwabo and Interahamwe and saying, "Bring that woman to me so that we can open up her stomach and see the position of the baby in her belly."  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And at what distance were you when you heard that statement?
A.	I have told you that I was a distance of about 50 metres.  However, I crave your indulgence because I didn't measure the distance.  So please, don't put questions to me regarding the distance but instead, question me with regard to evidence that could be of relevance to you. 
Q.	You state that Mika and Sikubwabo flushed out the lady.  At the same time, you state that the woman was brought to them.  What should we take as the truth? 
A.	I believe all what I am telling you is the truth because I was an eyewitness of those events.  When those men wanted to capture somebody, they brought the person to them.  I am telling you about things I saw with my own eyes.  So it would be difficult for me to answer questions that I do not quite understand, but what I am telling you is what I saw with my own eyes, things I was an eyewitness to. 
Q.	What does 20 metres represent to you in this courtroom? 
A.	Twenty metres represent the length of a house.  What I was saying is that I was hiding in a bush and I did not have a decametre to measure the distance. 
Q.	My question was whether you could give an estimate of that distance within this courtroom.
A.	I have explained to you clearly, but when you make estimates, you may go wrong, but I am referring to events I witnessed, and I stated that it was between 20 and 50 metres.  It was a short distance.  I saw what had happened from where I was hiding. 
Q.	You stated, Witness, on the 12th of December 1999 that Mika took hold of a machete and after putting -- after making the woman lie on the floor, he cut her up, and once the stomach was open, the Interahamwe pulled out the baby and put her near her mother.  Tell us, where did Mika get the machete from? 
A.	Mika took a machete from the hands of an Interahamwe because he was carrying a gun.  He opened up that woman to see the position of the baby in her mother's womb, and thereafter, he put the baby near the mother.  The baby cried, and I explained this very clearly to you.
Q.	At that time, where was his gun? 
A.	He had slung his gun over his shoulders.
Q.	How was Pascasie dressed at that time? 
A.	She was wearing a miniskirt and a trousers known as Mugondo.  She was also wearing a loin clothes. 
Q.	Do you remember the colour of her clothes?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, I don't know how this question will help you or the answer will help you. 
MR. SONGA:
I ask this question, Madam President, because I want to demonstrate that what he is saying is not true, that the events did not occur in that manner, that he saw nothing.
JUDGE SHORT:
But how are you going to prove that by asking the witness the colour of the dress she was wearing?  Are you in a position to contradict any statement that the witness would make?  Do you have proof? For example, if he says that she was wearing a green dress, are you going to suggest to him that she was actually wearing a red dress?  Are you going to -- I mean, how are you going to use that piece of evidence?
MR. SONGA:
If he were to tell me, Your Honour, that he didn't know the colour, wouldn't that be an indication that he saw nothing?  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
As a matter of fact, it might not be.  I can hardly remember the colour Judge Khan was wearing yesterday and I saw her.  I mean, those are very, very minor things.  Do you expect him to remember the colour of a dress that was worn in 1994, in a situation where they were being fired at?  I mean, we don't have angels in court, do we?  These people are human. 
MR. SONGA:
Right then, Your Honour, but this is not the first time a witness is questioned with regard to colour, but let us proceed to the next question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Tell us how Mika cut the woman open from the stomach to the genitals.  Describe to us what happened.
A.	I think that you are beginning to tire me, Counsel.  I have explained at length how Mika cut open this woman's stomach from the breast right down to the genitals.  I explained this clearly. 
Q.	So what -- how was the blow given by Mika?  How effective was it for the surgery, as it were, that he conducted for the baby to come out? 
A.	Don't you know that you can skin a goat and disembowel it and take out the goat's entrails?  That can be done. 
Q.	May we take it that this is what happened, like what happens for a goat? 
A.	When a goat is butchered, the stomach or the entrails are removed.  Similarly, Mika disembowelled the woman and took the child out of her mother's womb, and a few moments after that, the baby died. 
Q.	Do you have an idea as to the machete that was used?  What was it like?  What size was it?
A.	Do you want us to measure the size of the machete?  It is not I who manufactured the machete.  When a machete is manufactured, it is sharpened, and with time its size reduces, but we are not going to be measuring the size of these machetes here.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that after screaming for almost 30 minutes, the baby stopped crying; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  That is what I stated and that is the truth.  It is the answer that I gave to the investigators who asked me questions.  

Listen, this is a situation that I saw with my own eyes.  I told you that during those 90 days I was always in this region, in Bisesero.  I did not go away from that region.  You may ask me another question. 
Q.	Here we are then.  Where were you during those 30 minutes?  
A.	I have answered you that when people were cut up with machetes in Rugona, I hid at the same place until nightfall, and from there I went to see how these women had been killed. 
Q.	And what was Mika doing during the 30 minutes when the baby was crying?
A.	They withdrew and they continued to search, to look for other refugees that were hiding. 
Q.	And where were you when Mika was cutting off Pascasie's hands? 
A.	Listen, you are asking me the same question ten times and I have given the same answer. 
Q.	Which answer?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, he has already answered your question.  Move on to another question, please. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How long did the attack last? 
A.	The assailants came in the morning and launched the attacks which lasted till the evening, at nightfall. 
Q.	Did I understand you correctly when I noted that you said that Pascasie was farming when she was found? 
A.	No, she was not farming, but the assailants were hunting down refugees in the bushes.  So you did not understand me correctly.  They were hunting refugees.  There was no question of any farming. 
Q.	Between Mika and Sikubwabo, who was giving the orders? 
A.	Both acted in the same manner because they were both in power and both wanted to massacre Tutsi, so they obeyed the same orders. 
Q.	Between the two, who was the leader then?
A.	Sikubwabo was bourgmestre, the other one was conseiller, so Sikubwabo gave orders to the conseiller, but at that time, there were persons who occupied lower positions than that of Mika who were even more carefully obeyed than the president of the republic.
Q.	You state that immediately after, another woman called Kankuyu was 50 metres away from where the previous victim was hiding, was found out and brought to about 20 metres away from Pascasie; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you know her before this event? 
A.	I have explained to you well before that I knew her.  She was a teacher in the Bisesero primary school. 
Q.	You state that she was hiding nearly 50 metres away from where Pascasie was lying down.  What was the distance between you? 
A.	I have told you that there was a distance of about 50 metres, and this is only an estimate.  I told you that I did not have a tape measure to measure this distance, and I think I explained to you that what I gave you as a distance is only an estimate, and when you make estimates, one can make mistakes.
Q.	In the meantime, you were still at the same place where you were when Pascasie was cut up -- was disembowelled? 
A.	I think that this is becoming a debate here.  If you wish, you can come with me one day and we shall measure the distance. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Just answer the question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just answer the question and don't make comments. 
THE WITNESS:
I gave him explanations to this on this subject.  I told him that I was hiding in the same place from morning till night and I left my hideout after the assailants had left. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that the group of Mika, Sikubwabo and Interahamwe accompanied by 
Obed Ruzindana discovered you, four of you on Kanyinya hill and they promised you peace and medicine; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  There was Ruzindana, Mika and two soldiers.  I stated this officially. 
Q.	At what time do you situate this discovery, Mr. Witness?
A.	This happened in the month of May, I would say between the 10th and the 14th, before the attacks that were launched on Muyira hill. 
Q.	At what time of the day was it? 
A.	I was not wearing a watch, but if I make an estimate, I would say it was between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Q.	And who are the three other people who were in your company?
A.	There was a certain Rwagasana, who is dead; others died afterwards but I remember -- I only remember Rwagasana, who is now deceased. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am going to apply that a piece of paper be used for this witness to be able to state clearly the relationship that he had between Nyiramasugi, Colette, with your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, as you know that the witness is illiterate, but will he be able to write the name and relationship of this lady?  However, you can call the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness. 

Professor, are you going to mention the relationship of this lady with this witness?  Why don't you ask him the relationship of the witness with this lady?
MR. SONGA:
I was afraid for her safety or his safety, but with your leave, I shall ask the question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, Professor, you will ask the question, what is the relationship, and then he  will write it down.  The Interpreter will write it down for the witness so that it doesn't go into our system. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you will write down your answer on a piece of paper.  What is the relationship between you and Colette Nyiramasugi?   
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Write it down for the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When you refer to Colette Nyiramasugi, you said that she was raped by Musema.  What position was she in?  Was she sitting?  Was she standing up?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone is not on. 
THE WITNESS:
In response to this question regarding Musema and Colette Nyiramasugi, I will ask you not to put a question on this matter to me because I have already testified in this regard. 
MR. SONGA:
I await the instructions of the President as to whether I am authorised to ask questions thereon or not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the witness has not given any evidence regarding this matter in examination-in-chief.  What is the purpose of your cross-examination on this issue? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I would like to ask for clarification from the witness based on his statement dated 9th October 2002.  On the last page of his statement, this is what we can read.  "We are in Muyira.  It is only towards 6 p.m. that the assailants left the hill on that day.  There were several thousands dead, mostly women, children and old people who could not run for long.  Three of my six children were killed during this attack.  After the withdrawal of the assailants, some survivors went to another -- to our cellule to look for food at night.  I was with them along with my wife and my three remaining children.  We then went to Rugona hill, where we spent the night."

"The next day," to my understanding, this is the 9th of April, "we went to the Muyira hill to meet the others.  I stayed on this hill where we were attacked daily till the French arrived."
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise this statement? 
A.	As for this statement, I have explained how this attack was launched.  When my children were killed, I did not see how they were killed.  I told you that we went back home, and I explained this to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, understand the question and answer it, please.  

Professor, please repeat your question.
JUDGE SHORT:
I think the witness has heard the question.  Let him answer.  

Do you recollect that this was the statement you made?  Yes or no, and counsel will ask you another question. 
THE WITNESS:
That is indeed my statement, but on Muyira hill everyone went his own way.  The reason why I told you that I did not witness the killing of my children was this, because everybody was going his own way and towards evening we went to look for food.
MR. SONGA:
With the leave of Madam President, I would like to come back to this statement, to try to summarise it for the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	This is the 8th of April and we are on Muyira hill.  On that same day, Mr. Witness, you got back to your cellule to look for food.  On that same day, you spent the night in Rugona.  The next day you leave for Muyira, where you stayed till the end -- till the arrival of the French.  This is the summary of your statement.  Do you confirm these facts as stated? 
A.	What I can state is that on Muyira hill, which was a very high hill, we went to Muyira to meet -- to gather there and to harbour our strength. 
Q.	You confirm that you went to Muyira on the 9th? 
A.	We used to meet on this hill, on Muyira hill, to see from which side the attacks would come, especially those from Gisovu and Gishyita.  That is where we met because it is a high hill; I have said that. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my question was as follows:  If from the 9th you had gone to Muyira and that you stayed there until the French arrived, when did you go to Kanyinya?
A.	I explained to you we met on Muyira hill to be able to observe.  Please understand that we used to meet on Muyira hill, and when we were dispersed, we run.  If we had stayed there, we would have been killed.  We ran into all corners of Bisesero.
Q.	Is there any way of obtaining an answer to the question? 
A.	I have answered the question.  It seems to me that you do not accept the answer.  I said that in the morning we met on this Muyira hill, and when we scattered, we went to the hills of the secteur.  I do not know whether you understand me correctly.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my cross-examination.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Any re-examination? 

MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  One question, Your Honour, arising from the last question.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I ask you, how often did you go to Muyira hill between April, May and June 1994? How often? 
A.	During the attacks, we were scattered, and it is from Muyira that we were able to see the assailants.  We ran.  We ran to Kanyinya.  We went to Kabanda's and we ran across these hills.  I cannot count how many times I went to Muyira.
Q.	Thank you. 
MR. KAPAYA:
That is all, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President, we would like to tender the two statements as exhibits.  And beyond that, the health problems of our client, which are still present, with your leave, I will say something on the subject. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please.  Professor, let us first enter the documents you mentioned.  

The statement of 12th December 1999 is entered as Exhibit D. 16, under seal, D. 16E for English version, D. 16F for the French version and D. 16K for Kinyarwanda. 
	(Exhibit Nos. D. 16E, D. 16F and D. 16K admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement of 9th October 2002 is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 17E, for English, F for French and K for Kinyarwanda. 
	(Exhibit Nos. D. 17E, D. 17F and D. 17K admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
The state of health of my client is still of some concern, and he has requested that I inform the Chamber to take note and to help to see that he receives the most appropriate care.  

Yesterday he was indeed able to see a doctor and to receive some medicine, but he is of the opinion that this is not sufficient and that he should be examined by specialised services, in view of the illness that he is suffering from.  This is being stated so that during the course of the trial, we may not be overtaken by a situation that can be prevented if it is handled in time.  Madam President, this is what my client asked me to tell you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is raising his finger, he seems to have a question.  The witness would like to go out to relieve himself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are sorry.  Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  Thank you very much for your evidence and assisting the Court.  We wish you a safe journey home.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you also.
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, he was examined by the physician and he was found fit.  Anyway, we direct the registry to ask the commander of the UNDF to get the Accused examined once again by the concerned doctor, by the doctor, and the Accused be given appropriate treatment. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Very well, Madam President. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We adjourn for the day and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.  Thank you.  
	(Court adjourned at 1909H)
