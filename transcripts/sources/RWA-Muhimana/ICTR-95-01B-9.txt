That's very good. 

Madam Witness we want you to know that we do care for you.  If you have any problem, just let us know.  We will stop the proceedings and give you some time to continue with your evidence.  Now you are reminded of the oath you have taken --

Madam Prosecutor, please continue with your examination-in-chief.

Thank you, Your Honour.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	Thank you.  I want to welcome you and I also want to thank you for continuing with your testimony. 

Yesterday we were discussing the conditions under which you were detained by Mr. Mugonero from the 22nd of April to the 23 of April 1994.  

Let's move on, but we ask you, at Mugonero's house, did you see Mika at Mugonero's house?
A.	I saw Mika near the Mugonero residence.  It was in the morning.  Mika had come to tell Mugonero that they should return to Bisesero together because there were many Inyenzi there.
Q.	Madam Witness, when you saw Mika Muhimana, how close was Mika from where you were?
A.	He was outside the house on the veranda and he called Mugonero.
Q.	If Mika Muhimana was outside on the veranda, were you able to see Mika Muhimana from where you were?
A.	I was inside the house and I saw him through the window.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when did you see Mika at the Mugonero's house?  Do you remember the date?
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was on the 24th, because on the last day I stayed in Mugonero's house, I think that was the 24th.  I believe it was during one of the three days I spent in Mugonero's house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When did you leave Mugonero's house?  Can you give us the exact date?
THE WITNESS:
I left Mugonero's house on the night of the 24th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Madam Prosecutor, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Did you hear Mika say anything?
A.	Yes.  He called Mugonero and he told him that he should rally a lot of people so that they should organise an attack against Bisesero.  
What I'm saying is that Mugonero was one of the very important Interahamwes.  He had a group of Interahamwe he was leading.  As a matter of fact, in the area where he was resident, he was the leader of the Interahamwe.  Mika spoke to him, saying that they should return to Bisesero because there were many Inyenzi there.
Q.	Do you recall whether Mugonero said anything in response to Mika's request that they should go to Bisesero?
A.	He answered, saying that he was going to prepare to go with him and that he was going to rally people to leave for Bisesero.
Q.	Did Mika refer to you or did Mika say anything to Mugonero in reference to your presence?
A.	No, I did not hear him make reference to me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when Mika arrived at the Mugonero's house did he see you?
THE WITNESS:
He did not see me, because I was looking at him through the window, and he was outside.  To tell you the truth, he did not see me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	We will continue from there.  Can you explain to the Court how you left Mugonero's house on the night of the 24th of April?
A.	Yes, I can do that.  On the 24th, during the day, I stayed in the house, and in the evening the group of Interahamwe came back to the house and usually, when Mugonero came back to the house, he would come back with sheep and cows  he had looted from Tutsis' houses.  So when he came back he would start roasting meat.  When they returned that evening, if -- they started roasting meat and while they were sitting and eating meat it is true that he wasn't far from me.  He was very close to the window and I could hear all he was saying because it was quiet.  And while they were talking to one another this is what they were saying.  "When we shall finish killing Tutsis in Bisesero we shall kill Tutsi women married to Hutus and we shall also kill their children."  That was what they said every day and whenever they said that, they were saying it at the top of their voices, and I could hear them.  I would also say the Interahamwe who were guarding Mugenero's house knew I was in the house, and when I heard them speak I told myself that I was going to die. But, as you know, I knew that I didn't have any other choice and I told myself, "Why shouldn't I try to go back to where I was before?"  So I went out through the window, and I went back to the Bisesero hills.
Q.	When you went back to the Bisesero hills, did you find any refugees in Bisesero?
A.	It was still quite early.  There were still some refugees in that area.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, how did you leave Mugonero's house?
THE WITNESS:
I passed through the window.  There was a window overlooking the outer courtyard.  There was another window overlooking the banana plantation.  I went out through this latter window, in order to get out of Mugonero's compound.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Mrs. Prosecutor, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	When you left Mugonero's house and you went to Bisesero, did you see Mika Muhimana at any stage in Bisesero?
A.	I saw him on several occasions.  I cannot even count the number of times that I saw him.
Q.	When you saw Mika Muhimana on several occasions, after leaving Mugonero's house, can you explain to the Court what Mika Muhimana was doing?
A.	I told you that, in Bisesero, all that people were doing was killing Tutsis who had sought refuge there.  And when I saw him he was usually posing as the loader of the assailants.  He was like a commander of an army who was encouraging his troops.  You would understand that he was a very important figure in that secteur.  So he was encouraging the assailants to look for Tutsi, who had sought refuge in Bisesero.  As a matter of fact, that was the only reason they were in Bisesero.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

I want to take you to another area.  Do you know a person by the name Virginia (sic) Gasherebuka?
A.	I know Virginie Gasherebuka, I know she was the daughter of Mr. Gasherebuka.
MS. MADENGA:
To assist the Court, Virginie Gasherebuka appears on the spelling list on the first column, the last name.  Thank you.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, thank you for that piece of information.  As a follow-up to that, do you know what happened to Virginie Gasherebuka?
A.	Bisesero was a very vast region.  I was unable to know what became of her, because she wasn't hiding with me.  But I know that I was with her in Bisesero.  On some occasions people were going back to their homes, and we didn't know whether those people will return to Bisesero or not.  And when we didn't see them again, we told ourselves, "These people are dead."  As regards Virginia, I know she died in Bisesero, but to tell you the truth, I was not an eyewitness to her death.  I am relying on information I received from other people.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Let's go to a person called Evelyn.  Do you know Evelyn?
A.	I know that person.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what happened to Evelyn?
A.	Evelyn was hiding with me in the Bisesero hills.  I cannot dwell on what happened to her, but I know that before her death she was raped by many Interahamwe.  I don't know the names of those Interahamwe, but she told me that she was raped by Interahamwe.  She was from Rwamatamu in Mugozi secteur and she told me that she enjoyed (sic) the attacks of the Interahamwe at the same time.  And when she related this to me, it was truly appalling because those Interahamwe were only aiming to kill people.
Q.	When Evelyn gave you a report that she was raped by Interahamwes, did she indicate to you who was leading those Interahamwes who raped her?
A.	It was the same leaders who were leading the assailants who attacked Bisesero, including Mika, Sikubwabo, Dr. Gérard, and other very influential people; otherwise, the other assailants were only following those leaders.  Among those assailants, we knew some of them and we didn't know some.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you also know a person by the name Tabita?
A.	I also know Tabita.
Q.	Can you also tell the Court what happened to Tabita, if you know?
A.	Tabita suffered the same fate as I related to you.  She was arrested by the Interahamwe.  As a matter of fact, it was -- she was arrested by an Interahamwe who was her neighbour.  She trusted that Interahamwe, but I did not witness the scene because I was trying to save my life.  But I know that Interahamwe, abducted her, raped her, and thereafter killed her.  Fortunately, after that, we found her remains and we buried her in dignity.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness. The Court indicated to you, when you started giving your evidence, they are concerned about you.  Can you tell the Court, according to how you assisted, what was the consequence of the rape that they treated on your person by Mugonero?
A.	I would like to ask you to ask other questions to me.  I crave your indulgence, please.  Don't ask me to talk about the consequences of what I endured.  Maybe we could go back to that subject at the end of your examination; otherwise, I will not be able to continue my testimony if I were to talk about such consequences.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  I appreciate the pain.  I understand.
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, this is the end of my examination-in-chief.  I think the witness is a bit distressed, and I think I'll end there.  She would then have an opportunity, before leaving the Court, to actually tell the Court this aspect of her life.  Thank you very much, Madam President.  

Thank you, Madam Witness, for your strength.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can we proceed with your evidence?

THE WITNESS:
We can continue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now you will be asked questions by the Defence counsel, counsel for the Accused, Mika.  Please try to answer the questions very briefly and concisely. 

Professor, please, proceed with your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	The question I would like to put to you, Witness, is whether you knew Mika prior to the events of 1994?
A.	I had known Mika well before then.  I knew him since 1992, because that was when I started working at (By order of the Court, this word has been deleted from the record).  And during that period he was the conseiller of Gishyita secteur and that secteur was a neighbouring secteur to Bisesero.
Q.	Did you also know his family?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, before we proceed, I think the witness has just disclosed part of the protected information.  If that can be put under seal relating to the specificity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was that?
MS. MADENGA:
The protected bit of work.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, the specific information be kept under seal.  

Madam Witness, don't disclose your identity.  Don't give the name of your profession or your places you used to work or any other information which may lead to your identification.  Thank you. 

Yes, Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question to you was whether you knew the members of his family?
A.	I do not know Mika's family very well.  However, I knew his wife.  I also knew one of Mika's children who took ill at one time.
Q.	In your statement of the 14th of November 1995 you stated that as from the evening of the 7th of April Tutsis started rushing in, there were so many of them that you could not count them or give an estimate of their number; is that correct?
A.	I did not state that there was an influx of Tutsis on the 6th.  I said the 7th, Madam Witness (sic).  

Before continuing, I would like to point out to you that the statement I gave in 1995 -- because I had already come to this Tribunal to give a testimony before this trial --  when that statement was shown me I was surprised and I told the Judges that the year 1995 was a very gloomy year in my life, to such an extent that when reference was made to that year I am very surprised.  So I told them to ignore my statement of 1995 and consider only the statements I gave subsequently, because in 1995 I was traumatised and most of the time I was in the hospital.  Among the things I did, including the giving of this statement, were not very accurate and I considered that they were not accurate.  That is why I would request that you should not dwell on that statement of 1995.  But if there are important points you want to tackle in relation to that statement, we can tackle them without dwelling on them.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like you to give me direction as to whether I should put questions to the witness on that statement of 1995 or not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated.  Though the witness has reminded you that you should not dwell on her statement of 1995, but you can ask questions on statement 1995.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Where were you, Madam Witness, on the 7th of April?
A.	I was at home.
Q.	Were you alone or did you have people with you?
A.	I was at home with my children.
Q.	Is it correct that up until the 12th of April you were in the Mugonero complex?
A.	That's correct, I was in that Mugonero complex up to the 16th of April.
Q.	And when did you arrive at the Mugonero complex, Madam Witness?
A.	I arrived at that complex on the 9th, in the morning.
Q.	Is it correct that you stated that, during your first examination by the ICTR investigators, you were not questioned on rape and sexual assault?
A.	I wasn't asked questions relating thereto, but I think, given the situation in which I found myself, even if questions were asked me on that subject, I don't think I could have talked about it.  For a Rwandan it is difficult to talk about such events.  It is subsequently, after having gotten some training, some counsel from a number of people that have talked about it; otherwise I wouldn't have been able to talk about those events at that particular time.
Q.	Can we know what kind of training you received?
A.	On several occasions we were told that for those who were traumatised we needed to meet doctors and that these doctors told us that we should talk about those various events, which were difficult for us, and they told us that by talking about them it will be better for us to put them in perspective and to be aware of our state of health.  And it is under those conditions that we, therefore, that had the courage of talking about them.
Q.	I understand you, Madam Witness.  However, with respect to the Bisesero massacres, well, you didn't mention them in your statement of November 1995.
A.	I told you or I asked you not to make reference to that declaration of 1995, because I think that it was a statement that was not quite mine.  Because when that statement was read back to me, I told myself that what was contained in that statement couldn't have been said by me.
Q.	Am I, therefore, to understand that, according to your understanding at the time, the second examination, concerns rape and sexual assault?
A.	In the second examination I wasn't asked questions on that subject, because when you are asked questions under this person you give clarifications thereon, but on that occasion questions weren't -- I wasn't asked questions on the subject that you are referring to.
Q.	I think you haven't understood me, Madam Witness.  I'm talking about the second examination, that of October 1999, 17th, -- October 4, 1999.
A.	With respect to my statement of October 4, 1999, the truth be told, I do not have that statement before me, but I know that the investigators came and saw me and they asked me questions on the rape, of which I was victim, and I gave them explanations on the situation.  But I couldn't have talked about the events if I was asked questions thereon.
MR. SONGA:
Now, how should we proceed, because your statement says the following:  "I have already been interviewed by the investigators of the ICTR, but they did not interview me on rape and sexual violence."   

Apparently your understanding at the time was that the second investigation or interview should be devoted to rape and sexual violence.  

I think we may assist the witness by showing her those statements to her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we seek your clarification.  You were not asked questions regarding rape and sexual violence in your first statement recorded in 1995.  This is what you said.
THE WITNESS:
I stated that when I read the statement of 1995 I realised, after reading it, that it was something new.  It came as a surprise to me, but given what I was told, in respect of the situation that I witnessed in 1995, I understood, because when I read that statement I realised that it was different from the reality that I had lived.  And that is why I didn't really pay much attention to that declaration or statement of 1995.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In 1995, Madam Witness, can we presume that you were already well then?
A.	Given that I had lost my children and that I found them later in 1996, I think that with that occurrence I found back peace.
Q.	I will ask the question, but I think this should be committed to paper because the idea is to give your address.  On the 7th of April 1994, I would like to know what your address was.  Can you put that on paper or in writing for us?
A.	Yes, I can do that, Counsel.
MR. SONGA:
Probably, Madam President, should we ask the witness to keep the piece of paper and add more additions to it, in the event she lived with somebody during that date, and to give the name of the person of the person with whom she was living?  She can keep the sheet of paper and supplement the answer to our question as follows:
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Were you living alone or with some other person on the 7th of April 1994?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Interpreter's microphone activated)
THE WITNESS:
I used to live with my children, only.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can we know where their father was?  

You can still put your answer down on the sheet of paper in the event of revealing the whereabouts of their father would pose a danger to your person.
JUDGE SHORT:
The private life of the witness, the private and family life of the witness, is it relevant to this case, and if so, how?  How relevant is it?
MR. SONGA:
It is my thinking, Madam President (sic), that this question is relevant to the trial insofar as they would enable us to show at an opportune time the false nature of some statements, in particular, with respect to the family structure and the assistance that she claims to have received when she had to save her children.  And I think it is because of that we are asking certain questions and because this has to do with her credibility and the reliability of her testimony.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it right, now, for you to ask her whether her husband was living with her at that time?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, probably, to know if -- who she was living with.  For us to know that she never had a husband and probably to know she never had two children.  This is all evidence that can be proven in the course of the trial.
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, if I can just point out one aspect of the cross-examination which I am not very comfortable with whereas the Prosecution would not have any objections to the Defence knowing how many children, but the area touching on the private life, especially who she was staying with, I think it's an area, which even under national jurisdiction, is not connected.  But the nature of cross-examination would actually impinge on the dignity of the witness, and we know we are dealing with a very traumatised witness.  Defence counsel has all latitude to cross-examine on relevant issues, issues going to the credibility of the witness, issue touching on furtherance of the Defence case, but I think going on a fishing expedition and undermining in somebody's private life would be the last stroke on a traumatic witness.  Thank you, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, if you want to ask this witness whether she was married or not, and if her husband was living with her, on a date, that is, in my judgement, a legitimate question.  But going on beyond that as to whether she was living with somebody other than her husband, that is an intrusion into her private life, which is not justified for the purposes of your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Honourable Judges, if you had followed me, I haven't gone beyond her civil status.  I even clarified that, at the time that the objection was being raised I had finished asking all questions relating to that subject.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So what's your --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, what is your question now?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I was about to ask her the question of the following question:  You state that the************** overflowing with wounded persons and that************ were running short. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Is it correct that you stated that in your statement?
A.	Yes, I am aware that I made that statement.
Q.	You also stated that *************, had said that there weren't enough ********************************** all Tutsis?
A.	Yes, I know that he made those statements.
Q.	You also say in the previous statement, the statement of the 15th of November 1995, Madam Witness, that ******* had asked the people not to touch ******* that were taken from the ******* because two Tutsis were in charge of them and that ***** run the risk of being poisoned.  Is that correct?
A.	Concerning my statement, I knew very well that refugees asked for ************************ because the people who had come from various areas, having asked for ****, were told ************ that there weren't ******************************* Tutsis.  I think that is the only statement that I recognise.
Q.	According to the information you had at the time, were ************************************ Mugonero ****************?
A.	During the war, let's say that at the beginning of the massacre of Tutsis, there were ***********because refugees kept coming, and given that ************************************************, he is the one who had the ************************.  And that is why he said there weren't enough***************, because he had locked the ************** or the store that served the purpose and there was no other person who could give out those *************.
Q.	And to whom were those **************************** -- correction, that you had at the time?
A.	Before the 16th of April, towards the 10th and the 11th, there were ********** that had been *******************; however, the wounded persons were the greatest number ***************.
MR. SONGA:
Before going further, Madam Witness, there is a sheet that the witness has been requested to fill and I would like to tender it as an exhibit for the Defence or the counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The sheet mentioning the place of residence of the witness in 1994 is entered as Exhibit D. 7.  You may proceed, Professor Songa.
(Exhibit No. D. 7 admitted)
MR. SONGA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Interpreter's microphone activated)
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I wish, on the piece of paper, to write down a name and to request or ask the witness to tell us if she knows the person in question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, show this piece of paper to the Prosecutor.

Mr. Songa.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your statement of 14 November 1995 you answered -- or you gave an answer to the following question, what happened on the 15th of April 1994.  You answered by saying that a great number of people arrived; is that correct?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, did you get this name?
THE WITNESS:
Do you want to repeat the question?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's what the witness is asking.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you finish with the name, the sheet of paper you have shown the witness?  You asked the witness a question, we didn't get a translation of the answer.
MR. SONGA:
My question was solely to know if she knew a certain person, and since we don't want to reveal her identity that is why I requested that we have that written down and nothing more.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did she answer your question whether she knew him or not?

Witness, did you answer that question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We didn't get the witness's answer.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know that person.
MR. SONGA:
For the next question, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to say that on the 14th of November 1995 in your statement you said when you answered a question that a great number of people arrived; is that correct?
A.	Are you talking about the 15th or the 16th of April? 
Q.	The 16th of April. 
A.	The people who came were assailants who were attacking refugees that were found in the hospital.
Q.	You also state here, Madam Witness, that in front or before the investigator you couldn't say more because you quickly hid in the basement of the main building under corpses; is that correct?
A.	As I stated yesterday, I hid under corpses in the hospital and I think that is what I stated yesterday, but that does not mean that I didn't have other things to tell him.  But I would like to ask you to verify if what you are saying -- if what is in my statement of 11 -- 14 November 1995 and I do recall that I had asked you not to dwell on that statement.
Q.	How much time did you spend in the basement of the main building?
A.	I cannot tell you at what time I entered.  I went into the basement, but my reckoning is that I left the basement at about 1 a.m.  In any case, I wasn't wearing a watch.  In any case, I can tell you that I got in during the day.
Q.	And when you left the basement, madam, where did you go?
A.	I went up through the Gitwe hill going towards the Bisesero region.
Q.	Since this has to do with the statement of the 14th November 1995 I will simply recall what we read, that is:  "I spent one week at Gishyita and then I was housed there for a week in Kibuye town and then I moved on to Zaire." 

You state, in your statement of 24 October, that you went to Bisesero; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is true.  I went to Bisesero.
Q.	Do you know a certain Ndahayo?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Can you remember if you saw each other on the 16th of April?
A.	We did not see each other on the 16th of April.
Q.	Did you see each other before?
A.	We knew each other well before.  He was a friend.  I used to visit him at Gishyita and he too used to visit me in my home.
Q.	Before the 16th of April, when did you see him?
A.	I cannot recollect the last time that I saw him, only I would tell you that since the beginning of the genocide we never saw one another.
Q.	Up until the end?
A.	On the day I left Bisesero, when I was being brought, we passed near him.  We passed by him on the road.  We bypassed him on the road, and when I was at Mugonero's place he wanted to come and see me, but he couldn't see me because I was locked up in the house.  However, people who were in Mugonero's house said he had come to see me, but we didn't talk to one another.
Q.	On the 16th of April, didn't you see the Accused?
A.	I don't quite understand your question.
Q.	On the 16th of April didn't you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	On the 16th of April I saw him in the morning.
Q.	Where is that, ma'am?
A.	I saw him on the road beside the Association of Adventists on that day.
Q.	Didn't he visit you?
A.	Well, well, you want to say he visited me*******************?  No, he didn't visit me.  Ndahayo, I did not go to Ndahayo's.  I wasn't with Ndahayo.  I didn't live with Ndahayo.
Q.	You are declaring, Madam Witness, that on the 24th of October 1995 that on the 27th of April 1994 around 4 p.m., Mika Muhimana and an Interahamwe called Mugonero discovered you and they were accompanied by two other women on the hill.  Which was that hill, that's on the 22nd of April 1994?
A.	I stated that on the 22nd of April we were on the Bisesero hills.  I didn't know that hill.  I was there as a refugee, and I couldn't tell you if such a hill was called this or that name.  I was at Bisesero, but I am unable to tell you the name of the hill at Bisesero.
Q.	Thank you.  You declared to the Prosecution investigator that on the 15th of April 1994 you saw a troupe of people, amongst whom were Charles Sikubwabo, Mika Muhimana, Ruzindana, Obed, Ngumbumabazema (phonetic), Paul Mukiera, soldiers and the Interahamwes and you said that they are the ones who were leading the attack on the Mugonero complex.  Can you confirm that?
A.	There were others whose names you didn't give, Counsel.  There were many other persons there, but the persons whose name you have just mentioned were amongst the attackers.
Q.	Now, amongst them was there a leader?
A.	Yes, sir, there were leaders.  If mere members of the population come, at least they are led by leaders and these are the persons that we refer to as leaders.
Q.	Was there a leader, a chief, as it were?
A.	As I have just said, mere members of the population were led by bourgmestres or advisers or people like Mika and these were the people who were their leaders.
Q.	Did you see Mika give orders to soldiers?
A.	I wasn't standing near them.  All I know is that they came and they started the killings.
Q.	So, while there you did not see Mika give orders to the Interahamwe?
A.	All I know is that when people arrived, when leaders like Mika arrived, many other people arrived with them and they immediately started the killings.  But before firing the first shot they, first of all, assembled and one would say that they were waiting for some kind of signal.
Q.	In your statement you state that "one of the gendarmes that was guarding us was the first to give a signal by firing into the crowd."  Is that correct?
A.	I was with people who said that that gendarme fired the first shot.  I was standing very near the parking lot.  We could see people below.  We knew that we were going to be killed.  I, personally, did not say that I was standing near that gendarme who fired the signal shot, but we know that he was the person who fired the first shot.
Q.	Do you mean, Witness, that you did not see him fire that shot but that you learned that he was the one who fired the first shot?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	However, that gendarme was one of the two who were guarding you?
A.	He hadn't come to provide for our security.  He came to pretend to be protecting us, but what he wanted is that people should come.  He could not have provided for our safety.  All he was doing was to attract people and at the appointed time it would appear to me that he wanted to kill us.  And he wanted us to assemble.  He wanted to surround us and to kill us easily.  It was not to keep us and to provide for our safety.
Q.	That is not the problem, Witness.  The Defence would like to know whether, as you stated in your statement, it was one of the gendarmes who was guarding you, and the Defence would like to know whether you could see him firing the first shot.  For us it has to do with distance.  Were you at a distance which enabled you to see him give the firing -- fire the first shot?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him with my own eyes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She has answered this about the soldier firing the first shot.  She has said that she learned from someone else that the first shot was fired by the soldier.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  I just wanted to confront her with her own statement in which she states that "one of the two gendarmes who were guarding us was the first to give the signal by firing into the crowd."  In her statement she does not state that she got this from somebody else.  I wanted her to clarify the specific point. 

Can we proceed? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	After the gendarme fired the first shot, as the signal, what happened?
A.	I believe it was a signal.  Thereafter bullets rained on us,  people fell on the refugees and cut them with machetes.  It was all very well prepared.
Q.	Thank you, madam. You state that the soldiers started using their firearms; is that correct?
A.	It was not only the soldiers.  If I said that there were two soldiers, one of whom fired the first shot, I didn't mean that there were only soldiers who had firearms.  There were others who had arms and those who came also fired and they killed people.
Q.	Did they do that on instructions or on their own initiative?
A.	I believe I was not with them.  To ask me whether it was on instructions or not, I don't think -- they did not do it on their own initiative.  Why did they wait for the others to start?
Q.	Witness, you said that you wanted to seek refuge in the church, and on that occasion, from what direction did you flee to the church?
A.	I was coming from the parking lot from where we could see the people who had come, I mean the assailants.
Q.	Do you have an idea as to the distance you covered?
A.	It was a short distance.  I can give an estimate of that distance and say that it was between 100 and 150 metres, thereabouts.  It was very close, that I believe.
Q.	Thank you. 

You stated that once in the hospital toilet you saw the assailants sprinkling petrol everywhere and whenever they put the petrol on fire it was extinguished because of the blood that was overflowing everywhere; is that correct?
A.	I stated that they tried to burn the premises, but they failed because of the blood that had flown in large quantities.
Q.	What visibility or how visible was the situation from the hospital, from the toilet of the hospital, such that you could see assailants sprinkling petrol?
A.	From where we were in that toilet there was a window, quite long and wide window.  It was not difficult for us to hear the people who were sprinkling the petrol; otherwise, you can ask me how come I saw them.  How could we have not seen what the people surrounding us were doing?  They did that while talking.
Q.	Were you alone or you were with others in that toilet?
A.	I was with others.
Q.	Can you give us a rough idea as to the number?
A.	No, I don't remember the number of people with whom I was.
Q.	What was the size of the toilet, was it big, was it small -- was it large, was it small?
A.	It was a toilet of average size.  It was not a small toilet.
Q.	A toilet of average size.  How many people do you think could have been contained in that toilet, if they were standing?
A.	Many people could fit into that toilet.  I would say 20 people or more.  And the people who wanted to flee could have exceeded that number.
Q.	At the time when you were in that toilet, was it full?
A.	There were many of us in there.
Q.	For how long were you in that toilet, Madam Witness?
A.	As I stated to you, I left the church, I went into the hospital, I therefore passed through the hospital.  I don't remember what time it was, but I stated that I left the hospital at about 1 a.m., that is in the morning.
Q.	And you left the toilet to go up Gitwe mountain before continuing; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Were you alone or accompanied?
A.	I was alone that night.  Each person tried to hide.  Everybody left running and I went up that hill alone.
Q.	Do you have an idea of the distance between the hospital and Gitwe hill?
A.	It is a long distance.  I cannot give an estimate as to the number of kilometres there are.
Q.	When did you arrive in Gitwe?
A.	I arrived towards the morning.  I left the hospital on the night of the 16th to 17th April and I arrived in the morning or thereabouts.  It is not very far away, even though I stated that I could not estimate the distance in kilometres.  It is not far.
Q.	Wouldn't it be a long distance for someone wounded?
A.	It is not really that far, even people who were more seriously wounded than myself got there.  They got there.  It was not really far.
Q.	You state, Witness, that from the time you arrived on the Bisesero hills you saw Mika Muhimana every day; is that correct?
A.	I stated that I saw him on several occasions.  At times I was hiding and I couldn't see him, but I saw him on several occasions.
Q.	Let me remind you of your statement on the 24th of October 1999.  "From the date of my arrival on Bisesero hills I saw Dr. Ntikimana, Ruzindana, Sikubwabo, Mika Muhimana come there every morning leading several Interahamwes to kill Tutsis."  Do you intend to correct that version?
A.	No, I cannot correct that version.  If I stated every day I meant that I saw him on several occasions.
Q.	Can you give us any date?  From what date to what date?
A.	I am not in a position to give you exact details as to the dates.  It thus happened sometimes that we forget days.  It is not easy for us to recall dates, the dates on which we saw people.  It wasn't necessary to recall dates.  We had no reason to recall the dates on which we saw people.
Q.	Can you talk to us about the victims?  We're still referring to Bisesero hills.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What do you want the witness to tell you, Professor?
MR. SONGA:
For instance, Your Honours, whether she could identify one victim or the other during those attacks, as she referred to them in her statement. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:  
Then put the question to her.  Don't ask her about everything.  It is very difficult when you give evidence.  Ask her this question, then you go to the next one.
MR. SONGA:
I do not quite understand what Your Honour is asking of me.  I believe I put the question to the witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry.  I asked you -- you put the question to the witness, "Tell us about the victims."  And I was telling you that if you want to get the information out of the witness, a question like, "Tell us about the victims" is not helpful.  If you want her to tell you how many victims she saw, you ask her how many victims she saw.  If you want to ask her whether they were black or white, you ask her what was the colour of the victims.  If you want to ask her whether they were dead or injured, you ask her.  But if you ask her to tell you about the victim, that question is not likely to elicit information in a way that is helpful.
MR. SONGA:
I understand your point, Your Honour.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, I also notice that the witness is very distressed.  At this stage I want to make an application in terms of Rule 34 for support from the witness support unit.  Yesterday I made another application and I think it worked very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, how are you feeling?
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem.  He is asking a very sensitive question to me.  How can he ask me how many people died in Bisesero?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you want somebody from the support section to be with you?
THE WITNESS:
If you allow, Madam President, let that person come and assist me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the staff of the witness support section come in with the witness for a short while.
	(Witness support staff arrive)
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave madam at this stage I would actually go for a short break so that the witness gets all the relevant support from the witness support unit and maybe she can tell us when she has gained composure so that we could proceed.  

Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you need a short break or are you able to give evidence?  Have you recovered?
THE WITNESS:
I believe I can continue.  I can persevere.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Professor, please ask, please.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you Your Honours for the clarification requested regarding the victims.  It is indeed true that the concern here is to ask Madam Witness if she is able to evaluate the victims that she saw with her own eyes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, that is the meaning of my question.  Can we know the number of victims, not the mathematical figure, any approximate will do, that is the victims of the attacks that you saw with your own eyes?
A.	I do not know what victims are being referred to.  These are people -- are you referring to people who were killed or people who were raped, because there were all sorts of victims.
Q.	You are right, Madam Witness, if we may begin with the persons who were killed.
A.	There were many victims.  I cannot tell you a name, a number.
Q.	Did you remember any names?
A.	To tell you the truth, I cannot give you the names of victims.  And I beg you, please, do not remind me of the names of the victims.
Q.	Madam Witness, I understand you, but please try to understand me.  This is a court and we are seeking to establish the truth.  My concern was -- would have been, for instance, to say such-and-such a person was killed by Mika Muhimana.
A.	I know for sure that all the victims who fell as a result of these attacks did so because Muhimana is partly responsible for their deaths and this applies to all those other people who are responsible for those attacks. 

Mika was a very influential person in his secteur.  There were bodies lying here and there in his secteur.  I cannot tell that you Muhimana killed such-and-such a person, but Muhimana should tell you whether he came to Bisesero to save this or that person.  I know you talked to him, has he ever said that?
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I see that my efforts will be in vain in respect to my search for date details.  So we shall move on so that we can save time. 

On the 22nd of April around 4 p.m. Mika and an Interahamwe called Mugonero leading a group of eight persons discovered you hiding under a bush on a hill and you were with two girls.  Is that correct?
A.	I think there was a problem of interpretation.  There were about eight people.  When we were found out, flushed out, I did not say Mika was accompanied by only eight people.  When we were flushed out there were about eight of us.  Mika was not only accompanied by eight people.
Q.	I was basing my statement on your statement bearing your signature, that is of 8th December 1999, where from the very first lines you say, "On the 22nd of April 1994 at around 4 p.m., when they were coming back from their killing, Mika Muhimana and one Interahamwe called Mugonero, at the head of a group of about eight people, found us under a bush at the hill next to the parting leading to the main road where I was hiding with two girls.  I don't know their names."  So the figure eight refers to Mika Muhimana, whereas you were hiding with two young girls, to which you must add four other people who were discovered by Interahamwe.  That is the statement bearing your signature and which you do not challenge, Madam Witness.  So based on these, my question was whether it was correct that Mika, accompanied by Mugonero, was leading a group of eight persons who discovered you under a bush.  What is your answer, Madam Witness?
A.	As I told you, I think there was a problem with interpretation.  I did not count the number of Interahamwe; however, I told the people who were asking me questions that when we were discovered there were about eight of us.
Q.	About eight persons, that is possible, again, we look at your statement.  There is you, two girls and four people, that is seven in total. 

But my question is that I would like you to confirm that you were discovered by a group led by Mika Muhimana, but if you want to redefine the members of this group we are ready to listen to you, Madam Witness.
A.	I did not tell you that I counted the number of Interahamwe.  I said that there was probably an interpretation problem, because I said that I was with about eight persons, but I do not -- did not count the people who composed Mika's group.  I could not do it.  It is not the sort of -- this is the sort of thing that you do when you are at ease but Mika's group was larger.
Q.	Larger, madam?  Do you mean larger than eight persons?
A.	Yes, there were more than eight, if I remember what I saw.
Q.	And if you remember what you saw, how many were they?  About how many were they?
A.	To tell the truth, I did not count them.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. However, these Interahamwe discovered four other people; is that correct?
A.	Yes, they came with a group of, I think, four people, and those of us who were hiding were about eight in number.
Q.	They made you sit down near the road, is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	For how long did you stay seated near the road in this manner?
A.	We did not stay for long.  They asked us to sit down.  Afterwards they asked us to lie down and I did not judge the time that we spent there.  In any case, we did not stay there for long.
Q.	Mugonero asked Mika for the favour of keeping you; is that correct?
A.	(No response)
Q.	What was Mika's response?
A.	Mika agreed to his request.  He agreed that he should take me with him.
Q.	What was his thinking?
A.	I remember that Mugonero said, "Come on, move ahead," and when Mugonero was asking Mika whether he could take me I do not remember the exact words that Mika used to respond to him, but in any case, he agreed to his request.
Q.	Yesterday, before the Court, Madam Witness, the following question was asked of you by the Prosecutor in regard to the people who were with you when you were discovered at the foot of a hill.  I would like to refer to this in the transcript.
MS. MADENGA:
Is my learned friend referring to a draft or an authentic transcript?
MR. SONGA:
May I respond?  I have a document, only one which is available which is marked as a draft but which bears the transcript of what transpired yesterday.  Is the authenticity of this document contested?
MS. MADENGA:
With all due respect, to me a draft is a draft and it cannot be cited before the Honourable Judges because it is a draft which is likely going to be rectified in one way or another.  Right now I don't have authority but I know in the case of Ntakirutimana the Court ruled that we cannot cite from a draft because it is a draft.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I do not know whether we do not have the right to continue a practice that has already been accepted by this Court in all the preceding sessions.  We have used the words of the parties based on the transcript which was bearing the mark of a draft. 

In any case, we cannot delete the memory of people.  We can recall the words that were spoken yesterday or the statements that were made yesterday and compare them to one statement or another.  I do not know why working documents which are distributed to us every morning to make the court case go forward would be contested.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have your own notes?
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can ask questions from your notes and from the draft, too, but you must keep this in mind, that this draft is a draft and not a final authenticated copy of the transcript.  You can go ahead with your question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I knew that I would be able to count on your wisdom, the transcript being the only document available for the time being, and I would like to refer to page 46 of such transcript, that is of the French version, where a question was put in line 12.  
"Those who were killed were killed on whose orders?"
	Answer.  "They had received the order to kill well beforehand, but since we were in front we were faced with an influential personality like Mika.  He did nothing to prevent the killing.  These persons were killed in the presence of Mika.  In any case, it is difficult for me to say, I did not see clearly how each person was killed."
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, why does this question come to mind?  It is because when I re-read your statement of the 24th of October, 1999, in paragraph 1, last two lines of that paragraph, this is what I see. 

"As for the two young girls, and the four others, they were ordered to sleep together and were coldly executed before my eyes."  

I state that these two declarations or statements are incompatible and you should help to us make progress by telling us where the truth lies?
A.	I said that these other persons who were flushed out at the same time as myself were killed.  Regarding the fact that I said they were killed before my very eyes, it was a way of saying that I was present when they were being killed.  It was in fact, very difficult for a victim or a person who was being attacked to stand there and look and watch how people were being killed.  What I do not change in my statement is that I heard these people scream.  I was paralysed with fear, and when I left, these two people were lying on the ground and Mika was there.  He did nothing to come to their aid.  If I said that I saw this with my own eyes, it was a way of saying that I was right there when these people were being killed.
Q.	You state in your last sentence before one, I just want to confirm that I heard you correctly, that Mika did nothing to come to the assistance of these persons?
A.	Mika did nothing to save these people.  He did nothing.
Q.	Let us continue. Madam Witness, you state that Mika and the others continued in a vehicle.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  When they went away they did so on board a car.
Q.	What was this car like, Madam Witness?
A.	I no longer remember on board what type of vehicle the assailants came and went.  They did so in various vehicles.  I said that these people went back in a car because me, myself, Mugonero, and the other Interahamwe that were under him went back on foot.  The leaders went away on board vehicles and we went down on foot.
Q.	Do you mean that there were several vehicles?
A.	Yes, there were several cars.
Q.	And the car on board which Mika left, who was driving it?
A.	I did not note this detail, and I have told you that I saw people moving towards the vehicle.  The vehicles were parked where we were, but to tell the truth, I did not identify the vehicle in which Mika went away.
Q.	Madam Witness, when you say "car", can you distinguish it from other types of vehicles or do you just mean vehicle?
A.	There was no saloon car there.  There were only vans and other big vehicles that we could see.  To tell you the truth, I did not see a saloon there, they were mostly vans.
Q.	The question is not the most used means of transport.  We are referring to a particular date and are on that day.  So what vehicles were there?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness has told you that she did not see cars.  They were mostly vans and other vehicles.  That is a complete and perfect answer to the question you are asking.
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Your Honour, this is the first time I'm hearing of the word "bus".
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Because, you heard "bus" from me, or is it a translation problem?  I understood the witness to say that it was the witness said there were no cars, no saloon cars.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There were vans.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mostly vans and other vehicles.  Is the translation any different?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, in spite of the explanation of Your Honour, I would like to assure myself by asking the witness.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you see these vehicles?
A.	I saw vehicles.
Q.	How far were they from the place where the other persons were killed before your eyes?
A.	When we were taken near the road we were not quite close to the vehicles, but we could see the place where they were parked.  Even though we were not next to the vehicles we could see them.
Q.	What distance was it?
A.	I am not able to tell you the distance, but it was a place from which we could see.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that Mugonero asked you to carry his bloodied spear.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What do you mean?  My question put differently, is this an image or the spear was actually covered in blood?
A.	The entire spear was not covered with blood, but I can tell you that a great part of the spear was covered with blood.  For example, the metallic part and the handle were covered with blood.  It means that there was a lot of blood on this spear.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  What was the road like, the road that you used between 4 to 7 p.m., was it a path or a road?
A.	I said that we were3 flushed out at 4 p.m., we were not flushed out to ask us to leave immediately and please do not ask me the kind of road that we took.  I know that we arrived at Gishyita in due course, we went to Mugonero's.  I did not know the road of Gishyita.  I don't know whether we took a path or a road.  I am not able to tell you that.  It was the first time that I was taking that road.  There were small paths, there was the main road.  I no longer remember whether we took the paths or the main road, but I know that we arrived the centre of Gishyita and we went to Mugonero's house.	
	(Pages 1 to 24 by R. Lear)






























	1600H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can you describe the Mugonero house -- the house, Mr. Mugonero's house? 
A.	I do not remember what Mr. Mugonero's house looked like.  The house -- I went into the house at night.  I did not have the time to observe the house.  I left it on another night.  I am not able to tell you how the house was like because I did not visit the entire house, but I remember that there was a window that opened out onto the back and that is -- there was another window.  That is all the description I can provide. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Did other persons, other than Mugonero, live in the house?
A.	If this house belonged to Mugonero or not, I did not know.  The fact is that I went into this house; it is into this house that he led me.  There were Interahamwe who were guarding his residence because Mugonero acted as a leader.  I do not know whether these people resided in this house or whether before me there were people who had lived in this house.  I know nothing about it.
Q.	My question is, when you arrived at Mugonero's house you found other inhabitants?
A.	When I arrived at Mugonero's house, there was nobody inside the house.  But I remember that when we arrived, I saw Interahamwe.  I don't know whether they stayed there.  Do not ask me questions on that.  It was the first time I was entering this house.  I had never seen it before.  

Regarding the fact that there were other people who were living -- lodging in this house, I can tell you, quite simply, that I saw no one enter the house after I arrived.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you describe the window through which Mugonero's mother passed you a bowl that you referred to yesterday in this court?
A.	It was a small window but through which you could receive something from the outside.
Q.	And the bowl you referred to, what was its contents?
A.	In that bowl there was food.
Q.	You stated, Madam Witness, that you were served food in a bowl once or twice, but when we read your statement of 24 October 1999, in particular on line 4 -- the last two lines -- it would appear that you didn't have a problem with feeding while you were confined in that room.  Can you read that?  During the three days during which you were confined, Mugonero's mother used to give you food through the window.  She was the one who told you she was the mother: "This woman told me that she was the mother of Mugonero and that he knew that she was feeding me."  Was there a problem with your feeding, yes or no?
A.	Please, don't ask me questions with respect to food.  I don't quite see the importance of talking about food here, whether his mother gave me food or not.  Probably I couldn't even eat what she was giving me.  I don't know if I was hungry.  How could I have been hungry?  I don't want to know -- I don't know why you want to know if I was hungry or not.  It was something private. 
Q.	Well, I am not the one answering questions.  It is justice; what we are looking for is the truth.
A.	I have told you that I didn't stay for long in Mugonero's house.  If I tell you that once or twice I was given food, I think that was important.  I never said that I was a hungry or famished in that house.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You state that on the night of 23 April you heard Interahamwe state that when there will be no longer any Tutsis to be killed elsewhere, it will be the turn of Tutsi -- of Hutu women who are married to Tutsis, and you realised that your end was near.  Is that correct?
A.	I said that it was in the night of the 24th.  I don't know if it was 24 or 23; please let me recall.  The night during which I heard that, I think it is the same night that I left that house.  I said it was on the night of the 24th, and it was during that night that I left that house.
Q.	Thank you for correcting your statement of 24 October 1999, because I hear it is stated that it is on the night of 23 April that you heard Interahamwe.  

Now, let's move on to the 24th of April.  You state that towards 10 p.m. you took advantage of the inattention of the guards to pass through the window and to disappear into the banana plantations;  is that correct?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, it would look as if I wasn't heard.  That's correct?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How, Madam Witness, were the guards inattentive?
A.	In the evening they started eating, in particular, the cows that they had seized.  And when they came to the house to eat the beef of the cow, they looked for drinks, and it is usually on such occasions that they became inattentive. 
Q.	Was he present eating or did he leave?
A.	They were always there on the site.  They were eating the meat of the cows, and they would roast the meat of the cows that they had seized.  You understand, imagine people who had sat down to eat, so you would imagine the situation in such a group.
Q.	What was the distance between them and the window you refer to and through which you escaped?
A.	I said that they sent me food through the window from behind.  They were, rather, in the vicinity of the front yard of the house.
Q.	And what was their position vis-à-vis the window through which you escaped?
A.	The window was behind on the part that faced the banana plantation, whereas they, on their part, were in front of the house. 
Q.	They were on their usual position?
A.	Yes, they were at their usual positions.  However, they were with other persons that used to come to eat the meat with them.  And I wouldn't say, however, that whilst they were eating, they also took care of ensuring security, but they were quite close to the road such that anything that could happen, they could see, but whilst they were eating they were less attentive. 
Q.	You say, Madam Witness, that Mugonero usually came back in the evening; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	On that 24th day of April, did he come back?
A.	Yes, he did come back.
Q.	And where was he when you succeeded to make your escape?
A.	He was in the company of the other persons who were there.
Q.	You state that on the 24th of -- you said on the 24th of October 1999 that he came -- he used to come back sometimes, three times.  He raped you three times in the same night; is that correct?
A.	I stated that on the first day he raped me thrice.
Q.	But, Madam Witness, when I refer to your statement, you said that during the time that he retained you in his house, it occurred to him to rape you more than three times in the same night.  I wonder if you can confirm that portion of your statement?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, do you feel that this evidence is critical to your cross-examination?
MR. SONGA: 
Absolutely, it is a cross-examination that is meant to contradict the statements of the witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I mean the number of times that the rape took place and the things like that.  I am asking this question because we are required by the Statute to keep in mind the fact that witness -- victim witnesses can get terribly distressed by certain type of questions.
MR. SONGA: 
Your Honours, if you say that I am taking my questioning too far, I will be ready to comply.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I would be grateful.
MR. SONGA:
May we proceed, Madam President?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q. Madam Witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you proceed with the evidence?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we may proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, continue with your questions.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, what was the route you took in your escape from Bisesero?
A.	I took the road which goes to Bisesero from Gishyita.
Q.	On which hill did you arrive at Bisesero?
A.	I do not know the name of that hill.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  What was your hiding place like?
A.	I was hiding on the Bisesero hills.
Q.	In your hideout -- in your hiding place, were you alone, Madam Witness?
A.	I met other persons, and usually we could meet people and we would hide together without having to know each other.
Q.	Do you have an idea of the number of attacks that you had to confront in your hideout?
A.	There were very many attacks.
Q.	Do you have any dates?
A.	I think I have already told you, Counsel, that nobody was concerned with or had the time to worry about the dates or time because we were in a rather difficult situation.
Q.	During the events of April to June 1994, did your parents leave their residence?
A.	Yes, they left their residence. 
Q.	To which destination?
A.	My parents were attacked like other Tutsis and their houses were destroyed.  The members of my family were killed, and those who were able to flee, obviously fled.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You stated yesterday that a woman found you in your hiding place in the Mugonero complex and that you entrusted your children to them (sic) and that she gave the children to you after the war; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you have an idea of the date on which the children were handed back to you?
A.	I cannot recall the date.  I recall the year.
Q.	Well, which year was that?  That would still be interesting.
A.	I told you that it was at the beginning of 1996.
Q.	If this will not put at risk your safety, can you write down -- can you write that down?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Write what?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you write the name of the woman who kept your children during the war?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, is it okay with you to write down the name of that woman who kept your children?
THE WITNESS:
I think that this can be of no assistance to him because I am not going to testify on the subject of my children.  Accordingly, I do not think that it is very important for the Defence counsel.  Probably you can advise me on the subject.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how does the disclosure of the name of that woman who kept her children would be relevant to your case?
MR. SONGA: 
We would like that when the time comes, we should be in a position to show where people who were able to keep children during the war were, and that this may not be the version that she is giving us today.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you write down the name of that lady who kept your children during the war? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We didn't get the translation. 
THE WITNESS:
I think I can write it down.
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, this will be an exhibit for the Defence.
MS. MADENGA: 
Madam President, Your Honour, may I please have the opportunity to see the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The piece of paper with the name of the lady who had kept the children of the witness is entered as Exhibit D. 8, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 8 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, the window through which you received food from Mugonero's mother, is it the same window through which you made your escape?
A.	Yes, it was the same window.
Q.	Did anybody help you to go through that window?
A.	Nobody.
Q.	Didn't you pass through Ngendehayo (phonetic) after staying at Mugonero's house?
A.	I went to Ngendehayo's house (sic), but I was only transiting; I didn't stay there.
Q.	On the Bisesero road, did you meet any obstacles?
A.	No, I did not encounter any obstacles.  I arrived at the Bisesero hills, safe and sound. 
Q.	Today, Madam Witness, you talked about a certain Evelyn, and you stated that those who raped her were the same group, that is, the group of Mika Muhimana.  And I think that this is the first time we are hearing this because in your declaration, you had specified who were the authors of the acts.  You said the following:  "At night I saw him (sic) again where we used to sleep together.  She told me she had been kidnapped and raped during several hours by three Interahamwes from Mugozi, the Rwamatamu commune, whom she knew before the events."   Why do you mention Mika today?
A.	I mentioned Mika because I was asked a question, as you know: "Who were the persons leading the attacks?"  I did not say Mika was the person who raped the girl.  When I was asked a question on the leaders of the Interahamwes, I gave the -- I mentioned the leaders of the Interahamwes, and that is why I mentioned Mika because he was aware of all those attacks and assaults.
MR. SONGA:
Madam Witness (sic), I am done with my cross-examination, and I would like to thank the witness for her availability.

And if you will give me leave, madam, I forgot something.  We mentioned some documents which we should consider as exhibits, and these concern, in particular, documents where some names are mentioned.  Can we enter those documents as Defence exhibits?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What are those documents? 
MR. SONGA:
There is a document where we asked a name to be inserted, well before, and then we would like that statement of 14th November 1995 should be entered as an exhibit -- as an exhibit; and, finally -- I think this has already been done because it is not long ago that we proposed this -- the name of the lady who had custody of the children during the war.  I think that has been done already; that is, the name of -- the name has already been entered as an exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the document bearing the name of a person is Exhibit D. 9.
MS. MADENGA: 
If I can seek your indulgence, Madam President.  While the Prosecution has no objection to the statement of the 14th of November 1995 being accepted as an exhibit, under seal, it's rather problematic for that name which Defence is now tendering as an exhibit. 

What my learned colleague simply did was to ask the witness to write that name without laying a foundation on that name.  And this procedure is entirely different from Exhibit D. 8, because in D. 8 my learned colleague laid a foundation and tendered the exhibit.  So the Prosecution would actually object to the tendering of the other exhibit where he simply asked the witness to write down a name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, this name was shown to the witness and she has stated that she knew this person. 
MS. MADENGA: 
(Microphones overlapping)... Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So this document is Exhibit D. 9, under seal; and the statement of 14th November 1995 is entered as Exhibit D. 10, to be kept under seal
(Exhibit No. D. 9 admitted, under seal)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, do you have a signed copy of this statement, a signed copy? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It may be reminded that Exhibit D. 10 is not signed by the witness -- is not a signed copy.
MR. SONGA:
And it was not challenged either.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Any re-examination, Madam Prosecutor? 
MS. MADENGA:
Before we get to that, Your Honour, just to assist the Court.  We have a signed copy of the French version, if the Court prefers a signed copy to be tendered as an exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have a signed copy? 
MS. MADENGA: 
It's part of the binder, but we can make copies available to replace the unsigned copy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the signed copy of 14th of November 1995, French version, is entered as Exhibit D. 10, to be kept under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 10 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, any re-examination?
MS. MADENGA:
No re-examination, Your Honour.  

But before I sit down, I think I have a legal obligation just to indicate to the honourable Court that the witness had indicated that she has a comment she wants to make to the Court; and I also assured her I would tell the Court, and the Court will decide whether or not they want to hear the comment from the witness.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it part of the evidence or is it for amusement?
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honours, for that clarification.  

When the witness intimated that to me, I also asked her the nature of the comment she wants to make.  She referred me to the hearing in Ntakirutimana, and it is like it is connected to what has transpired since the Ntakirutimana hearing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we have deliberated, and we -- at the end of your examination-in-chief, you had asked a question about the consequences of her ordeal, and her reply was that these questions be asked at the end.  She herself never asked the Court to give some statement. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  If I can just clarify what I have just said.  What I said after the honourable Court invited me for re-examination is that I no longer had any re-examination.  

I am alive to the fact that before the end of the examination-in-chief I had asked this question to the witness, but she actually indicated that she had reservations, so I decided not to continue with the examination-in-chief in that aspect because I thought it was not directly relevant to what the Prosecution wanted to establish.  

But the matter I have raised with the Court is an intimation which the witness made when I saw her yesterday before she gave her testimony.  After all the re-confirmations, that is when she actually indicated to me that she had something which she wants to talk to the honourable Judges about.  She actually said it emanated from the time she testified in Ntakirutimana.  

I thought, as an officer of the Court, I had a legal obligation to bring that concern to the honourable Judges since the witness had indicated directly to me that she wants to make that comment to the Court.  So it's a matter where I thought, as a trial attorney, I don't have the jurisdiction to bar a witness from commenting to the honourable Court.  I thought it's a matter which lies squarely in the hands of the Court, whether or not a witness, after giving evidence, is allowed to go into additional matters which are of concern to her.  Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, can you tell us what was the --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Madam Prosecutor, did you find out from the witness what it was she wanted to tell the Court?
JUDGE SHORT:
We are not asking you to tell us. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't tell us what she said. 
JUDGE SHORT:
We want to know whether you found out exactly the nature of the comment that she wants to make to the Court.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I did not go to establish exactly what she wanted to tell the Court.  The nature of the conversation was that she intimated to me that she has a comment, a carryover from the Ntakirutimana testimony which she wants to intimate to the Judges.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that comment relevant to this case?
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I was also trying to establish the relevance, but what I can say at this stage is that the issues seem to be interrelated.  By "interrelated" I mean that we are dealing with a legal issue, and from a lawyer's perspective sometimes we start with the law and end with the law, so I wanted to know whether it was a legal issue.  But when the witness was trying to explain to me, she was, like, trying to explain to me that the issues are interrelated but not necessarily legal issues.  It was at that stage that I thought I did not have the jurisdiction to entertain that, but I had a legal obligation to make that information accessible to the Court so that the Court would use its discretion whether the Court wants to hear anything more from the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated, and we believe if that comment is not part of the evidence, that comment will not be -- shall not be allowed. 
MS. MADENGA:
I am indebted, Your Honour.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You don't have any re-examination, right? 
MS. MADENGA:
No, Your Honour, I don't have any re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for having come to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  We'll take short break for 15 minutes. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Maybe, Your Honour, before we take a break, I refer to the decision in Ntakirutimana.  I am tendering it since I cited it.  But I am obliged to the Court's Ruling, but since I cited that decision I made copies for Your Honours and the members of the Defence team. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that part of your case?  Are you reopening your case?  No, I think it is wrong; the Defence has now to respond to it. 
MS. MADENGA: 
I am in your hands, Your Worship.  What I said was that I had cited a Judgement but I didn't have a copy of that Judgement, and I thought that I should just provide the Judgement.  It's not like we are going back to the case.  

I actually indicated that I am obliged to the ruling of the Court, but when I made a citation, I just said in a decision of Ntakirutimana, because I do not have the copy. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But as you understand, Madam Prosecutor, if we are to receive cases from you, then the Defence must have an opportunity to address us on the case.  That means you are reopening the proceedings. 
MS. MADENGA:
Obliged, Your Honour.  I am indebted.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I think you should keep it until you are making a submission, if it is relevant to the evidence.  If it is relevant to the issue of whether we should take her evidence or not, that matter is finished. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  It relates to the draft, not the issue of the witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Well, if it does, as I said, it is a matter which you can bring in when you are making your submissions. 
MS. MADENGA: 
I am indebted, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall take a break for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1645 to 1720H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the court are resumed.  

Good evening, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good evening, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, this is Witness BJ. 
MS. MADENGA: 
That's correct, Your Honour.  This is Witness BJ, Prosecution Witness No. 6.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we proceed to record your evidence under your pseudonym, BJ.  You are a protected witness and we are sitting in open court.  Please don't reveal your name, place of your residence or any other information which may lead to your identification.  

Before your testimony, you have to take the solemn declaration to speak the truth.  

Mr. Issa, please take the solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness BJ in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:

MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
WITNESS BJ,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Good evening, Madam Witness.
A.	Good evening. 
Q.	Thank you for coming.  I want you to look at the protected witness information sheet in front of you.  You will recall that during reconfirmation that we went through your personal details.  Today you appended a signature on the document.  Do you recognise the signature as your signature?
A.	Yes, it is my signature.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Your Honour, the Prosecution wants to tender the protected witness information sheet as Prosecution Exhibit No. 9.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Protected information sheet is entered as Exhibit P. 9, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 9 admitted, under seal)
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, please proceed with your examination. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you recall seeking a refuge at the Mugonero complex on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, I was there.
Q.	Can you please tell us under what circumstances you sought refuge at the complex?
A.	I sought refuge there because before the war I was working for a Tutsi, and in 1994, I heard that on the 7th of April 1994, Habyarimana had died following a plane crash.  And in due course, I went to the commercial centre to buy some items, mainly sugar and flour, and when I got there, I realised that the shops were closed.  I saw soldiers there.  

Those soldiers were opposite the shop, and they asked me where I was going, and I told them I had come to buy some items.  And they asked me, "Who are you?  Are you Hutu or Tutsi?"  I answered and said I was Hutu.  They said nothing further.  Then I went back home and I told the people for whom I was working that the shop was closed.  

And three days later there was an influx of refugees converging on Mugonero hospital, and the people I was working for went there themselves.  Then the time came for me to work during the day.  I went to the hospital with the children.  I spent the day at home, and at night I usually spent the night in the hospital.  

I asked people whom I knew from my area what was happening.  I could see people coming from various locations.  And on the Sabbath day, at about 9 a.m. on the 16th of April, I was at home.  I heard people screaming and I went out.  And on the hill opposite where the place where I was, I saw many people.  I told myself, "Is that the war that has been spoken of that has broken out?"  

I heard a certain Murekatete, who had told me that Habyarimana had died in a plane crash, and I told myself that people had sought refuge there because the war had started.  So I took the children to my mistress, who was in the church.  People came very close to the hospital.  There was fighting, and the refugees defended themselves with stones, but they could not cope with the attackers.  People were killed, and people converged on the hospital and the church.  And so I, myself, I fled and I went to the basement of the hospital.  

Since I had already entrusted the children to my mistress, I went to the room, room No. 3, and I stayed there; and I could hear people screaming everywhere.  There were other women under the beds. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Can I just take you back to what you indicated in your testimony?  You said there was an influx of refugees.  Do you know the ethnic makeup of these people you referred to?
A.	I saw the refugees who were coming to seek refuge at the hospital and the church.  They were coming from all over.  Some of them came from Gishyita, others were from the Rwamatamu commune and others in Mpembe and others from other areas. 
Q.	You also indicated that you saw attackers.  Can you tell the Court where the attackers were coming from?
A.	They came from the Gishyita commune, that of Rwamatamu, and from the vicinity of Mpembe as well; others also came from other areas of the region.
Q.	Can you also tell the Court whether those attackers were armed or not armed?
A.	The attackers were armed.  Some had clubs, others had pointed clubs, others had guns and grenades.
Q.	Madam, you also referred to a person called Murekatete.  Who is Murekatete? 
A.	Murekatete was a domestic servant who was working in a house that was adjacent or close to the one where I worked.  She was a domestic servant like myself.
Q.	Do you know Murekatete 's ethnic group?
A.	I did not know her ethnic group.
Q.	You indicated that you went to room No. 3.  Who else went to room No. 3?
A.	Many other women whom I did not know were there. I was sitting on a bed with Murekatete, the domestic servant, and another young girl that I saw there, who introduced herself to me before the attacks began; and she told me that she was called Mukasine.  So we sat together on the bed, and at a certain point we saw the attackers coming.  

But before they entered that room, we had seen three persons entering the room, and amongst those three persons there was a certain Mika, a native of Gishyita.  He came in with two other persons.  He called us and asked -- and told us young girls, "You sitting on the bed, follow us."  So we followed them.  We went to room No. 4, which was opposite room No. 3.  And they asked us to undress.  We undressed.  They asked us to lie on our backs so that they could see what the genitals of a Tutsi looked like.  So we lay there.  They looked at us, and raped us.  We asked them to let us alone.  They didn't want to listen to us, and they even said, "We are going to kill you.  After having raped you, we are going to pierce your genitals with a sharpened stick."  

So we heard noise coming from the door, and three minutes later they stopped raping us.  We put on our dresses very quickly, and thereafter they told us to remain seated where we were.  And when they were about to kill us, I looked through the window and saw a young man who was a member of the attackers, who said, "Hey, aren't you the daughter of this person?"  I said "yes," and he asked, "Why did you come here?"  I said, "I came here to seek refuge."  And he told us -- but he told me, "But you are a Hutu, and we are looking for Tutsis, so you should come out."  So I came out through the window.  I crossed bodies and I went home.  

But when I reached my home, I was never in peace because there were Interahamwes who came and who was led by a certain Ngendahimana, who had saved me, and he said, "Since you worked for Tutsis, it is possible that you are hiding some here."  My father had died before the war, and these Interahamwes used to come to disturb my mother, claiming that she was hiding Tutsis.  Now, they searched the house and found nobody.  And some days later, the young man came to my house and said, "I saved you when you were about to die in the hospital.  You cannot refuse to be my woman."  He asked me to accept to be his wife, I told him, "I'm still a young girl; I can't be your wife."  Now he said, "Whatever the case, you have to accept to live with me."  And I kept refusing.  

And when I realised that those people kept coming to my house and that they were threatening to kill me - they threatened to kill me if I refused, I had to go to leave the family home to go to Gishyita, where I stayed for some days.  And there I learnt that the Inkotanyi soldiers were about to take over the region.  I learnt that the other persons who were living in the region had started fleeing saying that the Inkotanyis were killing Hutus.  I also followed other refugees and went right to Zaire.  And three days later, I came back to Rwanda.  And I said to myself, "I think now is the time for me come back to Rwanda because I didn't kill anybody" because there were other people who were returning to Rwanda.  And it was under those circumstances that I came back to our home.  Those are, therefore, the circumstances that I had to live through. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to thank you very much for the strength you have shown and also to appreciate your valuable testimony.  

I want to take you step by step through what you have just told the Court.  

We are now in room 3, so we want to move to room 3.  You've just indicated that you saw a certain Mika.  Can you clarify to the Court who Mika is?
A.	Mika was a gentleman who was conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.  He is a person who was in charge of that secteur, and before the war he used to buy and sell coffee.  And sometimes I used to accompany my parents to***********************************************.  Subsequently, I saw him when he took part in the attacks. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Before the events of the 16th of April 1994, for how long had you known Mika?
A.	I hadn't known him for very long.
Q.	Madam, do you think you can identify the person you referred to as Mika?
A.	I can recognise him without my problems, even if it has been a while ago.  If I see him, I will recognise him.  
But I think he has taken -- put on a lot of weight, and I think he has even become a Muslim.  

Oh, God, may God forgive me; this is impossible.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Where is the person you are referring to as Mika sitting?
A.	He is sitting to my left, and he is wearing a skull cap, as is the wont of Muslims.  I also see that he is wearing a red dress, or maybe a shirt or a dress.  He also had -- has another white item of clothing.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  
MS. MADENGA:
Can the record reflect that the witness has identified Mika Muhimana?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness has identified Mika Muhimana. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, we want to go back to room No. 3.  You have just told the Court that when Mika came, you were told to undress.  Who specifically ordered you to undress?
A.	It was Mika.
Q.	Madam, do you still remember what you were wearing on this day, the 16th of April 1994?
A.	I was wearing a skirt, a blouse and inner wear.
Q.	I know it has been a long time, but can you also recall what Mika Muhimana was wearing on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	I do recall that he was wearing a white shirt, jean -- a pair of trousers.
Q.	When Mika ordered you to undress, did he also undress?
A.	He also put out his clothes -- put off his clothes.
Q.	You also told the Court that you were ordered to lie on your back.  Who specifically ordered you to lie on the back?
A.	It was Mika.
Q.	When Mika Muhimana ordered you to lie on your back, did you comply with Mika's order?
A.	I complied with his instructions because I told myself that if we complied with his instructions, he would be merciful to us and not kill us.
Q.	When Mika entered the room and he undressed and he ordered you to undress, you indicated that he said that you should lie on your back so that they know what the genitals of a Tutsi woman looked like.  Who specifically said this comment?
A.	He was the one.  Everybody respected what Mika said.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  When you say "everybody," who else was in the company of Mika?
A.	He was accompanied by two young men that I didn't know.
Q.	Did you see whether these men were armed or unarmed?
A.	They were armed.  One of them had a club, and another had a machete, and a pointed, sharpened stick, and all those young men were armed.  It has been quite a while, and I didn't quite retain what their weapons looked like, but I know that all of them were armed.

1745H
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  That is very useful.

We want to move on and focus now on you specifically.  How old were you in 1994, 16 April 1994, when this was happening to you?
A.	I was 15 years of age.
Q.	When you were ordered to undress and Mika also undressed, what did Mika do to you?
A.	He took advantage of me.
Q.	How did Mika Muhimana take advantage of you?
A.	He took his penis and introduced it into my sexual parts.  I asked him to be merciful to me.  He didn't want to listen.
Q.	Madam Witness, I know it's very difficult, but it's very important for the Court also to know what was happening to you on this particular day.  Had you had sexual intercourse prior to this incident you are referring to when you said Mika took his male organ and put into your female organ?
A.	No, I had never done that before.  It was the first time for me. 
Q.	Let's also now look at what was happening in the room.  When Mika was taking advantage of you, what were the other persons who were in his company doing?
A.	Those who had come with him seized the other young girls who were with me, that is Murekatete and Mukasine.
Q.	When they seized Murekatete and Mukasine, did you see what they did to Murekatete and Mukasine?
A.	They also had to undergo the same fate as myself.
Q.	Did they, the two persons you are referring to, have sexual intercourse with Mukasine and Murekatete?
A.	Yes, they were equally taken advantage.
Q.	Madam Witness, can we please go back to you and focus again on what was happening to you.  For how long did you feel that Mika Muhimana had sexual intercourse with you?
A.	About three minutes.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you also tell the Court how you felt when Mika Muhimana had sexual intercourse with you?
A.	I felt pain.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  I appreciate it's a difficult aspect, but we also want to know what happened to the other two girls.  Did you know the other two names, Mukasine and Murekatete, before the events we are talking about?
A.	Murekatete is one that I knew before because she used to work before in a house that was neighbouring.  It was close to that of my mistress and master.
Q.	Do you know what happened to the two girls, Mukasine and Murekatete?
A.	I did not know what became of them.  I quickly ran home because I was told that if I remained long on the road, the Interahamwes could mistake me for a Tutsi and kill me.
Q.	Madam Witness, I also want to you tell the Court whether, from that day, you ever saw any one of them, that is either Mukasine or Murekatete?
A.	I never saw them again.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can we go back to room 3 and can we now focus on Mika Muhimana.  Did Mika Muhimana say anything after he had had sexual intercourse with you?
A.	A young person said, "I know this girl, this is the daughter of this person."  Muhimana said, "I wasn't aware," and he said, "Wait a minute, you did not know this is the daughter of this person?"   But it's after having had intercourse with me, and that is how I left room number 3.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  You also referred to your employers.  Did you -- or have you seen them after this incident?  Do you know what subsequently happened to them?
A.	They died because I never saw them again.
Q.	You also referred to their children.  Do you know what subsequently happened to those children you were looking after?
A.	I had already handed over the children to my mistress and I never saw them again, and I think that those children died with their mother.
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to thank you very much and I want to appreciate your testimony.  You indicated that the Interahamwe who saved you, Ngendahimana, approached you at home?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You also indicated that you had to subsequently leave your place of residence.  Why did you leave your place of residence?
A.	It is because that young man, Ngendahimana, who had -- took me out of the hospital, told me that, "If you do not accept to be my wife, I'm going to hand you over to the Interahamwe so that they can kill you, or I, myself, will kill you."  You know, the house of a widow is always attacked by anybody.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, this is the end of my examination-in-chief, thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Madam Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the Defence counsel, counsel for the Accused, Mika Muhimana.  Try to answer the question asked by the Defence counsel very briefly.

Professor, you have the floor for cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you Madam President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, good afternoon. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	In your statement before the Court, you stated that you were a domestic servant in a Tutsi family.  That was a while before the death of the president.  When did you start working in that household?
A.	I did not retain  -- I don't recall the date on which I started working for that family because that was of no interest to me.  I did not know I was going to be compelled to answer a question as to when I started working for those people.
Q.	Had you worked for them for some time?
A.	Yes, I had worked for them for a short while.
Q.	Thank you.  The name of your employer appears in your written statement.  Do you confirm that name?
A.	You are talking about my statement, but what did you say, Counsel?  Please can you repeat your question? 
Q.	The statement I am referring to is a statement that you made before the Prosecution investigators on 15th of November 1999, and in that statement, there is a name of your employer and I would like you to confirm that name.
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, I think if the witness can be shown the statement, because there are so many names contained in the statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Professor, please can you show the statement to the witness.  Professor, also highlight the name of the employer.
MS. MADENGA:
Maybe to assist the Court, if the name appears in the confidential working document in the spelling list of common names, I think it will be easier if the witness just indicates in terms of the number, whether it's number -- what number.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You want us to show this list of proper nouns to the witness?  Show the statement to the witness.  

Madam Witness, do you confirm that the highlighted name is the name of your employer?
THE WITNESS: 
I do not know how to read.  I can't read.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you write the name of your employer?

MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, the witness cannot read, she cannot write, so if she can get assistance from a Kinyarwandan interpreter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Kinyarwanda Interpreter, please, could you come to the witness stand and assist the witness with the name?

Mr. Interpreter, just read out the name of that highlighted person to the witness. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
She has recognised her employer's name which appears in the statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Interpreter, can you go to your seat, please.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you confirm that the highlighted name is the name of your employer?
THE WITNESS:
That is his name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Professor, do you want this name to be entered as an exhibit? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now you can proceed with your cross-examination.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you said that the death of the president was revealed to you by a certain Murekatete.  What relationship did you have with Murekatete?
A.	We were friends.  We were all household workers in neighbouring homes.
Q.	You state that you went to about one kilometre away to buy sugar, salt and flour.  What atmosphere obtained on your way?
A.	I saw nobody taking the road that I took. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you say that after three days, three days after the death of the president, refugees started coming to the Mugonero complex.  From what position did you realise that this was happening?
A.	I was near the hospital, working as usual.
Q.	What was the distance between the complex and your place of work?
A.	It is difficult for me to evaluate the distance because I did not carry out any studies in this regard, but I would say that to cover this distance on foot would take five minutes.
Q.	You state that this was three days after the death of the president.  May we therefore say that this was on the 9th of April?
A.	Do you say that this was the 9th of April?  I would like to know the date on which -- do you want to know the date on which I found out that the president was dead? 
Q.	No, Madam Witness.  My question is when did the refugees begin to come to the Mugonero complex?
A.	It was three days after the death of Habyarimana.
Q.	Madam Witness, and you state that a week afterwards, your employers joined the refugees.  Therefore, they went to the Mugonero complex.  Was it on 16th or the 17th?  On what date was that?
A.	The hospital was attacked on the 16th April, and after the death of Habyarimana, all the workers stopped working.
Q.	You stayed at home to look after the children up till the 16th of April, is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And on the 16th April, you decided to take the children to the complex where the parents were taking refuge; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  It was on the morning of 16th April before the beginning of the massacres.
Q.	Madam Witness, why did you decide to take the children to the complex, whereas you state that you had seen armed persons who were invading the complex?  Why did you have the initiative to take the children to a place that was also occupied by assailants?
A.	Listen, I took these children before the attack against the hospital.  It was not during the attack.
Q.	But the assailants were already visible, you could see them, these assailants?
A.	When one is afraid and people are dying and shouting, one cannot have the courage to go and see what is happening.  One tries to hide.
Q.	What was your trip from the place where you were working, the house where you were working, to the place where the parents of the children were taking refuge like?
A.	There was nobody on the road.  Everybody was in the hospital.
Q.	Madam Witness, when you gave back the children, was it easy to find the mother or the father?
A.	I took the children to the church where their mother was, and in due course I went to the hospital.
Q.	When you arrived, how many people did you meet in the church, in the chapel?
A.	Listen, I didn't go there to count the number of people who were there.  Perhaps a computer would have been able to do that.
Q.	Were there many?  Were there few?
A.	The chapel was full to bursting.  Others were at the hospital and others in the classrooms.
Q.	Madam Witness, you stated that upon giving the children back, you hid in room 3; is that correct?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And why did you not stay where your employers were?
A.	The room was full, and in a situation of total madness, people run here and there in despair.
Q.	When the parents decided to take refuge in the complex and to abandon the children with you, did they already know that the Tutsis were targets?
A.	They went to the hospital to find out about the situation.  They did not know what was happening up until then.
Q.	But they did not return from the hospital?
A.	They came back to the house to eat, and they went back to the hospital.
Q.	Between what dates and between what days were they able to do this back and forth movement between the house and the hospital?
A.	Do you think that I would have remembered these dates and these days?  In fact, I did not know that such a question would be put to me, and in any case, I can neither read nor write.  I can therefore not remember dates.
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall simplify the question by asking how long this back and forth movement of your bosses lasted, that is between their residence and the Mugonero complex?
A.	Are you referring to my employers?  They did this back and forth movement during the three days that preceded the attack.
Q.	And during these three days, you were able to learn that they were running a risk as Tutsi?
A.	They did not know that they were running a risk because they wanted to find out about the situation from other refugees, and in any case, I cannot say with any certainty whether they knew that they were running any risk whatsoever because I did just my work, and in any case, if I had known that as Tutsi they were running a risk, I would not have been able to work for them.
Q.	So you took refuge in room 3.  Why did you, in the first place, decide to hide in this room, and to begin with, why did you decide to take refuge?
A.	I took refuge because I saw that people were running towards the hospital and I was quite close to this hospital.  I heard the screams of people.  I could also hear the sound of whistles, and I said to myself that these people were running away, and I wished to join them.
Q.	Who told you that this was room 3?
A.	I knew the premises well because the hospital was built quite close to the residence where I worked, so I knew the premises well.
Q.	On arrival in room 3, you found many women; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Were there any men as well?
A.	I did not note this because there were many people in this room.
Q.	And why did you notice the women?
A.	The women were standing up, whereas the men were lying on the beds -- were lying under the beds.
Q.	When you saw Mika enter the room, were you able to identify him immediately?
A.	I had seen him once when *************************************************, so when I saw him enter this room, I recognised him, and after raping him -- after he raped me, I looked at him and I recognised that it was he.
Q.	In what year did your parents go to buy coffee?
A.	It was a very long time ago.  I can remember neither the date nor the year.
Q.	Could you give us more details as to what you mean by "very long time ago"?
A.	I was still very young.  I could not remember the time.
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  You stated that he was accompanied by two individuals; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You also stated that these two individuals seemed to obey him, is that correct?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	How did you realise that these two individuals obeyed him?
A.	They carried out his orders.
Q.	What orders, for example?
A.	They came into this room.  He came in with the two persons, and when he asked them to do this or that thing, they obeyed.  He said, for example, "I want to take this," and he would say, "You take that." 
Q.	Before you decided who took whom, was Mika able to give any orders?
A.	Listen, even the fact of saying, "Take this girl," and, "I'll take that girl," that was an order.
Q.	You stated before the Court, in response to a question, that you did not know the ethnic group of Murekatete; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	However, in the statement that you made before the Tribunal's investigators, you state that Mika pointed out two Tutsi girls.  Do you acknowledge this statement or do we have to show it to you?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, which part of the statement are you referring to? 
MR. SONGA:
In the French version, it would be the first page of the statement, last paragraph, counting six lines from the bottom.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, we've got it.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I had not yet asked the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, go ahead.  Professor, please go ahead.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I'm not sure that I had already asked the question regarding the difference in versions.  Perhaps I may ask it again.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Why is there a difference in versions?
A.	At that time I did not say that these two girls were Tutsi.  I said this instead.  If I was unable to see these two girls, it is probable that they are already dead and that they were Tutsis.  I never stated that they were Tutsi because I did not know anything about their ethnic origin.
Q.	The transcript will, of course, record this explanation.  

Madam Witness, when you say that Mika pointed to you and pointed to the other two girls while asking you all to follow him, how did he actually ask you to follow him?
A.	He asked us to follow him in Kinyarwanda, but we did not know our destination and the reason why he had called us.
Q.	Having recognised Mika Muhimana, did you speak to him?
A.	I had nothing to say to him.
Q.	In your statement, Murekatete and Mukasine were employees of the Mugonero hospital; is that correct? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, Professor, that is not correct.
THE WITNESS:
I knew Murekatete --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, I think our statement in (indecipherable) says they were employed by staff at the hospital -- they were employed as maids by members of Mugonero hospital.  That's what our statement says; not that they were employed by the hospital.
MR. SONGA:
That's correct.  That's correct, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you know this before or did you learn it upon meeting them?  The question would be more in reference to Mukasine than Murekatete.  In reference  to Mukasine, did you know that she was a maid at the hospital?
A.	She told me her name, but she did not tell me what she did for a living, nor did she tell me her tribe.  However, I knew this other girl, who, like me, was a maid.
Q.	Your statement indicates that all of them were working as maids?
A.	My statement was not taken down accurately.  That is not what I stated.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When you were taken to room 4, you state that it contained three beds, but that there was nobody; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was it a closed room?
A.	The room had a door, but the door was not closed.
Q.	Is there any explanation for the fact that there was nobody in the room, since the complex was full?
A.	Part of the refugees were inside the church.  Others were in other rooms, but there was nobody in this room.  I cannot tell you the reason why there was nobody.  It was perhaps because there were many places where these people could hide.
Q.	The door was open; was there a key?
A.	Yes, there was a key inside.  There was a key in the lock of the door.
Q.	Before this Court you stated that the rape on Mika's part lasted three minutes; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And in regard to Mukasine, the rape lasted three minutes as well?
A.	Considering that there were screams inside this room, these people stopped the act of rape.
Q.	Who stopped?
A.	The two young persons.
Q.	After three minutes?
A.	Yes, after three minutes.
Q.	Was it a pause, or was it that the act had been completed?
A.	The act had already been completed.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that Mika promised to stick sticks up into your vagina; is that correct?
A.	When we were begging him, he said, "Wait till we finish," and that, "we are going to push sticks up into your vagina and we are going to kill you."
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's not much of a promise, Professor.  It's more of a threat.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, you are perfectly right.  I was limiting myself to the French version of the statement where the word used is "a reward", actually.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, this stick -- did you see them or did you just hear them talked about?
A.	We heard them discussed.
Q.	So you did not see any sticks?
A.	I did not see them, but perhaps the other people who had come with him had these sticks, and if he had wanted any, he would not have lacked them.  He could go outside and ask those who had them to give them to him.  It was his right.
Q.	When Mika stated that he wanted to see the private parts of a Tutsi girl, why did you not tell him that you were not Tutsi?
A.	I did not know that.  If I knew that, I would not have been there.
Q.	Madam Witness, what did you not know?  What did you not know, exactly?
A.	I did not know that it was the Tutsi who were targeted.  I knew that all Rwandans were the same and had taken refuge in the same place.
Q.	All Rwandans were the same and had taken refuge in the same place?  What danger would these refugees have been running away from?
A.	They were running away and they stated that war was going to break out, but they did not know that it was the war that would make a distinction between ethnic groups.  People did not know who was a target of the war.  Even if they had known, they did not explain to us what war it was.
Q.	You say at one point a group of Interahamwe broke down the door.  What was the reaction of 
Mika Muhimana?
A.	These Interahamwe did not break down the door.  They were just arriving at the door.  Mika opened the door and a boy who was near the window recognised me and he asked me, "What did you come to do here when you are Hutu?"  Then they opened the door and I went away.
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall read your own statement out to you.  It is up to you to challenge it or to endorse it.  "At the time when action was beginning, a group of Interahamwe broke down the door, thinking that there were no refugees.  In this group, there was one of our Interahamwe neighbours called Ngendahimana, who recognised me." 
A.	That Interahamwe recognised me when he saw me through the window.  He did not pass through the door.
Q.	What is the significance of the statement you signed?  What does it say?
A.	I signed the statement because I know I came here to tell the truth.  Did I leave my family to come and tell lies?  Is that of any interest to me?  It is possible that errors were made somewhere, but I'm telling the truth.
Q.	Let us proceed, Witness.  Nobody here thinks you are a liar.  What does Interahamwe mean in your opinion?
A.	To my mind, the Interahamwe are people who kill others.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When did you understand that what was happening was targeting Tutsis?
A.	I knew about it that day when I went back home and that young man explained it to me.  He said that it wasn't the Hutus who were targeted, but the Tutsis.  As far as I'm concerned, what was important was the fact that I was safe.  I went home and I did not want him to explain any further.  When I got home, I asked the question why Tutsis were targeted and I asked who were Tutsis, and that day I knew that it was the members of the Tutsi ethnic group who were targeted.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you came out, you state that there were many corpses in the courtyard of the hospital.  When you came out, Witness, which way did you go?
A.	I came out and I continued on the road leading to my home.  If you ask me what way I went, how do you expect me to know?  If I told you the way I went, would you know? 
Q.	Yes, I would know.  I would believe you.  You state, Witness, that your employers and their children were killed on that day; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	How did you know about that?
A.	I never saw them again, and people who are returning after killing others told me my employers were dead.  Those Interahamwe were saying that they saw them where they were lying.
Q.	I would like to understand what you mean when you state that it was because you never saw them again.  Are all those you never saw again dead?
A.	They are dead.  If they were still alive, I would have seen them, since they wasn't far from where I was, from our house.
Q.	Where were the RPF troops when you decided to flee?
A.	I heard the refugees who were leaving saying that the RPF forces were coming, but they did not explain how far they had come.  All they said was that RPF troops were coming and that on their way they killed Hutus because of the abuses they were committing, and it was on that occasion that people in our area, in our home, fled.  I, myself, decided to flee, since the people in our house had fled.
Q.	Witness, did you receive any information subsequently regarding Mukasine?
A.	No, I did not receive any information regarding Mukasine.
Q.	Witness, did you receive any information subsequently on Murekatete?
A.	No, I did not receive any information on Murekatete.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, she has answered that she has not seen these two ladies after the war.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  This is the last question for the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Having fled to Zaire, where exactly did you seek refuge?
A.	I fled.  I did not know the various areas in Zaire.
MR SONGA:
If you allow me, Madam President, I will ask another sub-question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you go to the area in Zaire you fled to on foot, by car, or through some other means?
A.	I went on board an officially registered canoe.
Q.	To arrive in an island -- on an island?
A.	No, I don't know.  There were many points on which people disembarked, and I don't know the names of those points.
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your availability. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any re-examination for the witness?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President, I have no re-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this brings us to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for having come to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe trip home.

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, good evening, Your Honours.
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you.  I thank you for having arrested these evil doers.  I told myself that even if I am a Hutu, I should not tolerate all what happened.  It is good that you make no distinction between witnesses.  In any case, you should treat those people as you should.  I observe that they have put on weight, they have become Muslims.  May God help them.  May God inspire them to repent, and I, myself, I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I wish to address you on the order of appearance of witnesses tomorrow.  According to our schedule, BH is next; then he will be followed by AU, AW in that order.  

Tomorrow, as we all know, is a genocide memorial day.  Now, BH, I've been to see BH this afternoon.  He told me that in his home area there is a burial ceremony where his relatives and neighbours who died there ten years ago, the remains of his relatives are being reburied, so he's feeling very, very strongly about coming to testify in court here tomorrow.  Actually, he looks very depressed and we talked to him for a long time about this issue.  He's not prepared to come and testify tomorrow.  So we would request that AU, who is next after him, comes to testify because this one doesn't feel very strongly as BH on this issue.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you mean to say that your next witness would be AU tomorrow.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that is our request, Your Honour, because BH appears next, but we want to switch the two after have AU tomorrow and then BH may come the day after tomorrow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that okay, Professor?  Professor, there shouldn't be any problem, I think.
MR. SONGA:
The Prosecutor has only caused us inconveniences since we started this trial.  I cannot explain to you just how tiring it is when he disrupts the scheduling order.  Madam President, I usually don't like to complain, but today I am forced to complain.  I have been the only one handling the defence since the beginning of this trial, whereas we have on the other side, the side of the Prosecution, four persons, and I prepare my defence in accordance with the schedule prepared, and when that is disrupted, my work is doubled, and I would lose my voice and even my ability to read and write because I am overwhelmed.  

I know that it is not the fault of anybody that I am going through this.  My co-counsel will come at the end of the week.  Such disruptions should not be considered as unexpected and the genocide memorial should not disrupt the schedule and seen as an unexpected event.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

So next witness tomorrow will be AU.
MR. KAPAYA:
Much obliged, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
We stop for the day and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.
(Court adjourned at 1848H)
