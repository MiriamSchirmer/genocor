 1   In accordance with the scheduling orders issued on 29 March 2007 and 8 May 2007, the
 2   Appeals Chamber will deliver its judgment today in the case of Mikaeli Muhimana versus the
 3   Prosecutor.
 4

 5   Following the practice of the Tribunal, I will not read out the text of the judgment, except for the
 6   disposition. Instead, I will summarise the issues raised in this Appeal and the findings of the
 7   Appeals Chamber. I emphasise that the summary is not part of the written judgment, which is the only
 8   authoritative account of the Appeals Chamber's rulings and reasons. Copies of the written judgment
 9   will be made available to the parties at the conclusion of this hearing.
10

11   The Appellant, Mikaeli Muhimana, who is also known as Mika Muhimana, was the conseiller of
12   Gishyita secteur in Gishyita commune, Kibuye préfecture, from 1990 through the relevant period
13   covered by his indictment in 1994. The Trial Chamber convicted him pursuant to Article 6(1) of the
14   statute for instigating, committing, and abetting crimes between April and June '94 at various locations
15   in Kibuye préfecture. The Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant of genocide, count 1; rape as a crime
16   against humanity, count 3; and murder as a crime against humanity, count 4. The Trial Chamber
17   sentenced the Appellant to imprisonment for the remainder of [his] life on each count. The Appellant
18   appeals his convictions and sentences.
19

20   I will now address the grounds of appeal in turn. The Appellant has divided his grounds of appeal into
21   three categories: Errors of law and fact relating to general issues; erroneous factual findings related to
22   specific events; and sentencing errors. Within these categories, the Appeals Chamber has identified
23   16 grounds of appeal.
24

25   In ground 1, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that he had authority over the
26   Interahamwe, and that he was in a position to order them to commit genocide and crimes against
27   humanity. The Appeals Chamber notes, however, that the Trial Chamber did not find that the Appellant
28   had authority over the Interahamwe, or that he ordered them to commit crimes. Rather, the
29   Trial Chamber held the Appellant responsible for personally committing genocide, committing and
30   abetting rape, and committing and instigating murder. None of those holdings is founded upon any
31   finding that the Appellant had authority over the Interahamwe, or that he ordered the Interahamwe to
32   commit these crimes. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is dismissed.
33

34   Under ground 2, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law by reversing the burden of
35   proof, and essentially requiring him to prove the impossibility of his presence at the scene of crimes, or
36   that the crimes could not have occurred. The Appeals Chamber considers that some of the language
37   used in the trial judgment, as highlighted by the Appellant, could be perceived as a shift in the burden of
                              KIRSTIN McLEAN - ICTR - APPEALS CHAMBER - page 2
      MUHIMANA                                                                             MONDAY, 21 MAY 2007

 1   proof to the Appellant, when viewed in isolation. However, it is apparent that from the Trial Chamber's
 2   approach as a whole that it did not reverse the burden of proof. For the reasons provided in the
 3   judgment, the Appeals Chamber finds the Appellant's second ground unfounded and dismisses it.
 4

 5   In ground 3, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law and in fact by not defining the
 6   scope of his legal authority as a conseiller. He argues that, as a result of this alleged error, his
 7   conviction for ordering has not legal basis. As previously noted, the Trial Chamber did not find the
 8   Appellant responsible for ordering any of the crimes of which it convicted him. Accordingly, the
 9   Appeals Chamber dismisses the third ground of appeal.
10

11   Under his fourth ground, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in unfairly considering his
12   alibi, based on the circumstances surrounding the death of his child on 8 April '94, and the ensuing
13   mourning period. As explained in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber
14   followed established jurisprudence when it considered the Appellant's alibi. Accordingly, this ground of
15   appeal is dismissed.
16

17   The Appellant's fifth ground of appeal relates to his conviction for genocide. The Appellant submits that
18   the Trial Chamber erred in law and in fact by finding that he had intent to commit genocide when it was
19   established at trial that he had a Tutsi wife whom he protected to the end of the war; that he saved
20   Tutsi people in Gishyita; that he had saved Witness AQ, a Tutsi woman; and that he had married a
21   Tutsi woman during his flight to Zaire. This evidence was before the Trial Chamber. The
22   Trial Chamber was free to consider that it did not suffice to impeach the evidence of the Appellant's
23   individual acts of violence against the Tutsi, which formed the basis of its finding that he had the
24   requisite intent to commit genocide. In general, evidence of limited and selective assistance towards a
25   few individuals does not preclude the trier of fact from reasonably finding the requisite intent to commit
26   genocide. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is dismissed.
27

28   Under ground 6, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in failing to consider his arguments
29   advanced at trial in relation to a plot by Pascal Nkusi against him, his family, and his property, and by
30   failing to draw all necessary inferences from his alleged relationship with certain witnesses. For the
31   reasons explained in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber concludes that there is no merit in the
32   Appellant's contention that the Trial Chamber did not consider his arguments in relation to the alleged
33   plot, and finds that the Appellant has failed to demonstrate any error of law or fact on the part of the
34   Trial Chamber in this regard. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is dismissed.
35

36   Under ground 7, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in fact when it found that the
37   attacks in -- at Nyarutovu Hill and the neighbouring areas of Kiziba, Nyarutovu, and Ngendombi,
                              KIRSTIN McLEAN - ICTR - APPEALS CHAMBER - page 3

 1   between 8 and 11 April '94 had been established, whereas certain Prosecution evidence shows that the
 2   violence in the area began later. For reasons given in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber finds that
 3   the Appellant has not demonstrated that this evidence contradicted the Trial Chamber's findings about
 4   these attacks. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is dismissed.
 5

 6   In the eighth ground of appeal, the Appellant challenges his conviction for rape as a crime against
 7   humanity based, but only in part, on the finding that on 7 April '94 the Appellant raped two Tutsi women,
 8   Languida Kamukina and Goretti Mukashyaka, in his home. The Trial Chamber's finding that the
 9   Appellant raped Languida Kamukina and Goretti Mukashyaka is based solely on the testimony of
10   Prosecution Witness AP, who was not an eyewitness to the rapes. Rather, the Trial Chamber inferred
11   that the Appellant raped the two women based on several factors, including: The witness saw him take
12   the victims into his house; she heard them scream, mentioning the Appellant's name and stating that
13   they "did not expect him to do that" to them; finally, the witness saw the Appellant lead the victims out of
14   his house, stark naked, and walking "with their legs apart".
15

16   The Appeals Chamber can identify no factual error on the part of the Trial Chamber in concluding that
17   these two women were raped in the Appellant's home. However, it is apparent from Witness AP's
18   testimony that the Appellant was not alone with the young women in the house at the relevant time.
19   Witness AP testified that, "[a]mongst the voices coming from inside the house, the witness also
20   recognised the voice of Bourgmestre Sikubwabo, telling the girls to 'shut up'." Consequently, the
21   Appeals Chamber is not persuaded that the Trial Chamber acted reasonably in determining that it was
22   the Appellant who raped the two women, rather than another person present in the house, such as
23   Sikubwabo.
24

25   Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber finds, Judge Shahabuddeen and Judge Schomburg dissenting, that
26   the Trial Chamber erred in fact in convicting the Appellant for committing rape based on this event, and
27   reverses this factual finding. Even if Witness AP's evidence, as accepted by the Trial Chamber,
28   demonstrated that the Appellant could bear criminal responsibility for the rapes of these women as an
29   aider and abetter, the Prosecution did not charge this form of responsibility in connection with these
30   rapes, and therefore it will not be appropriate for the Appeals Chamber to uphold the conviction on that
31   basis.
32

33   The Trial Chamber's error of fact, however, did not occasion a miscarriage of justice because no
34   conviction on any count of the indictment rested solely on these rapes. Accordingly, the
35   Appeals Chamber is not satisfied that its finding of error on the part of the Trial Chamber is sufficient to
36   impugn his conviction or sentence for rape as a crime against humanity.

 1   Under ground 9, the Appellant challenges his conviction for genocide based on his role against Tutsi
 2   refugees at Nyarutovu and Ngendombi Hills between 8 and 11 April '94. In addition, the Appellant also
 3   challenges the Trial Chamber's finding that he raped Espérance Mukagasana at his residence, resulting
 4   in part in his conviction of rape as a crime against humanity.
 5

 6   With respect to the attacks on Nyarutovu Hill, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law
 7   and in fact in its assessment of Witnesses AW and W, in -- and in its failure to consider
 8   Defence evidence. For the reasons set out in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber finds that the
 9   Appellant has failed to demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could have made the
10   Trial Chamber's findings as to the events in Nyarutovu Hill. This sub-ground of appeal is dismissed.
11

12   With respect to the attack on Ngendombi Hill, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in law
13   and in fact by failing to address his arguments pertaining to the vagueness of paragraph 5(d)(iv) of the
14   indictment, and in assessing the evidence of Witness BC, BB, and W. Concerning allegations of
15   vagueness in the indictment, the Appeals Chamber finds that the indictment was defective, because the
16   Appellant could not have known, on the basis of the indictment alone, that he was being charged as
17   part of this attack with personally killing Tutsis with a grenade, seriously wounding Witness BC, and
18   killing her children. The pre-trial brief, however, provided the Appellant with timely, clear, and
19   consistent information sufficient to put him on notice that he was being charged with committing
20   genocide by these acts. In addition, the Appeals Chamber is not convinced that the Appellant has
21   demonstrated any error in the Trial Chamber's assessment of the evidence relating to this attack. This
22   sub-ground of appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
23

24   With respect to the rape of Espérance Mukagasana, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred
25   in law and in fact in its assessment of Witness AQ. His submission is supported by arguments related
26   to a credibility finding on Witness AQ in relation to another event, allegations of bias, internal
27   inconsistencies in the witness's account, lack of corroboration, and implausibility in light of Defence
28   evidence. For the reasons given in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Appellant has
29   failed to demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could have made the Trial Chamber's finding on
30   the rape of Espérance Mukagasana. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber dismisses ground 9 of the
31   Appellant's appeal in its entirety.
32

33   Under ground 10, the Appellant challenges his conviction for genocide and murder as a crime against
34   humanity, related to the Trial Chamber's finding on the attack against Mubuga church on 15 April '94.
35   The Appellant raises three challenges with respect to these findings, relating to the assessment of
36   Defence Witness DC, his alibi, and the burden of proof. For the reasons given in the judgment, the
37   Appeals Chamber is not convinced that the Appellant has called into question the Trial Chamber's
                              KIRSTIN McLEAN - ICTR - APPEALS CHAMBER - page 5
      MUHIMANA                                                                             MONDAY, 21 MAY 2007

 1   finding on his role in the attack against Tutsi at Mubuga church. Accordingly, ground 10 is dismissed.
 2

 3   In his eleventh ground of appeal, the Appellant challenges his conviction for rape as a crime against
 4   humanity related to the Trial Chamber's finding that, on 15 April '94, after the attack on Mubuga church,
 5   he and a group of Interahamwe brought six young Tutsi women to a cemetery where the Appellant
 6   raped Agnes Mukagatare. The Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in fact in finding that he
 7   raped Agnes Mukagatare on the basis of Witness AV's testimony because her evidence was internally
 8   inconsistent, lacked corroboration, and was inconsistent with the testimonies of other Prosecution and
 9   Defence witnesses, in particular with respect to when the event occurred. The Appellant further
10   contends that the Trial Chamber erred in fact in rejecting his alibi for this period, based on the evidence
11   of Witness DC. For the reasons stated in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber is not convinced that the
12   Appellant's argument demonstrate any error in the Trial Chamber's finding on this event. Accordingly,
13   ground 11 is dismissed.
14

15   Under ground 12, the Appellant challenges his conviction for genocide, rape as a crime against
16   humanity, and murder as a crime against humanity, based on the Trial Chamber's finding related to the
17   attack on Mugonero complex on 16 April '94. The Appellant raises several challenges to the
18   Trial Chamber's assessment of the evidence, and the credibility of Prosecution witnesses which the
19   Trial Chamber relied upon in making findings relating to his participation in this attack, as well as to the
20   attack in general. For the reasons given in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber is not convinced that
21   the Appellant's arguments demonstrate any error in the Trial Chamber's finding on this event.
22   Accordingly, ground 12 is dismissed.
23

24   Ground 13 relates to the specific role played by the Appellant during the attack on Mugonero complex
25   in the rape and murder of several women in three separate incidents occurring in the basement of
26   Mugonero hospital. This ground also challenges another event on 22 April '94, which is not related to
27   the attack on the complex, relating to the rape of Prosecution Witness BG.
28

29   I will first discuss the three events at Mugonero complex. The Trial Chamber found that on 16 April '94
30   the Appellant raped Mukasine Kajongi, and abetted two other assailants to rape two daughters of
31   Amos Karera, and then instigated the assailants to kill the three women. In addition, the Trial Chamber
32   found that on the same date, and at the same location, the Appellant also raped
33   Prosecution Witness (sic) BJ and AU, and abetted two assailants to rape Mukasine and Murekatete.
34

35   With respect to the rape and murder of Mukasine Kajongi and Amos Karera's two daughters, the
36   Appellant alleges a number of inconsistencies between Witness AT's evidence and his previous
37   statements, the lack of clarity in his evidence concerning the location of the crime, and the lack of
                               KIRSTIN McLEAN - ICTR - APPEALS CHAMBER - page 6
      MUHIMANA                                                                            MONDAY, 21 MAY 2007

 1   corroboration. For the reasons stated in the judgment, the Appeals Chamber is not convinced that the
 2   Appellant's argument demonstrated any error in the Trial Chamber's findings on this event. This
 3   sub-ground of appeal is dismissed.
 4

 5   With respect to the rapes of Witness BJ, Mukasine, and Murekatete, the Appellant raises three principal
 6   legal and factual challenges related to an alleged defect in the form of the indictment, the ethnicity of
 7   the victims, and the credibility of Witness BJ. The Appellant first submits that the indictment failed to
 8   provide him with sufficient notice of the place of the crimes. The Appeals Chamber considers that from
 9   the indictment alone, the Appellant would have known that he was being charged with these rapes at
10   Mugonero complex. The Appeals Chamber recalls that in the Ntakirutimana appeal judgment, it
11   concluded that referring to events taking place at Mugonero complex was sufficient to put the Accused
12   on notice that he was charged with acts committed at Mugonero hospital. The Appellant has not
13   advanced any argument indicating why further specificity was required in this particular case.
14

15   The Appellant next submits that the Trial Chamber erred in fact in finding that Mukasine and Murekatete
16   were Tutsi, when Witness BJ testified that she did not know their ethnicity. Moreover, the Appellant
17   submits that in failing to establish the ethnic identity of these women, the Trial Chamber erred in law in
18   convicting him for genocide on the basis of this event. Contrary to the Appellant's assertion, the
19   Trial Chamber observed, in its factual findings on this incident, that the ethnicity of Mukasine and
20   Murekatete was unknown. Moreover, the Trial Chamber stated in its legal findings that the Appellant's
21   conviction for genocide, insofar as it related to acts of rape at Mugonero complex, encompassed only
22   the rapes of Tutsi women. It therefore convicted the Appellant for the rapes of Mukasine and
23   Murekatete as a crime against humanity. Finally, the Appeals Chamber finds no merit in the Appellant's
24   submissions concerning the Trial Chamber's assessment of Witness BJ. This sub-ground of appeal is,
25   therefore, dismissed.
26

27   With respect to the rape of Witness AU, the Appellant challenges the notice given to him in the
28   indictment for this event, and the assessment of Witness AU's testimony. First, the Appellant contends
29   that the indictment alleges that the rape took place at "Mugonero school of medicine", which does not
30   exist, and that it therefore does not give notice that the event occurred in the basement of
31   Mugonero hospital. However, on the basis of the indictment alone, the Appellant would have known
32   that he was being charged with the rape of Witness AU at the Mugonero complex. As the
33   Appeals Chamber noted above in this ground of appeal, this is sufficient notice of the location of this
34   crime in the context of these events. Accordingly, the Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the
35   indictment was defective with respect to the location of this crime. The Appeals Chamber finds no merit
36   in the Appellant's submissions concerning the Trial Chamber's assessment of the testimony of
37   Witness AU. This sub-ground of appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

 1   Turning to the rape of Witness BG, the Trial Chamber found that on 22nd April '94, the Appellant
 2   permitted an Interahamwe named Mugonero to "take away" Prosecution Witness BG, with knowledge
 3   that Mugonero intended to rape her. The Appellant argues that he was convicted for "authorising"
 4   Mugonero to abduct and rape Witness BG, which is not a mode of participation under Article 6(1) of the
 5   statute. The Appellant further argues that the Trial Chamber was required to establish his position of
 6   authority in order to show that he used his authority to "persuade or force another person to commit a
 7   crime". The Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant for abetting the rape of Witness BG. Abetting is
 8   one of the modes of participation under Article 6(1) of the statute. For an accused to the convicted of
 9   abetting an offence, it is not necessary to prove that he had authority over the principal perpetrator. In
10   addition, the Appeals Chamber considers that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the Appellant's
11   actions in such circumstances amounted to encouragement which had a substantial effect on
12   Mugonero's subsequent rape of Witness BG. This sub-ground of appeal is therefore dismissed.
13

14   Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber dismisses ground 13 of the appeal in its entirety.

 2   MR. PRESIDENT: (continued)
 3        Under ground 14, the appellant challenges his conviction for genocide based on his role in the attack in
 4        mid-May 1994 against Tutsi refugees on Kanyinya Hill. The Trial Chamber found that the Appellant
 5        came to the hill with busloads of armed assailants and unleashed a devastating attack in which he
 6        actively participated by shooting and wounding a Tutsi man named Nyagihigi. The Appellant raises
 7        three principal factual and legal challenges with respect to the Trial Chamber's assessment of the
 8        notice provided in the indictment, the Prosecution evidence, and the standard applied in assessing
 9        Defence evidence.

10

11        With respect to the notice argument, the Appellant submits that paragraph 5(d)(v) of the indictment,
12        lacks precision and fails to plead any physical act of genocide. The Appeals Chamber finds that the
13        Indictment was defective because, on the basis of the indictment alone, the Appellant could not have
14        known that he was being charged with personally shooting and wounding Nyagihigi during this attack.
15        Nonetheless, the Appeals Chamber observes that the Appellant conceded in his motion to strike this
16        evidence at the close of trial that he received more detailed notice of this incident in the pre-trial brief.
17        Having reviewed the summary of Witness AP's anticipated testimony in an annex to the pre-trial brief,
18        the Appeals Chamber finds that the pre-trial brief provided the Appellant with timely, clear, and
19        consistent information sufficient to put him on notice that he was being charged with committing
20        genocide by shooting Nyagihigi at Kanyinya Hill.
21

22        The Appeals Chamber is not convinced by the Appellant's other arguments under this ground
23        challenging the Trial Chamber's assessment of evidence. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber
24        dismisses this ground of appeal.
25

26        In Ground 15, the Appellant challenges his conviction for murder as a crime against humanity based on
27        the killing of Pascasie Mukaremera. On appeal, the Appellant submits that the Trial Chamber erred in
28        law in convicting him of this murder because the indictment failed to give him proper notice of the time
29        and place of the crime and his role in it. Paragraph 7(d)(i) of the indictment reads: I quote, "Towards
30        the end of May '94 at Nyakiyabo hill in the Bisesero area an Interahamwe named Gisambo killed
31        Pascasie Mukamera, on instructions of Mikaeli Muhimana." Unquote. However, the Trial Chamber
32        found that the Appellant personally killed Mukaremera on Rugona Hill in mid-May '94.
33

34        The Appeals Chamber finds that the indictment is defective because it fails to allege the correct time
35        and location of the murder and that the Appellant physically committed it. Although the Prosecution
36        submits that the Appellant failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the evidence of Witness AW,
37        whose uncorroborated testimony supports this conviction, at trial, the Trial Chamber did not describe

 1   the Appellant's objection based on lack of notice in its closing brief as untimely. The Appeals Chamber
 2   has held that, where a Trial Chamber has treated a challenge to an indictment as being adequately
 3   raised, the Appeals Chamber should not invoke the waiver doctrine. Moreover, contrary to the
 4   Prosecution's submissions, the Appeals Chamber considers that the Appellant raised a timely objection
 5   to all defective aspects of this paragraph of the indictment at trial. It therefore falls to the Prosecution to
 6   prove that the Appellant's defence was not materially impaired by these defects.
 7

 8   The Prosecution submits that the Appellant had sufficient notice of the time and location of the murder
 9   of Pascasie Mukaremera and his role in it through the pre-trial brief and through the disclosure of the
10   statement of Witness AW.
11

12   The summary of Witness AW's anticipated testimony in the annex to the pre-trial brief refers to the
13   Appellant killing Pascasie Mukaremera on Rugona Hill in mid-May 1994 and relates it to the relevant
14   paragraph of the indictment. The Appeals Chamber has previously held that a summary of an
15   anticipated testimony in an annex to the Prosecution's pre-trial brief could, in certain circumstances,
16   cure a defect in an indictment. The circumstances presented in this instance, however, are different.
17

18   The summary of Witness AW's anticipated testimony does not simply add greater detail in a consistent
19   manner with a more general allegation already pleaded in the indictment. Rather, the summary
20   modifies the time, location, and physical perpetrator, matters that were already specifically pleaded in
21   the indictment, albeit in a materially different manner. In such circumstances, the summary of
22   Witness AW's anticipated testimony in the annex of the pre-trial brief and in the disclosure of his
23   witness statement do not provide clear and consistent information. The summary of Witness AW's
24   testimony materially alters key facets of this paragraph. This discrepancy should have been
25   immediately apparent to the Prosecution as the prepared its pre-trial brief and listed the anticipated
26   testimony of Witness AW in support of a paragraph of the indictment that materially conflicted with it, in
27   particular given that the Prosecution had shortly prior to that added this allegation to the indictment for
28   the purpose of providing specificity to the Accused.
29

30   In sum, the failure to properly plead Pascasie Mukaremera's murder in the indictment was not cured,
31   and the Prosecution has failed to rebut the presumption of material impairment of the defence.
32   Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber finds, Judge Schomburg dissenting, that the Trial Chamber erred in
33   law in relying on this evidence in convicting the Appellant for this murder. His conviction for murder as
34   a crime against humanity on this count is therefore invalidated.
35

36   This error of law, however, does not invalidate the conviction of the Appellant for murder because this
37   conviction did not rest solely on this murder. The Appeals Chamber is also not satisfied that this error
                            ELEANOR BASTIAN - ICTR – APPEALS CHAMBER - page 10

 1   invalidates the Appellant's sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of his life in view of the other
 2   crimes as well as the other aggravating factors considered by the Trial Chamber. Accordingly, the
 3   Appeals Chamber finds no basis for disturbing the Appellant's convictions for murder as a crime against
 4   humanity despite its finding that the Trial Chamber erred in finding this incident established.
 5

 6   Under Ground 16, the Appellant challenges his three sentences of imprisonment for the remainder of
 7   his life, respectively on each of the three counts for which he was convicted. The Appellant submits
 8   that the Trial Chamber failed to consider any mitigating circumstances and imposed an excessive and
 9   disproportionate sentence. Mindful of the gravity of the Appellant's crimes, the Appeals Chamber does
10   not find, even if it accepted the Appellant's submissions as to mitigating factors, any discernible error in
11   sentencing that has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is
12   dismissed.
13

14   I will now read out in full the operative paragraphs of the Appeals Chambers disposition.
15   Mr. Muhimana, will you please stand.
16

17   This is the disposition: For the foregoing reasons, the Appeals Chamber, pursuant to
18   Article 24 of the Statute and Rule 118 of the Rules, noting the written submissions of the parties, and
19   their oral arguments presented at the hearing on 15 January 2007; sitting in open session; affirms
20   unanimously the Appellant's conviction for genocide (Count 1); and affirms unanimously his sentence of
21   imprisonment for the remainder of his life entered for that conviction; allows, in part,
22   Judge Shahabuddeen and Judge Schomburg dissenting, the Appellant's eighth ground of appeal;
23   reverses, Judge Shahabuddeen and Judge Schomburg dissenting, the Trial Chamber's finding that he
24   bears criminal responsibility for the rapes of Goretti Mukashyaka and Languida Kamukina; affirms
25   unanimously his conviction for rape as a crime against humanity (Count 3) in all other respects; and
26   affirms unanimously his sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of his life entered for that
27   conviction; allows, in part, Judge Schomburg dissenting, the Appellant's fifteenth ground of appeal;
28   reverses, Judge Schomburg dissenting, the Trial Chamber's finding that he bears criminal responsibility
29   for the murder of Pascasie Mukaremera; affirms unanimously his conviction for murder as a crime
30   against humanity (Count 4) in all other respects; and affirms unanimously his sentence of imprisonment
31   for the remainder of his life entered for that conviction; dismisses unanimously the
32   Appellant's appeal of his convictions and sentences in all other respects; rules, that this judgment shall
33   be enforced immediately pursuant to Rule 119 of the Rules; orders, in accordance with Rule 103(B) and
34   Rule 107 of the Rules, that Mikaeli (also known as Mika) Muhimana is to remain in the custody of the
35   Tribunal pending his transfer to the state in which his sentence will be served.
36

37   Mr. Muhimana you may be seated.
