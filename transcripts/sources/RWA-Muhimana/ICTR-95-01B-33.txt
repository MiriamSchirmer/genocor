MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The Court is in session now.  

The appearances for the Prosecution are the same as before? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, Defence counsel.  The appearances are the same as always. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The Defence. 
MR. SONGA:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  The composition is the same.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

At the close of the session yesterday, the witness made the request to hear him in closed session.  The witness fears that his evidence on the events to which he had pleaded guilty to the Rwandan authorities would jeopardise the security of his family.  In view of the request, we allow him to testify in closed session in relation to the crimes to which he had confessed.  

Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.

	0917H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are in open session, so be careful with your identity. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I was asking you about a person who is protected, as you are, so we are going to put her name on a piece of paper, or the person's name on a piece of paper.  Mr. Witness, you have said that you know the first name but that you do not know the second one.  I shall proceed as follows.  Do you confirm that there is a person with the first name that you have before you?
A.	As I told you yesterday, there is a child who has this first name -- who bears this first name who used to live in Mika's house.
Q.	Thank you.  If I remember correctly, yesterday you said that this was his wife's niece; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I think it is his wife's niece.
Q.	Do you know what happened to this niece of the wife of Mika Muhimana?
A.	When I returned from exile after the war, I was arrested and detained, so I do not know where this girl is, but I don't think that she's amongst the people who were kidnapped. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, I believe I also recall that you stated yesterday that on the 7th of April you were at the centre of your secteur; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you learn that women were raped by Mika at his home on the 7th of April?
A.	I never heard any such thing.  Besides, during the gacaca sessions in the prison where we are detained, I have never heard that such a thing happened in our secteur.  What is more, I do not think that it is possible that Mika raped women in his own house, where his wife was.  Therefore, it is impossible, in my view.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, this impossibility you are putting in your view, let's get to it.  What is impossible?  Why is it impossible for Mika to rape a woman in his house?  Why do you say it is impossible? 
THE WITNESS:
Based on Rwandan culture, instances of rape are kept secret, so I think it is not possible for this to have happened because his wife and children were there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, all the events that were happening in April of 1994 in Rwanda, did they conform to Rwandan culture? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  This has nothing to do with Rwandan culture.  But there are taboos in Rwandan culture.  Thus, to commit rape in the presence of one's own wife, I don't think that is possible.  I never heard of such a thing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I know you never heard of it.  It is the impossibility that I am asking you about.  Is it impossible just because it is contrary to Rwandan culture or is it impossible for other reasons? 
THE WITNESS:
That is contrary to Rwandan culture.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that the reason --
THE WITNESS:
What is more, I have never heard of it. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it the reason that it is contrary to Rwandan culture the one which makes you say it is impossible?
THE WITNESS:
That is not the only reason.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What's the only reason?
THE WITNESS:
It is one amongst many reasons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What are the reasons?  Those are the ones I am asking you. 
THE WITNESS:
The first reason is connected to Rwandan culture.  A question was put to me regarding whether or not he could have raped these women.  As I told you, rape is taboo in Rwandan culture.  Thus, for me, I cannot understand how a person can do this in particular, which means that it is not true. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, did you hear that refugees were attacked in churches during the events of 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I heard of it. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Is that in accordance with Rwandan culture, to attack refugees in a church building? 
THE WITNESS:
From the time I was a child, I have never heard about refugees or cases of refugees, so I don't know whether this is in accordance with Rwandan culture. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You don't know that it is taboo for people to attack others who have sought refuge in a church?  You don't know that in Rwandan society it was felt that it was unacceptable for people who had gone into a church to seek refuge to be attacked and killed?  You never heard that that's a taboo in Rwandan society? 
THE WITNESS:
If I examine my conscience, I would say that it is a taboo, but my view is that this depends on everyone's individual conscience.  But I have never heard of this sort of thing before. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So taboos and cultures are sometimes broken, aren't they?  Taboos and cultural norms are sometimes violated. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is true.  Sometimes people break taboos. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall once more send a name, with the assistance of the registry, and you shall tell us if you know this person.  Mr. Witness, do you know this person?
A.	Yes, I knew her. 
Q.	Can you tell us something about her?
A.	I told you that this person was also the niece of the wife of Mika Muhimana.
Q.	Do you know what became of her?
A.	In 2002, she lived in Gitovu cellule in Gishyita secteur, and I believe that is where she still lives.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, I shall show you one last name, with the assistance of the registry, of course.  Mr. Witness, do you know this person?
A.	Yes, I knew her.
Q.	Can you remember whether you saw this person in April 1994?
A.	A little before the war, I saw this person, but after the crash of the presidential aircraft, when it was shot down, I never saw this lady again.
Q.	Can you remember whether you saw her, for example, on the 7th of April; that is, on the day following the death of the president?
A.	As I said yesterday, after the 6th of April, in the morning, many people left their homes and went to Bisesero.  From the information -- the information I received, I received during the gacaca sessions, and I learned that this person went with the others to Bisesero on the morning of the 7th of April.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You have spoken at length about the gacaca.  During the gacaca sessions which you participated in, did anybody confess to rape in your secteur?
A.	I stated to you that I didn't hear mention of that during the war, nor did I hear about them during the gacaca sessions.  In short, I never heard any such thing, but I add that during our discussions outside of gacaca sessions, some people admitted to having raped women.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief of this witness.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And we'll enter the documents as exhibit -- the first document is entered as Exhibit D. 77, under seal. (Exhibit No. D. 77 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The second one will be Exhibit D. 78, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 78 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the third one is Exhibit D. 79, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 79 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor.  Please understand the question and be brief and concise in your answers. 

Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Counsel. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecutor. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Mr. Issa, could you place D. 76, the document pertaining to the personal identification of this witness, before him. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, it is shown under the title État-civil, a person is mentioned there as your spouse.  Can you tell us when you were married -- when you got married to this person?
A.	I remember.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are referring to which exhibit?
MR. KAPAYA:
D. 76, Your Honour, the personal identification. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us the date?  Do you remember the date, the month, the year?  If so, tell us. 
A.	I remember.
Q.	Could you tell us, please, if you remember. 
A.	I believe I can tell you, but I would like to do so in closed session. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did you say? 
JUDGE SHORT:
You can write the date on a piece of paper. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The date when you were married?  Write it on a piece of paper, yes. 
THE WITNESS:
That is also possible. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Could you also include the place where you were married.  Thank you.  Now, could you indicate this place which you show here, this name, name of a place, in which cellule and secteur it is.

Now, I can show you the name of a person and ask you whether you are acquainted -- whether you know that person and whether you are acquainted to him.  Do you know that person?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
Q.	Where did he live in April, May, June '94?
A.	If you give me a piece of paper, I would write the place where he was during that period. 
Q.	But people don't know who we are talking about.  I don't think there is any need to write those down.
A.	If I say the circumstances under which I knew that person and where he was, people can identify him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are only being asked to say where he lived, not the circumstances in which you knew him. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And nobody knows who you are talking about, so I don't know what your problem is. 
THE WITNESS:
We were together on the Tuesday in April 1994. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	I didn't quite get the response.  On a Tuesday or what?  I'm sorry, can you repeat?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You were asked --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Just say where the person lived in April, May and June.
THE WITNESS:
We were together.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where did he live in April to June? 
THE WITNESS:
That question is not clear, as far as I am concerned, because that person was not resident in the same area up to the time mentioned.  I don't know how to explain it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Okay, let me help you, Mr. Witness.  In April where was he living? 
THE WITNESS:
In early April, that person was living in Mpembe secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In May where was he living? 
THE WITNESS:
And for the reasons I mentioned to you, he left that location.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And therefore in May he was living where? 
THE WITNESS:
That person moved to his secteur of origin.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the name? 
THE WITNESS:
It is Ngoma secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And in June where was he living? 
THE WITNESS:
In May, that person was living in Ngoma, but he often came to visit us. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In June.  I'm asking about June.  In June where was he living?  You have told me in April he was living in Mpembe, in May he was living in Ngoma, now I am asking you in June where was he living? 

THE WITNESS:
I have stated to you that in April that person was in my secteur where I was residing.  For the reasons that I have already mentioned --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't tell us your secteur.  We are talking about his, that person's place of abode. 
THE WITNESS:
His secteur of origin is Ngoma, and I believe I have already said so.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, is that where he was living in June? 
THE WITNESS:
That is where that person resided.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In June? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, was there a period in April that you and that person lived together?
A.	Yes, at one time in April we lived together.  That is from the 2nd of April, as I have already mentioned to you.
Q.	To when?  From the 2nd of April to which date?
A.	I do not remember the date on which that person left my house, but from the 2nd of April up to May, we were living together.
Q.	Now, the person who is referred to is *************.  Apart from **********************, do you have any other relationship with her?
A.	That question is not clear. 
Q.	Okay.  Was she employed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where you ********************? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, we didn't follow your question. 
MR. KAPAYA:
I'm trying to ask in such a way that --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May the Honourable Judge use a lit microphone.  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You are asking the witness whether he, the witness, and the person named as *********************** ************** or not?
MR. KAPAYA:
That's the question. 
THE WITNESS:
We were **************. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, in April, May, June, were you on ******************?
A.	At one time in April, we stopped ***********, but subsequently we *****************.  Particularly from the 3rd of May we ********.
Q.	Were you paid your salaries at the end of April, as usual?
A.	We were paid at the end of the month of May.
Q.	Now, the person whose name appears on the first document, the typed document I gave you, was he also working?  Was he on duty in April?
A.	I have stated to you that in April we were together, which means that we were not working.
Q.	Let me show you another document that contains three names and tell me whether you know the first and second.  Do you know the first and second person?  The first and second person.
A.	I know both persons.
Q.	So now is it true that the three persons mentioned there used to work with you?
A.	I will explain things differently.  The person who is number one was **************************************.  We did not work together, but we used to meet from time to time.  The person who is number two was not at the same place from October 1993.  He went for studies, so he was not at the same place of work in April. 
Q.	If you take number two and number three, in relation to your position, who was the senior of the three?  Number two, number three and yourself, who was the boss?
A.	I have stated to you that person number two was no longer working during that period, so I cannot compare him with other persons.  Regarding the third person, he used to work, but I cannot compare him with number two.  One was working; the other had gone to study. 
Q.	Did your area of work, your sphere of your jurisdiction, did it extend beyond Gishyita secteur?
A.	No.
Q.	So is it correct to say that the person on number three was not reporting to you in April, May, June?
A.	Can you please repeat your question.
Q.	Did the person on number three report to you, work-wise?  Did he report his -- did he make reports and submit them to you as boss?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	But this person was working in a secteur other than Gishyita secteur.  How could he have been reporting to you when you have said that your area of work did not extend beyond Gishyita secteur, it is in Mpembe?
A.	You have probably confused -- you are probably confused about things.  I don't know how to say this.  With regard to services, there is sometimes what is called secteurs or sectors.  That's what we refer to as zones, and our jurisdiction covered zones.  I don't quite know how to say this.  Probably I can translate this into another language.  We used to work in what was called ************, which was different from the *********************.  I think I have answered your question.
Q.	Right.  So were you with this person at your place from -- between -- from the 7th to the 16th of April '94?
A.	I said this already, because I told you were we together in effect from the 2nd of April, and even on the date you've just mentioned, we were together.
Q.	Did you go with him to Mugonero hospital on the 7th of April?
A.	No.
Q.	Where was he when you went to Mugonero hospital?
A.	That person remained at home.
Q.	Did you go with him anywhere on the 7th of April?
A.	I don't remember, but I think -- I don't think we went anywhere together.
Q.	So is it your testimony that from -- after you had returned from Mugonero hospital, you went home to your residence and stayed with this person whose name appears on that document?
A.	As I said yesterday, when I returned from the Mugonero hospital, I went to deliver the message from Muhimana's wife to Muhimana, and when I returned home the person was home.
Q.	The delivery of the message, how long did it take at Muhimana's residence?  One, five minutes? 
A.	I was there for some time because I told you that I got there at eleven o'clock, and I think I stayed there for about four hours.
Q.	Can you tell us what you were doing for two hours at Muhimana's residence. 
A.	I am sorry, but I didn't spend the two hours at Mika's place.  What I meant is that when I returned, I found this person in my home.  I didn't spend all the two -- all the two hours at Mika's place.  I gave him the message and then I took a walk.  I therefore didn't spend the two hours at Mika's place.
Q.	So how long were you at Mika's place?
A.	I was there for about between 15 and 25 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How far was your house from Mika's place? 
THE WITNESS:
The question is welcome, but I would like to ask you, Madam President, Your Honours, that I would like to answer the question in a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why do you want to answer this question in a closed session?  Just give us the -- estimate the distance. 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that this could jeopardise my safety.  Can't you let me write down the answer on a piece of paper?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Write it down. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give him a piece of paper. 

	May we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to help with the translation of this answer. 

	Mr. Witness, after delivering the message to Mika and staying with him for 15 minutes, where did you go thereafter? 
THE WITNESS:
When I left Mika's house, I went to see other people and wasted some time on my way. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you tell us the names of those people? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I would also like to request that you give me leave to answer that question in writing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please give him a piece of paper. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, how long did you stay -- sorry.  What time did you get to Mika's house?
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I got to Mika's house at about eleven o'clock.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, apart from the 7th, which -- 7th of April, which other day did you see Muhimana?
A.	As I told you yesterday, unless I am mistaken, I stated that most often I saw Mika Muhimana, and I also told you where I used to live, but I never saw him again during the mourning period for his child -- or, rather, I saw him most during the mourning period for his son.
JUDGE SHORT:
Can we finish with the 7th of April.  Now, after you went to see this person whose name you've written on a piece of paper, you went home, I assume.  From there did you go home?
THE WITNESS:
I left that person to go to my home.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long did you stay with this person? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that when I left the hospital, I spent about two hours at that location, so if you subtract 15 to 20 minutes that I spent at Mika's place, you will have the time that I used or that I spent with that person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was that person related to you? 
THE WITNESS:
If you are referring to the person that I went to see, yes, there are ties binding us.
JUDGE SHORT:
And after you left that person's house, you went home and you stayed home the rest of the day?
THE WITNESS:
I went home and stayed there. 
JUDGE SHORT:
For the rest of the day? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, for the rest of the day.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, on the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When did Mika's child die? 
THE WITNESS:
Mika's child died on the 8th. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, on the 8th, what -- for how long were you at Muhimana's place?
A.	On the 8th, I did not go to Mika's house.
Q.	All right.  How about on the 16th, did you see Mika on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	I saw Mika on the 16th.
Q.	What time did you see him?
A.	I saw him in the morning while we were preparing a coffin in which his child was going to be buried, and up until about 5:30 p.m., I saw him in his home.  Please, I am sorry.  I think I am mistaken.  I think I didn't quite understand your question.  You asked me a question in respect of the 16th.  I would say, rather, that on the 16th I went to Mika's house after eleven o'clock and that's the day on which the mourning period or the mourning of his son was being completed.  I am sorry, I was mistaken.  So from eleven o'clock, I was with Mika and other persons at his home during the coffining.
Q.	Between the time you woke up and 11 a.m., where were you?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It was, rather, the end of the mourning.
THE WITNESS:
On the 16th, before I went to Mika's house, I first of all took my cow to the veterinarian's.  And it is thereafter that I came back; that is eleven o'clock, and then I went to Mika's place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When was the child buried? 
THE WITNESS:
The child was buried on the 10th at about eleven o'clock. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, what is the location of the place where you went to see the cow?  Is it to see a cow?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, to take his cow to the veterinarian.
JUDGE SHORT:
Veterinarian.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Possibly for...(overlapping microphones)
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I went to look for drugs or medicines for my cow.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Where?  Was it in the same cellule or different cellule, and what is the name of the person you went  to for the medicine?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before that, did you go to look for the medicine or did you go to take the cow?  Which one is which? 
THE WITNESS:
My cow was at somebody's place.  I was informed that the cow was not well, and the next day I went to the person who had the cow so that we can go and look for medicine with which to treat the cow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you take the cow with you? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I found it at the person to whom I had entrusted it, so I found it at his place.  I entrusted it to him so that he can take care of the cow, but the person to whom I had entrusted it sent me a message to the effect that the cow was not well.  So in the morning I went to his house so that we could look for medicines with which to treat the cow.

JUDGE SHORT:
Didn't you say earlier that you took your cow to the vet's in the morning when you woke up?  Isn't that what you said earlier? 
THE WITNESS:
As far as I am concerned, there is no difference because the idea is to treat the animal.  We went to look for medicines with which to treat the cow.  Well, I didn't take the cow to the vet's place as such, but we went to look for medicines with which to treat it.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	What is the name of this person you went to, in which cellule was he a resident?
A.	I shall ask you once more to let me answer in writing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, give him a piece of paper. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Write also the name of your friend to whom you had entrusted the cow. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, would it be appropriate to go into closed session? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I think that would simplify -- to speed up the process. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session.

 testified as follows:
 EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us about the circumstances under which President Habyarimana died?  I withdraw the question.  That wasn't what I was thinking. 

Mr. Witness, I'm going to rephrase my question.  Under what circumstances did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	We learnt of the death of President Habyarimana, but I don't quite recall the date.  I didn't write it down.  I did not know that I was going to be asked about that date.  But on -- during the night in which he died, we knew about it.
Q.	Can you recall the year?
A.	It was in 1994.
Q.	Is it also possible for you to recall the month?
A.	It was in April 1994.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  On the day following the president's death, what was the security situation prevailing in your secteur?
A.	Immediately after his death, there was insecurity because the Tutsi took flight.  We couldn't explain why.  Some of them went to Bisesero, and others to the Catholic mission.  And there was insecurity from that moment.
Q.	At the time of the events, Mr. Witness, did you know a gentleman called Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I knew him.  He was my neighbour.
Q.	When you say "neighbour," Mr. Witness, do you mean that you were in the same commune?
A.	Well, in the same cellule.  He lives in the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) cellule.  I myself live in -- I live in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and the two cellules are close to one another. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the witness has mentioned names that can identify him, in particular, the names of the cellule, so can they be expunged from the transcript?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The identifying information will be struck off the record and kept under seal. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you also know his family?
A.	Yes, I know his family.
Q.	Did you know his wife?
A.	Yes, I knew her. 
Q.	Did you know the ethnic origin of his wife?
A.	I don't know her ethnic group, but she was Tutsi.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did Mika have children?
A.	Yes.  He had two children. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, do you know the Mugonero hospital complex?
A.	Yes, I know that complex.
Q.	Did you learn what happened in that complex in April 1994?
A.	I know because I was present. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened, since you were present there?
A.	I can tell you.
Q.	Please, carry on. 
A.	There were disturbances.  There was war.  Military men came, and the Interahamwe came and they killed many people.  They killed, in my presence, the people.
Q.	What were you doing there?
A.	We went there because we were called by the bourgmestre to go there within the framework of an attack.
Q.	Do you recall the period or the date, even if only approximately so?
A.	I do not remember the date.
Q.	You mentioned the bourgmestre; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  It is the bourgmestre who asked us to go to that attack at Mugonero.
Q.	Can you recall his name?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please tell us. 
A.	His name was Sikubwabo, Charles. 
Q.	When he told you to go and attack the Mugonero hospital complex, where were you precisely?
A.	I was at home in my house.  He was in a car, and he was asking all those he met to go and take part in the attack at Mugonero.
Q.	Was it in the morning or in the afternoon?
A.	It was very early in the morning.
Q.	When he talked to you, were you with other people or were you alone?
A.	I was with other persons. 
Q.	Tell us, Witness, how did you leave your house to the Mugonero complex?  Did you go on foot or did you go in a car?  Which means of transport did you use to go to the Mugonero complex?
A.	I went on foot.
Q.	Were you alone to go on foot?
A.	I was with other people.
Q.	How many of you were there, Mr. Witness?
A.	It's been a long time.  I remember the people who were close to me.
Q.	Can you estimate the distance between your house and the Mugonero complex?
A.	Two kilometres separate my home from the Mugonero complex.
Q.	You talked to us about the bourgmestre, Mr. Witness, that is Charles Sikubwabo.  Was he alone when he asked you to go and attack the Mugonero complex?
A.	At that time he was alone, but when we got to Ngoma, there were other Interahamwe who had come from Bugarama.
Q.	How many Interahamwe were there?
A.	There were many of them.  Nobody could count them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you an Interahamwe yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I am only an ordinary member of the population.  I am not an Interahamwe.

	1230H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, according to you, what exactly represented the Interahamwe?
A.	They were Hutu.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, can you say a little more concerning the Mugonero attack?  What weapons were the assailants carrying?
A.	The assailants were armed with guns and grenades.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you an assailant yourself?
THE WITNESS:
There were some who had come to fight, and I'm talking about the Interahamwe and the military men.  As for us, we came as members of the population to Mugonero, and when we got there, we found Interahamwe who had come from Mugonero, Bugarama.  And Sikubwabo had brought soldiers.  And when they started killing people, we were already there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you were there to do what?
THE WITNESS:
We went there for the attack.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To attack?  You went there to attack, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Charles Sikubwabo took us to attack by force.  He asked us to participate in this attack.  We went there to defend, to save ourselves.  We arrived before the Interahamwe and the soldiers.  The Tutsis stood up to us, they chased us, and we fled.  It is the Interahamwe and the soldiers who brought us back.  We returned to that place.  And the soldiers began to shoot at people and to throw grenades.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you referred to Sikubwabo.  Were there any other authorities present at the scene?
A.	I did not see any other authorities.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Approximately, how many people, civilian members, of the population were there with you?
THE WITNESS:
Except for a few people that I was able to identify, with whom I had gone, there were many other people who had come from Mpembe, Gishyita, and even from Rwamatamu.  There were many people.  I could not count them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you can't even estimate the number?  Was it 20, 30, 100, 500, 1,000?

THE WITNESS:
There were over a thousand if I were to give an estimate.  There were very many.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And the Interahamwe, how many?
THE WITNESS:
I did not count them.  There were also many.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
As many as a population or fewer?
THE WITNESS:
There were less in number than the population, but the difference was that they were carrying weapons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how long did the attack last?
A.	The attack started at 10 o'clock and ended at 3 p.m.
Q.	From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., were you at the Mugonero hospital complex?
A.	Yes, I was there all the time.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if someone were to tell you that Mika Muhimana was one of the assailants, how would you respond?
A.	Mika Muhimana was not amongst the assailants because he had problems, he had lost his child.  I no longer remember on what date his child died, but I think it was a Friday.  He was not buried immediately.  This child had died in the Mugonero hospital.  He was buried on a Sunday, at the end of the Sabbath, so he could not have participated in these attacks.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you hear that Tutsi women were raped on that day at the Mugonero complex?
A.	That did not take place in Gishyita commune.  It did not happen in Mugonero.  And, besides, in the entire Gishyita commune, I had no news that a girl or a woman had been raped during an attack.  If, by any chance, you hear that there were any rapes at all, I am ready to be punished for that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What do you want to be punished for? 
THE WITNESS:
It would mean that I have given false testimony.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We hear that if somebody was raped you get punished.
THE WITNESS:
Quite so.  I heard nothing of the sort from the start of the war.

JUDGE SHORT:
You mean throughout April, May and June, you never heard that a single person was raped?
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, you never heard, or no, nobody was raped?
THE WITNESS:
Nobody was raped.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, I am going to send you a name written on a piece of paper.  You will tell us whether or not you know this person, and I shall put questions to you afterwards.
THE WITNESS:
But I can't read.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But it is a simple name.  You can't read the name? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I can't read. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we ask the interpreter, please, to assist the witness.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
It's done, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have the name before you.  We would like to hear your clear answer on this.  Do you know that person?
A.	I know this person.
Q.	Can you tell us whether in April 1994, the day after the death of the president, you saw this person?
A.	Yes, it was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), my neighbour.
MR. SONGA:
We're requesting witness not to give the name of this person.  It is for this reason that we put the name on a piece of paper.  If it is possible for this -- the name that has been called, to be struck from the records.
THE WITNESS:
The day following the death of the president, this person went and sought refuge in Bisesero.  Even before the fighting began, this person took her children and her cows and went to seek refuge in Bisesero.  Subsequently, this person escaped and returned to Gishyita.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the person mentioned by the witness is to be deleted from the record.  
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Do you know at what time of the day this person left home for Bisesero?
A.	The cows went at 5 a.m., and the person in question followed with her children at about 11 or 12 o'clock, but the cows had gone before.
Q.	How did you learn that she had departed for Bisesero?
A.	This person is my neighbour.  Also, my wife had gone to Nyarushishi market, and when she arrived at Bisesero at the wood belonging to Muhirwa, she asked -- she saw these cows and she asked the herdsman what these cows were doing there, and the herdsman said, "I was asked to take these cows here."  The husband of this person lived in ***********.  And when she arrived at the place where the cows were found, she took them away to her uncle's place in Bisesero.  And, subsequently, the wife and children joined them.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know a person called Ruhigira?
A.	Yes, I know Ruhigira.  She even presented me with a cow.
Q.	Did you know this person's family?
A.	I know this person's family.
Q.	Did you know his wife?
A.	Yes, I knew his wife.
Q.	Did you also know his children?
A.	Yes, I also know his children.
Q.	How many children did Ruhigira have?
A.	He had five children; three daughters and two sons.
Q.	Can you tell us whether in April 1994 these children lived with their father Ruhigira?
A.	Two of his daughters had married.  One of them in Gisenyi, who subsequently went to work in Kigali and that is where she lived.  The other one had married in Mubuga.  And the third daughter was a single mother who lived with her parents.  One of the boys had his own house, and the other resided in Kigali.  And the one who resided in Kigali is still alive.
Q.	Can you remember the names of all these children?
A.	Yes.  The one who lived in Kigali was called Aquiline, the one in Mubuga was called Faina.  I think I have forgotten the name of the other one.  The other one was called Mathias, and yet another was called Désiré.  There was a girl called Languide.  That is the one who was a single mother.  Her name was Languide.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you learn that Ruhigira's daughters were raped in April 1994?
A.	No, nobody raped them.  The one who stayed with her parents went to seek refuge in Mubuga with her son -- with her child, and it is in Mubuga that she died among the refugees in the church.  As to the others, I do not know under what circumstances they died because I was not with them.  What about the case -- I did not hear of any rape that was perpetrated against any of these persons.
Q.	If anybody were to tell you that amongst these Ruhigira girls, two were raped by Mika in his house on the 7th of April, how would you respond?
A.	That never took place.  Mika is my neighbour.  If something had happened in his house I would have known; he is a neighbour.  From my house to his house there is not more than 70 or 80 metres, 100 metres at the very most.  If something had happened in his home, I would have known.  And this is the sort of news that travels fast.  I am telling you the truth, it did not take place.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Apart from the children of Mika whom we have already mentioned, did you know other persons who lived under his roof?
A.	Regarding people who lived under his roof, there was a young girl who was his wife's niece.  When Mika was a prosperous trader before he became bankrupt, this young girl used to sell beer on Mika's behalf.  So when Mika went bankrupt, this young lady was in charge of domestic work.  When his wife had gone to teach in her school, and Mika was busy elsewhere, this young lady used to take care of the home.  There was no other person in Mika's house.
Q.	Do you remember this person's name?
A.	This young lady's name -- let me think.  I have forgotten her name, but I know it. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to put my question: do you know at least what happened to her in April, May or June 1994 during the events in Rwanda?
A.	This is what happened: Mika left his house to go and bury one of his relatives who had passed away.  And during Mika's absence, Interahamwe abducted this person, and when he returned he realised that the person had been taken away.
Q.	Who were these Interahamwe?
A.	They were Interahamwe who had come from Bugarama.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, how did you get to know that this lady was abducted by Interahamwe?
THE WITNESS:
This person was my neighbour.  When the Interahamwe came I could see them.  I lived by the road side.  When they came through the trading centre, the Interahamwe, they went from house to house and they abducted this young lady.  I do not know where she was taken.  I cannot tell you about that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How many ladies were abducted from the other houses? 
THE WITNESS:
On that day they took that young lady, they killed -- or, rather, they abducted this young lady.  They abducted a teacher who had been arrested in Bisesero, but this happened on different days.  The teacher who was arrested in Bisesero was arrested after the abduction of this young lady.  These Interahamwe also took away a communal policeman called Nzabandora.  And in the vehicle they had the head of a certain Kabanda.  And then Nzabandora was taken to the road below, and he was killed.  I was there at the commercial centre and I was a witness.  The teacher was taken towards Mugonero.  I do not know whatever happened to the teacher.  I don't know whether these Interahamwe had particular places where they took these people to.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How do you know they had the head of Kabanda?
THE WITNESS:
When they were taking Kabanda's head away, I was present.  They took his head on a piece of wood, and while they were doing that -- "Open up.  Now you can buy your coffee."
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They took it from where, the head of Kabanda? 
THE WITNESS:
They brought it from Bisesero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's what I'm asking.  How did you know that they brought it from Bisesero or that they had it?
THE WITNESS:
The Interahamwe said so themselves.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
They were coming from Bisesero, and they were saying that they had brought this head from Bisesero.  They said that they had killed Kabanda in Bisesero.  It is these Interahamwe themselves who were saying it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And where did they take it? 
THE WITNESS:
They left this head at the centre.  It was finally buried at the commercial centre.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And where was Mika on that date? 
THE WITNESS:
Mika was sitting on his verandah.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And where in the centre did they leave the head?
THE WITNESS:
They left the head on the verandah of Kabanda's store.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
On the ground? 
THE WITNESS:
They hung it on the verandah.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would Mika ever be able to witness the hanging of the head on the verandah?
THE WITNESS:
I remember that Mika was present.  He was sitting on his verandah when the vehicle came with this head.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did he speak to the Interahamwe?
THE WITNESS:
To the best of my knowledge, no.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how far is Kabanda's store from Mika's verandah?
THE WITNESS:
No, there was no great distance.  Let's see.  About 30 metres.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What position did Mika hold at that time? 
THE WITNESS:
He was a conseiller.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Even being a conseiller, he did not talk to the Interahamwe?
THE WITNESS:
Personally, I heard nothing.  But if Mika said something to them I didn't hear it.  I saw the Interahamwe.  Mika was sitting at his home.  And after that -- besides, I left this place.  I left the Interahamwe there and I don't know whether Mika spoke to them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The Interahamwe, were they walking or were they in a vehicle or something?  How did they move? 
THE WITNESS:
When they brought his head they were on board a vehicle.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did they say anything? 
THE WITNESS:
From what I know they said nothing, but they were saying that they had just killed Kabanda in Bisesero.  The communal policemen is supposed, according to them, to have found him in a cassiterite mine in the company of the teacher who was also arrested.  This is what I heard them say.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what did they tell you about buying coffee?
THE WITNESS:
When they brought his head, they hung it on the house and they said, "Now look at him.  There he is.  He should buy his coffee." 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know the names of the Interahamwe who brought this head of Kabanda?
THE WITNESS:
How can I know their names?  The people in Bugarama, in Cyangugu, how could I know their names?  I don't know their names.  No, I don't know their names. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you referred to the girl who lived in Mika's house, the one who sold in the store.  Did you learn that she was raped by Mika?
A.	But how could Mika have raped her?  If he had wanted, he could have taken her as a wife in addition to his other wife.  Why would he have waited for this opportunity to rape her?  This person lived in his house.  Why would he have raped her on that day had he not had the opportunity to do so before?
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I would have liked a more positive response, but you're subjecting me to a question and answer here again.  I'd like to put another question to you: did you know where Mika worked as a conseiller?
A.	As to Mika's office, I know that there was no secteur office in our area, and a secteur office had not been built yet.  Anybody who had a problem went and presented it to Mika at his home.
Q.	If I remember correctly, you have referred to Sikubwabo, Charles.  During the events, did you see him in the company of Mika?
A.	I saw Sikubwabo with Mika when they passed this place, but during the war Mika and Sikubwabo were not on good terms because Mika was married to a Tutsi woman, and Sikubwabo did not like men who were married to Tutsi women.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you saw them, where were they going?
THE WITNESS:
They did not get on well.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you saw them, where were they going? 
THE WITNESS:
They were passing by.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that the same day that the Interahamwe brought the head of Kabanda? 

THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What was there --
THE WITNESS:
These are different days.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The day you saw them, what were you doing yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I lived at that place.  When I moved I could see what was happening.  I did not live far from this place.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When you saw them, were they in the same vehicle or were they in different vehicles? 
THE WITNESS:
It is Sikubwabo who was on board the vehicle and, in fact, it was not the commune vehicle because the commune vehicle had broken down.  This vehicle belonged to a Nyaruhanga trader called Rulinda.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And who was in the vehicle? 
THE WITNESS:
Sikubwabo.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And where was Mika?
THE WITNESS:
Mika was at his home.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did Sikubwabo come to Mika's home? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him go to Mika's home.  He didn't go there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So where did you see them together?  That's what I'm asking you.
THE WITNESS:
I did not say that I saw them together.  What I said instead is that I used to see them in the market square in front of the store, in front of Mika's house.  I did not see them exchange any words.  What is more, I was not supposed to be watching them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you did say that you saw Mika -- you said that you saw Sikubwabo with Mika.
THE WITNESS:
He could greet him, but after he greeted him he would continue on his way and there was nothing surprising about that, and Mika would stay there on the spot.  As for Sikubwabo, he could go and see those who participated in the attacks.  What is more, if he found anybody who was not participating in the attack, he would threaten them.  I remember that one day he shot at someone whom he met roasting meat, and it was his policeman.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, did you say that you saw Sikubwabo talking to Mika, or you saw them together?  Can you really be more specific as to what your testimony is on this matter? 
THE WITNESS:
The fact of seeing them together in front of Mika's house does not mean that I could know what they were talking about.  I saw Sikubwabo with Mika, and after a while I saw him get into his vehicle, and he went away, and Mika stayed in his home.
JUDGE SHORT:
And how many days or weeks after the death of the president did you see them together? 
THE WITNESS:
How can you ask me such a question?  Mika lived close to the commune office just like I did.  Do you think that I could begin to count the number of times that they spoke? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did they speak many times or only once?
THE WITNESS:
I was not monitoring them.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The times that you saw them, was it once, is it several, 10, two times?  Some estimate. 
THE WITNESS:
I saw them together only on one day.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that is the one you can't count.
JUDGE SHORT:
And when did you see them together?  Was this?  How many days was this --
THE WITNESS:
It was in the morning at about eight.
JUDGE SHORT:
Was this after the death of the president? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was after the death of the president.  He was already dead. 

JUDGE SHORT:
How many days after the death of the president did you see them together? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember.  What about the case?  I know that it was before the war. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now you said that Mika and Sikubwabo were not getting on together well because Mika had married a Tutsi woman.  Is that not what you said?  And Sikubwabo did not like people who were married to Tutsi women.  Is that what you said? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who told you that?  Who told you that the two were not getting on together? 
THE WITNESS:
If you are someone's neighbour and he has an enemy, you cannot not know, whereas he is your neighbour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, did he tell you he has an enemy?
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about Mika? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
Listen, sometimes people chat and you might learn something from it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you chat with him, with Mika?
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about Mika?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
I could chat with Mika and he would tell me, "Listen, I am no longer on good terms with this person."
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that what he told you?  Did he tell you that? 
THE WITNESS:
No, it is people who were saying it.  They were saying that Mika is no longer on good terms with Sikubwabo and we wondered why, and he would answer, "Listen, it is because Mika is married to a Tutsi woman", and that is why they are no longer on good terms.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I'm asking you who is it who told you that?
THE WITNESS:
It was the people who lived in this place who talked about it.  It is those who could talk with Mika who told me about it.  I couldn't speak with Mika because these were people that we respected.
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know when Mika got married to his wife? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember the period when they got married, but I do not remember the exact month.
JUDGE SHORT:
How long before the war did they get married?  How many months, years? 
THE WITNESS:
When the war broke out, they had already had two children so I think they had spent about five years together -- between four and five years because, when you have two children, you can estimate the period of the marriage or the duration of the marriage to four to five years.
JUDGE SHORT:
And before the war how long had Mika been conseiller? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, I don't remember.  But I think he had been at this position for two or three years.
JUDGE SHORT:
And when did you hear about this strange relationship between Mika and Sikubwabo?  When did you hear about it?  When did you hear people talking about it? 
THE WITNESS:
I heard of it in the course of conversations that I had with other people.  And they would tell me, "Listen, this person no longer gets along with the bourgmestre."  When I asked them why, they might give me the reason.  But it is not Mika who told me.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you hear about this before the war, or after the war, and if so, if before the war, how many days, weeks, or months before the war did you hear about this?
THE WITNESS:
It was before the war.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did Mika and his wife celebrate their marriage? 
THE WITNESS:
No, they did not celebrate their marriage.  Mika brought her.  Mika had married this woman who had lost her husband, and she was a teacher, so he married a widow and the civil marriage was celebrated in their house, in Mika's house, but there were no festivities marking this house, unless they celebrated with their nearest neighbours, but there was no marriage feast as such.  It was not celebrated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when we look at your identification particulars we realise that your current address is at the prison.  Is there any reason for that?
A.	Yes, I can explain it to you.  We had the chairman of the gacaca sessions in our prison and at one point he called me.  I went out and met someone who had come from this court.  He asked me did I know Mika.  I said yes, I knew Mika.  He asked me, "What is your area of origin?", and I said, "I live in Gishyita".  He asked me the names of my father, my mother, and my wife.  And he said, "This is what I wanted to know about you."  He went away again and he called other people.  And the following day, a few days later, a young lady came.  She took photographs of us.  After photographing us, she told us, "Prepare to go to Arusha."  And sometime afterwards a vehicle came and took us and we came here.
Q.	Mr. Witness, please listen to my question carefully.  Why are you in prison?
A.	I'm in prison because I participated in acts of war and I participated in the attack launched in Ngoma and Gitovu, and I pleaded guilty to the two crimes.  That is the reason why I am detained.
Q.	Please try and explain to us here.  So the first crime is the Mugonero crime, is it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what is the second crime?
A.	It is the Gitovu attack.
Q.	Can you distinguish between the crimes for which you are accused and the ones that you confessed to?
A.	The crimes I confessed to are as follows: I participated in the Ngoma attack, even if I killed no one.  I participated in this attack.  And I said that I hadn't killed anyone, but later on the instructions were read out to us and they told us even if you participated in an attack without killing anyone, you are considered as an accomplice to the assailants or the killers.  And when these explanations were provided I pleaded guilty. 
Q.	During your gacaca, did you hear the other names of those who plead guilty for Mugonero?
A.	Yes, there are many of them.  There are many of them.  Many confessed. 
Q.	And can you give us their names?
A.	I can give you the names of those whom I remember, but I don't know most of those who confessed to their crimes because there are many detainees in this prison. 
Q.	During the gacacas, are the names of those who confessed to rape given?
A.	No.  I heard no one confess to this crime.
Q.	Do those who confess in the gacacas, do they have the possibilities of accusing other persons?
A.	Yes, they do it.
Q.	This is my last question: did you learn that Mika's name was mentioned in the gacaca?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness DI.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	Now I'm going to direct my questions on the events after the death of the president.  Witness DI, do you know **************?
A.	Yes, I know him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the name again? 
MR. KAPAYA:
**************************
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness, did this man work at the commune office?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what work was he doing at the commune office?
A.	He was an (unintelligible) officer.
Q.	Following the death of the president, did this man **********************?
A.	I did not know that he had come to hide.  One morning a shop had been burnt down.  I went out on to the road.  I saw him in the front courtyard of my house and asked him what he was doing, and his answer was "Don't you know what has happened?", and I asked him, "Can't you come to my house in the evening?"  So he came inside the house and I asked him what had happened.  And all of a sudden, the bourgmestre sent two persons called *************************************************.  These two boys came and said, "The bourgmestre has summoned *************."  I accompanied him.  When we got to the bourgmestre's house, he asked him what he was doing in my house; whereas, he wanted him to come to his house.  The bourgmestre then spat into my face.  The bourgmestre then handed that person to the brigadier who took him away.  But in the evening my wife asked me whether we couldn't take food to **********.  When we went to where *********** was, the policeman scolded my wife and that policeman took the food and gave it to *************.  The following day, my wife returned there to bring some clothing to him, or some property to him, the same policeman scolded her.  And my wife said that the policeman had scolded her and that she hadn't found *************** in the prison.  That is what happened.
Q.	Witness, is it not true that this person was handed to ****************?

A.	No, that man by the name of *************** who came with ************ and myself left together and we met the bourgmestre very close to the school.  Nzabandora was not present.
Q.	All right.  Now isn't it the case that when you reached the commune office, Mika Muhimana was also present with Sikubwabo on that day?
A.	The person I saw was the bourgmestre whom I found at the school.  Mika was not present.
(Pages 39 to 53 by Roxane Lane)












1515H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Very well.  Do you know a person by the name of ***************?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
Q.	And what did he do?  What was his --
A.	He was also ****************** and shared the same office.  We shared the same office.
Q.	Did he have a motorbike?
A.	*********.
Q.	On or around 7th or 8th April '94 isn't it a fact that he was arrested carrying fuel in Gishyita centre?
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	In what?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	In a jerry can?
A.	I was not present but I heard that **************** had been arrested in Gishyita as he was bringing fuel to ***********************, and that was when soldiers arrested him.  They said he was going to burn people's houses.  He was then taken to the commune office.
Q.	Witness, I didn't hear the name to whom it is said this man was taking the fuel.  Who was he taking the fuel to?
A.	The person's name was ****************.  He was the one who asked him to bring the fuel to him. 
Q.	Now, Witness, was it not Mika who arrested ***************** and interrogated him about the carrying of the fuel?  Didn't you hear that, if you were not present?
A.	No, he was arrested by soldiers instead.
Q.	Yeah, but was Mika not one of the people who interrogated him as to what he was carrying, where he was coming from, after he was arrested?
A.	I heard about that during Emmanuel's arrest.  I was not present.  I heard people say so.  I did not witness it myself.
Q.	And what time was he arrested, if you heard?
A.	I do not know the time, because I was not present.
Q.	Do you agree that ****************** were killed in the -- were subsequently killed?
A.	I was not aware of their death, but I know that they were arrested and imprisoned in the commune office.  Their graves were not found.  I do not know where the bourgmestre took them to.
Q.	And do you know a lady by the name of Myiramabiragi, M-Y-I-R-A-M-A-B-I-R-A-G-I, B-U -- that's the second name -- B-U-D-E-N-I-S-A?
A.	I know her.
Q.	What was the ethnic origin of this lady?
A.	She was Tutsi.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened to her?
A.	While the world was waiting in Ngoma the bourgmestre put her, her mother, and another woman who was with them, on board a vehicle and took them to Ngoma mission, claiming that he was going to help them to flee.  He took them in the morning at about 8 a.m.
Q.	Now, Witness, let's talk about the Mugonero attack.  Now, what time did you reach at the Mugonero hospital on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	We left our home very early in the morning, and we got there at about eight.  There were many of us.  The Tutsis were assembled there.  When they saw us, they started throwing stones at us, and they were pursuing us.  And as we were threatened, we fled.  I was very close to them.  There was someone who was directly behind me.  He was killed.  His name was Sienny.  We -- therefore we left, and when we got below the field Sikubwabo led an attack composed of soldiers and Interahamwe and told us to go back to Mugonero.  The soldiers started shooting at people and throwing grenades at them.
Q.	Witness, what weapon were you carrying that day?
A.	I was carrying a club.
Q.	Now, in your group amongst the attackers how many of you came from Gishyita secteur?
A.	I don't know the exact number.  There were many of them.  We went there in large numbers; however, I left with my neighbours, ********* , we left together, **************** was with us and left with us.  I got to know those people who left from my house when I got to Mugonero.  I cannot remember all those.  Sometimes I even forget my child.
Q.	Now, did you see some attackers come in vehicles to the complex?
A.	I saw soldiers on board vehicles. They had come from Mugonero, because they were residing there in Murakaza's house.
Q.	How many vehicles did you see?
A.	You mean the soldiers' vehicles?  The soldiers came on board two vehicles.
Q.	And did you see Ruzindana in the course at the complex?
A.	I had heard of Ruzindana, but I had not yet seen him.  He had attended school, and after his studies he went to work in Kigali.  I did not know him very well.
Q.	Did you hear that he came with a vehicle at the complex?
A.	I heard that he came to the Mugonero complex, but I did not know him.  I did not see him.  I heard people talk about him.  I heard that he was the one who had brought Interahamwe.  I did not see him.  It may have been because I did not know him.
Q.	Did you see Clement Kayishema?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you Sikubwabo?
A.	Yes, I saw Sikubwabo.
Q.	Do you know the people with whom you went to the hospital?
A.	Are you referring to Sikubwabo?  I do not know the persons who accompanied him to the hospital.  He was the one who had brought those soldiers.  I could, therefore, not have been able to make out the persons who went there with him.
Q.	The first time that there were Interahamwe who came up from Gitarama, who brought these Interahamwe from Gitarama?
A.	Those Interahamwe who came from Gitarama, I heard people say that they were Interahamwe from Yusufu.  I had never heard of Yusufu in Goma.  I had heard of Ruzindana, but I did not know. 
THE INTERPRETER:
He said Ruzindana but I think it means Rusufu.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right, now in the course of the attack, did you go to any of the buildings in the Mugonero complex?
A.	No.
Q.	Why not?
A.	To do what?
Q.	I thought you said you were recruited to go and participate in the attack on the complex.
A.	I was not chosen.  Everyone was taken to that attack in Mugonero.  Why would I have been chosen?  I was not a soldier.  People were brought by chance, and they were obliged to take part in the attack.
Q.	Now, how many Tutsi refugees did you club to death at the complex?
A.	No one.  We used guns and grenades.  Guns and grenades were used.  They could not have been hit with clubs, whereas there were guns and grenades that could be used.
Q.	So, Witness, how did you feel when you found out that you did not have an opportunity to use your club?  Were you happy?
A.	I felt at peace with myself. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why did you feel at peace with yourself?  
THE WITNESS:
I felt at peace because I didn't have any blood on my hands.
JUDGE SHORT:
While you could have stayed at home?
THE WITNESS:
I could not have stayed at home because after their victory people fled.  I stayed indoors.  I didn't hold myself to blame for anything.  I stayed at home.  People started fleeing in the month of July, and in August the Inkotanyi arrived in our country.  And after their arrival, they found the troops of UNIMIR.  When they met them, the UNIMIR soldiers asked the Inkotanyi to go to Ngoma.  The Inkotanyi used to come and buy  beer in my house, and in September, around the 15th, they arrested me and they imprisoned me in Mugonero, where I spent three days.  Thereafter they took me to Nyabitare in Kibuye where I spent three weeks.  After that I was taken to Gitarama, where I spent five years.  After those five years, I was taken to *********, where I am detained.  I have been detained there for the past five years.
JUDGE SHORT:
That wasn't part of what I asked you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he disclose his identity?
MR. KAPAYA:
I did say "you", Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
He mentioned his current position.
MR. KAPAYA:
There are many people from his area, from his préfecture.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Okay.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, I  move to another area.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you said that many people took part in this attack and that, in fact, people were obliged to take part in the attack and the bourgmestre was there, he was directing affairs, is that also true (microphone not activated) was there.
THE WITNESS:
I head about it.  I didn't see him, but probably because I didn't know him.  It was said that it is Ruzindana who had brought Interahamwe.
JUDGE SHORT:
But you never saw nor heard that Mika was there?  You never saw Mika, nor did you ever hear that he was there?
THE WITNESS:
No, Mika wasn't present.  If he had been there, I would have said so.  I am in custody, and I cannot defend him.  Mika wasn't present.  Everybody would say that to you.
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you give an explanation why all these officials and, as you say, everybody was more or less compelled to participate but Mika alone was not there?
THE WITNESS:
Mika had lost his son.  He was in mourning, and that is why he did not take part in those attacks.  The bourgmestre had left him in peace because of his son's death.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is that what he told you?  Did Mika tell you that?

THE WITNESS:
I had nothing to do with Mika.  He couldn't tell me that.  Since he fled I haven't seen him again.
JUDGE SHORT:
How do you know that was the reason why he was not there?  How do you say so?
THE WITNESS:
That's because he was my neighbour, and I took part in those attacks, and I did confess as much.  I never saw Mika in the scene.
JUDGE SHORT:
What you are bringing us, Witness, is it Mika who told you why he was not there or was it Sikubwabo who told you why he left Mika alone?  How did you know that, the reason why Mika was not there?
THE WITNESS:
I knew that Mika wasn't present because I took part in those attacks and they were seeing everything, and when we returned he was at home in his house.
JUDGE SHORT:
How do you know what you have told us, that he was not asked to come to be there, the bourgmestre left him alone because he had -- he was mourning his child?  How did you know that fact?
THE WITNESS:
He was my neighbour.  He had lost his son.  Is it a mistake in saying that he didn't take part in those attacks for that reason? 
JUDGE SHORT:
No, we are not asking you to say whether he took part.  You have told us you didn't see him but you also said that the reason why the bourgmestre left him alone is because he was mourning his son.  The question you are being asked is this: "Who told you that that is the reason he was left alone, that is the reason he was not there?"  Is it him, Mika, or is it the bourgmestre?
THE WITNESS:
I never asked Mika or the bourgmestre anything.  As far to me, I thought he was left alone because of the problem that he had on his --
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, after the mourning period, did you ever see Mika with the bourgmestre, Sikubwabo?
THE WITNESS:
No, I never saw them together.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, you know that you are an elderly person.  You know that you must know how the communes and the secteurs worked.  You must know that the bourgmestre worked hand in hand with the conseiller; is that not true?  They have to. Yes?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
You are saying that throughout the war period, April, May, June, you never saw these two personalities of figures together, from April, May, June, you never saw them together.
THE WITNESS:
I never saw them together; maybe others did.  There are many of us witnesses.  Others may say so but I never saw them.  I was part of the attacks twice, and, subsequently, I kept my cow.  I never went back there, and I never saw Mika and the bourgmestre together conversing.  Anybody who saw them together can tell you so.
JUDGE SHORT:
During the war did Mika continue working as a conseiller or did he resign or retire?
THE WITNESS:
The war stopped immediately or -- the minute the war stopped people fled into exile and the conseille and the bourgmestre didn't continue to work, they all went into exile.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's in July, isn't it?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they went away in July.
JUDGE SHORT:
And speaking about the period between April when the war started and the period when they went into exile, are you saying that during that period, from April to July, you never, even on one occasion, saw the bourgmestre with Mika the conseiller?
THE WITNESS:
No, I never saw them together.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, you testified that you confessed to participating in attacks at Ngoma and in Gitovu.  If you --
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, when did you commit crimes in Gitovu, what's the period, what's the date?
A.	I can no longer recall the date, because nobody was talking of the activities that were being undertaken to retain the dates, but insofar as Gitovu was concerned, that was at the very beginning of the war.  We were told that the Bisesero people had attacked the commune, the bourgmestre pushed us to go and fend off those people.  That's exactly what he said, and people went.  I came amongst the last group and when we reached Gitovu we saw that the Tutsi were up on the hill, and the people had to fend off the Tutsi where there were those Tutsi, and they killed them immediately.  And when I arrived at the exact location I saw the corpses.  The soldiers took up the corpses, and they hid them in a pit.  And when the military came they said,  "Now, these are Gisovu people who have come to attack us."  The soldiers went by this group and told the people of Bisesero to put down their weapons.  And after their weapons had been put down, they told the Bisesero people to go back.  And when we returned we were told by the soldiers to return to our homes.  And on the next morning there was a major attack on Bisesero.
Q.	My question is this, did you kill anybody during your participation in the Gitovu attack?  Did you kill anybody?
A.	I killed nobody, but people saw me at that location and during the gacaca sessions they told me, "We saw you during the Gitovu attacks.  You were amongst those who went from Gishyita to attack Gitovu."  And I said, "Yes, I was there but by the time I arrived people were killed, and the person who saw me there said, "Now, listen, even if you came after the people died, you were present."  And I did confess to this.
Q.	When you went to take part in this attack were you armed?
A.	Yes.  Listen, each and every one had a club with him, otherwise, but then I didn't have any gun, besides, I don't know what is referred to as a grenade.  I never touched or held in my hand a grenade.  We were coerced into going there, and we had to save our skin; otherwise, there were many fighters.  Bandits that were sought by those people were sent and they killed those people at Gitovu.
Q.	Now, did Muhimana participate in the sending of those people, in sending of the group, did he participate?
A.	No, those bandits were sent by the bourgmestre.  There's a certain Mugenero (phonetic) who was the leader of the bandits and who was sent with the bandits, he was the one who was leading the bandits.
Q.	Now, these people were in Muhimana's secteur.  Do you think you want us to believe you, that when you say you were attacked in your house and you don't go to take part, at least to see who is attacking you?  Is that how a person behaves?
A.	I cannot know that those people attacked the commercial centre during the night, and those who attacked at Gitovu went in the morning.
Q.	Was Sikubwabo present at that attack?
A.	Sikubwabo sent people and remained in the communal office.
Q.	Now, when do you recall was Kabanda's head brought to Gishyita centre?  Was it in May-June?
A.	It was in June.
Q.	When the head was brought, did you see any old man, like yourself, called Ndoriyobijya?
A.	Ndoriyobijya used to reside at the commercial centre.  He was an old man, and it is attributed he was present when the head was brought over.  We were there together.
MR. KAPAYA:
The spelling for this name, Your Honour, is N-D-O-R-I-Y-O-B-I-J-W-A -- J-Y-A.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what this man did when the head was brought?
A.	When that head was brought, the old man was present; and before I left we had just -- they had just brought the head up close to the house.  I left and I learnt later that it was that old man who had buried the head, but I don't know where he had buried the head, because I left immediately.
Q.	Did you know that he went and asked for permission from Mika to bury that head?
A.	No, I didn't learn of that.  If Mika is the one who gave him the order or if the person asked permission from him, I am not aware.
Q.	Could it have been normal, according to you, for this man to go and ask for permission from Mika to bury the head?
A.	Why did he have to go and ask for permission from him to bury that head?  It was only a head, it wasn't a whole corpse for him to go and ask for his permission.  Probably he took the head and he went and buried it.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, earlier on, you stated that when Kabanda's head was brought Mika was sitting on his veranda; is that not correct?
THE WITNESS:
That is what I stated.
JUDGE SHORT:
What did Mika do when the head was brought?  What did he do?
THE WITNESS:
Mika was looking on like anyone else.  I don't know any other thing he might have done.
JUDGE SHORT:
You mean he just kept sitting on his veranda, and he paid no attention to the people who had brought the head of Kabanda, he just sat there?
THE WITNESS:
Did you think that he was in a position the stop those people?  Those people were very strong.  There was nothing he could do against them.  Mika had nothing against those people, nothing to do against them.  Probably he himself was thinking that he was going to be killed in order to take away his wife.  What could he do?
JUDGE SHORT:
Your evidence is that Mika just sat on his veranda and he did nothing, he did not get up, he did not say anything to anybody.  That's your evidence?
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him talk to anybody.  Probably he himself was trying to protect himself for fear that his wife be abducted.  His wife remained inside the house, because she was one of those who were targeted.  People wanted to take away his wife.
JUDGE SHORT:
He was the conseiller of the cellule, and he didn't even ask them whose head it is?  He just sat there and saw them?
THE WITNESS:
	When they arrived they were screaming, "We have brought Kabanda's head."  Everybody heard that.  All those who were there heard that.  Subsequently, after seeing that they had brought Kabanda's head, we saw them then partly because they brought Kabanda's head and everybody heard this.  It was not Mika that heard this.
JUDGE SHORT:
And everybody was excited except for Mika, who was sitting on his veranda.
THE WITNESS:
I saw him sitting at his veranda.  I can't say he wasn't there while he was present, or do you think that he could go and prosecute those Interahamwe?
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Did you think he feared if he would intervene he would be targeted?
THE WITNESS:
Well, it is something we assume myself because we saw that with our own eyes.  We saw with our own eyes.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, I would like to refer, Mr. Witness, to a statement which you made before the -- a confession made before the gacaca.   Do you recall making a confession before the gacaca court in January 2001?
A.	I do remember that.
Q.	I'll show you now a document and ask you whether you recognise that.  Can you read it or you want somebody to help you read? 
A.	Please, I'll need to be assisted because I can't read.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you should also have a copy for the court reporter.
THE INTERPRETER:
I have finished, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you affirm that that is the confession that you made before the gacaca court?
A.	That is correct.  I recognise what has been read to me.  That is, indeed, what I did; however, I told you that I had not killed anyone but that I was on the scene, and I was told, "If you were on the scene, then we shall take it that you killed somebody."
Q.	You have shown in this confession you confessed to having killed eight people under part 3.
A.	No, this does not appear in my confession.  Instead you have six people from Gitovu.  I arrived after they had been killed.  Apart from that, I participated in no other attack.
Q.	Witness, there are eight names listed in part 3 of your confession, eight names.  Now, do you know that you have been listed as a category 1 offender by the prosecutor before whom you made the confession?
A.	I did not know this.
Q.	You haven't been told that the prosecutor has accepted your confession and placed you as a category 1 offender and this appears immediately after your fingerprint on the confession?
A.	I did not know this.
Q.	And do you know that a category 1 offender is a person who physically kills or is a ringleader of killers; are you aware of that?
A.	No, I don't know that.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Where is category 1 mentioned?
MR. KAPAYA:
Last one, Madam President, on the original document.  It's under part 9, Your Honour, part 9, the very last page.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, are you saying that the various categories of accused persons and suspects was not explained to you during the gacaca sessions?  You were not given any explanation as to how they were going to categorise those of you who had been arrested and detained?
THE WITNESS:
This was not explained to us.  We were told that we would be placed in different categories when the gacaca court would be operational, and that is what we have still been told.
JUDGE SHORT:
And did they explain to you those who were going to replace -- how they were going to put the people in the various categories, the criteria that was going to be used for placing people in the various categories?
THE WITNESS:
No, we were not told.  We were told that people would be placed in various categories before the gacaca court, after listening to testimonies from the people.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And are you aware that category 1 offenders are liable to the death penalty in Rwanda or life imprisonment?
A.	I don't know this.  We were not told.
Q.	Now, I put to you, Mr. Witness, that if you had not killed -- as you have claimed throughout the morning and this afternoon -- if you had not been a leader of the attackers, you could not have been a category 1 offender; and, therefore, your claim that you didn't kill anybody at Ngoma or Gitovu is a lie, so it is your claim that you didn't see Muhimana taking part in the various attacks.  What do you say to that?
A.	This is what I have to say.  I never made that attack.  People know this.  

Secondly, regarding Muhimana, I cannot commit perjury about him, and I do not recognise that I participated in these attacks.  If I did not see a person in these attacks, I cannot tell lies about it.  I do not wish him to undergo my fate, so I can't say that I saw him.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to be sure that my submission will not be misunderstood by anybody; however, I have a problem with the translation of the document.  Where we read part 6 and we compare what is written on the second paragraph -- we are referring to the English and Kinyarwanda, that is -- from my limited understanding of things, these texts are slightly different.  With your authorisation or with your leave I should like to give greater detail on this.  If I look at the text in English this is what we understand.  

"In an attack in Gitovu in April 1994 in which I played an important role, or in which I participated to an important extent, six were killed."  This is what appears in English.  However, if you look at the Kinyarwanda and you look at the corresponding paragraph you will see that, "In an attack in Gitovu, in the middle of the month of April, six persons died, and I took my share because I was present or because I had arrived."  So, or - "because I was present," rather.   So I do not know whether the Court understands my concern in regard to the semantics in these two texts. 

And, Madam President, I would like to point out that it is the Kinyarwanda text that has the fingerprint of the witness; and whereas the English text has no recognition.
	(Pages 54 to 64 by R. Lear)














	1615H
MR. KAPAYA:
It is true, Your Honour, but also I think if he reads the full paragraph he will come to a sentence which says, "We killed six people."  And the very last one, the last sentence says, "We beat them to death.  We beat them to death." 

So this, as I said, is not in accord with the claim of the witness, and I say, Your Honour, that the witness did not speak the truth when he said they did not participate.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, what about the third paragraph, last but one line?  Can you tell me whether the Kinyarwanda version is any different from the English translation, which reads:  "We killed so many people.  I was using a stick.  We killed many people there, but I do not know who they were because this area was quite far from home."  

What you have got in your Kinyarwanda version, is it any different from this?
MR. SONGA: 
	At this -- in this passage, it is said, "We killed them using clubs, and we beat them to death." This is what my translation of the Kinyarwanda says. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It doesn't have the passage, "I was using a stick"?
MR. SONGA: 
	This is what I have just read, but I used the word "club," Your Honour.  It is the word Umaheri (phonetic) which is used in Kinyarwanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can we ask you to read the entire statement?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I think it is better for the Kinyarwanda interpreter to just interpret this for us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would it be appropriate to give this document to the Kinyarwanda interpreter?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, very appropriate; read it in the record, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, can you give this document to the interpreter.  Can we ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to read out Chapter 6 -- part 6, on page 6. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we are going to try, says the Kinyarwanda interpreter, but the document is poorly drafted.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Try, that is all we are asking.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, go to the document first and then read it.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"In the beginning of the month of June 1994, the bourgmestre, Charles Sikubwabo" --
JUDGE SHORT:
Is it June or April?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"In the beginning of the month of April 1994, the bourgmestre, Charles Sikubwabo, sent two people to come and fetch me in my home; that is to come and fetch from my home ******************** called *********************.  Afterwards, people came, these are ****************************************** -- or ********" corrects the interpreter.  It is difficult to read the part that follows.  

"They took ************ and when we reached the school we found the bourgmestre there who was armed with a gun.  He seized this person who never returned.  I am saying this because these people came to fetch me from my home.  

"During another attack that took place in Migitovu in mid-April 1994, six persons were killed.  Therefore, I played a role in this attack because I was present there.  I was in the company of other persons.  These are the people whose names I remember:  *********************************************.  So we killed these people.  We killed six people.  These are the names of the people we killed: Baltholomew, Jack, Sindayiheba, Myavu, Ruhumuriza and another person called Mathias Muhire.  We killed them using clubs.  We beat them to death.  

"There was another attack that took place in Ngoma.  We went to Ngoma during the attack.  When we arrived there, we found many Tutsis who were more powerful than we were.  The bourgmestre called us.  We met him on our way.  He was carrying soldiers and gendarmes.  There was also Ruzindana who had brought Interahamwe who had come from Bugarama.  So we began to kill using guns.  Many people were killed.  I was killing using a stick.  We killed many people at that place, but I was not able to find out who they were because this area is far from my home."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, are you satisfied with the translation now?
MR. SONGA: 
	It could have been better, but it is better than the version that was given before.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, this is my last question.  I have placed a piece of paper before you; I know you cannot 
read -- I don't know, can you read a name?  This is just a name.
A.	No, I cannot read this name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, can the interpreter help the witness? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Has the name been read to you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	Yes, I know this person.
Q.	Are you related to him; 	just say yes or no?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is he ****************************?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And that is why you have come to testify for Mika, in defense of Mika, partly because of this *****************? 
MR. KAPAYA:
That is all, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I wish to tender the various documents as Prosecution Exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This confession statement of witness, original document in Kinyarwanda dated 4 December 2002 --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- is entered as Exhibit P. 79K, under seal.  And the English -- official English translation is            Exhibit P.  79E, under seal.  And the piece of paper with the name is entered as Exhibit P.  80, under seal.
	(Exhibit Nos. P. 79K, P. 79E admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. P. 80 admitted, under seal) 
MR. KAPAYA:
      Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, any re-examination?
MR. SONGA: 
	No, there is no re-examination, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, Sikubwabo and Mika, were they neighbours?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were neighbours but they were separated by about a kilometre. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are done with your evidence.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  You are free to go now.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, who is your next witness?  Would you bring him in?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Your Honour, we are bringing the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, therefore, you will be referred to as Witness DJ in the court proceedings today.  You also make sure not to disclose your identity.  Now, you will be sworn in.  

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
MR. MJUI:
Witness, kindly stand up, raise up your right hand and repeat the following words after me.
	(Declaration made by Witness DJ in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you read the document placed before you?
THE WITNESS:
I will try, even through my sight is not very good.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go to it quickly, please.
THE WITNESS:
I have finished.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm the information contained therein is correct?
THE WITNESS:
It is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You also verify your signature at the bottom of the page?
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered as Exhibit D.  82 to be admitted under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 82 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA: 
	Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, I would like to say a word.  The witness has expressed his wish to testify in closed session.  Since my application for closed session is not always well understood, I would like the witness to explain why he would like to testify in closed session himself.  

From what I gather, his reasons are always related to security and the position of certain personalities may be called into question.  I will stop here, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, do you have any objection?  It is good to hear him in closed session instead of getting pieces of paper and having his answers on the sheet.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Not for the entirety of his testimony.  I mean, surely, he can arrange his testimony in such a way that the identifying features come out first and then we deal with that in closed and then we move to an open session.  We can't have a blanket closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.
MR. SONGA: 
	That would be my wish as well, but I would like the witness to state what his position is since he had asked for closed session for the entire examination-in-chief.
THE WITNESS:
The reasons for my request that my evidence be given in closed session are as follows:  My safety, as well as that of my family, could be endangered, given the nature of the testimony I am going to give before you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are -- 
THE WITNESS:
I think this could have unfavourable consequences towards me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are in prison.  How could your safety be endangered?
THE WITNESS:
In my country, Rwanda -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- people take delight in prosecution witnesses and not in what defence witnesses say.  That is why it would be proper that my evidence be heard in closed session.  This would be good for myself and for members of my family.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, we understand that.  What is being asked of you is this:  If your identity is not disclosed, if your identity is kept closed, how will people in Rwanda or people everywhere else know who gave that evidence if we don't disclosure your name, we don't disclose where you come from, we don't disclose your appearance, we don't disclose your neighbourhood?  You don't tell us anything which would identify you at all.
THE WITNESS:
In my testimony, I may provide information regarding what I discuss with certain persons, and this could lead to the discovery of the identity of the person who gave that testimony.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When you reach that stage, we will consider your request.  Just put up your hand and tell us that you need to go to closed session.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President, I will try to organise my examination-in-chief such that we could start with questions that could be put to him in open session for which there is no risk, and then we end with questions that raise security concerns for the witness.




WITNESS DJ,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Could you tell us the circumstances under which you learned of President Habyarimana's death?
A.	The day before the president's death -- we learned of his death the day after his death.  I heard about it from people who had heard the announcement over the radio.  They were saying that he had died.
Q.	Can you tell us what the security situation was in your secteur the day after the president's death?
A.	I was in my secteur, but on that day there was no problem.  However, most people were wondering what was going to happen.  They were in a state of suspense.
Q.	In April 1994, did you know a person called Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I knew Mika.
Q.	How did you come to know him?
A.	He was conseiller of Gishyita secteur where I was residing.
Q.	Did you know him since he was conseiller or shortly before then?
A.	I knew him even before because his parents used to live in that secteur.
Q.	As far as you can remember did you also know his family?
A.	Yes, I knew his family.
Q.	Did you know, for instance, his wife?
A.	I knew his wife.
Q.	Did you know his wife's ethnic group?
A.	I knew the ethnic group of his wife.  She was a member of the Tutsi ethnic group.
Q.	In April 1994, did you know Mika's children?
A.	At the time he had two children, two boys.
Q.	Did you also know other persons living under Mika Muhimana's roof?
A.	I knew a girl working in his shop.  She was a niece to his wife.  I do not know very well other children living under his roof.  I know there were two of them, but I do not remember their names.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us what became of Mika's children?
A.	I know that in 1994 the younger of Mika's children took ill.  By the way, he died subsequently.
Q.	In your secteur are there any problems between ethnic groups?
A.	Well, we were the same, we shared everything.  There were marriages between the various ethnic groups.  There were no problems.  I couldn't see any problems.  I do not, by the way, understand how we got to what happened in 1994.
Q.	What happened in your secteur?
A.	After President Habyarimana's death, about the 9th -- or, rather, say the 8th, in the evening, the situation changed in some cellules in our secteur.  People started killing one another.
Q.	Witness, when you say that people started killing one another, can you tell us who were those killing?
A.	In a cellule situated very close to the lake, on the 8th of April, the inhabitants of that cellule came up to our cellule and killed people there.  And other people fled to the commune office.
Q.	Do you know the ethnic group of those who were doing the killing?
A.	The victims were Tutsi -- were of Tutsi origin.  They were killed by Hutus on that night.
Q.	Did the same events occur the following day, still in your secteur?
A.	In our secteur those events stopped on that day.  We did not know war any further.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
A.	I thank you, too.
Q.	Do you know a person called Assiel Kabanda?
A.	He was a man from Bisesero region.  He was a trader in the Gishyita commercial centre.
Q.	Do you know whether he survived the events of 1994?
A.	No, he did not survive the events of 1994.  He died, just like many others.
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which he died?
A.	I do not know the circumstances of his death.  However, one day while I was at the commercial centre, it was in the evening, I saw people who used to work with Obed Ruzindana, who were from Rwamatamu.  They brought down Kabanda Assiel's head, which had been transported in Ruzindana's vehicle.  Those are the only circumstances I am aware of.
Q.	I may not have understood what you said correctly.  When that vehicle brought Kabanda's head, did you see it?
A.	Yes.  That vehicle transported people from Rwamatamu towards Mugonero, and they were heading for Bisesero, the battlefront.  That vehicle came at about 5 p.m.  It was at the commercial centre and I saw Kabanda's head.  And those people hung it up on the window of his house.
Q.	Were they saying anything, those people?
A.	When we witnessed that scene, we were shocked and we fled.  I did not hear them say anything whatsoever.
Q.	Were some of the people who brought that head known to you?
A.	To tell you the truth, I did not know those people.  They were from another commune.  All I knew was that they were transported in the vehicle of someone we knew.  At times, we used to see the owner of that vehicle on board it.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that Mika was in that vehicle, how would you react to that?
A.	If someone made such a statement, it would be a lie.  Mika was not on board that vehicle.  From where I was at the commercial centre in the courtyard, when those people used to come down from Bisesero, Mika was at home in his house.  He was at home.  By the way, he came out and stood on his veranda to observe the scene like everyone else.
Q.	You've made mention to Mr. Mika, saying that you knew him.  Are you in a position to tell us whether you knew his place of work in his capacity as conseiller of the secteur?
A.	In his capacity as conseiller of the secteur, Mika did not have an office.  We started building the office, but the building was not yet completed.  It was the former office of the commune.  It was built with block.  It had been demolished so that the secteur office could be built.  So Mika used to work in his house, in his sitting room.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
A.	Thank you, as well.
Q.	On the 7th of April, the day after President Habyarimana's death, do you remember what happened on that day, the activities you engaged in on that day; that is the day after President Habyarimana's death?
A.	Are you referring to the Wednesday on which he died? 
Q.	If you please, I'm referring to the following day, the day after the president's death?
A.	People did not work on that day.  Everyone was in a state of shock.  We just stayed there.  No one did anything.
Q.	Do you mean that you stayed at home?
A.	No, I did not stay at home; I did not spend the whole day indoors.  Since I lived very close to the commune office, I could move towards the bus stop and then go back home.
Q.	On the 7th of April, did you hear that a meeting in which members of the population participated, took place in the secteur?
A.	No meeting was held on that day.  There was no meeting.
Q.	If a meeting had taken place, would you have been aware of it?
A.	If a meeting involving members of the population had taken place, I would have participated in it.
MR. SONGA: 
	Madam President, I would like to move on to another line of questioning which requires closed session.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before you do that:  Witness, you say if there had been a meeting, you would have participated in it.  And you say there was no -- and, therefore, there was no meeting on the 7th.  Was there any meeting on the 8th? 
THE WITNESS:
To my knowledge, there wasn't.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The 9th.
THE WITNESS:
To my knowledge there were no meetings during that period, otherwise, I would have been aware of them.  You would understand that a meeting to which members of -- all members of the population had been invited could not have taken place without my participating in it, because I wasn't doing anything.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So, when was there next a meeting?
THE WITNESS:
I did not take part in any meeting.  If I said I did, I would be lying.  And if you were to conduct an investigation, you would learn that no meeting was held in our area.  By the way, on the Saturday, that is the 8th -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Microphone off) ... nobody telling people what to do or everything, giving them any instruction?  No authority gave any instruction to the people?
THE WITNESS:
I wasn't there if it had taken place.  I didn't take part in such a meeting, so, I cannot speak on behalf of the entire commune.  I did not take part at such a meeting.  All that I know is that I am not aware that any such meeting was held.
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you saying that there was no meeting in the months of April, May and June?
THE WITNESS:
It was a time of war, beginning from the 9th of April.  The inhabitants of Bisesero came down and attacked Gishyita.  The inhabitants of the zone close to the lake came up.  So there was a war during that period.  When, therefore, could such a meeting have been held?
JUDGE SHORT:
Did any official go around talking to people? 
THE WITNESS:
We did not spend the day with the officials.  If there had been some who had had talks with members of the population, I am not aware of that.  Personally, I do not know because I never held any conversation with such officials.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you never heard that anybody went around talking to people?
THE WITNESS:
Frankly speaking, if I told you that I learned about it, I would be telling you a lie.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor.  

Professor, how long will you take to conclude your evidence?
MR. SONGA: 
	About 30 minutes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll adjourn and resume tomorrow morning at 9:00.
	(Court adjourned at 1704H)
