11

12        2. The events set out hereinafter occurred in the Republic of Rwanda between the 1st of January
13        and the 31st of July 1994.
14

15        The Accused:
16        3. Mikaeli Muhimana was born on the 24th of October 1961 in Gishyita sector, Gishyita commune,
17        Kibuye préfecture and was at all times referred to in this indictment as counsellor for Gishyita sector

20        The Charges: Counts I and II, Genocide, or alternatively, Complicity in Genocide.
21

22        4. At all times referred to in this indictment, there existed in Rwanda a minority ethnic group known
23        as Tutsi, officially identified as such by the government. The major population was comprised of

30   MR. PRESIDENT:
31        Ms. Ben Salimo, looking now at the English version of the indictment, on the first page, under the title,
32        "The Charges" you will see there that in English it reads, "Counts II and I, Genocide, or alternatively,
33        Complicity in Genocide. It is stated, II and I, Genocide, or alternatively Complicity in Genocide.
34

35        If you look at the French version read out by Ms. Ben Salimo, then you see, "Chefs I et II: Génocide
36        ou, subsidiairement, Complicité Dans Le Génocide". I take it, Prosecution, that the French version is
37        correct. So Count I is genocide and Count II is complicity; is that correct?

 6        (c) --
 7   MR. PRESIDENT:
 8        And just for the record, is that there is a very slight difference between the English and French
 9        versions of this indictment, in the sense that in the English it is referred to explicitly, "the Mugonero
10        Catholic Church" in relation to Roman (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), whereas in the French version it follows
11        also, but the last verse in these paragraphs are, "l'église" but of course, this has absolutely no
12        substantive significance, but it is simply noted because what was read out was based on the French
13        version and not exactly the same wording as in the present English indictment.
14

15        Yes, please proceed, Mrs. Ben Salimo.

 1        Jallow.
 2        Thank you, Mr. President.
 3   MR. PRESIDENT:
 4        Thank you, very much, Ms. Ben Salimo.
 5

 6        Now, Mr. Muhimana, we have now read out to you this amended indictment in its updated version.
 7        And I want to make sure that you understand what was read out to you. So this was something that
 8        you have understood, would you please confirm that.
 9   THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
10        Yes, I have understood.
11   MR. PRESIDENT:
12        Thank you very much. Now we will now proceed to the sequence during this hearing when you will be
13        pleading. And I will go count by count. So first I ask you, Count I, Genocide, how do you plead, guilty
14        or not guilty?
15   THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
16        I plead not guilty.
17   MR. PRESIDENT:
18        A plea of not guilty is entered on behalf of the Accused, it's noted.
19

20        Count II, Complicity in Genocide, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty?
21   THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
22        Not guilty.
23   MR. PRESIDENT:
24        Not guilty. Count III, Rape as a Crime Against Humanity; how do you plead, guilty or not guilty?
25   THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
26        I plead not guilty because I did nothing.
27   MR. PRESIDENT:
28        Count IV; Murder as a Crime Against Humanity, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty?
29   THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
30        Not guilty.
31   MR. PRESIDENT:

33

34        In conformity with Rule 62 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, we will then instruct the registrar
35        to set a date for trial. Thank you very much.

 1        1530H
 2   THE ACCUSED MUHIMANA:
 3        Thank you, Mr. President.
 4   MR. PRESIDENT:
 5        So then we have accomplished the task which was the one we had to proceed with today.
 6

 7        Mr. Phillips, did you notice the typing errors in this indictment? First of all, you noted the first one,
 8        namely, the reverse order of Count 1 and 2. That was on page 1.
 9   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
10        Yes, Your Honour.
11   MR. PRESIDENT:
12        Then I didn't find so much on the following pages. Do you have page 4 in front of you?
13   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
14        Your Honour, yes.
15   MR. PRESIDENT:
16        If you look under Count 3 and then at "Particulars," followed by "Events in Gishyita sector," then I
17        think you would wish – that what you mean there is not capital "C" but little "a". You may wish to look
18        into that.
19   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
20        And then on the next page, "Events at Mubuga Parish, Mubuga Sector," I think what you mean there
21        may be little "b", not little "d".
22

23        And then it may well be that in the next paragraph, "Events at the Mugonero Complex," you may wish
24        to reflect whether you do not mean little "a" but little "c", and that would make sense because on
25        page 6, when you come to the "Events in the Bisesero area," you are back to the little "d", and that
26        would be the right sequence.
27

28        Now, this does not, of course, touch on the substance of the indictment. I'm drawing your attention to
29        that in case you want to ensure that everything is tidied up, and I also noted under this "D", where we
30        are now, little Roman iii, it seems to me that in the second line, under Roman iii, where we are talking
31        about an event around June '94, maybe you do not need the word "members" before "armed
32        civilians".
33

34        That's noted, Your Honour.
35   MR. PRESIDENT:
36        Yes. It may also be that "commune" could be written with one "N" and not two "N"s in a couple of
37        places in the indictment, for instance, on page 7, at the bottom there. Now, these are small points,

 1        but I thought I should draw your attention to them.
 2   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 3        I'm grateful, Your Honour.
 4   MR. PRESIDENT:
 5        Yes. Thank you very much. That brings us, in principle, to the end of this initial appearance, and I
 6        would like to thank Professor Songa for having stayed this extra week and being present, together
 7        with the Accused, today.
 8

 9        The only issue I have now is the following: Is there a need today, immediately after this initial
10        appearance, to go into a brief status conference to look at further planning, or is there no need for
11        such a session today? What is the view of the Prosecution in relation to that, please? Any
12        outstanding matters that need discussion today? I mean, the only issue seems to be the question of
13        translation of some Kinyarwandan documents and, of course, the dates for trial, which have to be
14        fixed when we see how the remaining work of translation develops, matters like that, but is there a
15        need for a status conference to discuss this, or can it be done bilaterally by the parties?
16   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
17        We don't think -- we don't require a status conference. My learned friend and I can settle any matters.
18   MR. PRESIDENT:
19        All right. Thank you.
20

21        Is that also the view of the Defence? You will be able to sort this out together in the weeks to come?
22   MR. SONGA:
23        We think so, Mr. President. A status conference immediately would not bring anything new, taking
24        into account the initial appearance which just took place. You did give us instructions in the last
25        status conference that the registry should prepare the urgent work programme. We have made the
26        necessary contact, and the documents have been -- are being processed, so we are waiting for the
27        registry to react so that we can begin our work as soon as possible. Of course, we are in contact with
28        the Prosecutor, and we are ready to meet the Prosecutor as many times as it is necessary to speed
29        up the proceedings.
30   MR. PRESIDENT:
31        Do you intend to file any preliminary motions? Is it possible to have an indication of that now,
32        immediately?
33   MR. SONGA:
34        We do intend to, Mr. President, but it all depends between consultations between myself and the
35        client, but we intend to use the time given to us by the regulations.
36   MR. PRESIDENT:
37        All right. But if you could try to file such motions as quickly as possible, then that would, of course,

 1   speed up matters. So that is a request I'm addressing to you, even if you have deadlines provided by
 2   the Rules.
 3

 4   I thank, then, both parties for their submissions on this point. The reason why I raised it was simply,
 5   since we now have counsel for both sides present in Arusha, it's good to be on the safe side before
 6   he leaves Arusha again. So thank you very much, and have a good weekend.
