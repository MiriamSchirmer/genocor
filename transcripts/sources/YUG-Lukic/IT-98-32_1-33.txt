 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Tanaskovic.
 7                          WITNESS:  VASILIJE VOJINOVIC [Resumed]
 8                          [Witness answered through interpreter]
 9                          Examined by Mr. Tanaskovic: [Continued]
10       Q.   [Interpretation] Good morning, Mr. Vojinovic.
11       A.   Good morning.
12       Q.   Shall we start off from where we were yesterday when you said you
13    had weapons and that you used to go home.  My question was:  Did Mitar
14    Vasiljevic have weapons and if you can remember, what kind of weapon did
15    he have?
16       A.   I don't know whether Mitar had a weapon or not.  In the kitchen
17    where I was and while he was with me, I didn't see it because nobody
18    brought weapons into the kitchen.  I didn't bring my weapons into the
19    kitchen.  There was a sort of storage room.  I would leave my automatic
20    rifle there, then I would go into the kitchen and then when I needed it,
21    when I went home, then I would take it.
22       Q.   You said yesterday that you received those weapons?
23       A.   Yes, I did.
24       Q.   Do you think that the others also received these weapons, signed
25    for them, and were issued with such weapons?

 1       A.   I don't know anything about that.  I asked because I travel for 7
 2    kilometres, I have to go through a wood late at night, and I leave my
 3    house early in the morning.  I was afraid.  The situation was tense.
 4    Luckily nothing ever happened to me, and for a while I did carry it.
 5       Q.   Could you please tell us how you and also how Mitar Vasiljevic,
 6    what kind of a uniform you wore and what kind of a uniform did Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic have, if you had one?
 8       A.   I can't remember because it wasn't really my job to look or to
 9    remember.  I'm a 65-year-old man so I don't remember what kind of a
10    uniform he wore.  I don't remember at all and I'm telling the truth.
11       Q.   What kind of a uniform did you have?
12       A.   In the beginning when we first started work, I had a shirt which I
13    used to work in Belgrade, and I had that at home.  It was a secondhand
14    one.  And I also wore a suit for a while.  After a while, we got those
15    multi-coloured suits.
16       Q.   When you say "later we received," who do you mean?
17       A.   Yes, I mean me.
18       Q.   You told us that occasionally you would go home.
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Did Vasiljevic Mitar also do that?
21       A.   Mitar Vasiljevic used to do that while he was working with us.  He
22    didn't have any transport but he used to go in the evening, he would just
23    report and say, "I have to go and try to stop a car so that I can go home
24    to my children."
25       Q.   Does that mean that there was no organised transport?

 1       A.   That's right.
 2       Q.   If you remember, could you please tell us how long Vasiljevic
 3    stayed in Prelovo in that kitchen?
 4       A.   As far as I remember, he could have stayed for 15 days at the most
 5    while we fixed up the kitchen, brought in the stoves.  He was there to
 6    organise the purchase or how we obtained the stoves, the cleaning.  There
 7    was a lot of broken stuff in the halls and so on.
 8       Q.   You stated yesterday that you prepared food for the lines, for the
 9    positions?
10       A.   Yes, for the positions, that's right.
11       Q.   Could you please tell us, if you can remember, how you took that
12    food out to the lines; lunch, dinner, so on?
13       A.   We sent it in 25 kilo cauldrons that we used for cooking.  And in
14    the evening, we would send packed food, tins, pates, butter, and then in
15    the morning, we would send out tea and little things like that so that
16    they could have a bite of something before lunch.
17       Q.   Besides the dry food that you sent, did you also make any kind of
18    prepared, cooked foods for dinner?
19       A.   If somebody said that they wanted something cooked and something
20    was left  over, we would send it to those who asked for it.  We would also
21    send food a little further out, because the distances were quite long.
22    There were forests there.  So further out we would send preserved meat or
23    milk, things that they could prepare for themselves over there.
24       Q.   To make it a little clearer, was cooked food ever taken out to the
25    lines in the evening?

 1       A.   I don't know.  I don't remember.  Maybe we did take that kind of
 2    food there sometimes, but I forget things like that.  I'm a 65-year-old
 3    person.  I forget a lot of things.
 4       Q.   When we discussed uniforms a little while ago --
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   -- did you have any insignia on your uniforms?
 7       A.   Well, I can tell you, Mitar did wear some kind of insignia.  I
 8    don't know how long or wide it was.  The people from TO ordered him to --
 9    the people who wore those red ribbons were the only persons who could go
10    into the kitchen and work.  Those people who did not have such a ribbon
11    were not allowed to enter into the kitchen, and I think this was for
12    reasons of hygiene.
13       Q.   Who wore those, as you call them, rags?
14       A.   First of all, I had one, and also all the others who help.  I
15    don't know their names.  I don't know the young people, because I spent a
16    lot of time in Belgrade, 24 years.  So I know a few of the older residents
17    there, but I don't know the soldiers who used to come round and those who
18    used to help us out in the kitchen.  I can't remember.  I forget things
19    like that.
20       Q.   Can you describe to us what those strips of fabric looked like and
21    where you put them on your uniform?
22       A.   I was given one, and I wore it on my shoulder.  It was tied right
23    here.  And that's what I did.  But those who went out to the line, what
24    can I tell you?  One day I could see that they wore green ribbons.  The
25    next day they wore red ones.  What that was, I never asked.

 1            I know that we who we were helping out there, we would wear that
 2    when we were helping out in the kitchen.  Also, this goes for persons who
 3    assisted in the kitchen.  And when they no longer worked there, they gave
 4    them back.
 5       Q.   You said a little while ago that Mr. Vasiljevic had something -
 6    I'm not sure exactly how you said it - something wider.
 7       A.   Yes.  Yes.  I remember that he and another person who was in
 8    charge of the sanitary inspections, and Mitar too, because he was sent
 9    there to help us out and to do certain things.  And he did help us a lot.
10    So when we finished all the work in the kitchen, when we set it up and
11    when we started to prepare food, later, Mitar left.
12       Q.   Mr. Vojinovic, that thing that Mitar had, can you please explain?
13    Was that a piece of fabric? a rag?  Was it a ribbon?  Was it something
14    else?
15       A.   Well, it was something that was three fingers wide that he wore
16    around his arm, and it was red.  I don't know what else to say.
17       Q.   I would like to ask you something that comes from your -- what you
18    said yesterday.  Could you please tell us the following -- well, you said
19    now "later, Mitar left."  Where did he go?
20       A.   I don't know anything.  I know about him while we were together at
21    Prelovo.  He would come.  He wore that ribbon which indicated that he was
22    permitted to enter into the kitchen, as well as the others who wore that.
23    After that -- I don't know anything about Mitar after he left Prelovo.
24       Q.   Did you hear anything about what happened to him later?
25       A.   Perhaps after awhile there were stories circulating around that he

 1    had an accident, that he had broken his leg, but I didn't see him when he
 2    broke his leg.  I didn't go to the town.  I was tied to the kitchen.  I
 3    couldn't go because I was responsible in the kitchen for the food.  It
 4    couldn't be late.  It couldn't be late in arriving out in the field and so
 5    on.
 6       Q.   You said yesterday that there were two vans there.  So I would
 7    like to ask you now, at what time do you remember that there were two of
 8    these vans?  And this relates to Prelovo and Blace.
 9       A.   When Mitar left, they gave us a van, a small truck - I can't
10    remember - that we used to transport the food, because these were quite
11    some distances.  The van was from the forestry unit.
12            I just said a van.  I didn't even look at it really.  My
13    assistants would carry the food out and put it inside, and I would stay
14    inside, and I would be preparing the food for people who were around us as
15    well.  Once I took the cauldrons out, I can't remember whether it was a
16    van or a little truck.  It was a small vehicle that you could put
17    cauldrons in in the back.
18       Q.   If I understood you properly, the van that you call a van or a
19    small truck, it came after Mr. Vasiljevic left?
20       A.   Yes, that's right.
21       Q.   Let me ask you now, did you hear or see any army that did not
22    belong to regular army units, something that we call paramilitaries?
23       A.   I don't know anything about that.  I had nothing to do with that.
24    My job was to work in the kitchen, to make sure that everything was on
25    time, because we didn't have electric stoves.  We used wood for burning,

 1    and it wasn't an organised, proper kitchen.  But only because I was an
 2    older military chef.  I did my best.  I had to hurry.  I asked for all
 3    kinds of wood in order to be able to do what I could do.  I never left the
 4    kitchen.  I don't know who was coming and going, what people were doing,
 5    what kind of an army was there, and I really wasn't interested in that.
 6       Q.   You heard that Mr. Vasiljevic was arrested.
 7       A.   Yes, I did.
 8       Q.   How did you feel about that and how did all these people in your
 9    area feel about that?
10       A.   Let me tell you, we were all surprised and we were all sorry.  We
11    were sorry and we were wondering about it and we're still wondering about
12    it today.
13       Q.   Why are you wondering about it?
14       A.   Well, we know Mitar.  He would pass by my house to go to school.
15    I know his parents.  I never heard anything bad about him, not in his
16    youth or at dances.  When I would come home, I never heard that something
17    happened.  Everything was quite usual, and I don't really know.  I know
18    what I know.  There's not much I can say about it.
19       Q.   You say you know both Mr. Vasiljevic and his father.  You know his
20    village.  Could you please tell us your opinion; what kind of a family is
21    this?
22       A.   Mitar comes from a good family, and his whole village, when I
23    happened to be there, when I come from Belgrade, when they celebrate
24    St. George's day, they were very nice people.  We never had any kind of
25    bad relations with them.  His father was a good man, a good householder, a

 1    good worker.  To this very day, he is still running around and working.
 2       Q.   So this news probably surprised you and made you wonder.
 3       A.   Yes, that's right.  Since we know that Mitar, in his youth, never
 4    created any problems in our area, and I can say that.  When we heard about
 5    it, we were surprised.
 6       Q.   I would like to ask you, perhaps, just one more question which I
 7    failed to do in that context when we were talking about that topic.
 8    Yesterday, you mentioned (redacted)?
 9       A.   Yes, I did.
10       Q.   This (redacted), did he drive that, as you call it, van or small
11    truck?  And did (redacted), was (redacted) with you from the beginning 
12    or was it at some other time?
13       A.   Not from the beginning.  He was there later on.  After Mitar left,
14    he came to us.  Where he went later, I don't know, but I know that when
15    Mitar left, because he helped to run things and he helped us about the
16    goods and the cauldrons and the stoves, and he found a way for us to clean
17    the corridors so that they would be clean and that's why he introduced the
18    insignia so that not everybody could come in. This was strictly forbidden.
19    Once he left, then this (redacted) came, his name is (redacted), 
20    and his nickname is (redacted), but I never called him (redacted) I always 
21    called him (redacted).  I am an older man, but perhaps his colleagues 
22    used his nickname (redacted), but I called him (redacted).
23       Q.   When you mentioned (redacted)?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   Did you know him from before or not?
 1       A.   Yes, I did.
 2       Q.   And could you briefly tell us what kind of a man is he?
 3       A.   He's not a bad man.  He's an honest man.  I don't know in which
 4    state he works.  He works there today.  He would come home.  He's a good
 5    host.  He has a nice home, a wife, children.  He's not a very heavy, large
 6    man.  He is from a poor family, but now he has a home of his own.  That's
 7    all I know about him.
 8       Q.   So in your opinion, he's an honest man?
 9       A.   Yes, that's right.
10       Q.   You don't know anything else about him?
11       A.   No.  No, I don't.
12            MR. TANASKOVIC: [Interpretation] Very well.  Thank you very much,
13    I have no further questions.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome.
15            MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.
16                          Cross-examined by Mr. Groome:
17       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Vojinovic, my name is Dermot Groome and I'm
18    representing the Prosecutor, and I will ask you a few questions regarding
19    your testimony.
20       A.   Good morning.
21       Q.   Tell me, how long, all together, did you work in Prelovo?
22       A.   I don't know exactly.
23       Q.   You told us that --
24       A.   Four months, five months.  I don't remember.  I didn't really -- I
25    can't really recall.

 1       Q.   You told us that when you arrived at Prelovo, Mitar Vasiljevic was
 2    already working there; is that correct?
 3       A.   He got there, and I found them there already.  They were cleaning,
 4    washing the windows, cleaning the place where the stoves would be placed
 5    and they positioned them where they were supposed to be.  And we had to
 6    work very quickly because the army was already on the lines and we had to
 7    prepare food for the people to eat.
 8       Q.   Do you know how many days prior to your arrival was Mitar
 9    Vasiljevic working in Prelovo?
10       A.   I don't know, maybe three or four days before, maybe even
11    earlier.  I didn't ask him when he came and when he started to set up the
12    kitchen in a classroom.  We cleaned it, we set things up, and so on.
13       Q.   And the crew that worked there, let me ask you, yourself, were you
14    considered a member of the Territorial Defence or simply a civilian that
15    was assisting in the preparation of meals?
16       A.   I didn't understand you very well.
17       Q.   Well, when you were working in Prelovo, were you considered a
18    member of the TO or were you simply considered a civilian, ordinary
19    person, helping out by cooking?
20       A.   How shall I explain?  I worked in Belgrade, and then I came to the
21    sixth anniversary of my mother's death which we were marking, and they
22    were asking for cooks, people to work in the kitchen, and then I was
23    mobilised in the kitchen because I was still on the record as being a
24    member of the Visegrad military recruits rather than the Belgrade list.
25    So I was asked to stay because I was still in their military records.

 1            I couldn't go back to my work.  I had to stay.  I don't know how,
 2    in which way they kept their records.
 3       Q.   Now, did you receive an official mobilisation order from the
 4    Territorial Defence?
 5       A.   Some soldiers came by and they said, "Vojinovic, they are telling
 6    you to report to Belgrade to the kitchen and to be there to be in charge
 7    of the shift for cooking.  They don't have a chef.  They can't find
 8    anybody."  I, as an experienced cook, had a lot of experience because I
 9    worked in Belgrade in the catering industry, in the restaurant business,
10    and that's how I ended up staying.
11       Q.   Can you tell us, at approximately what time each day did you
12    finish preparing the meal at midday?
13       A.   Around 11.00, we would finish lunch.  That was supposed to go to
14    the lines.  By the time it reached the lines, it would be about 1.00 or
15    even later, depending on the vehicles.  The roads were bad and so on.  You
16    couldn't really drive quickly because it's a macadam road.  There's a lot
17    of gravel and so on.
18       Q.   Now, you've told us about some vans that were used.  Did you ever
19    see a red van that was missing its muffler and made quite a bit of noise?
20    Did you ever a see van like that when you were at Prelovo?
21       A.   The one that we used, is it?
22       Q.   Well, the van that you used, was it a red van that didn't have a
23    muffler?
24       A.   I think it was red, but -- but truth to tell, I forget.  I don't
25    really remember.  I didn't really try to memorise it, and it was a long

 1    time ago.  So I mean, I want to say here how it was, but I cannot say that
 2    I know something when I don't.  I'm telling you the truth, and I'll tell
 3    you all that I know and that will be the truth.
 4       Q.   All we ask of you today is just your best memory, and I would ask
 5    you, would your best memory today be that one of vans was a small, red
 6    van?
 7       A.   Well, it was quite small, smaller than a proper van that belonged
 8    to the forestry department, I mean the one which took the forestry
 9    commuting workers.
10       Q.   And your memory of this van is that it was red; is that correct?
11       A.   I think so.
12       Q.   And do you have any memory of it today as being loud when it was
13    used, as if it did not have a muffler on it?  Did you have any memory of
14    that?
15       A.   I don't know.  It was down on the road.  There was a school down
16    there, but it was very muddy, so it never came near, and I can't really
17    remember.  So I can't really tell you what colour it was.  I can't -- I
18    can't be sure.  I can't remember.
19       Q.   Now, you've told us that the roads that this van would travel on
20    were in very poor condition; is that correct?
21       A.   Yes, that is correct.  And the road is still in a very poor shape
22    because it's macadam.  Nobody takes care of it.
23       Q.   Would it be the type of road that when driving on it would be
24    possible, especially if there was weight in the vehicle, for the bottom of
25    the vehicle to scrape along the ground or the road?  Was the road in that

 1    poor condition?
 2       A.   Well, it depended on the vehicle.  If it was a foreign vehicle,
 3    perhaps if it is very low, then it is possible that it comes -- that it
 4    hits all those rocks and stones there.
 5       Q.   Now, I want to ask you a question about the armband that Mitar
 6    Vasiljevic wore.  Do you remember whether there was any insignia on that
 7    armband?
 8       A.   Upon my word, I don't remember.  We were all very upset, and with
 9    all that haste -- and I'm telling you the truth.  It was all hurry, hurry,
10    hurry.  So I didn't really want to know.  Why did I want to look at them,
11    what they had?  My concern was -- my only worry was to prepare this food,
12    to think what to cook, how to do it.  Nothing was -- had been put in
13    order, so it all had to come out of my head; that is, I had to think up
14    meals and all that, and I didn't really pay much attention.  It never
15    occurred to me.  Only I know that he had it, and we who came there and who
16    helped there, he gave it to us, and he also entered the kitchen.  So
17    perhaps to avoid somebody telling you, "How can you enter the kitchen
18    without these markings?"  So perhaps he put it on himself, or perhaps the
19    Territorial Defence issued him with that to show how things should be
20    done.
21       Q.   I want to ask you now about the time that the kitchen was moved
22    from Prelovo to the village of Blace.  The first question I'd like you to
23    ask -- or I'd like to ask is:  Can you tell us where the village of Blace
24    is in relation to the village of Rujiste?  How close are those two
25    villages?

 1       A.   The village of Blace?  I come from Blace.  The kitchen was at
 2    Blace, outside, and it had a tin roof.  Then we were complaining because
 3    we were attacked by flies, and there were no disinfectants or anything.
 4    We were afraid, too, that we might poison the troops.  Then we were given
 5    a building.  Well, it was a derelict one, because after all, it was a war
 6    and all that.  But then we moved over and put it in order and got the
 7    water supply so that we could wash the spoons to avoid any infection of
 8    the troops.  And I was the one who organised it mostly, to have always hot
 9    water, because we could not really get all the wood and cook it.  And then
10    one had to wash the cloth, all the rags and all the napkins and all the
11    cloths, but that -- we put it all in order.
12       Q.   Mr. Vojinovic, can you give us some idea of how far apart are the
13    villages of Rujiste from your village of Blace?  How far apart are they?
14       A.   Oh.  Well, Rujiste is further from Klasnik.  Klasnik is much
15    closer to Blace, where we were.
16       Q.   Can you approximate in kilometres how far Rujiste would be from
17    Blace?
18       A.   I'd say about 5 kilometres, because it's all uphill.  You leave
19    Blace and then you go uphill and downhill, and there is forest and
20    streams.  It's not easy to get there.
21       Q.   Can you help us and tell us, when was the kitchen moved to Blace?
22       A.   I don't remember anything about any month.  I don't know.  I don't
23    remember.  I don't remember.  But it was quite hot, and if you'll pardon
24    my expression, there were hosts of flies.  So there was nowhere to put
25    meat because they were there, and all our cooking utensils.  And I had to

 1    cover it all with some tin plate to avoid the infection of the troops.
 2    And we didn't know how to overcome that, and that is how they eventually
 3    sent us up there, and that is where we started to work.
 4       Q.   Let me ask you this:  Are you familiar with the feast, the
 5    Orthodox feast of the Holy Trinity?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   Are you able to tell us whether the kitchen was moved to Blace
 8    before or after the feast of the Holy Trinity?
 9       A.   I don't know.  Upon my soul, the dates and the memory, I can't
10    tell you anything about this to anyone because I'm slightly upset, and my
11    heart is not quite all right.  And so -- but I'm telling you all the
12    truth, what I know.  That is how that was.  But something else, anything
13    else, I'm not going to say except what I know.
14       Q.   Let me ask you this:  From your testimony, it seems that aside
15    from your contact with Mr. Vasiljevic while he was working at Prelovo, at
16    the times that he was not at Prelovo, you had no contact with him; is that
17    correct?
18       A.   It is correct.  I didn't see him.  It could have been perhaps a
19    month or so later that in the kitchen, passing by, I heard, you know,
20    "Mitar Vasiljevic broke his leg and he's gone to Uzice to the hospital."
21    But I don't know where that was.  I never saw him again.  I knew nothing
22    about this.  My duties were in the kitchen.
23            And about all the rest of it, I know nothing.  All I was thinking
24    about was to see that the troops did not get infected, and we were very
25    strict about that.  And as far as that is concerned, I fared well.  We had

 1    no problem with disease, with anything dirty and so.
 2       Q.   So it's a fact, is it not, that you really aren't able to tell us
 3    anything at all about what Mitar Vasiljevic may have done after he left
 4    Prelovo; is that correct?
 5       A.   I didn't quite get what you meant.  I missed a word in your
 6    question.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  It's apparent anyway, is it not?
 8            MR. GROOME:  I'm putting it to the witness, Your Honour, by ...
 9       Q.   Aside from the time that you had contact with Mr. Vasiljevic in
10    Prelovo, you're not able to tell us anything about what Mr. Vasiljevic was
11    doing after he left Prelovo; correct?
12       A.   Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I know nothing further.  He left,
13    didn't come to see us.  I only worked in the kitchen.  I know nothing
14    about anything else; who, where, what.  I did that all like that from the
15    beginning to the end.
16       Q.   Did there ever come a time when you were at Lalce that you became
17    aware of Mr. Lindo breaking his leg?
18       A.   Lindo broke his leg before the war, as far as I can remember, in
19    the company that he worked at.  Something like that.  As far as I can
20    remember.
21       Q.   Did ever there come a time when you heard about a house burning in
22    the Mahala section of Visegrad on Pionirska Street in which a large number
23    of people from Koritnik died?  Did there ever come a time when you heard
24    about that incident?
25       A.   The first time I hear about it from you.  I didn't know that.  The

 1    first time I hear about it.
 2       Q.   Now, Mr. Tanaskovic has asked you a number of questions regarding
 3    a person by the name of (redacted) and the question that I have for you is
 4    when you made a statement to Mr. Tanaskovic in August of 2000, you did not
 5    mention (redacted) in that statement, did you?
 6       A.   No, I didn't.  I forgot to mention him because, what shall I say,
 7    I know we were in the van, but it slipped my mind.  It just slipped my
 8    mind.  But he was -- sure, when Mitar left Prelovo, then they gave us that
 9    one to help us out.
10       Q.   Well, now, when is the first time that you and Mr. Tanaskovic
11    talked about this person (redacted)?
12       A.   I don't remember ever talking with him.
13       Q.   So you and Mr. Tanaskovic -- well, how many times have you spoken
14    to Mr. Tanaskovic in preparation for your testimony yesterday and today?
15       A.   I never talk with him until that time when I made my statement in
16    Visegrad.
17       Q.   And after that, after you remembered about (redacted), did you
18    contact Mr. Tanaskovic and tell him that you had remembered that there was
19    another person working at Prelovo by the name of (redacted)?
20    A.   I don't know.  A soldier?  Soldier (redacted) or that (redacted), the
21    driver.
22       Q.  The (redacted) that you've told us about today.  I'm trying to find
23    out when is the first time you spoke with Defence about remembering this
24    person by the name of (redacted)?
25       A.   I don't remember ever talking about him until today.

 1    Q.   So until Mr. Tanaskovic asked you yesterday about (redacted), you had
 2    never before been asked about Mr. (redacted); is that correct?
 3       A.   Yes, correct, correct.  It is correct.
 4       Q.   Are you aware that by a court order, you were given a guarantee
 5    that you would not be arrested during the time that you are here in The
 6    Hague giving your testimony?  Were you aware of that fact?
 7       A.   I did not hear that word from anyone.  No, I didn't.  I didn't
 8    hear that.
 9       Q.   Did you ever ask anyone if you could have such a guarantee before
10    you would come and testify in The Hague?
11       A.   What's the word that you used?  I don't understand that word.
12    What did you say.
13       Q.   Did you ever say to anyone that, "I will only go and testify if
14    I'm promised that I won't be arrested while I'm there."  Did you ever make
15    that request to anybody?
16       A.   Nothing, nobody told us anything about that.  We only got that
17    report to come here on such and such date.  But as for that, nobody told
18    us anything.  I didn't know anything.
19            MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Mr. Vojinovic.  I don't have any further
20    questions for you.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Any re-examination, Mr. Tanaskovic?
22            MR. TANASKOVIC: No.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, sir, for coming to give evidence and for
24    the evidence that you have given.  You are now free to leave.
25                          [The witness withdrew]
 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, whilst we're waiting for the next witness, I
 2    have before me here page 2.434 of yesterday's transcript when Mr. Lindo
 3    was asked to read from his statement, the original B/C/S statement.  At
 4    the time, I had the impression that he was not exactly reading as telling
 5    us what he had intended to say.
 6            The particular sentence in issue which everybody was interested in
 7    he read out as follows, according to the English translation:  "He was a
 8    sort of health inspector because he had an armband with a sign.  It is the
 9    ribbon of the Red Cross."
10            Now, that, of course, was different to the English translation,
11    the official English translation which was provided to the Prosecution of
12    his B/C/S statement.  Bearing in mind that there are many disputes in
13    cases here about translations, I asked to have that particular statement
14    from the B/C/S checked by the translation people, and they have come back
15    with a revised partial translation.  I've got copies of it, but I'll read
16    it for you, "Vasiljevic made sure the kitchen was clean, took care of the
17    food, et cetera, and was like some kind of sanitation inspector since he
18    wore an armband with a medical or red cross marking."
19            I will provide you with that because I think that it is a matter
20    of some importance in relation to that witness's evidence about what he
21    saw the accused wearing and I'll leave it for you, the parties to do what
22    they wish in relation to it.
23            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, may I ask what has been the practice in
24    the past when there have been various different translations, does the
25    Court decide on ...

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, we have to decide in the end and they have to
 2    be before us officially as exhibits.  This is a revised partial
 3    translation by the official translators.  It is, if I may say so, a
 4    terrible problem not only with the B/C/S languages but also sometimes with
 5    the French and the English, but probably there is a slightly loose usage of
 6    words which can be interpreted in different ways.
 7            But I think that it makes it fairly clear that the witness was not
 8    reading precisely from his statement at the time, because the translation
 9    which we received is different to everything.  Not perhaps in substance
10    too much, but nevertheless, it is different.  It was because I had hoped
11    that he would read it and we would get these interpreters' translation of
12    it that I was concerned that he clearly was not reading it from the way in
13    which he was interpolating his own recollection and to some extent a
14    self-justification.
15            Now, that's one matter I want to raise at this stage.  The other
16    matter relates to this issue of doctors.
17            At the end of your cross-examination, Mr. Groome, you put to the
18    accused this, and I'm reading from 2240 of the transcript:
19                     Q.   Mr. Vasiljevic, isn't it true that you did not break
20                          your leg falling from a horse but that you broke
21                          your leg on the steep and slippery bank of the creek
22                          by the house that was on fire?
23            Mr. Vasiljevic then answered:
24                     A.   I don't know if I've understood you.  You say I
25                          broke the leg by the house that was set on fire.

 1            And the question was repeated:
 2                     Q.   I'm asking you, isn't it a fact, isn't the truth
 3                          that you broke your leg slipping during the
 4                          commission of the crime against those people when
 5                          you went around the back of the house and you fell
 6                          on the steep and slippery bank of the creek?
 7            To which Mr. Vasiljevic replied:
 8                     A.   That is a pure fabrication, sir.
 9            Now, it seems to me, Mr. Groome, that the case of the Prosecution
10    has altered somewhat.  It's not a question of whether that he was ever in
11    hospital in Uzice and for some weeks having his broken leg treated, but
12    the issue is when he broke his leg, which of course also involves where.
13    And the Prosecution -- I'm sorry, the Defence have something like eight
14    witnesses to come along to say he was at the hospital in Uzice.
15            Now, I think we're going to have to sort out what is the real
16    issue in this case about this, because if we have to listen to eight
17    witnesses coming along simply to say he was in hospital at Uzice when the
18    Prosecution's case is not that he wasn't or that it wasn't a reasonable
19    possibility that he was but simply that if he did break his leg, it was at
20    a different time of day and at a different place, but it nevertheless
21    happened on that day.
22            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm not exactly clear on what you're
23    asking me --
24            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm asking you what your case is.  Because if your
25    case is simply that if he did break his leg it was at a different time of

 1    day, so that there is still -- you can still establish that he was at the
 2    house, then we do not need eight people from the Uzice hospital to say he
 3    spent some weeks in that hospital.
 4            MR. GROOME:  I apologise.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, let's go back to it.  The Prosecution has to
 6    establish, as part of its case, at least on one version of its case, that
 7    he was at the Pionirska Street fire.  That's the way you put that highest
 8    part of your case.  You put an alternative that if we weren't satisfied
 9    beyond reasonable doubt about that, he nevertheless participated in the
10    whole business at some earlier stage of the day.  But let's take your
11    highest case, that he was at the house that was burnt and at the time it
12    was burning in Pionirska Street.
13            Now, in answer to that case, the accused raises an alibi.  He has
14    no burden of proof in relation to that alibi.  He simply has to be able to
15    point to the evidence.  And he points to evidence that he was admitted
16    into hospital, first of all in the local hospital, and then he was
17    transferred to the Uzice hospital.  And he says he broke his leg, and
18    there's going to be some evidence to support what he said, apparently,
19    that he broke it during the course of the afternoon and, therefore, could
20    not have been at the house at the time it was burning.
21            Now, if there is a reasonable possibility that he was injured
22    earlier in the afternoon, then clearly we cannot be satisfied beyond
23    reasonable doubt that he was at the house at the time it was burning.  You
24    bear the onus of proving that notwithstanding the evidence he produces,
25    that he was at the house at the time it was burning.

 1            Now, the Defence have nominated, I think it is eight witnesses,
 2    which are there to meet Dr. De Grave's evidence that the man whose leg was
 3    X-rayed at the Uzice hospital is not the accused.  It seems, from what was
 4    said yesterday, that there is some doubt about Dr. De Grave's evidence.
 5    You referred to the fact that you'd given a report to Mr. Domazet for him
 6    to use for whatever purpose he wishes.  He has described it as having a
 7    considerably different result to Dr. De Grave's evidence.
 8            Now, I think that we are entitled to know what is the Prosecution
 9    case in the light of your cross-examination of the accused, where you put
10    to him that he broke his leg not riding a horse during the afternoon but
11    slipping down the greasy slope between the two houses at the time the
12    house was burning.
13            What is the Prosecution case?
14            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the Court has heard not only
15    Dr. De Grave say that the X-rays did not match but also that the break was
16    consistent -- the break that he saw on Mr. Vasiljevic was consistent with
17    somebody slipping and falling on such a steep embankment.  The Court has
18    also heard from three witnesses that mister -- one witness placing
19    Mr. Vasiljevic directly behind the house, at the time of the fire, on that
20    steep embankment.  Also, from another -- at least one other witness that
21    he was by the Omeragic house as the people were transferred there and from
22    several other witnesses who put him there at the time that the fire
23    began.
24            The Court would be entitled to assess their credibility and infer,
25    I believe, that Mr. Vasiljevic was in fact there and that the explanation

 1    for his broken leg was that something happened during the course of the
 2    crime in which he broke his leg and then was subsequently treated at Uzice
 3    hospital.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  But is this because you are not going to attempt to
 5    establish that there was no reasonable possibility that he broke his leg
 6    and was in the Uzice hospital?
 7            MR. GROOME:  I'm going to attempt to establish that he was not in
 8    Uzice hospital at the time that the fire -- that the actual fire was set
 9    and those people were burnt to death.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  So it's an issue of time, not that he was there.  You
11    see, if we accept Dr. De Grave's evidence, then clearly it was not
12    Mr. Vasiljevic who was in the hospital at all, and it's in answer to that
13    case that these eight witnesses are going to be brought along to say that
14    he was there.  But your case seems to have changed so that the issue is
15    not whether he was there at all but what time did he get there.  And if
16    that is so, it would be a complete waste of time for the Defence to bring
17    eight witnesses to say that he was there for some weeks having his leg
18    treated.
19            MR. GROOME:  I guess I'm thinking what is the alternative.  What
20    is the Court seeking from me.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm asking you what your case is.  Now, I don't want
22    to say that again.  That's the third time I've put it to you.
23            MR. GROOME:  I think I've articulated what the Prosecution case is
24    regarding Defence witnesses.  The Prosecution certainly isn't prepared to
25    stipulate or agree that Mr. Vasiljevic was in the hospital at 9.30 that

 1    day.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  No, no.  I'm not asking you to.  I'm asking you
 3    whether it is necessary, in order to meet your case, for them to bring
 4    eight witnesses who will simply say he spent four weeks or some particular
 5    period of time at the Uzice hospital.
 6            MR. GROOME:  I don't see how I can answer that question, Your
 7    Honour.  I know that the doctors that are coming are not the doctors who
 8    filled out the medical records.  I know certain things --
 9            THE INTERPRETER:  Slow down, Mr. Groome, please.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  That point is -- you're being asked to slow down.  No
11    doubt we are not pausing between our responses.
12            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, could I ask this?  Could I just ask for
13    a few minutes to think about this, and maybe at the end of the session or
14    at the beginning of the next session, maybe we can discuss it further.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  Certainly, Mr. Groome.  I don't want to put you
16    on a spot if you want to think about it.  But it seems to me, at least,
17    that it will be a complete waste of time for the Defence to bring along
18    eight witnesses to say that he spent this time at the hospital if you are
19    putting a case that he got there much later than he said he was and he
20    could still have been at the house at the time it was burning.
21            In those circumstances, the only doctors who would need to be
22    called would be those -- or nurses who could say they saw him there at a
23    particular time, and perhaps his uncle who is going to be called, as I
24    recall, to explain that they stopped off along the way for a drink on the
25    way to Uzice, and probably the ambulance driver who took him to the local

 1    hospital.
 2            But we are not here just to allow people to play games.  We are
 3    entitled to insist upon the real issue being litigated.  And if the real
 4    issue does not include a Prosecution case that it could not have been
 5    Mr. Vasiljevic at the hospital at all, as it started out to be, then there
 6    would obviously be a great savings of time if the statements by these
 7    doctors, et cetera, were tendered and they didn't have to be brought
 8    here.
 9            Now, that's what I'm trying to do, is to bring the parties down to
10    a real issue in the case.  Unfortunately, for too long this Tribunal has
11    allowed the parties to have their heads and just fight anything, but the
12    Rules have been altered, and we are entitled to insist upon the real issue
13    being litigated.
14            Now, it's up to the Prosecution, then, to tell us now what they
15    see to be the real issue about the entry by Mr. Vasiljevic into the
16    hospital.
17            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Of course, a very loud inference can be drawn from
19    the statement that you have sent your new expert's report on the X-ray to
20    Mr. Domazet for him to do what he wishes with it.
21            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, rather than the Court draw any inference
22    from my statement, I would be happy to provide the report to the Court.  I
23    didn't because it seems to me that until it was in evidence, it would have
24    been inappropriate to put --
25            JUDGE HUNT:  But you're required to file them 21 days in advance.

 1    We obviously see them before the witnesses are called.
 2            MR. GROOME:  I'll have a copy to that after the next session, Your
 3    Honour.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Very well.
 5            MR. GROOME:  I can tell you exactly what is in the report now if
 6    the Court wishes.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  What is in the report?
 8            MR. GROOME:  The report is an inconsistent finding.  The report
 9    says that the small bone in the leg was not broken on the X-ray but that
10    the break in the large bone is compatible with the healed fracture of
11    Mr. Vasiljevic's bone.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  That's a very different case then, isn't it?
13            MR. GROOME:  I'm not sure, Your Honour.  I still want to speak to
14    the expert and study -- and speak with him.  The report is very brief and
15    very conclusionary.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  If that's so, we will certainly give you every
17    opportunity to consider what your case is, but you can see if Dr. De
18    Grave, whose evidence was not produced with ease, to say the least of it,
19    if he is not going to be relied upon because there's a reasonable doubt as
20    to the accuracy of his report or his evidence, then the case is very
21    different, isn't it, and there will be no need for the Defence to prove
22    simply that he was in hospital and we will save eight witnesses, which is
23    about a week's work.
24            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  All right.  Have we got the other witness?
 1                          [The witness entered court]
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, sir, will you please make the solemn declaration
 3    in the document that the court usher is showing you.
 4            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the
 5    whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
 6                          WITNESS:  DRAGAN SIMIC
 7                          [Witness answered through interpreter]
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  Sit down, please, sir.  Yes, Mr. Domazet.
 9            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
10                          Examined by Mr. Domazet:
11       Q.   [Interpretation] Good day, Mr. Simic.
12       A.   Good day.
13       Q.   Could you please tell the Court your particulars, your first and
14    last name, where you are from?
15       A.   My name is Dragan Simic and I was born in Visegrad in a village
16    close to Visegrad called Haluga.
17       Q.   How old are you?
18       A.   I was born on November 26, 1950.
19       Q.   And what is your profession, Mr. Simic?
20       A.   I am a school teacher.
21       Q.   Were you a school teacher in 1992?
22       A.   I was.
23       Q.   Since when have you been living in Visegrad, Mr. Simic?
24       A.   I was born in Visegrad, if that's what you mean.
25       Q.   You said you were born in a village near Visegrad and that you

 1    live in Visegrad and I thought, perhaps, that you moved to Visegrad
 2    later.
 3       A.   Yes.  I lived in another village in the village of Prelovo because
 4    of my work.  That's where I -- I worked in a school in that area, and then
 5    I moved to Visegrad in 1992 in December.
 6       Q.   Mr. Simic, do you know Mitar Vasiljevic?
 7       A.   Yes, I do.
 8       Q.   Is that person in the courtroom right now?  Did you recognise
 9    him?
10       A.   I don't see him at the moment.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I can see him.
11    He's there behind you.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we can all agree that he has now identified
13    the accused.
14            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
15       Q.   Can you tell us, Mr. Simic, how long have you known Mitar
16    Vasiljevic, since whence do you know him?
17       A.   I came to work in that area in 1969 so that means that I know him
18    from 1971 approximately.  I don't remember exactly.
19       Q.   Could you please tell us, Mr. Simic, something about 1992, about
20    the period which you probably remember?  Was the Uzice Corps in Visegrad
21    at that time?
22       A.   Yes.  It was in Visegrad sometime until perhaps the 19th or the
23    20th of May, and then it left.
24       Q.   What happened in that period, Mr. Simic, before the Uzice Corps
25    arrived in Visegrad?

 1       A.   It was a turbulent time.  The situation was tense.  People on both
 2    sides were arming themselves.  I don't know what to tell you.
 3       Q.   During the time that the Uzice Corps was in Visegrad, was the
 4    situation better or worse?
 5       A.   With the arrival of the Corps, the situation calmed down.  I even
 6    went to my own house.  I think I continued to work in the school in that
 7    area.  I don't know for how long, maybe for 10 or 15 days, but I think
 8    that schools started to work again and the situation became a little
 9    calmer.
10       Q.   Which school did you work in, Mr. Simic?
11       A.   I worked in the elementary school Zelimir Djuric Zeljo in
12    Prelovo.  Actually, it was an outpost of the school in Kamenica.
13       Q.   What happened, particularly with you, after the Uzice Corps left?
14       A.   With the departure of the Uzice Corps, I received a call to report
15    to the school and I was allocated to a unit there because I was in
16    communications in the army.  I received the same duties then.
17       Q.   Mr. Simic, when you say, "I was told to report to the school,"
18    which school do you mean?
19       A.   To the building of the elementary school at Prelovo.
20       Q.   The building where the school was, was it used as a school at that
21    time or was it used for some other purpose?
22       A.   I can't remember.  I can't remember that.  It was a long time
23    ago.  I know that we worked for a while, but I don't know up until when.
24    I'm not able to say that right now.
25       Q.   It's possible that I didn't formulate my question properly.  Since

 1    you said that you were told to report to a school, you're a teacher, did
 2    you report to the school in order to teach or for some other reason?
 3       A.   Oh, I understand now.  I didn't come to work.  I came to report
 4    there just like the other people did who were mobilised.
 5       Q.   So it was a mobilisation, it was a call-up in accordance with
 6    which you reported to the school in Prelovo?
 7       A.   Yes.  We all reported there.
 8       Q.   Do you remember the people who were with you at the school at that
 9    time, that first day that you reported there for your call-up?
10       A.   It would be a long list.  There were many of us, perhaps 150.  I
11    don't remember exactly how many.
12       Q.   I want to ask you specifically this:  The kitchen that served the
13    mobilised people, was it set up there in Prelovo?
14       A.   Yes, that's right.  The kitchen was there and there was also a
15    small first aid unit.
16       Q.   So who was there in those first days?  Who was there in the
17    kitchen and around the kitchen, in the kitchen itself, supplying the
18    kitchen, doing cleaning duties and so on?
19       A.   Vojinovic Vaso was there, Dragisa Lindo, Mitar Vasiljevic, Obren
20    Vojnovic, and another person, Mitrasin, I can't remember his last name
21    right now, Glisic.
22       Q.   Could you tell us briefly what you know or saw that a particular
23    person's duties were at that time?  Let's start with Vaso Vojinovic who
24    you mentioned.
25       A.   Vaso Vojinovic was a cook there.  He was preparing food for the

 1    soldiers.  I think that he was probably called up because he was most
 2    probably a cook in the army so that's why.
 3       Q.   And Dragisa Lindo?
 4       A.   Dragisa Lindo was a helper.  He would distribute food, peel
 5    potatoes, sort the beans.  He was a helper.
 6       Q.   And Mitar Vasiljevic?
 7       A.   Mitar Vasiljevic was also a cook, but I'm not exactly sure whether
 8    he cooked or whether he helped, but I know that he used to go and get the
 9    food supplies in a van that we had.  He would bring the supplies and then
10    he would also go out into the field to distribute the food.
11       Q.   And Obren Vojinovic whom you mentioned, what did he do?
12       A.   Obren Vojinovic drove the van, and he used to drive that same van
13    in the forestry department before the war, and that's why he was assigned
14    to that duty.
15       Q.   You're saying that he was a professional driver in the forestry
16    department before the war?
17       A.   Yes, that's right.
18       Q.   When you say the forestry department, what is that?  Is that a
19    company or some other institution?
20       A.   It's a company that cultivates and preserves and also deals with
21    forest exploitation.  They deal with forestation, also protection from
22    fires and so on.
23       Q.   So Obren Vojinovic was a driver at the forestry department before
24    the war, and he drove the van then that he used to drive in Prelovo at
25    that time.  Does that mean that the vehicle was also requisitioned for

 1    those purposes?
 2       A.   Yes, precisely.
 3       Q.   When you mentioned a little while ago as one of Mitar's duties to
 4    go with the van to get food supplies, did you mean that he used that van
 5    or another van?  Are you saying that Mitar Vasiljevic drove that van?
 6       A.   No, no.  We would go to get supplies from the town using that van,
 7    and we used that van as well in order to distribute food.  And the only
 8    person who drove the van was Obren Vojinovic.
 9       Q.   Do you know where they would go with the van to get the food
10    supplies?
11       A.   They used to go to town, to Visegrad.  I think there was a kind of
12    central warehouse for all that, all of that area.  That's what I think, at
13    least.
14       Q.   You said that you were called up and told to report to this school
15    in Prelovo.  Do you know if this was also the case for all the other
16    people that you just mentioned?
17       A.   They were all called up and told to report there, all of them.
18    Probably all of them were born in that area, and that is probably the
19    reason why they were told to report precisely where they were told to
20    report.
21       Q.   Did you personally wear a uniform at that time?
22       A.   Yes, I did.  I had a uniform of the former JNA.
23       Q.   What kind of a uniform was that?
24       A.   It's a uniform of the SMB colour; a shirt, trousers, and there was
25    also a cap, a hat.  Some took that hat, and some did not.

 1       Q.   Did you get that uniform when you got to Prelovo or did you have
 2    it at your house as a member of the reserve forces?
 3       A.   I had the uniform from earlier on.  I had signed for it because I
 4    was a member of the reserves.
 5       Q.   Was it usual at that time for JNA reservists to keep that uniform
 6    at home?
 7       A.   A certain number of people did keep it at home, maybe everybody
 8    who was in the reserves, but not everybody who had reported there had a
 9    uniform.  Many of them arrived wearing civilian clothes.
10       Q.   Do you remember whether Mitar Vasiljevic was wearing a uniform the
11    first time you saw him?
12       A.   Yes.  He was wearing the same uniform.  I don't think he was
13    wearing any kind of cap or hat, but I'm not sure.
14       Q.   When you say, "The same kind of uniform," do you mean the uniform
15    that you had, the uniform of the former JNA, the SMB, the olive-grey
16    colour?
17       A.   Yes, yes.  That's what I mean.  The olive-grey coloured uniform of
18    the former Yugoslav army.
19       Q.   When you saw him for the first time then, did you notice if he had
20    any weapons with him?
21       A.   I don't know whether I noticed him on the first day or the second
22    day, but he did have a weapon.  I think it was an automatic rifle.  I
23    don't know whether it was a German or a Russian weapon, but I know that we
24    called it a Schmeisser.
25       Q.   So you saw him with that weapon the first time that you saw him,

 1    but you don't know whether that was the first day or the second day, if
 2    I've understood you properly.
 3       A.   Yes, that's right.
 4       Q.   Later, while you were both at Prelovo, did you see what kind of a
 5    weapon Mitar had?
 6       A.   As far as I remember, he carried that Schmeisser, because that
 7    weapon was most appropriate because he was going in and out of the kitchen
 8    and so on.
 9       Q.   When you were discussing what you know about his duties, except
10    when you mentioned that he would go to get supplies to town, you also said
11    that he would go out to the lines to distribute food.
12       A.   Yes, that's right.
13       Q.   Do you remember, did you personally see how food was taken to the
14    lines?
15       A.   I remember.  For lunch, we would take a cooked meal.  Sometimes
16    there would be a double portion so that there would be cooked food for
17    dinner as well.  Sometimes we would take dry food instead -- along with
18    the cooked food to be used for dinner.  Sometimes we would take cooked --
19    a cooked meal for dinner and for lunch.  For breakfast, we also took some
20    food and also tea.
21       Q.   Mr. Simic, when you say, "We took the food," does that mean that
22    you also did that always or occasionally went to the line, you
23    personally?
24       A.   No.  There was no need for me to go to the lines with them.  Three
25    of them were enough to distribute the food, and also the driver would help

 1    them.  Sometimes I did go, though, but for -- because of other work.
 2       Q.   Mr. Simic, do you remember whether the soldiers who were there,
 3    including all of you, carried any kind of insignia, any kind of
 4    characteristic insignia which they would be distinguished by?
 5       A.   Yes, we did, but for two days, not longer than that.  Less than
 6    two days we carried insignia tied to the epaulettes on our shoulders.
 7    They were thin ribbons in different colours.  They were issued to us, and
 8    they were used in case somebody who we didn't know would enter into our
 9    unit, even though this was not necessary because we all knew each other.
10    And we were issued with these ribbons.  And then we did receive a kind of
11    code, according to which we would wear a certain ribbon on a certain day.
12            To tell you the truth, I didn't wear this ribbon very often.
13    Everybody knew me, so I moved about freely and very often.  I was without
14    such a ribbon.
15       Q.   If I understood you very well, it was a thin ribbon that you wore
16    on the epaulettes, on your shoulder of your uniform; is that right?
17       A.   Yes.  That's exactly right.
18       Q.   When you say "different colours," does that mean on certain days
19    or for a certain period you were supposed to wear only one colour or was
20    it permitted to wear a different colour?
21       A.   It was a long time ago.  As far as I would remember, we would
22    change them every day.  We would get a message in the evening, for
23    example, that tomorrow it would be yellow.  The next day it would be red.
24            To tell you the truth, I never changed my ribbon.  I think the
25    cook, Vaso, also never changed his ribbon, because we never went out.  The

 1    people who were out on the field -- in the field and who moved around a
 2    lot, they would change the ribbons frequently.
 3       Q.   If I understand you properly, the people who were out in the field
 4    needed to take care of this, to pay attention to this so that they would
 5    be recognised by soldiers on the same side.
 6       A.   Yes, that's right.  Those people who were out in the field and who
 7    would go back and forth.
 8       Q.   So as you explained, these were very small, narrow ribbons which
 9    were worn on the shoulder.
10       A.   Yes, that's right.  They were perhaps 1 centimetre wide and
11    perhaps 8 or 10 centimetres long.  Ten, something like that.
12       Q.   Thank you very much.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Perhaps we can move to the other sized ribbon after
14    the adjournment.  We will return at 11.30.
15                          --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
16                          --- On resuming at 11.30 a.m.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
18            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
19       Q.   [Interpretation] Mr. Simic, before the break, you explained to us
20    how all those who were at Prelovo had those shoulder ribbons and you gave
21    a detailed explanation about that.  My next question is if any other of
22    people around you had perhaps some ribbons or armbands of a different
23    colour than you described and if yes, then who did?
24       A.   Yes.  The male nurse and Mitar had those -- wore armbands, whether
25    on the left arm or the right arm, I'm not quite sure, I think it was the

 1    right arm, and they were about 8 centimetres wide.
 2       Q.   So you saw the nurse or nurses wearing an armband of some kind and
 3    Mitar Vasiljevic.  Were these identical armbands in both cases, and could
 4    you please describe those armbands if you remember them, of course?
 5       A.   The size was the same, but the colour wasn't.  The nurses or
 6    rather there was just one male nurse, and he had a white armband with a
 7    red cross and to his -- on the door to his room, there was also a red
 8    cross so that people would know where the infirmary was whereas Mitar had
 9    a red armband.
10       Q.   And that armband which Mitar had on his arm, and you tell us it
11    was red, were there any other emblems on that armband?
12       A.   I don't think so.  I'm not quite sure but I think not.
13       Q.   Apart from -- you told us that now and then, Mitar and the driver
14    went to the town to get foodstuffs.  Would you know if Mitar Vasiljevic
15    left Prelovo privately, that is, not officially or rather did Mitar
16    Vasiljevic go home now and then?  Would you know that?
17       A.   All of us, and that includes Mitar, would go home now and then to
18    have a bath, for a change of clothes, and then we would be back.  At times
19    it would be for a night.  At times for a few hours only, and come back,
20    and that goes for Mitar too.
21       Q.   Do you know how did he go home on those occasions when he went
22    home?
23       A.   Well, I guess like everybody else.  Sometimes using these delivery
24    vans, at times in a car would come up.  Those who lived nearby would just
25    walk.  It depended.

 1       Q.   Do you know if Mitar Vasiljevic could drive, and did he ever own a
 2    car at any time?
 3       A.   I never saw him drive a vehicle.
 4       Q.   When you say this about him or anybody else, that it depended how
 5    they would go home, that is either on foot or getting a lift from anybody,
 6    is that it; did I understand you well?  Does that go for Mitar too?
 7       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  That was Mitar's case too.  There was no other
 8    way.
 9       Q.   How far is Prelovo from Visegrad?
10       A.   About 9 kilometres.
11       Q.   Do you know where Mitar Vasiljevic's house is?
12       A.   I do, in the village of Blace, that was where he was born.
13       Q.   And where he lives now?
14       A.   Yes.  Yes.  I know that too, where his family is.
15       Q.   Is that house on the Prelovo-Visegrad road?
16       A.   It is nearer to Visegrad, perhaps about 2 kilometres or maybe a
17    kilometre out of Visegrad.
18       Q.   When you say that, you mean, I presume, the centre of Visegrad
19    when you give us these distances?
20       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  That's how I -- that is how I figured it out, yes,
21    from the centre of Visegrad.
22       Q.   When you spoke about this van that belonged to the forestry
23    enterprise that was driven by Obren Vojinovic, do you remember what kind
24    of a van was it and, in particular, do you remember its colour?
25       A.   It was a van used to transport the forestry company workers to

 1    work and from it.  Obren drove that vehicle before the war for quite some
 2    time, I think.  What colour it was, well, orange or red, I'm not quite
 3    sure.  I think it was a Maribor make, but I know it was the forestry
 4    company because Obren used to joke.  "When all this is over, and it will
 5    be over, then that van will again be my livelihood."
 6       Q.   When you say "to transport workers," do you mean that there were
 7    more seats in it than usually there are in a van or do you remember what
 8    it looked like?
 9       A.   I think it could take 8 or 9, perhaps 2 or 3 seats more, but I'm
10    not sure about that.
11       Q.   Do you remember how long was Mitar Vasiljevic with you at Prelovo?
12       A.   About 10 days.
13       Q.   Do you know why not longer than that or, rather, do you know where
14    he went after those 10 or so days?
15       A.   I don't.  I know that he left and he did not turn up again,
16    whether he was assigned to some other place or what, I wouldn't know.
17       Q.   Did you later on overhear what had happened to him and where he
18    was, where he'd been?
19       A.   Well, I didn't really care to know about that.  I mean, you know,
20    there were lots of people there.  All I know is that he ended up in the
21    hospital with a broken leg.  And I wouldn't have -- that wouldn't have
22    registered either had I not known through conversation that he had fallen
23    off a horse.  And you know, there were many people injured at that time,
24    so who would remember it all.  But people had said that he'd fallen off a
25    horse, and that sounded funny, so that's why I registered it.
 1       Q.   So if I understand you well, after those ten or so days at Prelovo
 2    when he left, you did not see him again in the months that followed, to
 3    make it quite precise.
 4       A.   No.  I did not see him again.
 5       Q.   Undoubtedly, as soon as Mitar Vasiljevic was arrested, you saw it
 6    in the media.  So how did you react to that since you knew him before and
 7    after that?
 8       A.   No, no, no.  I didn't find that out from the media.  But that is a
 9    kind of a story which circulates very quickly, so I heard it from other
10    people, and I was quite surprised.
11       Q.   Why do you say that you were surprised?  That is, why were you
12    taken aback by that?
13       A.   Well, because I know Mitar.  He was quite a merry man and --
14    because of his profession.  And anyway, he always socialised with people,
15    and I found it difficult to believe that he had done anything like that.
16       Q.   Does that mean that from what you knew about him, you thought it
17    wasn't likely that he could have done such a thing?
18       A.   Yes, quite so.
19       Q.   Thank you Mr. Simic.
20            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] I have no further questions.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Cross-examination, Mr. Groome.
22                          Cross-examined by Mr. Groome:
23       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Simic.  My name is Dermot Groome.  I'm
24    representing the Prosecution here, and I'll ask you a few questions
25    regarding your testimony.

 1            How long did you yourself work in Prelovo?
 2       A.   In Prelovo and schools around Prelovo since 1969.
 3       Q.   And when did you first begin to work or how long did you work in
 4    Prelovo with respect to this cooking duty?
 5       A.   Oh, that's what you mean.  I didn't prepare any food.  I was a
 6    signals man.
 7       Q.   You've testified that at one point, Mitar Vasiljevic stopped
 8    coming to work at Prelovo; correct?
 9       A.   It is.
10       Q.   And were you ever informed why a member of the crew was no longer
11    going to be assigned or be working in Prelovo?
12       A.   No.  I didn't know it, and I didn't really want to know.  It was
13    none of my business.  There were 100, 150, sometimes 200 people.  Perhaps
14    he was doing some job for the army.  So ...
15       Q.   How many men were on the crew, the cooking crew?
16       A.   Five.  Well, four at times, and at times five.
17       Q.   And we've heard from other witnesses on that crew that Mitar
18    Vasiljevic had a somewhat -- his capacity was somewhat of a supervisor or
19    an inspector.  Would you agree with that characterisation of his job?
20       A.   Well, since he wore this armband, I suppose, yes, he was -- he was
21    a boss there.  Because he didn't really cook.  He was mostly engaged in
22    procuring food, and Vaso was the one who was the chief cook.  But then on
23    the other hand, when the cooking was over, when the food would be
24    prepared, Vaso would be a free man again.
25       Q.   And so when this person who had these responsibilities stopped

 1    showing up for work, there was never an explanation as to why.  Is that
 2    what you're testifying to?
 3       A.   Well, I suppose somebody had been notified about his absence and
 4    the reasons for it, but not me.  And had I wanted to know, I could have
 5    asked, I guess, but there were so many people coming and going that ...
 6       Q.   Before he left, did Mr. Vasiljevic ever say to you that he had
 7    concerns or fears about going to the front line and delivering food?  Did
 8    he ever say anything like that to you?
 9       A.   Not that I remember.  But you know, we were all quite
10    apprehensive, because those 10, maybe 20 kilometres away from the kitchen
11    to reach the front lines.  I don't remember him complaining ever to me,
12    but I was also quite fearful when I had to cover that area.  You know,
13    that ground is not very nice.  There are very many curves.  There are
14    boulders and wooded areas, so that none of us were particularly happy
15    about it because it was a dangerous journey indeed.
16       Q.   What I'm asking you, sir, is as you sit here today, can you
17    recollect any time that Mr. Vasiljevic said to you, "I have" -- that he
18    was afraid of going to the front line to distribute the food?
19       A.   I cannot recollect.
20       Q.   Now, after Mitar Vasiljevic left Prelovo, would it be fair to say
21    that you did not see him again for quite some time?
22       A.   Well, I didn't.  I didn't often go to the town because my family
23    was in Prelovo.  So after 15 or maybe 20 days, I even moved further on.
24    So I'd come to Prelovo.  I'd get home, have a bath, change, and leave.  I
25    never went into town.  There was no need for me to go there.  Perhaps once

 1    in 20 days or so.
 2       Q.   During your work as a teacher, did you have occasion to teach a
 3    person by the name of Milan Lukic?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Do you know who Milan Lukic is?
 6       A.   I used to see him around town after the war.
 7       Q.   And how did you know that his name was Milan Lukic?
 8       A.   It's a small place.  Everybody knows everybody there.  I suppose I
 9    would have known him before had he lived in Visegrad.  It's a small place.
10       Q.   Would it be fair to say or would you agree with me that you knew a
11    lot of people from Visegrad?
12       A.   I mostly new people who lived between Visegrad and Prelovo and
13    beyond Prelovo, because that is where I spent the major part of my career,
14    the town itself.  And that other side I didn't know all that well.  I knew
15    some of them because I met them.  You know, shopkeepers, and doctors, and
16    maybe somebody else, but not really.  I didn't know many people in that
17    part.
18       Q.   I'm going to ask you to take a look at a list of names.
19            MR. GROOME:  I'm referring to Defence Exhibit 22.1.  I have a copy
20    if -- we have additional copies if any of the Chamber needs, then it's
21    handy for us to hand up a copy.
22       Q.   Mr. Simic, some of the people's names on this list we do not want
23    to mention publicly, so we have numbers assigned to each of these names.
24    I'm going to ask you some questions about some of the names on this list,
25    and I would ask you not to call their name but simply use the number.  So

 1    refer to the first person as VGD3.  Okay?
 2            Now, there's been testimony from a Defence witness that some of
 3    these people lived in Visegrad.  Can I ask you to look down that list, and
 4    can you tell us whether you recognise the names of any of the people on
 5    that list?
 6       A.   VGD10.  Is that how you want me to refer to them?
 7       Q.   Yes.  So you know or you recognise the name of VGD10; is that
 8    correct?
 9       A.   That's right.
10       Q.   Please review the rest of the list and tell us which people you
11    recognise, the names you recognise from that first.
12       A.   VGD15, VGD16, VGD17, VGD19 and, just a moment, let me give it
13    another look.  That's it.
14       Q.   Now, there's also been some evidence by a Defence witness that
15    some of the names on this list or the people on this list were involved in
16    paramilitary activity.  I want to ask you of the names that you
17    recognised, do you know of any of these people being involved in
18    paramilitary activity?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   In addition to those names, I want to ask you about some other
21    names which are not the subject of this numbering system.  Do you know a
22    person by the name of Mitar Knezevic?
23       A.   Mitar Knezevic.  The first time I saw him after the war broke out
24    and I saw him two or three times perhaps.  I may have seen him after the
25    war, but once or twice.  I'm not sure.  I didn't know him before that, and

 1    I suppose even if he comes from the area, I suppose he just didn't live
 2    there.
 3       Q.   Are you aware whether or not he was involved in any paramilitary
 4    activity?
 5       A.   I wouldn't know.  I remember him because he wore different clothes
 6    and he had only one eye, and he had a fur cap.  Otherwise, I don't think
 7    he would stick in my mind.
 8       Q.   How about a person called Miroslav or Miki Trivkovic, do you
 9    recognise that name?
10       A.   No.
11       Q.   Let me take you back to VGD15.  How well do you know VGD15?
12       A.   I've known him since could be 1990 or 1991, perhaps.
13       Q.   And in what context did you know him?
14       A.   He worked for the police.  I knew his brother better, and that is
15    how I came to know him too.
16       Q.   Now, you also said you know VGD10.  Did he also work with the
17    police?
18       A.   He did.
19       Q.   And aside from working with the police, do you know if VGD10 and
20    VGD15 were friends or saw each other outside of work?
21       A.   I never saw them -- together, I mean.
22       Q.   Was VGD10 VGD15's subordinate?
23       A.   I don't know.  I don't know what is their chain of command,
24    whether he was his subordinate or not.  I don't know.  I don't.
25       Q.   Do you know what rank VGD15 had?

 1       A.   No, I don't.  All I know is that he was with the police.  That's
 2    all I know.
 3       Q.   With respect to Mitar Vasiljevic, did you ever see him in the
 4    company of either VGD15 or VGD10?
 5       A.   No.
 6       Q.   Now, two days ago, Mr. Domazet explained about some problem that
 7    occurred in the Sarajevo airport.  I want to ask you:  Were you one of the
 8    people that was involved in that problem that occurred in the airport?
 9       A.   No.  No, I wasn't.
10       Q.   Were you present when that problem occurred?
11       A.   I was there, yes, but at a distance so I didn't see anything.
12    Perhaps I was doing something else.  I think I was solving a crossword,
13    waiting for something or other.
14       Q.   How did you become aware that there had been a problem?
15       A.   Well, one of them did say something, made a comment, but I don't
16    know.  I mean I didn't think it important because it had nothing to do
17    with me and I couldn't help either way.  Somebody said that he should
18    communicate with the lawyers to see what to do.  That's it.
19       Q.   When you say, "Somebody made a comment," who was it that made a
20    comment?
21       A.   I think that Dragisa Lindo had already been.  I think he said,
22    "Why are you looking at me like that?"  And I said, "Well, why are you
23    staring at the man?  Maybe he's right."  And that was that.
24       Q.   So Mr. Lindo, was he present at the scene of wherever this problem
25    was?

 1       A.   I don't know.  He said that somebody had said to him, "Why are you
 2    looking at me like that?"  And I told him, "Well, stop looking at the
 3    man."  And that's all.
 4       Q.   So Mr. Lindo told you that somebody said to him, "Why are you
 5    looking at me?"  Is that correct?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   And did this occur in the bar area of the Sarajevo airport?
 8       A.   Perhaps I was six or seven metres away from the bar, and I thought
 9    Lindo was perhaps joking when he said that because it wasn't anything
10    terrible.
11       Q.   The man who said this, did you recognise him?
12       A.   No.  No.  They didn't even look at me.  There were a lot of people
13    there.  I don't think it was anything terrible if somebody told him, "What
14    are you looking at me for?"
15       Q.   So in your estimation, it was not a very big problem that occurred
16    in the Sarajevo airport; is that correct?
17       A.   I don't know.  If he told him, "Why are you looking at me like
18    that?" I think that that's not something that's really that terrible.
19       Q.   Did you consider it serious enough to request that you not return
20    by way of Sarajevo but by Belgrade?  Did you consider it serious enough
21    for that?
22       A.   If that was the only thing that happened, then I don't think that
23    that's a good enough reason.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, this is an issue which I suppose is being
25    put on as to the credit of another witness, is it?

 1            MR. GROOME:  This witness or another witness, yes, Your Honour.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  But it's a very collateral issue, is it not?  It
 3    wasn't either of these two witnesses that was meant to be the subject of
 4    whatever the dispute was at the airport, it was VGD23, and -- that's what
 5    we were told.
 6            MR. GROOME:  Although this witness is contradicting another
 7    witness regarding who was involved in it, Your Honour.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  I know that.  But what is the issue here?  It must be
 9    the most remote issue of credit that one could imagine.  In common law,
10    you can't have collateral inquiries into questions of credit.  You have to
11    accept the witness' answer, and I really wonder what the value of this
12    issue is now that you've raised it with the third witness.
13            MR. GROOME:  That actually was my last question, but I can
14    certainly say what I think the value is if the Court is interested in it.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, you'll say it's great, but I'm asking you what
16    it is.  I don't see what it is at all.  It is a collateral issue upon a
17    collateral issue.  So can we get on with what is at issue in the case?
18            Every time Mr. Domazet asks for something, you use it as an issue
19    of credit somewhere, and I don't understand how this is appropriate.
20            MR. GROOME:
21       Q.   Mr. Simic, can you tell us when you were mobilised?
22       A.   I think that was -- yes, on the 19th of May, or maybe it was the
23    20th.  Right after the departure of the JNA Uzice Corps, the next day.
24    I'm not sure whether that was the 19th or 20th.  I don't know that.
25       Q.   And would it be fair to say that before that date, you were just

 1    an ordinary teacher; is that correct?
 2       A.   I didn't quite understand what you are asking me.
 3       Q.   Before you were mobilised, your work was simply a teacher.  You
 4    had no official duties either with the police or with the army, did you?
 5       A.   Yes.  Yes, I understand now.  I was just a teacher.
 6       Q.   And before you were mobilised, did you engage in any type of
 7    military activities whatsoever?
 8       A.   Which period do you mean?
 9       Q.   Prior to being mobilised.
10       A.   In the month of April.  Maybe you were thinking about that period
11    immediately before, a month or two before the corps left.  Everybody was
12    engaged in village guards and so on, if that's what you meant.
13       Q.   Well, were you engaged as what you're now describing as a village
14    guard?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   And when did you first act as a village guard?
17       A.   Maybe it started three -- maybe from January, February perhaps.
18       Q.   And when you were a village guard, did you carry a gun?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   And where did you get that gun?
21       A.   I think these were weapons from the Territorial Defence.
22       Q.   So prior to being mobilised on the 19th of May, you were issued a
23    gun by the Territorial Defence to be a village guard; is that correct?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And when you were operating as a village guard, did you wear a

 1    uniform?
 2       A.   Not at that time, no.
 3       Q.   When did you first begin to wear a uniform?
 4       A.   When I was called up for mobilisation.
 5       Q.   So you did not wear a uniform before the 19th of May; correct?
 6       A.   That's right.
 7       Q.   Now, can you tell us how often did you work as a village guard?
 8       A.   As needed.  Sometimes every other night.  Sometimes for ten days
 9    there would be nothing, and then again I would do it.
10       Q.   And what did you have to do as a village guard?
11       A.   I would usually go to a neighbour's with my family, leave my wife
12    and children there, and then we would be there in front of that
13    neighbour's house.
14       Q.   And what were you guarding against?
15       A.   The situation was very tense.  Sometimes in the evening, you could
16    hear shooting, sometimes.  Often at night you could hear cars moving about
17    and so on.
18       Q.   Did you ever have to shoot anybody in connection with your duties
19    as a village guard?
20       A.   Thank God, no.
21       Q.   How far is the village of Dobrun from where you live?
22       A.   To Visegrad it was ten, and then from Visegrad, I think it's about
23    20.
24       Q.   So in total, it would be 20 kilometres from your home; is that
25    correct?

 1       A.   Yes, approximately.
 2       Q.   And in the course of your guard duty, as you call it, did you ever
 3    have to engage in any activity in Dobrun?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Are you sure about that?
 6       A.   One hundred per cent.
 7       Q.   I want to read you a portion of a statement by a witness from
 8    Visegrad, and I want to ask you whether or not it is true.
 9            "In front of the military office building in Visegrad, I saw
10    Dragan Simic, a teacher from Prelovo, who wore a uniform.  He was
11    receiving orders regarding Dobrun from an unknown man also in uniform.
12    This happened between the 20th of April and the 10th of May, 1992."
13            Is that statement true?
14       A.   No.  That's a notorious lie.
15       Q.   So at no time were you ever -- or was any time that you were in
16    front of the Visegrad Hotel in uniform before the 19th of May receiving
17    orders from another person?
18       A.   I didn't receive any orders at that time because the corps was
19    there.  Maybe one day we went together with the corps for some shooting
20    practice, but as a regular soldier, I didn't have any duties.
21       Q.   You are aware that the White Eagles paramilitaries were stationed
22    in the Visegrad Hotel, are you not?
23       A.   I didn't know where their base was.
24       Q.   Sir, isn't it a fact that you were a member of the White Eagles,
25    and you were engaged in paramilitary activity in 1992?
 1       A.   There was no question about that.  No way.
 2       Q.   Can I have an answer, please?  Yes or no?
 3       A.   No.  I was not a member of any paramilitary organisation.
 4            MR. GROOME:  I have no further questions.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Re-examination.
 6                          Re-examined by Mr. Domazet:
 7       Q.   [Interpretation] Mr. Simic, let's deal right away with this
 8    question by Mr. Groome about the White Eagles.  You explained a little
 9    while ago the situation you were in at Prelovo and that while you were
10    there that you came very rarely.  But during the corps, Uzice Corps stay
11    in Visegrad, were you then a member of the White Eagles?  Did you notice,
12    did you notice any White Eagles presence in the town?
13       A.   I very rarely went to town, perhaps once every 20 days.  But
14    sometimes two or three people - I don't know whether they were
15    paramilitaries - would pass through Prelovo.  They wore camouflage
16    uniforms, their faces were painted, and they had hats.  But I don't know.
17    But as I said before, I very rarely went to town.  Maybe once every 20
18    days.  There was no need for me to go there.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, you had two questions there.  You
20    asked:  "When you were at Prelovo, were you then a member of the White
21    Eagles?"  That was your first question.  And then your second question --
22            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's correction.  The first question
23    was not asked by the Defence counsel.  He just asked the witness whether
24    he noticed the presence of any White Eagles or any other paramilitary
25    groups.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry.
 2            THE INTERPRETER:  The interpreter I apologises.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm relying on the transcript.  Because I thought he
 4    hadn't answer what had I thought was your question.
 5            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  [Interpretation] I had said -- well, the
 6    witness said that during his stay at Prelovo, he very rarely went to
 7    town.  So that my question then was:  "What was going on during the time
 8    that the Uzice Corps was there?"
 9       Q.   And now you replied that even at that time you went to town very
10    rarely and that sometimes you would just see some masked persons in
11    passing.  They were passing on that road close to Prelovo, if I understood
12    you properly.
13       A.   Yes, that's right.
14       Q.   Mr. Simic, when you answered to Mr. Groome's question about what
15    you know about Mitar Knezevic, you said that besides some characteristics,
16    that he didn't have one eye, that he always wore a fur hat, you also
17    mentioned a characteristic way of dress.  What did you mean when you said
18    that?
19       A.   I meant the fur hat.  It was a tall fur hat.
20       Q.   What was the colour of it?
21       A.   I think it was black, but I'm not sure.
22       Q.   Do you remember what Mitar Knezevic wore?  Did he have a uniform
23    or some other kind of dress?
24       A.   I don't remember.
25       Q.   Was he carrying weapons on the occasions that you saw him?

 1       A.   Yes, I think he was.
 2       Q.   Mr. Simic, you said in answer to Mr. Groome's question about what
 3    was happening before the Uzice Corps arrived, and about the village
 4    guards.  You explained that a little.  You said there were tensions, and
 5    this is why these guards were organised.  Could you tell us whether these
 6    village guards were organised in all villages and, as far as you know,
 7    were they organised by both Serbs and Muslims or by one or the other?
 8       A.   There were guards in the villages.  I think the Muslims also
 9    organised such guards, and since I heard shooting from their villages as
10    well, I assumed that that was so.
11       Q.   Mr. Groome also gave you a list that you have in front of you,
12    D22.1, and you said that you know some of the people on that list.  Could
13    you please look at number VGD14?  Does this last name or maybe nickname
14    mean anything to you, and did you know such a person?
15       A.   There are several people in our area who have that last name, but
16    [redacted], there was a person in our kitchen but it wasn't
17   [redacted].  We called him [redacted], but not called, and it wasn't  
18    [redacted]. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
19       Q.   Possibly it does, and that is why I am asking you about that
20    person that you say you're not sure if his name is [redacted].
21       A.   It's not [redacted], surely, the person that I'm thinking of.
22       Q.   Do you know his real name?
23       A.   I think his name is [redacted].
24       Q.   You mentioned that he worked in the kitchen or around the kitchen,
25    I'm not sure.  Could you tell us more specifically what, and from what

 1    time?
 2       A.   He came later.  I think he was in the kitchen when we moved to
 3    Blace.  He drove the van together with Obren.  Sometimes one would go,
 4    sometimes the other, and sometimes they would go together.  They went to
 5    get supplies, then both of them would go.  Sometimes somebody else would
 6    drive, but I think -- he was in Blace.  He arrived at Blace maybe a day or
 7    two before, but he was definitely in Blace.
 8       Q.   My next question is the following, and I ask you to consider this
 9    carefully:  That person, [redacted], as you said, whose nickname is [redacted],
10    was that person still there while Mitar Vasiljevic was still in Prelovo?
11       A.   No, he wasn't.
12       Q.   Are you sure about that?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   At that time when that person was also part of the kitchen team,
15    was there another vehicle around other than the vehicle that you described
16    as belonging to the forestry department?
17       A.   Another vehicle arrived later, I can't remember, perhaps after a
18    year or after three months.  It wasn't a van.  It wasn't a small TAM
19    truck.  It was a sort of small truck.  There would be a driver, a
20    co-driver and there was a bench in the back.  So in the back, it was like
21    a small truck.
22       Q.   Who operated, who drove this vehicle?
23       A.   Vojinovic and [redacted] used to drive it.
24       Q.   Was the other vehicle there also at the time, so were both
25    vehicles available for use at that time?

 1       A.   Yes, they were.  So they would use them alternately, but I think
 2    the van was used more.  The small truck would go to get supplies more
 3    often, but the van was generally used more.
 4            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you very much.  I have no
 5    further questions.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  It really was new material in that re-examination if
 7    that's what you are standing up to say, Mr. Groome.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  There is absolutely nothing in cross-examination to
10    justify that.  But we've got to use his pseudonym.  That seems to have
11    been -- is that one on the list or is it another one?
12            MR. GROOME:  It's not the person on the -- I'm not sure whether it
13    is or not.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Unfortunately, the transcript has been spelling it
15    the same way.  I don't know whether it's a different person.
16            MR. GROOME:  Should I use the pseudonym, Your Honour, when I
17    refer --
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Is the one VGD14 the one you want to ask about?
19            MR. GROOME:  That's a person that the accused has testified
20    about.  I don't know anything -- I'm not sure if it's the same person who
21    is the (redacted).  This person is saying it's a different person than the
22    one he worked with or is interested in.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  You proceed.  It certainly did not arise out of
24    cross-examination.
25                          Further Cross-examination by Mr. Groome:
 1       Q.   Mr. Simic, a few moments ago, Mr. Domazet asked you, "Was there
 2    another vehicle?"  And you responded, "Yes, there was."  And then you
 3    said, "It wasn't a van."  What made you think that Mr. Domazet was
 4    referring to a van?
 5       A.   I wanted to describe that vehicle.  People where I come from don't
 6    know the brands of cars, the makes of car so everything that is a sort of
 7    combined passenger and terrain vehicle is called a van.  So this was not a
 8    van that looked like the one from the forestry department that was used
 9    for the transport of workers.  It was a small truck, but probably people
10    from our area would call it a van, but it was a sort of combination
11    vehicle for passengers and also for freight.
12       Q.   So it's your testimony here today that Mr. Domazet's use of the
13    word "vehicle," in your mind, means "van" because everybody from your area
14    thinks about vans; is that what you're saying?
15       A.   Not all, but 90 per cent would think when they saw this that it
16    was a van compared to a proper van that we talked about first, if I am
17    being clear.
18       Q.   Has anybody connected in this case in any way talked to you or
19    said anything to you regarding a van and Prelovo?  Has anybody said
20    anything to you whatsoever about a van?
21       A.   No, there was no need.  I used to see that vehicle every day.
22       Q.   Now, Mr. Domazet also asked you about this person by the name of
23    (redacted) who you've testified about.  On the 27th of July, 2000, did 
24    you give a statement to Mr. Tanaskovic regarding what you knew about this
25    case?

 1       A.   Yes, I did.
 2       Q.   And you realised at that point in time that there was a legal
 3    proceeding involving this case and that your statement may be used in
 4    those proceedings; is that correct?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   And you told Mr. Tanaskovic everything that you knew regarding
 7    this case; correct?
 8       A.   I don't know whether I told him everything, but that statement and
 9    what I have said today, that's everything.
10       Q.   Were you truthful with Mr. Tanaskovic?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   And after you made that statement, Mr. Tanaskovic gave you an
13    opportunity to read it and you signed that statement; correct?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   And in that statement, at no time do you ever mention this person
16    by the name of (redacted) who worked with you in Prelovo, do you?
17       A.   No.  I didn't mention another 150 people out of those that were,
18    or what I said, perhaps that was sufficient for him.  I don't know.
19       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Simic.
20            MR. GROOME:  May I have an agreement from Defence counsel that in
21    the statement Mr. (redacted) is never mentioned?
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Mr. Domazet.
23            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, Your Honour, it is true, but this statement is
24    from 4th of September, not 27th of July.
25            MR. GROOME:  My apologies.
 1            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  Okay.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, are you agreed upon the date of the statement?
 3            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  The 4th of the September of the
 4    year 2000?
 5            MR. DOMAZET:  4th of September, yes.
 6            MR. GROOME:  My apologies.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  That's all right.  And you agree, Mr. Domazet that
 8    there's no --
 9            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, yes.  I agree, Your Honour.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much indeed.  Any re-examination
11    arising out that?
12            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, sir, for coming along to give evidence.
14    You are now free to leave.
15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you, too.
16                          [The witness withdrew]
17                          [The witness entered court]
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, madam, would you please make the solemn
19    declaration in the document which the court usher is handing you.
20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak
21    the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Sit down, please, madam.
23                          WITNESS:  MILOJKA VASILJEVIC
24                          [Witness answered through interpreter]
25                          Examined by Mr. Domazet:

 1       Q.   [Interpretation] Good afternoon, Mrs. Vasiljevic.
 2       A.   Good afternoon.
 3       Q.   I will ask you some questions.  However, I'd like to ask you to
 4    make a short break after you hear my question and then only start your
 5    answer.  We speak the same language, and we should try to facilitate the
 6    work of the interpreters.  So will you please bear that in mind.
 7            Mrs. Vasiljevic, is your microphone switched on?
 8       A.   No, no, no, nothing.  Nothing is switched on here.
 9            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Could the monitor be switched on,
10    please, so that Mrs. Vasiljevic could see that the interpretation is over
11    and that she can start answering.
12       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, will you please tell us when and where were you
13    born?
14       A.   I was born on the 4th of July, 1956, in the village of Pogacici.
15    My father's name is Milos, and my mother's name is Milena.
16       Q.   Is that a village in the municipality of Visegrad?
17       A.   Yes, it is.
18       Q.   And where did you attend school and what kind of education did you
19    receive?
20       A.   I came out of the secondary vocational school for salesmen in
21    Visegrad.
22       Q.   And do you remember the year?
23       A.   I graduated in 1974.
24       Q.   And after that, what did you do?
25       A.   And then I worked in commerce, and I still -- I'm still at it.

 1       Q.   You are Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic's wife.  When did you get married?
 2       A.   Yes, I'm Mitar Vasiljevic's wife.  We married in February 1978.
 3       Q.   And is it then that you started living together or did you live
 4    together before the wedding?
 5       A.   That is when we moved in together, not before that.
 6       Q.   And where did you live then, Mrs. Vasiljevic?
 7       A.   [No translation] And then we started building our own house in
 8    1980, in 1980 something, but we have not finished it yet.
 9       Q.   I shall repeat my question, because it seems that the interpreters
10    didn't get it all.
11            So the building that you lived in, you said it was bought by Mitar
12    Vasiljevic's father and that you lived in it.
13       A.   That's right.
14       Q.   And then sometime in the 1980s, you started building a new house
15    which is not finished yet.  Did I understand you correctly?
16       A.   That is right.  Sometime in the 1980s, we started building a new
17    house, but it is still not finished.
18       Q.   And which street is it on in Visegrad?
19       A.   It is Vojvode Stepe Street.  Some people called it Sandzacka
20    Street.
21       Q.   Is it the street which is along the main route from the heart of
22    Visegrad to Prelovo passing through Sase, and Banja, and Spa?
23       A.   That's right.  It's the main street taking you to Visegradska
24    Banja, Prelovo.
25       Q.   And the old house that you mentioned and the new house that you

 1    are building, are they adjacent or not?  Are they next one to another or
 2    not?
 3       A.   The old house, the old house and the new house are about ten
 4    metres apart.
 5       Q.   And tell us also about your children.  Where were your children
 6    born?
 7       A.   Daughter Marina was born in 1980 on the 14th of July, and my son
 8    Nikola on the 27th of August, 1988.
 9       Q.   In 1992, were you living in that old house in Vojvode Stepe that
10    you mentioned, you and your family?
11       A.   That's right.  In 1992, we lived in the old house because this
12    other one was not furnished yet.  It was only as late as 1999 that our new
13    house became habitable.
14       Q.   Will you please now cast your mind back to 1992, March and April
15    that year, and will you try to remember where were you at that time?
16       A.   Well, in March 1992, I know that in April, we were in Uzice.  We
17    had fled Visegrad, and then returned to Visegrad from Uzice in late
18    April.  We had to flee the house because it was on fire, so that was
19    everybody who had children left the town.
20       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, when you say, "We had to leave," whom did you
21    mean?  Who else from your family left?
22       A.   I went, and my children.  Marina, Nikola, and I left.
23       Q.   Where did you go?
24       A.   We went to Uzice.  That was in early April.
25       Q.   A while ago, you said, "Everybody fled because houses were set to

 1    fire."  Whom did you mean when you said "everybody," who left Visegrad at
 2    the time?
 3       A.   At that time, it was women with children left because they were
 4    afraid to move around the place.
 5       Q.   You mean it wasn't safe to be in Visegrad at the time, is that it,
 6    or do you mean something else?  I'd like you to be brief, but nevertheless
 7    specific.
 8       A.   Well, it wasn't safe to be there with children because they mostly
 9    were threatening, intercepting our people, beating them.  I remember well
10    how in the beginning, they waylaid some people and threatened them.
11       Q.   In the beginning, you already mentioned that some houses were on
12    fire.  Can you explain whose houses they were and what it was all about?
13       A.   I think that Savic, Vecko, I think that is him name, Vecko Savic's
14    his house was on fire.
15       Q.   And what was the ethnicity of people's houses who were on fire
16    then?
17       A.   They were of Serb ethnicity.
18       Q.   And your husband Mitar did not go to Uzice with you, if I
19    understood you.
20       A.   He didn't.  No, my husband Mitar stayed at home.
21       Q.   But did you leave in agreement with him?  Did he consent to you
22    and your children's departure to Uzice at the time?
23       A.   Yes.  Yes, he did, since we did not feel safe in Visegrad.
24       Q.   During your stay in Uzice, did you hear about a change in Visegrad
25    at the time regarding the situation in Visegrad?

 1       A.   While I was in Uzice with my children, I think that the Uzice
 2    Corps arrived whilst we were there.
 3       Q.   But did you leave Visegrad before the Uzice Corps arrived or
 4    after, I mean did you go to Uzice before or after the arrival of the Uzice
 5    Corps?
 6       A.   We left Visegrad before the Uzice Corps arrived.
 7       Q.   You mentioned that you returned some time towards the end of
 8    April.  Was the Uzice Corps in Visegrad still?
 9       A.   When we returned from Uzice, the Uzice Corps was there.  We
10    returned sometime in April, and the Uzice Corps was still in Visegrad.
11       Q.   Do you remember when was it exactly that you returned from Uzice
12    to Visegrad?
13       A.   My children and I returned sometime around the 26th or 27th.  It
14    was Easter, and that is when we came back.
15       Q.   So you returned on orthodox Easter day; is that it?
16       A.   Yes, that's right.
17       Q.   And when you returned from Uzice home, did you see any military
18    checkpoint near your house?
19       A.   That's right.  When I came back from Uzice, not far from our house
20    there was an army checkpoint.  I mean, manned by the army.  There is a
21    junction there, a crossroads, and that is where they were.  A junction
22    leading to Omar.
23       Q.   So you mean the checkpoint was in your street, but actually at the
24    crossroads leading to the village of?
25       A.   Omar.

 1       Q.   When you said that the army manned the bridge, which army did you
 2    have in mind?
 3       A.   It was manned by the Uzice Corps.
 4       Q.   Do you remember if it was regular troops or reservists?
 5       A.   Well, that was the Uzice Corps.
 6       Q.   Did you perhaps see if at that checkpoint somebody from Visegrad
 7    whom you knew worked there, that is, whether there was anybody from
 8    Visegrad stopping people there and checking their IDs?
 9       A.   No.  There was nobody from Visegrad there.
10       Q.   As far as you know, did your husband, Mitar Vasiljevic, ever do
11    that?
12       A.   No.  Mitar was never at the checkpoint.
13       Q.   Before the Uzice Corps left, so at about that time, do you recall
14    if when you were with your husband, Mitar, in front of your house or near
15    that checkpoint that there was a woman passing by with her family and that
16    a conversation took place between you and them.
17            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] But before that, I'd like the
18    witness to be shown the list of protected witnesses and to look under
19    VGD81, if it was that person and that person's family that she saw at the
20    time when there was that checkpoint in front of their house.  Did she see
21    them come down the street, and then they stopped and have had a
22    conversation with her husband Mitar.
23       Q.   VGD81 -- do not repeat the name.  Do not read aloud her name.
24    Just tell us if that is the person we have of in mind.
25       A.   There is no 81 here.

 1            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm not sure what was shown to the
 2    witness, but I have prepared a pseudonym sheet of the witnesses I --
 3    protected witnesses I think this witness will refer to.  I would be happy
 4    to offer it to Mr. Domazet for his use at this stage.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  It might a good idea, Mr. Domazet.  We did suggest to
 6    you that you do this.
 7            MR. GROOME:  I believe the witness was shown 22.1; is that
 8    correct?
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Which one has the witness got?  No.  No.  What we're
10    after is Exhibit 20 -- P164.
11            MR. DOMAZET:  These are Prosecution witnesses.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  P164 is the one I think we need.  I can understand
13    how the error was made.
14            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, may I suggest rather than show the
15    witness names that may not be necessary for her to testify about, that
16    perhaps we can work from --
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Show it to Mr. Domazet.  That would be the best
18    idea.
19            Now, that better be given a number.  What are we up to in your
20    list?
21            MR. GROOME:  106, Your Honour.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  106.  It will be Exhibit P106, and it will be under
23    seal.
24            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
25       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, now you have before you -- now you have the list

 1    before you.  Did you look at the name of the person indicated next to
 2    VGD81?
 3            So I shall repeat my question.  At the time when this Uzice Corps
 4    checkpoint was near your house, did she ever pass by, come down the street
 5    with her family when you and your husband were there and did you stop and
 6    talk?
 7       A.   I know that person.  But I was never at the checkpoint, so I have
 8    no idea whether this person ever passed by or not.  But it is quite
 9    possible that my husband and I were in our garden, but I never saw her or
10    come out to meet her, neither I nor my husband.
11       Q.   Does this mean that there was no conversation between that person
12    and you or that you simply never talked to her?
13       A.   No, never.  We never talked.  We never had any conversation with
14    this person.
15       Q.   Thank you.  And when you returned sometime around Orthodox Easter
16    to Uzice, the Uzice Corps was still in that town.  Now, could you tell us,
17    was the situation then any different from the one that reigned there at
18    the time you left Visegrad and went to Uzice?
19       A.   Well, the situation was much better than before, because before,
20    we did not dare move around.  We could not do anything.
21       Q.   Did you go to work?  That is, did people go to their respective
22    companies?
23       A.   Well, personally, I resumed my work sometime in May.
24       Q.   Now, tell me, what happened after the Uzice Corps left?  What did
25    your husband, Mitar, do then?

 1       A.   My husband, Mitar, when the Uzice Corps left, was mobilised by the
 2    Territorial Defence, and he -- so he went to the kitchen at Prelovo,
 3    because he was a cook anyway.  He worked in the restaurant business.
 4       Q.   As a reservist, did he keep a military uniform at home at the
 5    time?
 6       A.   That's right.
 7       Q.   And what was the uniform like?
 8       A.   It was a JNA uniform, that is, the olive-green/grey uniform.
 9       Q.   And was that the uniform that he took along when he went to
10    Prelovo?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Did you visit him while he was at Prelovo or did he come to
13    Visegrad?
14       A.   No.  I never went to Prelovo, and he came home now and again.  In
15    the beginning, every day or two.  Later on, at bit longer intervals.
16       Q.   Would he sometimes come in the evening hours and spend the night
17    at home?
18       A.   Yes, because there was no public transport at that time, so he
19    tried to manage, I suppose, lifted a finger, tried to get a ride from
20    somebody so that he didn't come all that often.
21       Q.   So one could say that sometimes, on several occasions, he would
22    come in the evening hours and stay the night.
23       A.   Yes, that is right.  Several times he came, he would come in the
24    evening.
25       Q.   And as you say, there was no organised transport at that time; is

 1    that it?
 2       A.   Oh, no, no, no, there was none.
 3       Q.   Was he a driver, that is, could he -- did he know how to drive?
 4    Had he taken the driving test?
 5       A.   No, no, no.  He never took this test, and he couldn't drive.
 6       Q.   Did you ever own a car?
 7       A.   No.  We never had a car of our own.  Never.
 8       Q.   And on those occasions when he came to Prelovo -- from Prelovo,
 9    would he be wearing that uniform that he had taken from home?
10       A.   That's right, yes.  He would wear that uniform that he had taken
11    away with him.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
13            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  Thank you.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  We will adjourn and resume at 2.30.

 1                          --- On resuming at 2.30 p.m.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
 3            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  Thank you, Your Honour.
 4       Q.   [Interpretation] Mrs. Vasiljevic, we will continue where we left
 5    off before we went on our lunch break.  We were talking about the period
 6    in which you say your husband Mitar was in Prelovo.  Can you remember how
 7    long is this period that your husband spent in Prelovo?  How many days is
 8    that approximately, if you can remember?
 9       A.   It was about 10 days, perhaps, that he spent in Prelovo.
10       Q.   When he would come home in the evenings and stay, as you said
11    yourself, he used any kind of transport that he could find.  Did he ever
12    tell you who actually brought him home on those occasions?
13       A.   It depends.  Sometimes he would come by car.  Once he told me that
14    he came with Milan, that Milan brought him, but I didn't see him.
15    Whatever car happened to pass by, that's what he would use to come home.
16       Q.   You said that he was brought by a car, you don't know which one,
17    and that on one occasion he came with Milan, which Milan?
18       A.   Milan Lukic.
19       Q.   Can you remember that time that he said Milan Lukic brought him,
20    was it in -- at the beginning of his stay in Prelovo, in the middle, or
21    the end, towards the end of his stay there?
22       A.   It was towards the end of his stay in Prelovo.
23       Q.   Do you know how it happened that he was no longer in Prelovo?
24       A.   I worked for a while, two or three days, and he wasn't around.
25    And then I started asking around where Mitar could possibly be, and I was

 1    told that he was in Zenica, and I said, "What is he doing ..."
 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Correction, Uzamnica.
 3       A.   And I said, "What was he doing at Uzamnica?"  And they said they
 4    had been -- they wanted to transfer him to transport food further away,
 5    and this is something that didn't suit him.  So they placed him at
 6    Uzamnica, and he went on a hunger strike up there.  He was drinking at the
 7    time.  At one time I met Dr. Raso, Raso Vasiljevic, and he explained to me
 8    that he was up there.
 9            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
10       Q.   When you say that you found out that he was up there and that he
11    was on a hunger strike and that he was refusing food, who did you hear
12    that from?  Was it from the person that you just mentioned or from
13    somebody else or only from this person?  Could you be a little more
14    specific and tell us who did you hear this, that you just told us?
15       A.   I heard it from Dr. Raso.  There were stories going around that
16    Mitar was on strike, that he didn't want to receive food, and when he
17    would go on a drinking spree, then he would drink for a few days and then
18    he couldn't eat so that then they went and they administered an IV to
19    him.  So that's why he remained there for two or three days.
20       Q.   When we're talking about the drinking, Mrs. Vasiljevic, I want to
21    ask you this kind of thing that happened at that time, was it something
22    that was -- something that would occur regularly, that he would start
23    drinking and then, as a result, he would have health problems?
24       A.   Yes.  Yes.  He liked to have a drink and, of course, this wasn't
25    good for him.  Then he would drink for a few days later.  He wouldn't eat,

 1    and then he would have to go and have treatment because of his
 2    alcoholism.
 3       Q.   As much as you are able to, can you explain who he was like when
 4    he was under the influence of alcohol; how long did it last?
 5       A.   He was all right.  He wasn't good for himself because after a few
 6    days, he wouldn't even know what he was saying.  He would be just
 7    babbling.  But as far as we were concerned, he was okay.  He didn't abuse
 8    us.  He adored the children.  The only thing that was a fact was that this
 9    drinking was not good for him.
10       Q.   When you say, "It wasn't good for him, not for us," what exactly
11    do you mean?  Are you thinking about the consequences of that drinking or
12    are you thinking about something else?
13       A.   He wasn't aggressive.  He wasn't -- the only thing was that he
14    couldn't pull himself out of it.  After two or three days, he could no
15    longer eat.  He was no longer aware of what he was saying.  He would rant
16    so that we would always have to take him to see the doctor.
17       Q.   As far as you can remember, when was the first time that he went
18    for treatment because of this, in view of the birth of your daughter and
19    son?  Was this before or after the birth of this children?
20       A.   He first went for treatment between 1980 and 1985, 1986.  I'm not
21    exactly sure when.
22       Q.   Do you remember where he went for this treatment?
23       A.   He went for treatment.  He reported to the doctor here first.
24    It's a small town, so there aren't the proper facilities for that.  So
25    then he would go further afield.  Uzice was the closest.  When he went for

 1    more serious treatment, then he went to Uzice, in the 1980s, for therapy,
 2    for treatment.
 3       Q.   So he was treated both as an in-patient and an out-patient?
 4       A.   Yes, that's right.
 5       Q.   This period that we're talking about, that we were discussing a
 6    little while ago, May 1992 when he was in Prelovo, this thing that
 7    happened at Uzamnica that you heard about, this state that he was in, was
 8    that the first time in that period that he had such an episode?
 9       A.   Yes.  That was the first time.
10       Q.   I think that you said that according to you, he spent two or three
11    days at Uzamnica.  Did you visit him in that time?  Did you actually go
12    and visit him?
13       A.   No.  No.  I didn't even know until others told me, because he
14    didn't come home and then I had to ask where he was.
15       Q.   Can you please tell us what happened to him when he was released
16    from the prison at Uzamnica?
17       A.   When he was released from prison, he didn't have a weapon at that
18    time.  I don't know who gave him this assignment.  He went out to clean
19    the town.  All the window -- all the shop windows were broken.  I was
20    working in the town at that time, so I used to go out with the others and
21    clean, because all the shop windows were broken.  There was glass all over
22    the place.  Also, there was even cattle wandering around on the street.
23       Q.   So according to you, after he was released from Uzamnica, he was
24    charged with organising the cleaning of the town.
25       A.   Yes.

 1       Q.   You say that somebody assigned him to do this, but you don't say
 2    who.  Do you know who it was?
 3       A.   I don't know who assigned him.  Most probably somebody at the
 4    command.  I don't know.
 5       Q.   You stated awhile ago that since his release from Uzamnica, he
 6    didn't have a weapon.  Do you know what happened to the weapon that he was
 7    issued with?
 8       A.   They confiscated his weapon because they saw what a state he was
 9    in.  They took his weapon at Uzamnica because he couldn't carry a weapon
10    in the state that he was in.
11       Q.   So on his release from Uzamnica and when he came home afterwards,
12    he was without a weapon, and I assume that you say that and that you heard
13    that.
14       A.   Yes, that's right.
15       Q.   And the next few days after that, was he issued with a weapon or
16    did he have a weapon?
17       A.   I don't know.  I can't remember if he had s weapon after that,
18    no.
19       Q.   Is your answer no or are you not sure or you didn't see?  Could
20    you please be more specific?
21       A.   No.  I don't know.
22       Q.   You worked in a shop in the centre of town.
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And you say that not only did you see him but that you also took
25    part in the cleaning of the town.

 1       A.   Yes.  We all took part, regardless of our nationality, our
 2    position.  Serbs, Muslims, we all participated in this cleaning.
 3       Q.   On those occasions when you saw him, what was he wearing?
 4       A.   He wore an olive-grey uniform, trousers, and then he wore a
 5    T-shirt of his own.  He also had a band around -- a ribbon around his
 6    arm.
 7       Q.   On those occasions or on any occasion when he was supervising or
 8    carrying out this cleaning around town, did he have any weapons?
 9       A.   No.  He didn't have any weapons with him.
10       Q.   At that time perhaps, did he have a weapon at home?
11       A.   No.  I don't remember that he had a weapon at home.
12       Q.   You said a little earlier on that many people, different people,
13    participated in these actions or to clean the streets.  Could you please
14    explain that a little more?  Were people cleaning in front of their shops
15    or a little more than that?  Could you explain how this was organised?
16       A.   Well, everybody would clean in front of their shop.  The shop
17    windows were broken, so that we would all be cleaning in front of our
18    shops.
19       Q.   And let me ask you this:  Before this action that he managed,
20    before it started, wasn't there any other company or organisation that
21    could have carried this job out?  Was there anybody responsible for
22    cleaning the town?
23       A.   No.  No, there wasn't any kind of organisation to clean the town
24    so that he was the one conducting this action along with the people who
25    were cleaning together with him.

 1       Q.   Did you personally notice or hear from anybody if there were any
 2    problems regarding this cleaning, whether anybody refused or anybody was
 3    forced to participate in that?  Were there any incidents like that?
 4       A.   No.  No, there weren't any incidents like that.  Nobody had to do
 5    it.  Everybody would clean in front of their own shop.  Nobody wanted to
 6    have garbage and things like that in front of their shop.
 7       Q.   At that time, the time your husband was at Uzamnica, was there a
 8    death in his family?
 9       A.   Yes.  His uncle's son was killed.  We didn't know exactly what
10    happened for two or three days, then we found out what happened.  This
11    perhaps happened on the 1st or the 2nd of June, I'm not quite sure about
12    the date, when he was killed.
13       Q.   When you say it was his uncle's son, was it his mother's brother?
14       A.   Yes, that's right.  Zeljko Sikric was killed.  I think somebody
15    else was also killed along with him, five or six people, so that Mitar was
16    very moved or affected by this.  So that's how it was.
17       Q.   Where did Zeljko Sikric live?
18       A.   He lived in Vardiste.
19       Q.   Is that where his parents lived as well?
20       A.   Yes, that's right.  He had a mother and father, and he didn't have
21    anyone else.
22       Q.   What was his father doing?  What was his father's work at that
23    time?
24       A.   I don't understand.  Whose father?
25       Q.   The father of Zeljko Sikric, Mitar's uncle.

 1       A.   I have no idea what he did.
 2       Q.   And I'm thinking about his profession, what was his work?
 3       A.   He had his cafe, a cafe of his own, a restaurant, and he was most
 4    probably working there.  I don't know.
 5       Q.   Do you remember whether, in that period, Mitar used to go and see
 6    them, according to the custom, and to express his condolences?
 7       A.   Of course.  Of course, Mitar went to express his condolences.  He
 8    was very much affected by what happened.
 9       Q.   Was this before Zeljko Sikric's funeral?
10       A.   Yes.  Yes, before the funeral.  Later we went to the funeral.
11    That took place sometime later, sometime on the 5th or the 6th of June,
12    I'm not exactly sure when.  I don't know the exact date.
13       Q.   So you went to the funeral together with Mitar, to Zeljko Sikric's
14    funeral?
15       A.   Yes, that's right.
16       Q.   If you don't know the exact date, do you perhaps remember which
17    day of the week it was?
18       A.   I think it was a Saturday.  I don't know.  A Saturday.
19       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, as far as you can recall, if Zeljko Sikric was
20    killed on the 1st or the 2nd and, as you say, he was perhaps buried on the
21    5th or the 6th, so several days after the funeral, is it customary, and if
22    not, do you know why was the funeral held so many days later?
23       A.   The funeral was late because they were killed and probably they
24    couldn't find them, and this was perhaps somewhere deep in the woods.  I
25    don't know.  So it took time for them to bring the body.  War operations

 1    were going on and so on.
 2       Q.   So you went to that funeral with your husband on the 5th or the
 3    6th.  You assume it was a Saturday.  And after that, you probably came
 4    back to Visegrad.
 5       A.   After that, we came to Visegrad, yes.  Mitar was drinking more
 6    heavily.  He was upset and so on.
 7       Q.   So what happened after that, in the days after that?  Is there
 8    something that particularly drew your attention or would particularly
 9    remind you of what he was doing, of his conduct?
10       A.   Well, two or three days later, he came home and he was very
11    upset.  He was ranting.  He was talking and not making sense.  He was
12    talking about Stanko Pecikoza, he was talking about Milan Lukic.
13       Q.   Just one moment, please.  Did you say a day or two later?
14       A.   I think it was a day afterwards.
15       Q.   In the interpretation, it says two or three days later, but the
16    witness didn't say that.  She said a day or two later.  Just one moment,
17    please.
18            Very well.  You may continue.  So what was it that happened a day
19    or two later?
20       A.   A day or two later, he came.  He was upset.  He was not making
21    sense.  He was talking about a colleague of his and his son.  I asked him
22    to sleep it off, to rest.  I didn't know what it was all about.  He kept
23    saying that he would go to report something.  And I said, "What is it all
24    about?" and he kept mentioning a colleague of his.  I think his name was
25    Meho.  And that night, I didn't allow him to go out, because I saw that he

 1    was very disturbed and that he was ranting, and what he was saying wasn't
 2    making sense.
 3       Q.   So did he stay at home that evening?
 4       A.   Yes.  Yes.  He stayed at home that evening because I asked him to
 5    calm down a bit.  He kept saying that he had to go.  And I said, "Where do
 6    you want to go?"  And he said, "I need to go to report this to Tomic," who
 7    was at SUP.  But that evening, he didn't go.  We got up the next day and
 8    he left, and he said that he was going to report this case.
 9       Q.   And did he go the next day?
10       A.   Yes, he did.  He got up in the morning and he went.  He didn't
11    come back until the evening.  Of course, he went to report it.
12       Q.   You say that that evening he returned only in the late afternoon,
13    in the evening.
14       A.   Yes.  He returned only in the evening.
15       Q.   And what did he look like to you then?  Did you -- did he look to
16    you as if he had been drinking?
17       A.   Yes.  Yes.  He'd been drinking.  He was very distressed.  He was
18    very cut up about this colleague, because he'd worked with him for years,
19    and he was elderly man.  And that day was Nikola's birthday, so many
20    people came.  Many friends, many colleagues came.
21       Q.   When you mention "colleague," then whom do you mean?
22       A.   He mentioned Meho.  Dzafic or something.  I'm not sure.
23       Q.   Did you know that Meho Dzafic personally?
24       A.   Yes, yes, yes, I did.  I knew all his colleagues.  Not only Meho,
25    everybody.  I knew them all.

 1       Q.   Can you tell us something about their relations at the time when
 2    they worked together?
 3       A.   Excellent.  Meho used to visit us, and he would often bring my
 4    husband home, like all the other colleagues, because he had a small Fiat.
 5    Or whenever we were celebrating something, a birthday or something, all
 6    the colleagues would come to our place regardless of their ethnic origin.
 7    I'd say there were even more Muslims than others when Nikola's birthday
 8    was.  I think there were more Muslims than our folk.
 9       Q.   Do you know if he ever had any words with this Meho Dzafic or did
10    they -- had they fallen out or had anything happened?
11       A.   No, no, never.  He never had any quarrels, any words with any of
12    his colleagues ever.
13       Q.   Not even when he was on a drinking bout?  No?
14       A.   No, no, no.  When he did drink, he was very funny.  It was bad for
15    him, but everybody else enjoyed it because he usually spent all his
16    money.  He'd be -- he'd come -- he'd come home or be somewhere and pay for
17    all this brandy and sit with them.
18       Q.   Awhile ago, Mrs. Vasiljevic, you mentioned a surname, Tomic.  Who
19    was that?
20       A.   Tomic.  Tomic was the chief, the chief of the police, I think.  He
21    was our neighbour too.  So he went to see him and told him the whole
22    story.
23       Q.   Do you remember his first name?
24       A.   Dragan Tomic.  That's it, Dragan Tomic.
25       Q.   Since he was your neighbour and you knew him, what do you think of

 1    him as a man or a policeman?
 2       A.   He was a very good man.  Everybody knew him.
 3       Q.   And do you know what happened to him?
 4       A.   I think he was killed in June or July.  I don't know.
 5       Q.   That same year or some other?
 6       A.   Yes.  Yes, that same year.  That same year, but I just don't know
 7    the date.
 8       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, what you were telling us about is June, I guess,
 9    because you said that that was the time when the funeral took place, and
10    then a day or two later, this story that he gave you.  So this must have
11    been the former half of June.  Do you remember then, what did your
12    husband, Mitar, do after that?  Let me just finish my question.  Did he
13    continue with this cleaning drive in the town?
14       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  He went on cleaning the city.  Everything was very
15    neat, very tidy.  He wasn't alone.  Other people, whoever -- whoever
16    wanted the town to be clean and nice did it too.
17       Q.   And was the town clean after that?
18       A.   After all that, the town was truly clean.
19       Q.   And until when was Mitar engaged in this work?
20       A.   Mitar did that until -- until he broke his leg, and he broke his
21    leg -- he broke his leg -- the uncle let me know.  It was -- oh, yes, the
22    14th of June.  And that was Sunday.  I was having a day off, and I was at
23    home.  It was in the evening, around 7.00 or 8.00 when the uncle called me
24    from Vardiste and said, "Listen, Mitar's here.  He's broken his leg."  And
25    I asked was that really so, and he said yes, that some people who were

 1    with him, a driver or somebody, that they had dropped by and brought him
 2    there.  That was, yes, the 14th of June.  It was our holiday.
 3       Q.   A religious holiday?
 4       A.   A religious holiday, the Holy Trinity.
 5       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, you said that it was his uncle who had called you
 6    from Vardiste; whom do you mean?
 7       A.   Dobrivoje Sikric.  He said that Savic had brought him, the driver,
 8    and he had given a blanket to cover him because he was cold and that he
 9    was somewhere in the town when he broke his leg.  I found out later on how
10    it all had happened.
11       Q.   So before that, nobody else had let you know that that had
12    happened, that he had broken his leg?
13       A.   No, of course I would have known, but no.
14       Q.   Can you tell us what did you mean when you said that he called you
15    and then you said something, "Is that all," or "Was that all?"  Why did
16    you say that?  Why did you ask that, "Is that true?"
17       A.   Well, I asked the uncle was that true that he had broken his leg
18    or something else.  And he said yes, he broke his leg and told me who had
19    brought him to his place and that he was cold, that he had been given a
20    blanket, that he had offered him some juice.
21       Q.   Perhaps you suspected that it was a more severe injury and that is
22    perhaps why you thought that the uncle wasn't telling quite the truth not
23    all together; is that why you asked that?
24       A.   No, no, no.  I meant just whether that was -- that was true, and
25    that is why I asked him and he said, "Yes, I'm telling you the truth.

 1    He's broken his leg."  I mean that was that night.
 2       Q.   And did you visit him while he was in hospital?
 3       A.   Yes, of course I did.
 4       Q.   Do you know if he was -- if he had surgical intervention at
 5    hospital?
 6       A.   Yes, yes.  He was operated on and he had a 9 kilogram weight on
 7    his leg so he could not move.
 8       Q.   When you visited him for the first time, was that after the
 9    surgery?  Was he already in the room with those weights or ...
10       A.   That's right, yes.  I went to see him a day or two after the
11    operation, and I went after that too.
12       Q.   You said that it was a 9 kilogram weight or something was
13    applied.  Does it mean that he was completely bedridden, he could not move
14    around, he could not get up?
15       A.   Yes.  That was a 9 kilogram weight which was suspended over the
16    bed, and he simply could not move anywhere.  He could not go anywhere.
17       Q.   And was he in that position all the time while he was in the
18    orthopaedic ward of the hospital?
19       A.   Well, yes.  I think that was the period of extension, and it
20    lasted for 21 days.
21       Q.   And what happened after that, after those 21 days or three weeks
22    when that part of his treatment was over, was he released to go home?
23       A.   No, because at that time he had something like a nervous breakdown
24    and he was taken to the psychiatric ward, and there he spent some time
25    too, and I visited him there.

 1       Q.   Were you allowed to see him there as --
 2       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, yes, they did, of course they did.  And he
 3    spent some time there, I think until -- until July because he kept
 4    ranting, and it was later on that I asked that he be released because I
 5    really realised that he didn't know what he was talking.  I mean what he
 6    said made no sense so that I asked the doctor, I believe the doctor's name
 7    was Simic, and I asked if I could take such a man home and he said "Yes,
 8    but you need to supervise him," that I had to take care of his medicines,
 9    that he always had them in time.  His leg was in a plaster cast so that is
10    how he came out of the hospital.
11       Q.   You said that when -- that he had his leg in a cast.  Does this
12    mean that this whole leg was in the cast?
13       A.   Yes, his whole leg was in the cast.  Later on, when he went on
14    check-ups, I think that they cut it and it was only down to his knee, and
15    then it was made even smaller.  They kept making this cast ever shorter.
16       Q.   Just a moment.  Let's go back a little, Mrs. Vasiljevic.  You
17    visited him even before he was taken to the neuropsychiatric ward, and you
18    told us how he made no sense when he talked, when he ranted and rambled,
19    and you said you couldn't make head or tail of what he was saying.  Did
20    this happen whilst he was still in the orthopaedic ward or not?
21       A.   I can't remember properly.
22       Q.   Let me explain what I mean.  Did you observe any out of the
23    ordinary behaviour on his part whilst he was still in the orthopaedic
24    ward?
25       A.   Yes.  Yes.  I did.  I could see that he was not quite all right

 1    and that he wasn't quite himself so that even the doctors could see that
 2    he was not all there and that he must have suffered a nervous breakdown,
 3    and that is why they took him to the neuropsychiatric ward.
 4       Q.   Did the doctors complain about his behaviour or about the way that
 5    he treated other patients?
 6       A.   I don't know.  I'm not aware of that.
 7       Q.   In the room that he was in, were there other patients too?
 8       A.   Yes, of course there were more patients there.  I know that one
 9    man from Visegrad helped him, helped him to get certain things, brought
10    him things because he really could not move anywhere.
11       Q.   When you say, Mrs. Vasiljevic, that nobody could make head or tail
12    of what he was saying, that he rambled, do you remember any details?
13       A.   Yes.  I know there was a Muslim there in the same hospital, but I
14    just don't know his name.  He was in a bed next to him.
15       Q.   But do you know anything about their relations, were there any
16    problems?  Were they in trouble between the two of them?  Do you know
17    anything about that?
18       A.   No, I don't know anything.  I don't remember.
19       Q.   Let me go back to what I asked you a moment ago.  Do you remember
20    something specific, any detail about those ramblings of your husband when
21    you said that you had concluded that he was ranting that something was
22    wrong?
23       A.   Well, I just could realise what he was saying was nonsense.
24    "We'll live there.  We'll live there."  I could immediately see that
25    something was wrong.  He didn't even ask about children, and he doted on

 1    them.  He always asked about them.  He always inquired after them, and on
 2    that occasion, he never said a word, and that is when I suggested that he
 3    should perhaps go home.
 4       Q.   And did his behaviour on that occasion remind you of the way that
 5    he behaved after those drinking bouts and binges?  Did it look anything
 6    like that?
 7       A.   Well, yes, in a way, except that it was more of that.  But yes,
 8    there were similar situations before, yes.
 9       Q.   You said that he came out of the hospital at your request.
10       A.   That's right.
11       Q.   Does that mean that the doctors were not for discharging him from
12    the hospital and that you requested that?
13       A.   That is true.  The doctors opposed it.  But I signed that I
14    would -- that I was taking him home, because he was really ranting.  He
15    didn't know.  He wasn't aware of anything that was happening around him.
16       Q.   And did you then sign that you were assuming the risk, that you
17    were doing it under your own responsibility?
18       A.   That is right.  I wanted to take him home.
19       Q.   Was anyone else with you when you came to get him from the
20    hospital?
21       A.   Yes.  His uncle came, Dobrivoje Sikric.  And we took him out of
22    the hospital at my initiative.
23       Q.   And where did you take him then?
24       A.   I took him back home.  But I had to take care that he took his
25    medicines regularly and what medicines he took.

 1       Q.   And did he take them all?
 2       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  He took all his medicines under my supervision.
 3       Q.   And did his health, I mean mental health, improve after he
 4    returned home?
 5       A.   Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  No doubt about that.
 6       Q.   And was he still in a plaster cast?  You said a leg-long plaster
 7    cast.  That is what you said, isn't it?
 8       A.   It is.
 9       Q.   Do you remember how long did he have this cast?
10       A.   For a very long time.  We went for check-ups every 15 to 20 days,
11    and the doctors said when it had to be shorter.  So for a while it was
12    down to the knee.  Then after that, they cut it further.
13       Q.   Did you take him for controls both to the orthopaedic surgeon and
14    to doctors who were taking care of his mental state?
15       A.   Yes, yes, both the orthopaedic surgeon and those others, because
16    we had exactly the schedule when he had to report for controls.
17       Q.   And where did these examinations take place?
18       A.   In Uzice.
19       Q.   And before going to Uzice, did he have to go for a control in
20    Visegrad?
21       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  He would first go to a doctor in Visegrad, and
22    they'd give the piece of paper and then he'd go to Uzice.
23       Q.   So in Visegrad, you would be given a document, a referral document
24    to go to a doctor in Uzice.  Is that what you say -- what you're saying?
25       A.   Yes, yes.

 1       Q.   Do you remember and did you see what kind of a fracture did your
 2    husband suffer?
 3       A.   Well, I know that he broke his leg, but how, I don't know.
 4    Whether both bones or one, I don't know.  We had the X-rays, but we were
 5    moving house, we lost it.  Had I known this would happen, I would of
 6    course have looked after it.
 7       Q.   I was about to ask you that.  Did you have these X-rays at home?
 8       A.   Yes, we must have had them.  Of course we did have them.  But we
 9    moved house and, I suppose, misplaced them somewhere.
10       Q.   How long, as far as you can remember, how long was he treated for
11    this fracture?
12       A.   A long time.  A very long time.
13       Q.   When you say "long," does it mean several months?
14       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  It took several months.
15       Q.   And after he recovered, what did he do then?
16       A.   I don't know.  I cannot remember.  I know he broke his leg again
17    in 1993.
18       Q.   Yes.  I was about to ask you that.  Will you explain to me what
19    you know about this?
20       A.   He broke his leg again in 1993, on the 6th of May, the same leg.
21    We were at the Slava at his father's, and he broke the same leg, except
22    three centimetres below the first fracture or above the first fracture.  I
23    can't remember.
24       Q.   When you say the 6th of May and the Slava, what Slava is that?
25       A.   That is St. George's Day, the 6th of May, at the father's.

 1       Q.   And where did Mitar Vasiljevic's father live?
 2       A.   In the village of Dzurevici.
 3       Q.   So the second fracture happened in Dzurevici?
 4       A.   Yes, yes.  That's right.
 5       Q.   And where was he taken for treatment?
 6       A.   To Uzice once again, except that they did not apply weights,
 7    because he knew that he wasn't supposed to move and he didn't, and they
 8    did not have to put the two fragments of bone together.  I don't know.
 9       Q.   Do you mean that on that second occasion he was hospitalised for a
10    much shorter time?
11       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  He wasn't there for 21 days.  He did not have to
12    carry this weight.  There was no need to put his leg in extension.
13       Q.   And after that, did he need crutches?
14       A.   Yes, of course.  It was -- he was again in the plaster cast,
15    except that it wasn't that -- that big as the first time.  And he again
16    had to go for check-ups.  And after all that, he went to a spa in 1993.
17    The first time he didn't go to a spa because the spa was closed.
18       Q.   When you say "the spa," do you mean rehabilitation?
19       A.   Yes, yes.  That's it.  After the fracture in 1993, he went for
20    rehabilitation, that is, when the leg was all right.  It was then that he
21    went to a spa.
22       Q.   After that, did he undergo any noteworthy operations again?
23       A.   Yes.  In 1994, he had his spine operated in Belgrade.  I think it
24    was the 16th of June, 1994, in Zemun.
25       Q.   And after that, was he treated; that is, did he undergo

 1    rehabilitation?
 2       A.   Yes, but that treatment lasted a little longer, in a spa, and then
 3    there were further controls for about 20 days.
 4       Q.   Do you know if after that, after he had recovered from that
 5    surgery, if after that he was wounded, he suffered that mishap?  Could you
 6    explain what it was about?
 7       A.   Well, he received a wound in his leg, quite by accident.  I was
 8    visiting his parents in his village, and they called me to let me know
 9    that he was at the hospital in Sokolac.  And then I think he had injured
10    the middle toe on his left foot, but I'm not sure about which one exactly.
11       Q.   Do you know how it happened?
12       A.   I think he went -- no, I don't know.
13       Q.   Or rather was it somebody else who injured him or did he injure
14    himself?
15       A.   He did it himself.  He had picked up a rifle to move it and that
16    rifle fired and hit him in his toe.
17       Q.   Mrs. Vasiljevic, I am going to finish now by moving on to another
18    subject.  In the beginning of your testimony today, you said that you had
19    graduated from the secondary commercial school and started to work.  Since
20    many witnesses have already said that they saw you at your place of work,
21    I would like you, if you can, please tell us or mention for us all the
22    places that you worked and the periods when you worked there.
23       A.   I started to work as full-time staffer in 1985.  I worked in
24    Prelovo, Sase, in all parts of the town.  I worked in Crnca, Dusce, I
25    worked at the department store and also at all of the UPI stores.

 1       Q.   Can you give us that in some kind of order, and I'm interested
 2    particularly in the period up until 1992?  Because what you have just
 3    said, this period that you are talking about is before 1992.  So could you
 4    please tell us.
 5       A.   I worked at Prelovo, Sase, Crnca, Dusce, and in all of the UPI
 6    stores in town.
 7     Q.  When you mentioned Sase, did you know a man by the name of (redacted)
 8    (redacted)?
 9       A.   Yes, I knew him well.  I worked not far from his house, perhaps
10    100 or 200 metres away.
11       Q.   Can you tell us anything that you know about him in a little more
12    detail from that period?
13       A.   He liked to drink and he would always stick around in the shop.
14    He would drink and sing, make merry.  He would always greet me, say hello
15    to me.  I knew his whole family.  Sometimes he would drop by with Mitar
16    for a drink because he worked at Terpentin.  He would always celebrate
17    Mitar's day and he said, "If I was a Serb, I would be called Mitar."  He
18    always also used to treat us when we were at the store.
19       Q.   When you say he came to the store, tell us, was it a custom for
20    people to drink in the store?
21       A.   Yes.  Yes.  That's right.  And he would always treat everybody.
22    He also used to stop by with Mitar and they would have a drink or stop by
23    with company.
24       Q.   And you mean in the store as well?
25       A.   Yes, yes, at Sase where I worked.  He would drop by after work if

 1    we would -- the store would still be open because we merchants would keep
 2    our shops open a little longer so then he would stay until closing time.
 3       Q.   Do you remember that he said that he was born on the 8th of
 4    November?
 5       A.   Yes, that's right.  The 8th of November is Serbian Slava, Mitar's
 6    day, so Mitar was named after that.  Well, he never worked on that day and
 7    he said, "If I were a Serb, I would be called Mitar."  And he never worked
 8    on that day, he would just go around and celebrate.  He would treat
 9    people.
10       Q.   Can you please tell me something about Mitar's family?  Did he
11    have any brothers and sisters and if he did, who, where did they live,
12    were they older or younger than him?
13       A.   Mitar was the eldest child of his parents, and he had two younger
14    sisters and the youngest brother, and he also had a half-sister.  His
15    brother lived in Belgrade and he lives there to this day.  His sisters,
16    one of them is in Belgrade, one of them is in Prelovo, and the other one
17    is in Vardiste.
18       Q.   You mentioned that he had a half-sister; is that a half-sister
19    from his father or from his mother's side?
20       A.   That is a half-sister on his father's side.
21       Q.   Does that mean that he lost his mother or that his father divorced
22    his mother?
23       A.   Mitar lost his mother when he was a young boy.  His mother
24    disappeared when Mitar was perhaps 8 years old.  I don't know exactly.
25       Q.   So his father got married again and so this half-sister is from

 1    his father's second marriage, if I understood you properly?
 2       A.   Yes, that's right.
 3       Q.   And is his stepmother still alive today?
 4       A.   Yes, she is.
 5       Q.   I would like to ask you now something about the families' kums,
 6    that you entered into these kum relationships between the family that you
 7    married into, the Vasiljevic family, and the Lukic family.  What do you
 8    know about this kum relationship?
 9       A.   The families Lukic and Vasiljevic are -- have a kum relationship,
10    and this relationship is maybe 100 or 200 years old.  It was passed down
11    from generation to generation, and in our custom, it is not something that
12    should be broken because in our belief, if somebody happens, if you break
13    off a kumship, then if something bad happens, it can be interpreted that
14    it happened because of that.
15            So the kumship is passed down from father to son, so the oldest
16    son inherits this relationship.  If there is no son, then the daughter can
17    inherit this relationship.
18       Q.   In this particular case, your husband's family, the kumship was
19    taken over by -- inherited by his father, Ljubo.  According to tradition,
20    Mitar, as the oldest son, was supposed to carry it on.
21       A.   Yes, exactly, that's how it works.  The oldest male child would
22    inherit this relationship from the father, and then it is passed down to
23    the next generation.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  You are running over without any regard to the
25    translation.  You must pause, please.

 1            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
 2       Q.   And his brother, and you said this was his younger brother, where
 3    did he live?
 4       A.   His younger brother lived and still lives in Belgrade, and he went
 5    to Belgrade as soon as he finished school.  That's where he lives and he
 6    works there.
 7       Q.   I would like to ask you now about some people from that family,
 8    the Lukic family, that the Vasiljevic family was in a kum relationship
 9    with.  I would first of all like to ask you about Milan Lukic.  Do you
10    know who Milan Lukic is?
11       A.   Yes, I do, because his father is the eldest kum so of course I
12    know about him.  I know that he has four children.  I don't know them
13    all.  I only know one son.  Afterwards when the war started, I saw Milan
14    once or twice.  I never seen him before.  I don't know where he was.  I
15    still don't know the other two children.  I think they are somewhere
16    abroad.
17       Q.   Could you please answer my question because in this way, you said
18    something that I'm afraid I didn't understand too well and I probably
19    think others didn't understand it too.  So let's do this properly.  When
20    you said, "I know he had four children," who did you mean?
21       A.   Our kum, Milan Lukic's father, had several children.  So of course
22    I know Milan, but I never saw him before.  So when we were talking about
23    the old kum, how many children he said, I never saw Milan.  And until the
24    war broke out, I didn't know where he was or what he was doing.  I only
25    saw him two or three times.

 1       Q.   If I understood you properly, you said that until the war, you
 2    never saw Milan Lukic and that he wasn't in Visegrad.
 3       A.   No, I never saw him before.
 4       Q.   Please slow down.  When you say "up until the war," do you mean
 5    this period in 1992 which we talked about?  Do you remember when you saw
 6    him for the first time and on which occasions you saw him?
 7       A.   I saw him once when Mitar broke his leg.  He came to visit him for
 8    about five minutes.  Maybe sometimes as he was passing by on his way to
 9    work.  I never spent any time with him.  I never sat down with him or
10    anything like that.
11       Q.   Do you know if he came to your house before Mitar was hurt on the
12    Holy Trinity day?
13       A.   No, he never did.
14       Q.   You said a few minutes ago that Mitar said that towards the end of
15    his stay in Prelovo, Milan Lukic brought him home.  On that occasion did
16    he come up to the house and did you see him on that occasion?
17       A.   No.  Mitar just told me that, and I didn't.  No.  Mitar told me,
18    but I didn't see him personally.  Perhaps I was at work or I was out of
19    the house.
20       Q.   And later, when Mitar told you about something that happened to
21    his colleague, and you explained that in a little bit more detail, did he
22    mention Milan Lukic at that time?
23       A.   Mitar only mentioned something.  He was ranting, talking.  I
24    wasn't there, so I don't know what happened.  When he came home, he was
25    talking without making any sense, that it was something about his

 1    colleague and his colleague's son and so on.
 2       Q.   Do you know who brought him home on that occasion?
 3       A.   I don't know.
 4       Q.   Do you know, did you personally see or did you hear from Mitar
 5    whether after what you just said - until the time he was injured and taken
 6    to the Uzice hospital, do you know whether in that period he saw Milan
 7    Lukic?
 8       A.   I don't know whether perhaps at weddings or some kind of
 9    celebration if Mitar saw him, but he never came to our house.
10       Q.   I think you didn't understand my question.  My question relates to
11    only the period from that day when he came home, and you said he was
12    ranting and talking without any sense, until the time he went to the Uzice
13    hospital.  So in that period.
14       A.   No, no.  I don't know.
15       Q.   Did you know Stanko Pecikoza?
16       A.   Yes, of course.  He made all the doors and the windows on our
17    house, and he was also our neighbour.  He was one of the best men in
18    Visegrad.
19       Q.   Can you tell us, please, what he did?  What was his profession?
20       A.   He had his own personal store.  He was a carpenter.  He also cut
21    construction material.  He was also a very good host, a very good man.  He
22    took care of his household.
23       Q.   Did your husband socialise with him?
24       A.   No.  They -- they worked for a while.  We didn't have enough money
25    to make the windows and the doors on our house, so he did that, and then

 1    Mitar worked for him in order to pay off his debt.
 2       Q.   So what you're saying is that Mitar worked in his shop, and in
 3    return he received the doors and the windows to the house that you were
 4    building.
 5       A.   Yes, that's right.  Before the war, he made our balcony doors and
 6    the windows, and he was supposed to make something else.  Unfortunately,
 7    he was killed, so he didn't get to do it.  But his son did that
 8    afterwards.
 9       Q.   What did his son do?
10       A.   Before the war, Stanko made the windows for our balcony, our front
11    door, and he was supposed to make another external front door.
12    Unfortunately, in the meantime, he was killed, so then his son made those
13    doors after, afterwards, after he was killed.
14       Q.   Do you know, did you hear how he was killed?
15       A.   I don't know exactly how he was killed.  I think somebody killed
16    him and they found him somewhere in a car, but I don't know exactly.
17       Q.   That evening when Mitar came and he talked about Meho and all the
18    other things, did he mention Stanko Pecikoza at that time?  Do you
19    remember?
20       A.   Yes.  Mitar met Stanko somewhere in town.  I don't know where.
21    And he said he was looking for Milan, and they went towards Vilina Vlas to
22    look for Milan.  They went to Banja together, and Mitar came back from
23    there.  I don't know who brought him back.
24       Q.   And you found this out from Mitar, from his story, from what he
25    told you?

 1       A.   Yes, I did.
 2       Q.   Do you know whether Stanko Pecikoza, whom you described as a
 3    wealthy and very good man and businessman, employed his Muslim neighbours
 4    and protected them?
 5       A.   Yes.  Whoever wanted to work could get a job from him and have
 6    enough money to survive.
 7       Q.   I just want to go back and discuss a few more things about Milan
 8    Lukic.  Do you know that your Mitar was his best man, his witness at his
 9    wedding?  Do you know that?
10       A.   Yes, I do.  Just in passing, since Mitar is the oldest child and
11    according to our beliefs a kum should not be changed, my father-in-law was
12    out in the village, away, he was sick, so he met Mitar, and of course he
13    wanted to have him as a kum.  He wouldn't change.
14            I wasn't there, so I don't know when this happened.  Mitar and
15    another witness - I don't know who it was - went to attend his wedding
16    ceremony, and it took 10 or 15 minutes.
17       Q.   Did you hear that afterwards, after the wedding, or were you told
18    before the wedding?
19       A.   I heard it after the wedding, because according to our beliefs in
20    our nation, an offer of kumship is never refused no matter who it is.  An
21    offer to be somebody's kum is never refused.
22       Q.   Did you hear who else attended the ceremony?
23       A.   I didn't.  I don't know.
24       Q.   Did Mitar ever tell you anything about that?
25       A.   I don't remember.

 1       Q.   Do you know that later, Mitar was the godfather at his daughter's
 2    christening?  And if this happened, were you also present?
 3       A.   Yes.  The child was christened on the 27th or the 28th in 1996 or
 4    1997.  I don't know.
 5       Q.   Were you present at the christening?
 6       A.   No, just Mitar and the children, because I was at work.
 7       Q.   Was that the only reason why you didn't attend the ceremony?
 8       A.   I couldn't be absent from work because there weren't enough
 9    workers at that time.
10       Q.   Does this mean that this was a work day?
11       A.   Yes, it was.
12       Q.   In that period, did you know somebody who had the same name, first
13    name as your husband Mitar, but his last name is Knezevic?
14       A.   Yes.  When I was working in Prelovo, that's where he was born.  I
15    never saw him personally, but he appeared out of nowhere from -- during
16    the war.  However, before the war, I never saw him but during the war, he
17    sort of appeared.  I don't know where he came from.  And sometimes in
18    passing on my way to work, he wore a big fur hat, he had a beard.  He
19    didn't have one eye, and he looked pretty terrible, and that's why I
20    noticed him.
21            I don't remember where he was, but I -- the only thing I remember
22    is that he just appeared from somewhere during the war.
23       Q.   Except for that, you seeing him, did you ever hear from anybody
24    that he did something that wasn't allowed?
25       A.   Well, yes, I did.  I heard that he did commit or do a lot of

 1    things that are not supposed to be done.
 2       Q.   Yes, I understand that you didn't see, but can you please tell us
 3    what you heard about it?
 4       A.   I heard that he took part in house burning, but I don't know.  I
 5    wasn't there.  I didn't see it.  Ugly things, but I don't remember what
 6    were all the things that he did.  --
 7       Q.   When you say "ugly things," can you tell us or -- I mean you said
 8    you don't remember.  What is this about?
 9       A.   -- I heard from people that he did all kinds of things, but I
10    can't remember all the things that he did.
11       Q.   Were there other soldiers or paramilitaries, unofficial formations
12    around who also did ugly things as you said?  Did you hear about that?
13       A.   Yes, I heard that there were also paramilitaries, but I don't know
14    who did what.
15       Q.   Was Mitar Knezevic one of those people, according to what you
16    heard?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   Besides the same name that he shared with your husband, did he
19    resemble your husband in any way?
20       A.   No, no.  He had a beard.  He had a big black hat, subara, a fur
21    hat, he didn't have one eye.  His nickname was "Chetnik."
22       Q.   Now that you mention the hat, did your husband have a hat that he
23    would wear occasionally?
24       A.   Yes, perhaps occasionally a small hat, but perhaps he wore it
25    occasionally, a small hat, but he didn't wear it every day.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, may I suggest that you ask the witness
 2    what was the fur hat that Mitar Knezevic wore, what was the shape of it.
 3    I think I can understand what a fur hat is, but I think we should have it
 4    on the record.
 5            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  It's not one in any way like the ones we have had
 7    described, that's the problem, but I think we better have it properly
 8    described somewhere.
 9            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.
10       A.   He wore a subara, and there was a kind of marking on it.  I don't
11    know how to explain.
12            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
13       Q.   Can you explain to the Court what is a subara?  What kind of a
14    hat?
15       A.   It's a longer, bigger thing on your head.  It's black, and it had
16    a marking, insignia on it.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, I think what we need to know is whether
18    it has a brim.  I don't think it does, but I think we better get it
19    clear.
20            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.
21       Q.   [Interpretation] That hat, subara, that you saw on Mitar
22    Knezevic's head, does it have a brim?
23       A.   The subara can be worn straight up, but you can also fold it back.
24       Q.   Let's try it like this:  The brim is something that you have on a
25    hat and it can be wide or narrow; does a subara have such a brim?

 1       A.   To tell you the truth, I don't know.  A subara is -- everybody
 2    knows what a subara is.
 3       Q.   Perhaps you know, but maybe somebody here in the courtroom doesn't
 4    know, so could you please explain what the difference is between a subara
 5    and what we call a hat.
 6       A.   A subara is bigger and longer.  It's a tall hat.  You can wear it
 7    unfolded so that it's tall, but you can also fold is so that it has a
 8    little piece around it.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, I don't know what sort of an artist your
10    witness is but it might be an idea if she drew it.  My understanding of
11    it, and I may be very wrong, I think I'm thinking of a Russian hat, it
12    will have some sort of a flap that you can fold down over your ears, but
13    it does not have a brim.  I think we better get it clear, but we'll come
14    back to it in the morning.  We'll adjourn now until 9.30.
15                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
16                          at 4.02 p.m., to be reconvened on Friday
17                          the 16th day of November, 2001, at
