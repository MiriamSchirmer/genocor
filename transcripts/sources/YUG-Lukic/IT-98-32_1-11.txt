 2                          [Open session]
 3                          [The accused entered court]
 4                          [The witness entered court]
 5                          --- Upon commencing at 9.30 a.m.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Case number IT-98-32-T, the Prosecutor versus
 8    Mitar Vasiljevic.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, there are something like five
10    applications made which have to be disposed of, and I'm afraid you're
11    going to have to explain to me what you mean by the proposition put
12    forward by the Defence that they can prove that the Muslims were attacking
13    the Serbs.  When would be the best time to deal with those?
14            MR. GROOME:  Perhaps after this witness, Your Honour.
15            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.
16            MR. GROOME:  Perhaps after this witness, Your Honour.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  All right then.  We'll proceed with this witness at
18    this stage.
19                          WITNESS:  IB JUL HANSEN [Resumed]
20                          Examined by Mr. Groome: [Continued]
21       Q.   Investigator Hansen, we finished last week with you describing the
22    circumstances under which you showed photo arrays to witnesses VG87 and
23    VG78?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   Do you recall your testimony?

 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   I'd like to draw your attention -- did there come a time when you
 3    showed a photo array to a witness with the pseudonym VG101?
 4       A.   Yes, I did.
 5       Q.   I'd ask that the witness now be shown Exhibit 55-VG101.  It's
 6    here.  May I note for the Court, over the weekend, Your Honour, we have
 7    reorganised your binder so these exhibits are in your binder now under tab
 8    55.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
10            MR. GROOME:
11       Q.   Investigator Hansen, is that the photo array that you showed
12    witness VG101?
13       A.   Yes, I showed this photo array on the 21st of March 2001, this
14    year.
15       Q.   And that is the original array that you have before you?
16       A.   Yes.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  There is absolutely no challenge to that fact.  Why
18    do we have to get every witness to  refer to every fact when there's no
19    challenge to it?
20            MR. GROOME:  I'm trying to establish foundation for the entry of
21    that piece of evidence.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  Why wasn't it tendered at the time?  I asked
23    you at the time and you said you wanted to wait for him.  Why?  There is
24    no challenge to it.  Let's get things in as we can.
25            MR. GROOME:  If I can explain what I'm proposing to the Court.

 1    After I laid a foundation I have colour photocopies.  I've an agreement
 2    from Mr. Domazet that they will be tendered at the same time and under no
 3    objection into evidence so that the original --
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  One by one.
 5            MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour, as --
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Good.  Let's get on.
 7            MR. GROOME:
 8       Q.   Did there come a time when you showed a photo array to Witness
 9    105?
10       A.   Yes, did I.
11            MR. GROOME:  I'd ask that the witness be shown Exhibit 55-VG105.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Can't you show them to him all at once?
13            MR. GROOME:  There's only one more, Your Honour.  If you'd like
14    I'll send them up at this time.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  If there is one thing that wastes time is doing this
16    sort of thing
17       A.   This is the one that I showed to witness 105 on the 23rd of March
18    of this year.
19            MR. GROOME:
20       Q.   For two witnesses was there a different procedure followed?
21       A.   Yes.  And the reason for this different procedure followed was
22    that we ran out of arrays.  We didn't have enough.  So the procedure was
23    that the witnesses had a look at the array, pointed out the person if they
24    knew -- recognised any person, pointed out the person and then signed the
25    array on the rear side.

 1       Q.   Was their section then noted in their statement?
 2       A.   It was.
 3       Q.   And was such a procedure followed with witnesses VG13 and VG59?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5            MR. GROOME:  I'd ask that the witness be shown Exhibit 55-VG13.
 6       A.   Yes.  This is a photo spread I showed to the witnesses on -- on
 7    the 21st of July, 2000, and also on the 13th of May, 2000.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time I move or tender the
 9    following documents all Exhibit -- all number 55, but with the suffix
10    VG87, VG78, VG101, VG105, and VG13.  I would tender at this time
11    colour photocopies of those exhibits into evidence and I have an agreement
12    from Mr. Domazet that the colour copies will suffice in lieu of the
13    originals.  I have the originals in court should the Court itself wish to
14    examine the original documents.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  And that's by consent, is it?
16            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Right.  They will be Exhibits 55 with those suffixes,
18    87, 78, 101, 105, and 13.
19            MR. GROOME:
20       Q.   Investigator Hansen, did there come a time when you went to
21    Visegrad to view medical records in connection with this case?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Would you please tell the Chamber when you did that?
24       A.   I did that on the 1st of November, 2000, together with
25    Investigator Ewa, with Senior Trial Attorney Joanne Korner, and the

 1    interpreter and myself.
 2       Q.   And who were you there in Visegrad to see regarding these medical
 3    records?
 4       A.   We went to see, first of all, Mr. Domazet and also Dr. Moljevic
 5    who was supposed to arrive in Visegrad from Uzice
 6       Q.   Did you in fact meet with Dr. Moljevic?
 7       A.   Yes, we did.
 8       Q.   And did he in fact show you records which he represented to be the
 9    medical records concerning Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic?
10       A.   He did.
11       Q.   Did you also have in your possession at that time a court order
12    authorising you to seize those records?
13       A.   Yes.  We had with us a court order.
14       Q.   Did you in fact seize those records?
15       A.   We seized the records on the 1st of November, 2000.
16            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time I'd ask that the witness be
17    shown this large blue ledger.
18       Q.   Investigator Hansen, do you recognise that large blue ledger?
19       A.   Yes.  This is one of two ledgers seized on the 1st of November,
20    2000.
21       Q.   I'd ask you to take a look at the -- there's a photocopy inside
22    that -- the cover of that ledger.  That is Exhibit number 13 -- or
23    number -- Prosecution number 136.  Do you recognise what that is?
24       A.   It is the page on -- at the top of this page, number 1014, is the
25    name of the accused, Mitar Vasiljevic, written in Cyrillic.

 1       Q.   Did you yourself make a photocopy of that page from that large
 2    blue ledger?
 3       A.   Did I.
 4       Q.   Would you be able to find the original page should the Court care
 5    to look at it?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  I don't think we need to look at that time, but there
 8    is, I think, some importance in what was the last -- the heading on the
 9    last column, which is a time.
10            MR. GROOME:  I'll be introducing an official translation of all
11    these documents, Your Honour.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  But we've only ever been shown a photostat with
13    the entry relating to Mr. Vasiljevic, which does not include the headings,
14    and whereas we can guess with most of them, the one with the time at the
15    end of them may or may not be important but I think we should know what is
16    the heading.
17            MR. GROOME:
18       Q.   Investigator Hansen, did you photocopy the entire page on which
19    this name appears?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   Including any headings that were on the top of that page?
22       A.   Yes.  According to the ledger, it's on the front page of the
23    ledger.  It's written the year 1992, and it's an alphabetical system in
24    Cyrillic, which I don't read.  So with the help from our language
25    assistant at the team, we found under V, Mr. Vasiljevic's name, and the

 1    date of 14th of June.
 2       Q.   Okay.  Was there also another ledger that you seized on that day?
 3       A.   Yes.  There was a second ledger, also a blue ledger but a thin
 4    one.
 5            MR. GROOME:  I'm going to ask that the witness be shown this thin
 6    blue ledger and inside the front cover is a photocopy entitled Exhibit
 7    number 137.
 8       Q.   Do you recognise that blue ledger, that thin blue ledger?
 9       A.   I do.
10       Q.   And what do you recognise it to be?
11       A.   It is a thin blue ledger.  Everything is in handwriting in it, and
12    it was one of those two that we seized on the 1st of November, 2000.  On
13    the front page is written in Cyrillic -- I don't remember exactly the
14    text, but it's something with patients admitted from the battlefield.  And
15    there's a date on the front page, 6th of April, 1992.
16       Q.   Now, I'd ask you to take a look at the Exhibit number or
17    Prosecution document number 137 on the inside cover.  It's a photocopy.
18            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I see that the accused is having some
19    problems with his earphones.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Are you able to hear the proceedings now,
21    Mr. Vasiljevic?  Can you hear the proceedings now?  Yes.
22            Yes.  You proceed, Mr. Groome.
23            MR. GROOME:
24       Q.   I'd ask you to take a look at Prosecution document number 137.  Is
25    that the photocopy you made of the pertinent page inside that thin blue

 1    ledger?
 2       A.   It is.
 3       Q.   Does it contain the name of the accused, Mitar Vasiljevic?
 4       A.   Yes.  As number 188 is written in Latin the date the 14th of June,
 5    1992, and then 2135.  I think it's the time for the admission.  And then
 6    Vasiljevic, Mitar, and in the column with the when and where born is
 7    written 1954, Visegrad.  And then there's a diagnosis and information
 8    about who brought him to the hospital, also, from where he came.  He came
 9    from the TO Visegrad, which means Territorial Defence, Visegrad.  And the
10    last column is who was informed about him being at the hospital.
11       Q.   Okay.  And who was informed him about being at the hospital?
12       A.   SUP, which means the police.  And then the military police, and
13    then there's three digits, 985, which might be a military post number, but
14    we're not sure.
15       Q.   Did you also at this time seize a four-part document entitled
16    medical history?
17       A.   Yes, I did.
18       Q.   I'd ask you that you be shown a four-part document as well as a
19    photocopy entitled Prosecution document number 138 and ask you, do you
20    recognise what that is?
21            Do you recognise that document, the original document?
22       A.   I do.
23       Q.   And what do you recognise that to be?
24       A.   It's a history of -- let me see.
25            MR. GROOME:  You can take it out of the sleeve if you want to take

 1    a closer look?
 2       A.   Well, it's a document in which was written what happened during
 3    Mr. Vasiljevic's stay at the hospital, his treatment and so on.
 4       Q.   And document number 138, is that a photocopy of the original?
 5       A.   Yes, it is.
 6            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time the Prosecution would
 7    tender Exhibits number 136, 137, and 138, photocopies of the original
 8    medical records into evidence and would make the originals available to
 9    the Chamber at this time if the Chamber would like to see the originals.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  When I was dealing with those orders, I was informed
11    that the bluebook, I was told that one of them, when produced by the
12    doctor, was covered with several years worth of dust.  I think, if I may
13    say so, that is a relevant matter which you should bring into evidence.
14            MR. GROOME:  I'm not sure whether that was hyperbole or actual
15    fact, but I will ask the investigator.
16       Q.   Investigator Hansen, can you describe the condition of the book
17    now as opposed to the condition of the book when you first took it into
18    custody?  Are there differences between the condition of the book?
19       A.   Yes.  The smell, that's for sure.
20       Q.   Can you please describe?
21       A.   Well, it was obvious to me that those documents had been stored
22    for quite a long time in a --
23            JUDGE HUNT:  And in an undisturbed state; is that right?
24       A.   It's difficult for me to say that, by think.
25            MR. GROOME:

 1       Q.   Was there any dust on the books that you recall?
 2       A.   Yes, they were dirty.
 3       Q.   Did there come a time when you submitted these books to the Dutch
 4    forensic laboratory?
 5       A.   Yes, we did.
 6       Q.   Aside from the time that you submitted those to the Dutch forensic
 7    laboratory, was there any time that they were out of the possession of the
 8    Office of the Prosecutor?
 9       A.   No.  They were held in a safe, a locked safe in our team area.
10       Q.   Aside from these --
11            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we better deal with them not one by one but
12    lot by lot.  You've tendered 136, 137 and 138, right?
13            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection, Mr. Domazet?
15            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  They will be Exhibits P136, 137, and 138.
17            MR. GROOME:  Does the Court wish to see the originals at this
18    time?
19            JUDGE HUNT:  I will let you know if we need to.
20            MR. GROOME:
21       Q.   In addition to these three -- these two ledgers and the medical
22    form, were there other records that were seized at that time?
23       A.   Yes.  There were in total 12 different documents.
24       Q.   And after you seized these documents, did you make a list of the
25    documents that you seized or items that you seized?

 1       A.   I made the list the day we seized the documents, and Dr. Moljevic
 2    got a copy of that list.  He didn't want to sign the list.
 3       Q.   I would ask you to describe for the Court the other records that
 4    you seized on that day?
 5       A.   We also seized an X-ray of a leg.  The X-ray was marked Milan --
 6    Mitar Vasiljevic.
 7       Q.   Did it have a date on the X-ray?
 8       A.   It was the 14th of June, 1992.  And there were some lab statements
 9    and some blood type forms filled out from the general hospital in Uzice,
10    and they were dated 15th of June.  Then there were six temperature lists
11    from the orthopaedic -- the first date visible on this was the 14th of
12    June, 1992.  Then there was a release list regarding a repeated fracture,
13    which was dated on the 6th of May, 1993.  And there was also a release
14    list dated 28th of July, 1992, from the psychiatric ward at Uzice
15    hospital.  Then there were three Yellow Pages with -- they were -- the
16    header was therapy list, and there was a history of disease from Uzice
17    hospital, orthopaedic department, dated 14th of June, 1992.
18            Then there was a letter in handwriting.  It was signed Mitar
19    Vasiljevic, and it was for a certain Dr. Slavica.  It was dated on the
20    13th of July, 1992.  And then we got a sample, a form like this one but.
21       Q.   Are you referring to Prosecution Exhibit number 138?
22       A.   Yes.  And this form was a similar form but used nowadays, in 2000.
23       Q.   I want to ask you a few questions about the X-rays separately, but
24    other records that you refer to, are they still all in the possession of
25    the Office of the Prosecutor?

 1       A.   Yes.  They are all held in this binder.
 2       Q.   And available for the Chamber should they wish to them; is that
 3    correct?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  You did promise us an English translation, Mr
 6    Groome.
 7            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  I'm having draft ones converted
 8    now into official translations.
 9       Q.   I want to ask you now a couple of specific questions about the
10    X-ray.  Can you describe the approximately size of this X-ray?
11       A.   I would say it's the size 25 times 40 centimetres.
12       Q.   And you indicated that it had the name of the accused along the
13    bottom of this X-ray?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   And did it also have a date on it?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   What was the date that was on the X-ray?
18       A.   The 14th of June, 1992.
19       Q.   Are you or is the Office of the Prosecutor in possession of that
20    X-ray today?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   Who is in possession of that X-ray?
23       A.   A specialist, Dr. Ivan de Grave.
24       Q.   Was he given that by the Office of the Prosecutor to conduct some
25    tests?

 1       A.   He was.
 2            MR. GROOME:  I'd ask that the witness be shown -- brought the
 3    following four exhibits, Exhibit 17-1, 17-11, 17-12 and 17-13.
 4       Q.   Investigator Hansen, I draw your attention to Prosecution document
 5    number 17-1.  Do you recognise what is depicted in that photograph?
 6       A.   Yes.  The photograph is actually two that are put together, and
 7    those two photographs show Visegrad.  It's aerial photographs.
 8       Q.   Prosecution document number 17-11, can you describe what's
 9    depicted in that photograph?
10       A.   This is the front of hotel Visegrad in Visegrad.
11       Q.   And Prosecution document number 17-12, can you tell us what is
12    depicted in that photograph?
13       A.   This is restaurant Panos at the main gate in Visegrad.
14       Q.   And finally Prosecution number 17-13.  Can you tell us, do you
15    recognise what is depicted in that photograph?
16       A.   It's also restaurant Panos in Visegrad.
17       Q.   And do all of these photographs accurately depict the sites that
18    they are -- are contained in these photographs, fairly and accurately
19    depict those sites?
20       A.   Yes.  There's one thing with the area photo showing Visegrad.
21       Q.   That's exhibit -- that's Prosecution document number 17-1?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And can you describe what it is about that photograph?
24       A.   Since it's two aerial photos put together, it might show where
25    they're covering each other, the same house two times.
 1            MR. GROOME:  I'd ask that that -- 17-1 be placed on the ELMO so
 2    Investigator Hansen can indicate the portion of the photograph he is
 3    referring to.
 4       Q.   I'd ask you to indicate the portion of the photograph which may
 5    have some of the houses repeated in it?
 6       A.   This, answer -- exactly where they are put together.
 7       Q.   Aside from that, does it fairly and accurately depict the town of
 8    Visegrad?
 9       A.   Yes, this year, 2001.
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time I would tender Prosecution
11    document number 17-1, 17-11, 17-12 and 17-13 into evidence.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection?
13            MR. DOMAZET:  No objection.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Sorry.  I didn't have my microphone on.  I will
15    repeat that.  They will be Exhibits P17.1, 17.11, 17.12 and 17.13.
16            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I have no further questions of
17    Investigator Hansen.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
19                          Cross-examined by Mr. Domazet:
20       Q.   [Interpretation] Mr. Hansen, you said in your answers that some of
21    the evidence that you recognised today in exhibits were the subject of
22    special analysis by the Forensic Institute in Holland, if I understood you
23    correctly.
24       A.   Yes, that's right.
25       Q.   Can you tell us, please, which of these documents were the subject

 1    of that expertise?
 2       A.   It was a typewritten document that we sent for further
 3    examination.
 4       Q.   What about the two blue ledgers, the large blue ledger, 1992, and
 5    the smaller blue book with the date of admittance into evidence as being
 6    the 14th of June, 1992?  Were they the subject of expert analysis too?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   If I'm correct, I think on the 25th of June this year, when
 9    photographs were taken of several important locations in Visegrad which
10    are relevant to this case, you were there.  You were on the spot; is that
11    right?
12       A.   I don't remember the exact date, but to me it sounds correct.  It
13    was at the end of June, that I remember.
14       Q.   You visited the house in Pionirska Street and the premises in
15    which the witnesses say they were shut in and burnt; is that right?
16       A.   Yes.  We visited the house near the creek in Pionirska Street.
17       Q.   Did you perhaps note down the dimensions of the room in which the
18    people were detained when the place was set fire to, the dimensions of the
19    room?  Do you have them?
20       A.   No, I don't.
21       Q.   Did you measure the dimensions of the house, that house in
22    Pionirska Street?
23       A.   No, we didn't.
24       Q.   At the time you visited the house and examined it, were there any
25    windows in the room facing the creek?

 1       A.   Excuse me, you mean window frames left or just openings?
 2       Q.   Window frames, because we can clearly see on the photograph that
 3    there are two apertures, two openings, but we can't see whether the
 4    openings have the window frames or whether windows existed at all?
 5       A.   Well, I don't have the photo with me.  As far as I remember, there
 6    were burnt wood in some of the window openings, and there were -- there
 7    was also burnt timber in the rooms, or half -- partly burnt timber.  And
 8    there was a door in the basement with a padlock on.  What was behind that
 9    door, we don't know.  But this door was a new one.  It wasn't a door that
10    had ever been burnt.
11       Q.   You were talking about the door to that particular room on the
12    ground floor basement, the room that the witnesses say they were locked up
13    in; is that right?
14       A.   I don't know what the witnesses have told in court.
15       Q.   I wasn't thinking of their testimony in court.  I was thinking of
16    what they perhaps indicated on the spot, in view of the fact that, at that
17    time, they were together with you, as far as I know from the material that
18    I received.
19       A.   I wasn't next to the witnesses all the time, so I'm not, I think,
20    the right person to answer that question.
21       Q.   One more question in this connection.  I didn't quite follow you.
22    Did you look at the room, the premises that we're talking about?  Did you
23    open the door and have a look inside?  You said you didn't measure the
24    room, but I'm interested in knowing whether you took a look, whether you
25    looked to see what it was like on the inside.

 1       A.   Well, I looked from outside into that room, through the window
 2    openings, and I saw this door, this wooden door inside the room, from the
 3    first room to another one; and what was behind this locked door, I don't
 4    know.
 5       Q.   Thank you.  That same day, you were at the Vilina Vlas hotel.
 6    That's right, isn't it?
 7       A.   That's right.
 8       Q.   Do you remember the reception area of the hotel?
 9       A.   Yes.  I was at the reception area in the hotel on this morning in
10    late June.
11       Q.   Can you tell me, please, what the size of the reception area is,
12    or, rather, how far it is from the entrance to the hotel to the actual
13    reception desk; can you tell me that?  In your assessment, how far
14    would that be, the entrance to the reception desk?
15       A.   I would say ten metres, 10 to 12 metres from the glass door to the
16    reception desk.
17       Q.   Thank you.  And now a few questions with respect to the photograph
18    albums or arrays that you showed the witnesses.  The photograph of Mitar
19    Vasiljevic is the photograph that was taken after his arrest here in The
20    Hague; isn't that right?
21       A.   That's right.
22       Q.   Did you have a photograph of him from that period, that is to say,
23    dating back to 1992?  And if so, why didn't you use that photograph for
24    the photo array?
25       A.   We didn't have a photo of the accused taken back in 1992.  I

 1    remember having seen one in a newspaper, a Bosnian newspaper at a
 2    certain stage.  I don't remember the date or when, but definitely
 3    after his address, because as far as I understood, his arrest was
 4    mentioned in an article in the newspaper.
 5       Q.   Not only in one.  There were several articles that came out in the
 6    Bosnian Federation with Mitar Vasiljevic's photograph in them, but they
 7    all date to the period after the arrest.  That is to say, the photographs
 8    are from here.  And that's why I asked my question, because I assumed that
 9    many witnesses were able to see the photographs before you showed them, in
10    view of the fact that a year went by since Vasiljevic was first arrested.
11    That's why I asked you.  So you didn't have a photograph of him dating
12    back to the earlier period.
13            Now, if it's no secret, can you tell us whether on the other
14    photographs in the photo array, whether there were any other suspects or
15    were there any other people from Visegrad or were the others people
16    at random who have nothing to do with Visegrad at all?
17       A.   The photo arrays were mixed.  We used several different arrays,
18    and I remember at a certain stage we used a black and white photo array
19    that also included photos of other persons from Visegrad.
20       Q.   Therefore, if I understand you correctly, there were photographs
21    of people from Visegrad amongst them, too, but not any of the direct
22    suspects relating to this case; is that right?  Is that what you're
23    saying?
24       A.   On this photo array in black and white, there were the -- the
25    black and white photo of the accused plus photos of other persons from

 1    Visegrad.  We also had a --
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Look.  You really must answer the question.  He's
 3    asking whether they are suspects, not just whether they're from Visegrad.
 4       A.   They were persons involved in what happened in Visegrad in 1992.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Are they suspects?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  That's only in the black and white photographs?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Does that answer your question, Mr. Domazet?
10            MR. DOMAZET:  I would just like to know directly whether there
11    were Sredoje Lukic's and Milan Lukic's photographs amongst the photo
12    array.
13       A.   On very few occasions, yes.  I think we have showed the photo
14    array with Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic just two times or so.  But I'm
15    not sure, I didn't count.
16            MR. DOMAZET:  Your Honour, I have no other questions.
17            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.
18            MR. DOMAZET:  No further questions, Your Honour.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  I thought that you had told us on Thursday that you
20    used the same photographs but in a different order.  Was that just in
21    relation to the colour photographs, was it?
22       A.   Yes.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, in relation to the black and white ones, we have
24    some black and white ones in evidence, have we?  I haven't seen them yet.
25       A.   I think the black and white photos were shown to people that are
 1    not called to give testimony during this -- no ...
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, I'm not sure why they've been tendered then.
 3    Why are the black and white ones being tendered, Mr. Groome?
 4            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the ones that you have in your hand --
 5            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, Counsel, please.
 6            MR. GROOME:  The exhibits you have in your hand have been shown to
 7    witnesses.  The investigator is talking about other photographs, which I
 8    believe I can clear up with a few questions.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  These are black and white.
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the original --
11            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we better get this very clear because the
12    point that Mr. Domazet makes may turn out to be an important one as to
13    the validity of this photograph identification.
14            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  I suggest you better try and explore it in
16    re-examination, because the point has been fair and squarely raised.
17                          Re-examined by Mr. Groome:
18       Q.   Investigator Hansen, were you responsible for investigating a
19    number of different crimes that occurred in Visegrad in 1992?
20       A.   I was.
21       Q.   When you refer to Mr. Domazet's question regarding suspects, that
22    their photographs were contained in those photo arrays, did you mean
23    people in addition to Milan Lukic, Sredoje Lukic, and the accused?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And were they in connection with other crimes that occurred in

 1    Visegrad?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   Now, we've entered in a number of photographs this morning, photo
 4    arrays that were shown to VG87, VG78, VG101, and VG105.
 5       A.   Yes.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Before you proceed, Mr. Groome, they, of course, have
 7    their full signatures on the back.  Those documents better be under seal,
 8    had they not?
 9            MR. GROOME:  Sorry, I did mean to tender them under seal.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Does that relate to all of those --
11            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, all of the photo arrays --
12            JUDGE HUNT:  All the ones with 17 as a prefix.
13            MR. GROOME:  No, 17 are photographs, Your Honour, these are all
14    55.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry, 55.  Very well.  All of those commencing
16    with the numbers 55 will be under seal.
17            Now, the other point, now that I've seen the documents, I have
18    absolutely no idea which one of the witnesses on the front -- I'm sorry,
19    which one the photographs on the front has been identified by these
20    people.  Is the positioning of the signature on the back intended to
21    suggest that they have identified different people or in each case have
22    they identified the photograph which happens to be of the accused?
23            MR. GROOME:  Are you putting that to the witness or --
24            JUDGE HUNT:  No, I'm asking you.
25            MR. GROOME:  Okay, I'll clear it up.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  This is the sort of thing that we just see it for the
 2    first time now, it doesn't make it at all clear what that document's
 3    intended to mean.
 4            MR. GROOME:
 5       Q.   Investigator Hansen, let me just finish up my question to you.
 6    The witness -- the photo arrays that were shown to Witness number 87,
 7    78, 101, and 105, those photo arrays, did they contain the picture of any
 8    other person, any other suspect in Visegrad or of the two other accused in
 9    this case, Milan Lukic or Sredoje Lukic?  If you need to see them again --
10       A.   Yes, I'd like to.
11            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, they are now formally in evidence.  I
12    don't know the procedure in your court, whether you will use the Court's
13     -- the actual exhibit or a copy that I have.
14            THE REGISTRAR:  I don't have any extra copies.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we'll use your copies.  We're not going to
16    give up your copies, frankly.  And the Court Deputy makes a very good
17    point.  There should be one that is the actual exhibit not just the three
18    copies that are for the Judges.
19            MR. GROOME:  That was the one that I just tendered a few minutes
20    ago, Your Honour.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  I see, all right.
22            MR. GROOME:  That's why I tendered the colour copies in lieu of
23    the originals?
24            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm still at a complete loss to know what you are
25    doing, Mr. Groome.

 1            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour --
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  A complete loss.  Now is the original of these
 3    documents we've got in colour?
 4            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Why have we got black and white ones.
 6            MR. GROOME:  You have colour copies except for this one, Your
 7    Honour, because it was impossible -- the colour copy machine was
 8    unavailable at the time and we needed to make copies over the weekend.
 9    You have colour copies --
10            JUDGE HUNT:  May I suggest that you take them back and get them
11    colour copied so we do have a copy of the exhibit, otherwise we will
12    wonder what on earth this is all about.
13            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  But that probably cures the problem with this
15    document, which is now Exhibit 55VG13, but it still doesn't make clear
16    which of those photographs the people who signed it on the back identified
17    them.
18            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  With a few questions I think I can
19    clear this up.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Fine.
21            MR. GROOME:
22       Q.   Now, at the end of the portion of your testimony where you
23    described a different procedure being shown, I believe that you testified
24    to the Court that did you not have sufficient photo arrays to show all the
25    witnesses that you wanted to show photographs to?

 1       A.   That's right.
 2       Q.   Now, had one witness signed a photograph would you have been able
 3    to use that with a subsequent witness?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Because you were out of the country at the time, what procedure
 6    did you or what adaptation did you make to your procedure in order to
 7    ensure the fairness of this photo array?
 8       A.   We had ten pictures of ten different men, one of them were or is
 9    the accused, Mitar Vasiljevic, and we numbered the pictures from 1 to 10,
10    and at the end of the witness -- no, no, statement, we asked or I asked if
11    it was possible for the witness or if the witness thought he would be able
12    to recognise the said person, Mitar Vasiljevic.  Then I showed them those
13    ten pictures, asking them to point out if they knew or recognised any of
14    those ten.
15       Q.   And how did you document the choice that each witness made?
16       A.   It was written in the statement.
17       Q.   And was that statement then read back to the witness?
18       A.   It was read back to the witness and it was signed by the witness,
19    by myself, and by the interpreter.
20       Q.   And -- on -- sorry.  Continue.
21       A.   In addition to this, I asked the witness to sign on the rear side
22    of the photo space.
23       Q.   And their signature on the rear side, does it indicate anything
24    other than the fact that they had an opportunity to see these photographs?
25       A.   Nothing else.

 1       Q.   Did the witness --
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  The positioning of the signatures has no bearing to
 3    the photographs on the front; is that so?
 4       A.   I'm afraid I don't understand the question.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, the signatures are spread out obviously across
 6    the back of the colour photographs?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  And the positioning of the signatures has no bearing
 9    as to the photograph which they say they recognised Mr. Vasiljevic?
10       A.   One of those I know, one of the witnesses that signed on the rear
11    side, didn't recognise anybody from those ten.
12            MR. GROOME:
13       Q.   Would it be --
14       A.   But it indicates that the witness has seen this photo spread.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, can I get an answer to my question?  I'm sorry
16    to be persistent, but I think we have to have it.  The positioning of the
17    signatures on the back of that sheet has no bearing upon the particular
18    photograph which they identified as that of Mr. Vasiljevic and indeed one
19    of them didn't identify anybody as Mr. Vasiljevic?
20            You seem to be at a loss.  You see, in all of the other documents
21    we've seen, somebody has signed the particular photograph that they
22    identified --
23       A.   Yes.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  -- which is the usual way with a photographic
25    identification, so that there is an indisputable piece of evidence and

 1    that is the particular photograph they identified, a very wise way of
 2    doing it.  Now, this time, you couldn't do it because you say you didn't
 3    have enough copies of the colour document, but there is nothing on the
 4    photograph now or the signatures on the back which demonstrates that they
 5    identified any particular photograph on the front it as that of
 6    Mr. Vasiljevic.
 7       A.   No.  If we want to know if any of the persons that signed on the
 8    rear side recognised any of the persons shown on the photos, one has to
 9    read the statement.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  With all the problems of Prosecution statements being
11    translated twice.  But anyway, this document doesn't assist us on that
12    issue.  That's clear.
13            MR. GROOME:  Mr. --
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Mr. Groome.
15            MR. GROOME:
16       Q.   Investigator Hansen, would it be fire say that the signatures on
17    the back were simply done just in the order that the people had the
18    opportunity to see the photographs?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   And just so the record is clear, were any of these witnesses shown
21    these photographs in the company of other witnesses?
22       A.   No.  There were myself, the interpreter and the witness.
23       Q.   Now, the original of VG or 55-VG13, the original of that document,
24    is it a colour reproduced set of photographs?
25       A.   Say again, please.

 1       Q.   The original of the document that the Judge has just referred to,
 2    you just had it in your hand moment ago, is that a -- was the original of
 3    that a colour document just like the other coloured photographs?
 4       A.   It is a coloured photo spread, yes.
 5       Q.   And speaking about this particular array of 55-VG13, was -- did
 6    it contain the photograph of any other suspects or of Milan Lukic or
 7    Sredoje Lukic?
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   It contain the photograph of Mitar Vasiljevic?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Domazet asked you a couple of
12    questions regarding windows in the house.  I'm going to ask you to look at
13    my copy of Exhibit 17-10.  I'm going to ask that that be placed on the
14    ELMO for the witness.
15            Investigator Hansen, I'm going to ask you to take the pointer and
16    ask you to indicate by holding the pointer still where precisely the creek
17    would be in relation to this photograph?
18       A.   To this side.
19       Q.   I'd ask you just to hold it still just for a second there?
20       A.   Okay.
21       Q.   Now, there's a person who seems to be standing by two openings in
22    the wall.  Did they appear to you be windows, those openings in the wall?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And would it be fair to characterise those windows as facing the
25    creek?

 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   And were those windows on the ground floor?
 3       A.   They were on the ground floor, yes.
 4       Q.   Now, you describe in response to Mr. Domazet's questions, a door
 5    that was locked.  Can you please put the pointer and hold it there for a
 6    few seconds to indicate where that door was?
 7       A.   It's here.
 8       Q.   And was there any other way to -- were you able to access through
 9    the inside of this premises at any time during the time you were there?
10       A.   No.  There were no windows to that room.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Is the door something that you can see in the
12    photograph, those two vertical lines?  Are those the edges of the door?
13            MR. GROOME:
14       Q.   I'd ask you to trace the outline of the door with the pointer,
15    please?
16            JUDGE HUNT:  I can only say, Mr. Groome, to have to go back and
17    look at the video of this particular piece of evidence later to see what
18    he's pointing at is a pretty horrific task.
19            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, there's also a better copy in your
20    binders now if you care to look at the original copy.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  You've made no attempt, if I may say so, to get on to
22    the transcript precisely where he is pointing.  Yes.  The photograph that
23    I've been shown certainly does show a door.  And it's not where the man
24    standing but around the corner from it facing the photographer.  Is that a
25    fair description of it.

 1            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 2       Q.   I'd ask, Investigator Hansen, if you'd take the black pen in front
 3    of you and if you could just write the word "door" across the door on that
 4    photograph?
 5       A.   [Marks]
 6            MR. GROOME:  My only concern with this Your Honours, is I'm
 7    working with a copy, not the one that was entered into evidence so this
 8    isn't preserved for the record properly either.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, we can substitute one or the other if it's as
10    good a copy.
11            MR. GROOME:  It is the exact same copy.
12       Q.   And I ask you to write the word "window" and just draw an arrow to
13    indicate where the windows were.
14       A.   [Marks]
15       Q.   Now, Investigator Hansen, you also described seeing some type of
16    wooden structure contained in this building.  Can you indicate on this
17    photograph where approximately that structure would be?
18       A.   It was in the top floor and on the -- what is -- if this is the
19    ground floor, then I'll call this -- oh, sorry.  I'll call this floor the
20    first floor and this the second floor.  And there was a partly burned
21    structure on the second floor and also some on the first floor, and a lot
22    of rubbish all over.
23       Q.   What you're describing now is the ground floor.  Aside from these
24    two windows facing the creek, were there any windows facing the Pionirska
25    Street on the ground floor?

 1       A.   On the ground floor, no.
 2       Q.   Were there any windows facing where the photographer would have
 3    been to take this picture?
 4       A.   I think there was one, but -- yes, there was one.
 5       Q.   Thank you, investigator.
 6            MR. GROOME:  I have no further questions, Your Honour.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  We'll substitute, if we can, the document which is
 8    presently the exhibit for the one the witness has been writing on.  We'll
 9    give you back the one that was the exhibit.
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, may I please make a suggestion?
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.
12            MR. GROOME:  Could we possibly just add a suffix to this with the
13    investigator's name?  There may be other witnesses that I would ask to
14    look at this photograph and I wouldn't want to influence their testimony
15    by seeing Mr. Hansen's marks.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  All right.  What was the number of this one?
17            MR. GROOME:  So that's 17.10.  Maybe we put could Hansen after
18    it?
19            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, we'll put 17.10-1 for the next one.
20            MR. GROOME:  Okay.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  That's the one he's marked and that will be the one
22    we'll call the Hansen document.
23            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, when that's been done, it can be shown to
25    Mr. Domazet.

 1            Well, thank you, sir for coming along to give evidence.  You
 2    can -- yes, Mr. Domazet.  What do you want?
 3            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, may I, in connection
 4    with Mr. Groome's question, ask an additional question of this witness?
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Why -- Mr. Domazet --
 6            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] In connection with this explanation.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  You raised the issue.  You didn't ask him for the
 8    explanation.  You left it up in the air and that gives Mr. Groome the
 9    entitlement to have it explained but you have cross-examined.  You've had
10    your chance.  Why should you now have another one?
11            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] It's merely a matter of the
12    witness's explanation when he was pointing to the creek.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  No, no.  Look, Mr. Domazet, there is a very clear
14    procedure.  You get your opportunity, you raise the issue, you can ask him
15    to explain, and you can cross-examine him on his explanation, but you
16    can't come back another time because you don't like an answer that he's
17    given in re-examination.  Re-examination is the end of the evidence.
18            If, of course, the Prosecution had raised some new matter, you
19    would have had the right to cross-examine upon that, because they could
20    have raised new matter only by leave.  But it's not new matter.  It's
21    dealing with the issue you raised in cross-examination.  Now, if you can
22    suggest to me somehow that this is new, you can try, but I think you may
23    have some difficulty.
24            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I did not cross-examine
25    regarding the position of the creek.  Mr. Groome or, rather, the witness
 1 showed on the photograph where the creek was.  My question is that the
 2    creek is on the side shown by the witness, but my question would be to
 3    show whether the creek followed the length of the building or the position
 4    of the creek in relation to the house, nothing more.  Maybe it's not all
 5    that important, since there is more evidence along those lines.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  No.  I am happy to concede, I'm just looking through
 7    the evidence.  I'm happy to concede that I do not think there was any
 8    reference to the creek in the course of the cross-examination.  So on that
 9    basis, you may ask any questions you may wish about the creek.
10            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.
11                          Further cross-examination by Mr. Domazet:
12       Q.   My question for the witness is:  The creek that you showed on this
13    photograph, in what direction does to flow?  Does it follow the
14    direction -- is it parallel to the wall of the building with the windows
15    on it?  That is, is it on this side of the building?
16       A.   It's not completely parallel to the building.  It's -- it's -- it
17    flows from the top of the picture to the bottom, and there's a bank or I
18    would say three metres from where the person is seen on the photo to the
19    creek.
20       Q.   Just one more question.  Is there any kind of inclination or a
21    slope between the house and the creek?  Is there an angle?
22       A.   Yes.  There's a slope, a very steep one.  I would say two or three
23    metres.  It begins two or three metres to the left from the wall with the
24    window openings.
25            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Any re-examination arising out of that?
 2            MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Well, sir, I was about to say you can go
 4    back to work.  Thank you for coming along.
 5            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
 6                          [The witness withdrew]
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Well now, Mr. Groome, we'll deal with these matters
 8    that you've raised in this confetti of paper that we've received over the
 9    last few days.
10            The applications for video-conference testimony.  There's one for
11    VG105, one for VG87.  Have you got anything to say about those,
12    Mr. Domazet?  VG105 is the one who has received a recommendation from her
13    doctor that she should not travel, and the assessment by the deponent that
14    she is frail in health.  Do you object to a video-conference evidence
15    there?
16            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.  In this case, no.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  What about VG87?  That's the one with the bad heart.
18            MR. DOMAZET:  One moment, please, Your Honour.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, certainly.
20            MR. DOMAZET:  Because I received one document this morning.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Join the club.
22            MR. DOMAZET:  87.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, VG87.
24            MR. DOMAZET:  I just received this document.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, if you'd like a chance to read it, you may

 1    certainly have it, but it's a medical issue again.
 2            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  If it's a health problem, I have no
 3    objections.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  Well, then, we'll make orders.
 5    You will have to organise a date, Mr. Groome, so that a formal order can
 6    be made.
 7            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I had left a message with one of your
 8    legal officers proposing a week from this coming Thursday as the date that
 9    we do all of the videolink.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  I have a message to that effect.
11            MR. GROOME:  So if that's acceptable to the Court I --
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, the problem, as I understand it, it takes a
13    little longer than that for it to be organised.
14            MR. GROOME:  We have it organised for that day for some of the
15    witnesses that we applied for videolink testimony several weeks ago.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  Oh, I see.  It's the same day, is it?
17            MR. GROOME:  We'll try to do it the same day.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  And will we get through them all in a day?
19            MR. GROOME: If not, we have arrangements for the morning of the
20    Friday that following day.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  All right then.  Well, we'll get orders, formal
22    orders written up because the audio-visual people, for good reason, like
23    to have them.  They like to have something in writing anyway.  So we'll
24    have those orders made in relation to those two witnesses and for them to
25    give evidence on the 27th and/or the 28th.

 1            Now, Mr. Groome, the next thing, I'm trying to keep them in
 2    chronological order, is your response to the Defence's explanation for
 3    calling all this evidence about the Muslims attacking the Serbs.  I'm not
 4    sure quite what it is you are saying.  You seem to be saying - I may be
 5    wrong - that it is irrelevant, but it is nevertheless, admissible in order
 6    to give a more balanced view of the context.  What does that mean?
 7            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, in this past year I've had -- worked
 8    very much in Serbia.  I know Mr. Domazet's reputation as an attorney
 9    there.  I guess I'm reluctant at this stage to try to curtail his ability
10    to try his case as he sees fit.  I would probably -- I would not object if
11    Mr. Domazet introduces some evidence that he thinks gives the Court a more
12    balanced perception of what occurred in the spring of 1992 to balance some
13    of the witnesses that the Prosecution called.  I would object to any
14    arguments being made that somehow attacks against Serbs somehow justified
15    the crimes in this case --
16            JUDGE HUNT:  Or are in any other way relevant.  You see, this is
17    what I want to know.  If it is irrelevant, we will make no findings about
18    it.  You see, I hope that nobody will take offence if I put it this way,
19    but this is an issue upon which both parties are really not facing up to
20    what we have to determine.  This is the third case that I have been in
21    where there have been Serb -- has been a Serbian accused or a Bosnian Serb
22    accused in which the case relates to attacks upon the Muslim civilian
23    population.  In each case, this is an issue which is put forward.
24            I rather think, as I say, I don't want to be offensive, but it's
25    put forward for some political agenda, because we -- if it's irrelevant,

 1    we will make no findings on it, none at all.  So the evidence just sits
 2    there.
 3            If there is some relevance, I have yet to be persuaded by anybody
 4    what the relevance is.  Nobody has been able to even come close to
 5    providing any explanation, let alone an acceptable one, as to why it's
 6    relevant.
 7            Now, the Prosecution, on the other hand, has its own political
 8    agenda, and again I'm not trying to be offensive, but this is what it
 9    appears to be:  It wants to keep its position open so that it can
10    introduce a whole lot of material called "background material" which is
11    also equally irrelevant.
12            Now, somebody, sometime, somehow has got to face up to this.  I
13    had hoped that we might get some sort of official Prosecution statement,
14    but we haven't.  We've got a statement that, frankly, means nothing.
15            Now, are you going to permit Mr. Domazet to lead evidence of all
16    18 incidents that he's set out in his pre-trial defence brief?
17            MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  That's what I want to know.
19            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, if I could just explain.  What I am
20    saying is it seems that Mr. Domazet is entitled to contest some of the
21    facts that the Prosecution has alleged through their witnesses.  For
22    example, that the mortar attacks really weren't what the witness said the
23    mortar attacks were.  So I'm not objecting --
24            JUDGE HUNT:  But what do you suggest, that he is going to lead
25    evidence to suggest that they were not mortar attacks?  You mean, for the

 1    purposes, in relation to the purpose of the mortar attacks?
 2            MR. GROOME:  Or that there was no conflict at all in Visegrad at
 3    the time.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  I thought there was an admission about that, that
 5    there was an armed conflict.  We still haven't got the signed documents
 6    yet, but on the draft, at least, there is an admission that there was an
 7    armed conflict at the relevant time.  But I don't see that attacks by
 8    Muslims upon the Serb population in any way denies that or is at all
 9    relevant to it.  An armed conflict means a conflict between two armed
10    bodies, as I understand it.
11            MR. GROOME:  That's correct.  Your Honour.  I think the
12    Prosecution also has the burden of showing that the crimes committed in
13    this case are connected to that conflict and --
14            JUDGE HUNT:  How does the fact that the Serbs were being attacked
15    by the Muslims the, the Serb civilian population was attacked by the
16    Muslims, how is that relevant to anything that you have to prove?
17            MR. GROOME:  It's not Your Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  That's the whole problem, you see.  Now, I too do not
19    want to deny Mr. Domazet the opportunity of fairly presenting his case,
20    but I know what will happen is there will be -- whoever loses will appeal
21    and that will become some issue in the appeal, and it's something which I
22    think that a Trial Chamber has the obligation to avoid.  So if we accept
23    the joint approach of the parties, first of all, you may be assured, both
24    of you, there will be no findings by the Trial Chamber, none at all.  In
25    fact, the Trial Chamber will make it abundantly clear in its judgement

 1    that such evidence as was given was given by consent and with the
 2    agreed -- and with the agreement that it was irrelevant to any issue we
 3    had to determine.  So I don't know where any of these political
 4    objectives, and I'm using "political" in a very general sense, whether
 5    these political objectives will be achieved.  But I am still concerned
 6    that you say some background material or some background evidence should
 7    be admitted, but you justifiably say not 18 incidents.  So what happens?
 8    Does he lead evidence of one or two or 17 or 18?  That's why I'm
 9    suggesting, I don't really get any assistance out of what you've put.
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, it's -- I find myself in a difficult
11    position to predict to what the evidence will appear that's why I reserve
12    my objection to --
13            JUDGE HUNT:  There are 18 incidents -- I think it's 18, in the
14    pre-trial brief by the Defence.  Quite specific incidents.  It will be
15    worthy of a Prosecution's indictment.
16            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I simply reserved the Prosecution's
17    right to object should it become cumulative.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  What does that mean?  That's another word I wanted to
19    ask you about.  What do you mean when you say you don't want the evidence
20    to become cumulative?  Cumulative means they have some additional effect
21    by their multiplication, I assume.
22            MR. GROOME:  I'm using cumulative in the sense, Your Honour, that
23    if Mr. Domazet leads such evidence at some point, it may be clear that the
24    Chamber is now in possession of sufficient evidence on this point and to
25    include additional evidence would be cumulative.  It would be

 1    unnecessary.  That could happen after testimony about the second -- two of
 2    these incidents.  It could happen after five.  I hardly think it would
 3    happen much more than that and that's why I reserved the Prosecution's
 4    ability to object to -- should a point come in time when that evidence
 5    would be cumulative.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  The point I'm making is that even the first is
 7    unnecessary, so how can we have a rule on your objection that something
 8    has suddenly become unnecessary when it's all been unnecessary?  This is
 9    what, unfortunately, nobody ever seems to think about.  But I have been a
10    Trial Judge for a very long time, and this is the sort of issue that has
11    to be determined at some stage in the trial, otherwise it gets out of
12    hand.  How can I stop Mr. Domazet, after the second one, and say, anything
13    more is unnecessary when what he has already put is unnecessary and the
14    Prosecution has consented to it?  You're really asking the Trial Chamber
15    to determine what's fair on a sort of an informal basis and that's not a
16    Trial Chamber's job.
17            Now, perhaps you better speak to Mr. Domazet.  If you come to some
18    agreement about having one or two or something there, then that's a matter
19    between you and then we will just note that it's been done by consent.
20    But we cannot make any ruling upon your objection if you take it at any
21    time other than it's all been unnecessary and it's all irrelevant.
22            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  So perhaps you might like to reconsider your answer
24    to that.  Is there nothing upstairs in the OTP which -- in which this has
25    been examined?

 1            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm also -- have to prove persecution in
 2    this case and it is the position of the Prosecution that many of these
 3    events that have been described by these Prosecution witnesses are
 4    relevant to the Court's determination of persecution, the campaign against
 5    the civilian population of Visegrad.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, but what Mr. Domazet is going to prove, how is
 7    that relevant to the issue of persecution?  Except, as I said to him, does
 8    it suggest that there is a motive for retaliation?
 9            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour --
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, if you want to put that, you put it, but for
11    heaven's sake, let's get it on the record somewhere that really is the
12    Prosecution's view.
13            MR. GROOME:  That is not the Prosecution's view, Your Honour.  The
14    Prosecution's view is just simply that Mr. Domazet is entitled to present
15    a defence in this case.  At this stage, I don't feel that I am in a
16    position to -- to object until I hear some of that evidence.  I think he's
17    entitled to present some of it so that the Court has a fair and balanced
18    view of what happened in Visegrad.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  So if you call 15 witnesses on the issue of
20    persecution of the Muslims, you feel he should be entitled to call 15
21    witnesses about persecution of the Serbs?
22            MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour.  I guess what I'm saying is that
23    it's up to the Court to determine when it's heard enough of this evidence.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  No, it's not.  That is totally wrong.  It is never
25    the job of a Trial Chamber to say it's heard enough unless it has all been

 1    given without any form of issue being taken with the evidence.  We can say
 2    there has been no objection to two witnesses saying about that, why do you
 3    need to proceed?  That's not saying we've heard enough except in a very
 4    colloquial form we've had enough of all of this.  But we are not here to
 5    determine when Mr. Domazet has presented enough of material on a totally
 6    irrelevant issue.
 7            Now, you have got something which, as I have said, is worthy of a
 8    Prosecution's indictment.  So you are in exactly the same position as an
 9    accused person.  You know the general nature of the case he wishes to
10    present.  You must be able to tell me what your attitude to it is.
11            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, as I said before --
12            JUDGE HUNT:  No, no, no.  You must be able to determine what your
13    attitude is.  Now, if you haven't formed an attitude yet, I'd like to know
14    why not.  I've given you the opportunity.  We've said we wanted it in
15    writing.  If you want some further time to do that, to consult perhaps
16    some other Prosecution teams to see if they've ever thought of an answer,
17    I would be very grateful.  Unfortunately, there never seems to be any
18    communication upstairs between the Prosecution teams and it is very
19    disturbing that we get no real assistance from the accumulated wisdom of
20    the Prosecution office and the number of trials it's done.  Surely you
21    have up there all of these research tanks.  They must have an index to
22    what they've had to give advice on.  Have you consulted any of those to
23    see whether they have ever had to determine what the relevance of this
24    evidence could be?
25            MR. GROOME:  I'll seek their advice, Your Honour, and refile

 1    tomorrow.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Okay.  That will be of great assistance to us.
 3            Now, the next one.  Mr. Domazet, you have filed a response in
 4    relation to the 92 bis statements, asking why the Defence can't be present
 5    when the witness statements are taken.  I fear that you have a
 6    misunderstanding of what Rule 92 bis is.  There is no formal hearing where
 7    the witness in effect gives evidence.  There is a formal hearing only to
 8    comply with the technicalities of the Rule about identification and the
 9    signature and that sort of thing.
10            The purpose of Rule 92 is to save time in having evidence given
11    orally.  If the Trial Chamber accepts a statement under Rule 92 bis, it is
12    also in a position to say whether the witness should attend for
13    cross-examination.  The Defence loses no right they have to cross-examine
14    the witnesses.  But where there is sometimes very detailed evidence about
15    matters that don't directly involve the accused, the object of the Rule is
16    to save the time of that evidence being taken orally.  It was, I think, a
17    recognition of the conflict between the civil law system and the common
18    law system, where the civil law system relies almost entirely upon the
19    statements and the Trial Court leads the evidence through his statement,
20    and the common law system, which requires the witness to give his evidence
21    unaided by a written statement.  The distinction drawn is between evidence
22    which directly relates to the accused person and evidence which does not,
23    and the idea of the Rule is to save time, that's all.  So there's no need
24    for the Defence to be present unless there's going to be some issue as to
25    whether the person who signs the document was, in fact, the person named

 1    in it.  I don't think there should be any worry about that.  But you do
 2    not lose your right to have them attend for cross-examination, provided
 3    you can demonstrate there is at least some basis upon which you want to
 4    cross-examine them.
 5            So does that explain to you what this Rule 92 bis procedure is?
 6            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I understand why the
 7    Defence does not participate.  I also had in mind Rule 71, about out of
 8    Court records, depositions, at which the Defence does participate, and
 9    maybe that would have been better way for some of this testimony.  But I
10    wrote this motion because, in my opinion, it is not logical for an
11    investigator of the Prosecution to be present but only the presiding
12    officer, according to the Rule 92 bis.  But if that is the Rule, I have to
13    accept, but in any event, it isn't all that important because I understand
14    the purpose of this Rule now.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm not sure I understand the sinister aspect of
16    having the investigator there.  The investigator is probably the person
17    who prepared the statement in collaboration with the witness, but I don't
18    see myself that there's any problem with that.  Now, when you say you
19   object to one of these, the first named (redacted) because what he has said
20    in his statement is false, that is the very sort of matter that you can
21    raise in cross-examination.  And if you want any of these to attend in
22    cross-examination, you should notify or put a document on stating that you
23    want the particular witnesses to attend for cross-examination with the
24    sort of statement you've made about [redacted] demonstrating that there
25    is an issue you want to cross-examine them on.

 1            Now, perhaps you better reassess your attitude towards the Rule 92
 2    bis statements which the Prosecution wants to have accepted.  When would
 3    you like to give us a fresh assessment of your attitude towards them?
 4            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I do not object to the
 5    presentation of evidence pursuant to Rule 92 bis for all proposed
 6    witnesses, except for all Witness [redacted]  As I have explained in my
 7    submission, first of all, I did not receive --
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry.  I have got myself into trouble.  I had
 9    not seen all of the pseudonyms beside it.  That will all have to be
10    redacted out of the transcript.  Perhaps you should refer to him as
11    Witness 37.  I'm sorry, Mr. Domazet, to interrupt you.
12            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] As I was saying, only with respect
13    to Witness 37, I did not receive, attached to the statement, that the
14    statement was taken pursuant to Rule 92 bis, and that is why I feel that
15    that statement cannot be used in accordance with this Rule.  However, if
16    the Trial Chamber were to find that it was taken in that manner and no
17    such evidence was provided to me, I objected; that from the attachments
18    produced by that witness, it is evident that he did not speak the truth in
19    part and that for this reason, cross-examination is necessary of this
20    witness.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, just what is the situation about each of
22    these six witnesses?
23            MS. BAUER:  Your Honour, I'm sorry, we haven't received Defence's
24    response yet so I wasn't quite aware.  There is one mistake that occurred.
25    Actually, number 37 was taken an affidavit according to US procedures.

 1    The affidavit, we tried to print it out from the system over the weekend,
 2    but unfortunately our system failed us on that, and this is why probably
 3    Mr. Domazet objected, because he didn't see the affidavit which was taken
 4    according to US procedures.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  And does it contain the material from his original
 6    statement that Mr. Domazet is challenging?
 7            MS. BAUER:  As far as I know, it's just a confirmation of his old
 8    statement.  There was additional information taken relating to another
 9    case but which we don't intend to offer into evidence into this case.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  You see, it was hoped - and this obviously is
11    something which the Prosecution has some trouble with - it was hoped that
12    there would be proper statements taken from each of the witnesses which
13    deal solely with the material which is relevant to the particular case.
14    If you use the old statement, we are then faced with an enormous amount of
15    material which is irrelevant.
16            I'm not criticising anybody when I say that, because I understand
17    that when the statements are taken, nobody has been charged, nobody knows
18    what crimes have been committed, even.  So that the investigators take a
19    statement which contains everything the proposed witness wants to say.
20    Very little of it ever gets into evidence.  And the intention behind 92
21    bis would be that there would be fresh statements taken which do deal
22    solely with the relevant material.  This hasn't been done here, obviously.
23            MS. BAUER:  If I may try to respond that.  We chose six
24    statements particularly in order to corroborate the evidence given about
25    the persecutorial campaign at the time in 1992 in Visegrad and the

 1    build-up of the conflict.  We have heard evidence here, and it was
 2    suggested that those six statements just confirm, actually, more or less
 3    what was given there in evidence, just probably a bit more explained the
 4    political and military background at the time in 1992 in Visegrad.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Has there been any attempt to put a line through
 6    those parts of the statements upon which the Prosecution is not relying?
 7            MS. BAUER:  We could endeavour that if this would be of
 8    assistance.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  I just --
10            MS. BAUER:  I'm afraid it's going to be very little, because we
11    already minimised really the amount which we intended to introduce instead
12    of live testimony.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, as I understand him, says he has
14    received nothing by way of Rule 92 bis statements other than the statement
15    that you want to tender them.  Now, you better perhaps discuss this with
16    Mr. Domazet, see if you can sort out what has happened.  The document
17    which he sent was received by fax on Friday and was actually filed on
18    Friday, so the Prosecution, as I understand it, would have been notified
19    there are documents to pick up.  So there must be a copy there for you.
20    But if you need another copy, we'll get one for you, but you better sort
21    out with Mr. Domazet what it is that he has to deal with and perhaps, if
22    you can, what the Trial Chamber should do about it because we are a little
23    alarmed at the thought that we are going to have a lot of material before
24    us which is irrelevant.
25            All right.  Well, we'll deal with the other two matters, or three,

 1    I think there are, when we return at 11.30.  We'll adjourn now.
 2                          --- Recess taken at 11:00 a.m.
 3                          --- On resuming at 11.30 a.m.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, one suggestion that you may like to
 5    consider about this irrelevant material is that it goes in in some written
 6    form, then you have some control over what is going to happen.  Now the
 7    next one is your request for a subpoena in relation to the mother and
 8    son.  Why do you think that that is something which your investigators or
 9    whoever have been unable to do this is to persuade them to come?  The
10    threat of making them guilty of contempt does not seem to get us anywhere.
11            MR. GROOME: Your Honour, it may not ...
12            JUDGE HUNT:   Just one moment.  We're not getting any transcript.
13            We are now.  Thank you.  I think we've lost a fair bit of it, but
14    hopefully it will be in the transcript at the end of the day.
15            Now, why do you think that this subpoena will do something which
16    the persuasion doesn't?
17            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm not sure that it will.  I feel it is
18    incumbent upon me, especially since so many of the other witnesses have
19    assumed these risks and have come to the Tribunal to testify that I pursue
20    every possible option.  Most recently we had contacted another son who is
21    in law enforcement of the witness and it seemed that we had overcome these
22    fears and we even offered to have that particular son accompany the
23    witness.  We were advised late Thursday or sometime on Thursday that the
24    decision was taken again not to come.
25            As I say, Your Honour, I don't have any basis for believing that

 1    we will be successful.  I hope that we will, and I believe it is my duty
 2    and responsibility at this stage to pursue every legal means to try to
 3    secure the presence of these two witnesses before the Tribunal.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  Well, it looks to me under Rule 54 rather under
 5    the Trial Chamber I assume, is it.
 6            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Very well.  I'll sign one, but you better provide one
 8    of the legal officers with a floppy disk with it on so it doesn't have to
 9    be retyped.
10            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, the expert reports.  There are two
12    applications.  Dr. Clark appears on them twice.  I'm not quite sure why
13    that is so.  There's one dated the 11th of September, which includes his
14    report, and another one of the 12th of September which includes his report
15    or are they different reports?
16            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, Mr. Ossogo will deal with the issues
17    related to Mr. Clark.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  I haven't checked them, Mr. Ossogo, to
19    see whether they're the same but I assume they are, are they?
20            MR. OSSOGO:  [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. President.  That is to say
21    they're not completely identical.  The first report is dated the 5th of
22    September.  It was an incomplete report, but we thought it would be useful
23    to communicate it to the Defence within this time limit and five days
24    later we received a complete report which contained a photograph, the
25    exhumation site, and we said to the Registry that this 17th of September

 1    report would be replacing -- taking the place of the 5th of September
 2    report.
 3            So it is the -- this report that we are handing over to the
 4    Defence for it to be able to tell us if it is in accord or not in keeping
 5    with Rule 94.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  That's the first we've heard that one is intended to
 7    replace the other, but now that you've said that it makes sense.  And you
 8    are providing the Defence with the incomplete report just as a matter of
 9    history.
10            You also want to add his name to the list of witnesses.
11            MR. OSSOGO:  [Interpretation] Yes, that's right.  Mr. President.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  Well, Mr. Domazet, what is your
13    attitude -- I'm sorry, is there something you wanted to add.
14            MR. OSSOGO:  [Interpretation] No, that's right Mr. President,
15    yes.  I have nothing to add thank you.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, what is your attitude to this
17    application to add Dr. Clark as an additional expert witness?  The
18    explanation that was given was that his availability was not certain at
19    the time the pre-trial brief was filed.
20            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Mr. President, Mr. Ossogo, I don't
21    know if you received a motion, my motion dated the 15th of September.
22    That was sent by fax.  It was faxed to you.  And the Defence states its
23    views in that motion.  I can explain it now.  With respect to Rule 94 bis
24    (A) to have the time -- Rule 94 bis (A) is what I'm referring to, and it
25    states a period of 21 days.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  If you would find it easier to speak in the B/C/S,
 2    please do so.  We're very envious of your ability to speak French, but it
 3    is obviously, I think, more difficult for you.
 4            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Yes.  In this motion, and we said
 5    that the Defence received on the 7th and on the 9th of September written
 6    findings, and we consider that the time limit stipulated in Rule 94 bis
 7    (ii) should be adhered to and also the 14 days period within Rule 94 bis
 8    (B) with respect to stating whether we wish to cross-examine the expert
 9    witness or not.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, whether or not we stick completely to
11    the Rules of that nature is a matter we can discuss later on.  I really
12    don't think that the Prosecution should be denied calling a valid witness
13    simply because it might be one day short of the time unless there is some
14    real prejudice from the accused's point of view.  But let's leave that to
15    one side.
16            My first question to you was:  What do you want to say about
17    adding this witness to the witness list?  That doesn't rely on 94 bis.
18    That's in relation to the pre-trial brief, where the Prosecution is
19    required to set out the witnesses it proposes to call.  It did not put
20    Mr. Clark's name on that list because, it is explained, his availability
21    was uncertain at that time.
22            Now, do you object to his name being added to the witness list,
23    first of all?  How he gives his evidence will be another matter.
24            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, no, I have no objection
25    to make to Dr. John Clark, the witness testifying.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Well, now, you will have 14 days from the
 2    delivery of this to you in which to put your response on.  When is it
 3    proposed to call this witness, Mr. Ossogo?
 4            MR. OSSOGO: [Interpretation] In the week of the 1st of October,
 5    Mr. President.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  My maths is never the best when you go over a month,
 7    but when was the document -- when was the statement served on the
 8    Defence?  12th of September.  Yes, you're in time.
 9            All right.  Well, thank you for that.
10            Mr. Domazet, if you can give us an answer before 14 days that
11    would be to everybody's benefit, but you have 14 days to reply in response
12    to the expert evidence that they wish to call.
13            Well, those are the only matters that I have listed.  Is there
14    anything else?
15            MR. GROOME:  There's a scheduling matter I'd like to bring to the
16    Court's attention.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.
18            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, for several reasons this trial is moving
19    at a faster pace than anticipated, in part or a large part rescheduling by
20    the Registry.  It's only last week that we learned that we would have
21    additional sessions this week that we didn't anticipate last week.  I just
22    want to bring to the Court's attention, we've endeavoured to bring -- we
23    actually 12 witnesses here this week to put before the Tribunal.  I just
24    want to make the Court aware that we have encountered some problems
25    securing visas from the Dutch government to have these witnesses enter the

 1    country.  Nearly all of the witnesses are coming from abroad.  So there
 2    are no immediate problems.  I just wanted to bring to the Court's
 3    attention that there may be some problems in the coming days and the
 4    following week regarding being able to have sufficient witnesses present.
 5    We are still endeavouring to do our best.  I can assure the Court, though,
 6    that we still anticipate completing the Prosecution case at least a week
 7    or possibly two weeks prior than our original estimation.  I have a
 8    schedule, as best we're able to tell at this stage, Your Honour, of the
 9    entire prosecution case, and if the Court wishes, I'd just like to tender
10    that to the Court at this stage.
11            It goes beyond -- what you have just been handed, Your Honour, is
12    just this week.  I propose to give you our schedule for the entire case
13    which it looks like that we would complete our case on the 1st or 2nd of
14    October.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, yes.  But you keep referring to this change.
16    There has been very little change.  There is a difference between sitting
17    for four hours a day or, I think it's five minutes short of four hours a
18    day to four and a half hours a day.  That's the only difference.  So I
19    really hope we don't have that explanation put up to us again.  What we
20    are very grateful for is that the case is moving more quickly, as indeed
21    it should have been anticipated that it would, but nevertheless, we accept
22    that you have to re-estimate.  We accept that there are problems with
23    getting visas because of the notice that has to be given.
24            If you run out of witnesses at some stage, I can assure you we all
25    have an awful lot to do out of court, and we will spend a very productive

 1    time out of court.
 2            We would like some notice, though, of when you think you will run
 3    out of witnesses so that we can make arrangements, if necessary, for -- at
 4    least this is from my own point of view, hearings in other pre-trial
 5    matters.
 6            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  I propose to provide the Court
 7    with the entire schedule for the Prosecution case, and I will communicate
 8    both with your legal officer and with Mr. Domazet and keep you up-to-date
 9    regarding any changes in the availability of witnesses.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, well, you may have to give us various versions
11    of this as we proceed.  It may move up or it may move down as the case may
12    be.  But we do hope, for example, that if you can, you can give us the
13    whole of a Friday off if you are running out of witnesses, because that
14    allows us to list things, or at least allows me to list pre-trial matters
15    in three or four other cases at that time.
16            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, this week, all of the witnesses will be
17    in the building as of from Wednesday on, so we will have witnesses to work
18    full time, hopefully, up until whatever time on Thursday their testimony
19    is concluded.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  All right then.  Well, thank you very much for
21    that.  This sort of thing is always a great help to us.
22            Now, your next witness.  With this witness, still no protective
23    measures are required, the next one?
24            MS. BAUER:  Yes, Your Honour.  It's VG55.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Oh, I'm sorry.  The one ahead of that on the list.

 1    55 is number 2 on the list.
 2            MS. BAUER:  I'm sorry.  We provided Friday morning an update, and
 3    I think that VG55 was advanced.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Oh, dear.  Yes.  Well, something happened down in the
 5    Registry about that, I'm afraid.  Are they otherwise in the same order?
 6    Perhaps we'll get one later on today if we could.
 7            Yes.  Very well.  55.  Thank you.
 8            THE REGISTRAR:  Is VG55 the next witness?
 9            MS. BAUER:  Yes.  I might ask that the oath be read out to the
10    witness.  The witness said she forgot her glasses and she can't read.  So
11    it would be good to get that.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Is VG55 here?  It will be necessary to read the
13    solemn declaration to the witness because she does not have her glasses.
14    Thank you.
15            I don't know.  It will have to be read into English and translated
16    for her, I should think, unless our court usher has a talent I am unaware
17    of.
18                          [The witness entered court]
19            JUDGE HUNT:  Would you stand up, please, madam.  The usher will
20    read to you the solemn declaration that you will be asked to agree with.
21    After it has been read to you, I will ask you, do you make that solemn
22    declaration?
23            THE REGISTRAR:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth,
24    the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I will always speak the truth, the
 1    whole truth.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  You make the declaration in the terms which were read
 3    to you by the usher, is that so?
 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I agree with that and will
 5    always agree with that.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  Sit down, please, madam.
 7                          WITNESS:  WITNESS VG55
 8                          [Witness answered through interpreter]
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Ms. Bauer.
10                          Examined by Ms. Bauer:
11       Q.   Witness, you have been assigned the pseudonym VG55 for purposes of
12    concealing your identity, and that is how you will be addressed throughout
13    the proceedings.  Do you understand that?
14       A.   Yes, I do.
15       Q.   You will be handed a piece of paper which contains your name.
16    Could you just say yes or no that it contains your name.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, unfortunately, it will have to be read to her.
18       A.   Yes.  Yes.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  You are able to see that, yes.
20            MS. BAUER:
21       Q.   Thank you, VG55.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, how is the witness going to deal with the rest
23    of the document, Ms. Bauer?
24            MS. BAUER:  Well, Your Honour, I would have hoped that she's going
25    to refer to -- that's why I have put it in the Bosnian language.  The

 1    print is very large, as you can see, so I hoped she could read the Bosnian
 2    term of this paper.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Perhaps you better ask her whether she's able to and
 4    then explain to her that when she refers, or wants to refer to those three
 5    persons, she should refer to them in the way you've described.
 6            MS. BAUER:  Can the witness be shown the same piece of paper again
 7    and --
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  She should have her own copy of it.
 9            MS. BAUER:  Yes.
10       Q. [redacted]
11       A. [redacted]
12       Q. [redacted]
13          [redacted]
14          [redacted]
15       Q. [redacted]
16       A. [redacted]
17       Q.   You will have this sheet of paper in front of you.  So any time
18    you refer to any of those three names, please just refer in Bosnian to
19    either your brother-in-law, your sister-in-law, or your father-in-law.  Do
20    you understand that?
21       A.   Yes, I understand that.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  And is that the date upon which you were born - or
23    you believe you were born - on the third line?
24       A.   Yes, it is.  It is.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  That will be Exhibit P74, and it is under seal.

 1            MS. BAUER:  Excuse me.  Can it please be left with the witness,
 2    open.  Thank you.
 3       Q.   VG55, in 1992, did you live with your late husband and your two
 4    children in the village of Musici in Visegrad?
 5       A.   Yes, I did.
 6       Q.   I would like you to recall an incident that happened in the end of
 7    March in your village, when Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic came to your
 8    house.  Where did you know Mitar Vasiljevic for -- from?
 9       A.   Yes.  I knew him when we went to school together.  We were
10    friends.  We went to school together.
11       Q.   What else did you know about Mitar Vasiljevic's personal
12    circumstances?
13       A.   Well, I didn't know anything special until it happened, but when
14    we were friends, I didn't know anything bad about him.  I can't say I
15    did.
16       Q.   Do you know what his profession was?
17       A.   Yes; he was a waiter.
18       Q.   Where was he a waiter?
19       A.   In Panos, Visegrad.
20       Q.   Did you know anybody else of his family?
21       A.   Yes, I did; I knew his sisters and his wife Milojka.
22       Q.   Before the outbreak of the conflict, did you see Mitar Vasiljevic
23    several times, once, twice?
24       A.   When do you mean?
25       Q.   Before 1992.  Before we come to the incident we're going to talk

 1    about.
 2       A.   Yes, I did.  I would see him around before that.
 3       Q.   That evening, how did Mitar Vasiljevic and Milan Lukic arrive?
 4       A.   They came as dusk was falling, Mitar Vasiljevic, and Lukic, Milan
 5    Lukic.  And there were five or six other people.  They stormed my
 6    father-in-law's house.  Mitar stood in front of the door.  And when I went
 7    outside the house I said to Mitar, "How's Milojka?"  I just didn't want
 8    him to kill me, that's all I was thinking of at the time.
 9       Q.   You said they arrived.  Do you know in what kind of car or what
10    kind of colour of car they arrived in?
11       A.   Red, red.
12       Q.   You said you were afraid that he would kill you.  How was Mitar
13    Vasiljevic dressed --
14       A.   Yes, that's right.  He had black trousers on.  I don't know what
15    he had above that.  All I know is that he was armed; he had a rifle.
16       Q.   Do you remember what kind of rifle?
17       A.   I don't really know.  He was holding a rifle and the rifle was
18    cocked.  I don't know.  That's all I know.  And he was pointing it.
19       Q.   Where did exactly Mitar Vasiljevic stand throughout that time?
20       A.   He was standing in front of my door, at the steps to the first
21    entrance.
22       Q.   Did he tell you anything when he came, about the reasons why they
23    came?
24       A.   No, he didn't tell me anything.  When I asked him, "How's
25    Milojka," because I was afraid that he would kill me, all he said was,

 1    "She's fine."  He didn't say anything else.  He didn't say anything to me
 2    any more.
 3       Q.   What did Milan Lukic do in the meantime?
 4       A.   Milan Lukic went into my house.  He was armed.  He raised his
 5    bayonet and turned over the sofas and everything, and he seemed to be
 6    looking for some people in my house.
 7       Q.   Were you at that time told what the people were looking for or who
 8    the people were looking for?
 9       A.   They were looking for people.  They thought someone was hiding
10    there, and they were looking for people to see if they were hiding there
11    then.
12       Q.   Were you told this by anybody?
13       A.   They said Milan Lukic was looking for some people.  He thought
14    that we were harbouring some people, hiding some people in our house.
15       Q.   If you say "they," who do you refer to, VG55?
16       A.   Milan Lukic.
17       Q.   Mitar Vasiljevic, did he have a ribbon on his gear?
18       A.   He had a red ribbon on his shoulder, on his clothing, a red
19    ribbon.
20       Q.   Did he wear any headgear?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   Did Milan -- did Mitar Vasiljevic at any time tell you not to
23    worry because you were school buddies and nothing would happen to you?
24       A.   He didn't say anything to me.
25       Q.   Did he say anything to anybody else; to your husband?

 1       A.   I didn't hear him say anything to my husband.  I didn't hear him
 2    say anything to my husband.
 3       Q.   Was he at all times in front of the house or in the doorstep of
 4    the house?
 5       A.   All the time while Lukic was in the house, he said that nobody
 6    should go anywhere out of the village of Musici.
 7       Q.   Who said that?
 8       A.   Lukic.
 9       Q.   My question was:  Did Mitar Vasiljevic stand the whole time in
10    front of the house or in the doorway of the house?
11       A.   In front of the house.  At the entrance to the house, on the
12    steps.
13       Q.   Where was he pointing his rifle to?
14       A.   The sky.
15       Q.   You said there were other people with him.  Was one of the people
16    a blonde woman at that time?
17       A.   I didn't see her that evening.  I saw her on another occasion but
18    not that night.  I just saw five or six other people and they went to
19    my brother-in-law's house and my sister-in-law's house.
20       Q.   Could you discern from their accents where they were coming from?
21       A.   Well, they seemed to be from Serbia.  They weren't our people, the
22    ones that went off to my brother-in-law's house.
23       Q.   After Milan Lukic has searched the house, what did he tell you to
24    do?
25       A.   He told us to round up our neighbours and that they should all

 1    come to my house and that we should tell them to come to my house so that
 2    he could give them a piece of advice.
 3       Q.   Did this happen?
 4       A.   Yes, it did.  The people all came.  There were a lot of people
 5    there, women as well, and he told us that we weren't to go anywhere, that
 6    we would be safe there.  And he hit one man called Suljo on his shoulder,
 7    but he said that not a hair of our heads would be harmed.
 8       Q.   Did he take anything from your house?
 9       A.   He didn't take anything from my house but he did from my
10    brother-in-law's house.  The five or six people that went there, they took
11    money, cigarettes, and some drinks, bottles.
12       Q.   The next day, did Milan Lukic return?
13       A.   No, he didn't return, but the next evening he did return and took
14    seven of our menfolk away in a car.
15       Q.   Did you see how they were taken away?
16       A.   Well, I heard the women crying and saying, "Lukic has taken away
17    the seven men."  I know those men.  They are all my neighbours.  And he
18    took them off in a direction and I don't know what happened to them.
19       Q.   Can you recall the names of those seven men?
20       A.   I do.
21       Q.   Can you please list them.
22       A.   Yes, I can:   Mustafa Vila, and Nermin Vila, and Suljo Vila, and
23    Uzeir Vila, Vatres -- Vatres, what was the first name? [redacted]
24    [redacted] but the Vatres man, I can't remember his name.  Yes,
25    Adil.  Adil Vatres and Kasim Murtic.

 1       Q.   Were those men ever seen again after this date?
 2       A.   Never.
 3       Q.   What happened to your father-in-law that night?
 4       A.   My father-in-law went towards Prelovo to grind his grain, and he
 5    was never seen or heard of again.
 6       Q.   Did the same evening another group come to your village?
 7       A.   Yes, another group came, and they took us to another house.  There
 8    was this ploughshare, and there were some other people in the village, and
 9    they led us to another house to gather us in that other house.
10       Q.   Who was the leader of this group?
11       A.   That was a blonde lady.  She kept pushing me with her rifle in the
12    back, and I was asking her, "Where are we going?"  And she said, "I didn't
13    ask you anything."  She just kept pushing me in the back with her rifle to
14    make me go faster.
15       Q.   Was she a local or was she from another country?
16       A.   She wasn't a local.  She had a strange accent when she spoke.  She
17    spoke Serbian dialect.
18       Q.   What did she do to you when you assembled with the other villagers
19    in the other house?
20       A.   When we assembled in front of a house, they were waiting there.
21    There was another group of men, and one of them came up to me, and he
22    asked me, "Who did you vote for?  Did you vote for Alija?"  I kept quiet
23    and didn't say anything.  They assembled us there and asked us, "What is
24    the name of this village?"  And I said, "Musici."  And he said, "You'll
25    see what Musici is."

 1       Q.   What did he mean, "You will see what Musici is"?
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  How can she possibly answer that?  What did she
 3    understand him to mean might be a different question.
 4            MS. BAUER:  Well, it is a Bosnian translation.
 5       Q.   Did he say to you Mutici or Musici?
 6       A.   I said "Musici," and she said, "It will now be Mutici," Mutici
 7    meaning suffering.
 8       Q.   Did there come a time when they robbed all our money and
 9    valuables?
10       A.   Yes.  They waited for Milan Lukic, because he had taken away the
11    men, and they were waiting for him to come.  And they forced us into this
12    house and they said give us whatever jewellery and money you have.  I took
13    off my jewellery, threw it on the floor, and the people who had money,
14    they put it down there and then Milan came back.  They collected it.
15       Q.   When Milan came back, what did he do?
16       A.   When he came back, he first asked, "Where is the man whose house
17    we were in yesterday?"  And that was my father-in-law's house, and that is
18    what he asked us.
19       Q.   What else did he say to you?
20       A.   Then he said that we should go inside, and he asked whether anyone
21    had fuel, that we should move to the stable.  I suppose he wanted to start
22    a fire.
23       Q.   What did Milan Lukic do next?
24       A.   They stood in front of the door, and they were sort of drawing
25    lots to see what they would do to us.  Then he came back to the house and

 1    said, "We won't do anything to you.  But another group may come to do
 2    something to you."  But then he said, "Go to your own houses, but don't
 3    stay in them.  Go where you want."
 4       Q.   What happened to your husband and your brother-in-law that night?
 5       A.   Then he said, "You and you, come with us, and the rest of you go
 6    back to where you came from."  Then I and my sister-in-law started
 7    pleading with them, "Leave our men."  And then he said, "We'll just
 8    interrogate them and then we'll bring them back."
 9       Q.   With "you and you," do you refer to your husband and your
10    brother-in-law?
11       A.   Yes, my husband and his brother.
12       Q.   The next day, did you and your sister-in-law go to find your
13    husbands?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Where did you go to?
16       A.   I spent the night in the basement with my children.  In the
17    morning, we got up.  We caught a bus that was passing through our
18    village.  We took the bus, and there were other women with us, my
19    sister-in-law, and we went to Visegrad.
20       Q.   Where exactly in Visegrad did you go to?
21       A.   We went in the direction of the MUP, the police in Visegrad.
22       Q.   Was there a time when Milan Lukic came to the MUP?
23       A.   Yes.  There were people working there in the MUP, and they asked
24    us what we wanted, and we said we were looking for our husbands.  They
25    said, "Who took them away?"  And we said, "Lukic."  And the man said,

 1    "Wait until he comes," and then Lukic came.  We waited and he came.
 2       Q.   What did he tell you when you asked for your husbands?
 3       A.   A man said to him, "These women are waiting, inquiring about their
 4    husbands."  And he said, "Fuck them."  That's what he said to us.
 5       Q.   Did there come a time when you went back to your village and your
 6    sister-in-law continued to search for your two husbands?
 7       A.   Yes.  Yes.
 8       Q.   Later that day, did your sister-in-law come back and tell you what
 9    would be the destiny of your husbands?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   What did she tell you?
12       A.   She said, "Our husbands are coming."  And I said, "That's not
13    possible."  And a little while later our husbands did come to our village
14    of Musici.
15       Q.   Who accompanied them?
16       A.   I know that Lukic, Sredoje, he brought them in a car.  There was
17    another man, and I'm afraid I don't know his name.
18       Q.   Who was Sredoje Lukic?
19       A.   He was a neighbour of mine.  I knew him.
20       Q.   What was his profession?
21       A.   He was a policeman.
22       Q.   What did he tell you to do?
23       A.   He said -- we went to my sister-in-law's house when our men came,
24    and we thanked him for bringing our husbands.  And he told us that we
25    couldn't stay there any longer, that this would be Serbia, and that we

 1    should go and join our own people.
 2       Q.   Did your sister-in-law or did he tell you why he released your
 3    husband and his brother?
 4       A.   He said that my sister-in-law had deserved it because she had
 5    helped him when he was building his house and that it was because of her
 6    that he had brought back my husband and my brother-in-law.
 7       Q.   Was this help in any way monetary?
 8       A.   I don't remember.  I don't know.
 9       Q.   Was there a day when a number of young Serbs came to your village
10    asking for a sheep?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   How did they approach you?
13       A.   I was close by.  They came in a car, young men.  They had big
14    crosses round their necks, and they cursed the mosque and faith of my
15    neighbour.  And when I came up to her, she said, "They're looking for a
16    sheep."  I said, "Would a young cow do?"  And they said, "No, only a
17    sheep."
18       Q.   Were those Serbs from Serbia or local Serbs?
19       A.   Serbs from Serbia.  They were not from our area.
20       Q.   Was that the same day when you were on your way with Jasmina Vila,
21    when you met Milan Lukic?
22       A.   Yes, it was.
23       Q.   What did Milan Lukic do with Jasmina?
24       A.   We took the sheep down.  They put it in the car, and then Lukic
25    said, "You must report to me," and the girl left.

 1       Q.   Did she come back the same day?
 2       A.   Yes.  Two or three hours later, she returned.
 3       Q.   What was her condition?
 4       A.   Bad.
 5       Q.   What did she look like?
 6       A.   She was blue under the eyes, and she was wet.  Her clothes were
 7    wet on top, and she tied a sweater around her waist.
 8       Q.   Did she tell you what had happened to her?
 9       A.   Yes, she did.
10       Q.   What did she tell you?
11       A.   She said that he had done whatever he wanted, that is, he raped
12    her, and that he had said that we mustn't stay there, that we would all be
13    slaughtered, and that we must go our own way.
14       Q.   Was that the night your husbands decided to swim across the river
15    and leave the area?
16       A.   That evening, our husbands crossed the Drina River.
17       Q.   Were you a few days later told by local Serbs to leave the area
18    because you would all be killed?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Did you gather a few things and leave for Visegrad?
21       A.   Yes, we did.
22       Q.   Did you try to get into a convoy of the Red Cross?
23       A.   We did, but they were saying, "No one will take you," and we
24    returned.  We didn't go.
25       Q.   They -- if you refer to "they," who do you mean?

 1       A.   I mean the Serbs.
 2       Q.   On your way there, did you meet some paramilitaries?
 3       A.   When?
 4       Q.   On your way to Visegrad and to the Red Cross.
 5       A.   No.  When we were going to the convoy, they would assemble, and
 6    they had knives, and they would play around with these knives, and they
 7    would throw bread at us, and they were teasing us and treating us like
 8    dogs.
 9       Q.   Did they threaten you?
10       A.   No, not really.  They were provoking us.  They were always armed.
11    They were unpleasant towards us.
12       Q.   Did they say what they would do with your children?
13       A.   When we reached the Red Cross, they said that they would first
14    slaughter our children for us, that we would watch them do, and then they
15    would do the same to us.
16       Q.   Did there come a time when you went into hiding in Bikavac?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   In a Muslim house in Lipe?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   When you left it, the house, why did you flee from the house?  Can
21    you describe the incident, please?
22       A.   I can.  We fled because there were four murders in that house.
23    They killed four women, and myself and my sister-in-law threw our children
24    out of the window to save ourselves and that is how we fled that night.
25       Q.   One last question:  Would you be able today to recognise Mitar
 1    Vasiljevic?
 2       A.   I would.
 3       Q.   Do you see him somewhere in this room?
 4       A.   I do.
 5       Q.   Can you describe for the record where he is sitting, please?
 6       A.   He's sitting in the last seat up there from the top.
 7       Q.   Can you describe basically what he's wearing?
 8       A.   A suit.
 9       Q.   Which colour?  Do you see the colour?
10       A.   He has a white shirt and a red tie.  A black tie, sorry.
11       Q.   Thank you.
12            MS. BAUER:  Your Honour, no further questions.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
14                          Cross-examined by Mr. Domazet:
15       Q.   [Interpretation] Madam, that evening when Milan Lukic came for the
16    first time or, rather, when you saw Mitar Vasiljevic with him, you
17    explained that you were rather scared.
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   Did any one of those persons, on that particular occasion,
20    threaten you, or more specifically, did Mitar Vasiljevic threaten you?
21       A.   No.  He didn't say anything to me and he didn't threaten me, only
22    what I said.
23       Q.   Did Milan Lukic threaten, apart from what you told us he said?
24       A.   He didn't threaten me at all.  He just said that we were safe
25    there, that we shouldn't go anywhere that evening.  That is what he said.

 1       Q.   When you said, madam, that you remember that Mitar was wearing a
 2    red ribbon, can you remember whether it was a ribbon round one of his
 3    sleeves?
 4       A.   Yes.  I think it was round his sleeve after all.
 5       Q.   Was it a wide ribbon or a narrow ribbon?
 6       A.   A narrow ribbon.
 7       Q.   Did you notice anything on it, on the ribbon itself?
 8       A.   Just the red colour.
 9       Q.   Do you remember when that incident occurred, roughly which month?
10    Because I think that in the transcript, the month indicated was not
11    mentioned, even in your first statement.  So it might just be an error.
12    It says March.  Was it March or  May?
13       A.   I think it was May, the 28th of May.
14       Q.   So you think it was the end of May.
15       A.   Yes, the end of May.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  Just a moment, Mr. Domazet, we're running into the
17    usual problem.
18            Madam, because you and Mr. Domazet, the counsel here, are speaking
19    the same language, it is difficult for the interpreters to keep up with
20    you both unless there is a pause before you answer the question.
21    Mr. Domazet will have to pause before he asks the question.  If you'd just
22    give us a brief moment whilst the interpreters translate into English and
23    into French for us, then you answer the question.
24            Do you understand that?
25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Mr. Domazet.
 2            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
 3       Q.   You told us when this incident occurred for the first time, but
 4    today you also described the second incident.  But could you tell us how
 5    much time passed between the two?  Was it one day or two days later or a
 6    little longer when the second incident occurred that you described, when
 7    the seven were taken from your village?
 8       A.   They weren't taken away that night, but another day, seven men
 9    were taken away.
10       Q.   Yes.  That is how I understood you the first time.  But was it the
11    very next day or two or more days later, if you can remember?
12       A.   The next evening immediately, seven men were taken.
13       Q.   So the next day.  And this group with the blonde lady came that
14    same evening?
15       A.   Yes.  That same evening, this woman assembled us down there.
16       Q.   When you were describing the event after which all of you who were
17    in the village headed for the Red Cross in Visegrad, you said that a group
18    of local Serbs came.  Could you tell me from which village they came and
19    who they were, as far as you can remember?
20       A.   I don't know those people, but I would see them.  I don't know
21    their names.  I know they are from Visegrad.
22       Q.   Are they from Visegrad or the village of Greben, which is close to
23    your village?
24       A.   I think there were more from Visegrad than from Greben.  I didn't
25    recognise anyone from Greben among them.
 1       Q.   You said that on that day, at the Red Cross in Visegrad, while you
 2    were waiting, a group of men in uniform threatened you and provoked you in
 3    various ways.  Could you judge by their accent whether they were local
 4    Serbs from Visegrad or people from Serbia?
 5       A.   There were some Visegrad and some from Serbia.  It was a mixed
 6    group.
 7       Q.   When you said today that the reason for your leaving Bikavac was
 8    four murders, could you please tell us, if you can remember, who carried
 9    out those murders?  Who were the murderers?
10       A.   I don't know.  I couldn't see them.  If I had seen them, I
11    probably wouldn't be alive.  I just know the names of the women who were
12    killed.
13       Q.   So you don't know or you cannot remember the names?
14       A.   I don't remember who did the killing.  I couldn't see it.
15       Q.   Thank you very much.
16            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] I have no further questions, Your
17    Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Ms. Bauer, any re-examination?
19            MS. BAUER:  Only one question.
20                          Re-examined by Ms. Bauer:
21       Q.   Witness VG55, when Mitar Vasiljevic was there that night, he
22    didn't threaten you, but how did you feel?
23       A.   I was a little scared that he might kill him, and I addressed him
24    by name so that he would recognise him and that he wouldn't kill me.
25            MS. BAUER:  Thank you very much.  No further questions.
 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, madam, for coming here to give evidence.
 2    Thank you for the evidence which you've given.  You are now free to
 3    leave.
 4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You're welcome.
 5                          [The witness withdrew]
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  You better tell us, Mr. Groome, who the next witness
 7    is.  We haven't got the revised list yet.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  The next witness, Your Honour,
 9    Witness VG116.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Is this a person who has got the pseudonym since the
11    list was typed?
12            MR. GROOME:  I don't believe so, Your Honour, unless there's --
13            JUDGE HUNT:  There's no 116, even on the most recent edition.
14            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the one that was handed out this morning
15    on the 11.30 to 1.00 session it is VG116?
16            JUDGE HUNT:  That's the third edition of the list, is it?  We have
17    one here dated the 13th of September, another one dated the 14th of
18    September.  And there's now one dated the 17th of September, is there?
19            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour the most recent one.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  As you can understand, we are a little at a loss.
21            MR. GROOME:  There has been a struggle to get these witnesses into
22    the country.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  I understand all of that.  I'm just trying to see
24    that we are all operating from the same document.  Oh, you mean the
25    schematic one?

 1            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, we have that.
 3            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, this is a protected witness, and I'm
 4    going to -- the first thing I'm going to ask him to do is look at a video
 5    in which he appears.  So could I ask that we begin in private session and
 6    then after he views the video, we'll come out of private session and he
 7    can discuss the video?
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we better get him -- I was going to say sworn
 9    in, but at least settled in and then we'll into a private session, yes.
10            This was a pseudonym that we gave at the beginning of the trial.
11    I can go through and look at the transcript, but it's not on the pseudonym
12    list, unfortunately.  Oh, here we are.  Thank you.
13            MR. GROOME:  Just to avoid any confusion, Your Honour, the larger
14    print is a witness that this witness may possibly refer to.  I made it
15    large because of some problems he has with seeing.  That's the reference
16    to VG22.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  The witness is temporarily delayed, but we'll wait
18    for him.
19            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, while we're waiting, I'd also ask that
20    the oath be read to the witness.  Again, he has problems with his vision.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  While we're waiting, I see we've got Dr. de Grave on
22    Wednesday.  Whoever speaks to him beforehand, would they please ask
23    him, and I give a tremendous amount of emphasis to this, that he speak in
24    other than the Latin language?  He's one of those doctors who
25    understandably speaks in a language which he understands, but it really is
 1    very difficult.  Unless we have a medical dictionary besides us, it's hard
 2    to follow him.
 3            MR. GROOME:  I'll convey that to him this evening, Your Honour.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Okay.
 5                          [The witness entered court]
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Would you stand up, please, sir.  Now, the usher will
 7    read to you the solemn oath, and once he's read that, I will ask you do
 8    you make that solemn declaration, I'm sorry -- do you make that
 9    declaration?
10            THE USHER:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the
11    whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Do you make that declaration, sir?
13       A.   Yes.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Sit down, please.
15                          WITNESS:  WITNESS VG116
16                          [Witness answered through interpreter]
17            JUDGE HUNT:  The pseudonym sheet will be Exhibit P75 and it is
18    under seal.
19            Yes, Mr. Groome.  Tell us when you want to go into private
20    session, but get his details first.
21                          Examined by Mr. Groome:
22       Q.   Good afternoon, Mr. 116.
23       A.   Good afternoon.
24       Q.   I'd just like you to explain to us briefly where you were born and
25    what was your occupation.
 1       A.   I was born in the village of [redacted]
 2       Q.   Is that in Visegrad?
 3       A.   Visegrad, yes.  A village near Visegrad.
 4       Q.   And were you born on the [redacted]
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   What was your occupation when you were working?
 7       A.   I'm a [redacted]
 8       Q.   There's a glass of water there on the table.  Feel free to take a
 9    drink whenever you need one.
10       A.   Very well.  Thank you.
11       Q.   I'm going to ask that you be shown a video, but before we do that,
12    I'm going to ask that we go into private session for the showing of that
13    videotape.
14       A.   Yes.  Yes, yes.

12                          [Open session]
13            JUDGE HUNT:  We are now in public session.
14            MR. GROOME:
15       Q.   Mr. 116, we are now in public session, so I would ask you to refer
16    to your sons, if you have to, just as your sons and not use their names.
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   I want you to describe for the Court how it was that you came to
19    be in that truck.
20       A.   Well, when the corps entered the town, a lot of people came from
21    Dobrun, fled from the corps, from Dobrun, and we took to the woods, all of
22    us.  All the people fled to the woods.  And the people were very scared.
23    They didn't know what to do, and went down to the road.
24            I went back home to my own village to see to the livestock, to let
25    them out, because I didn't know if I would return alive.  So I had to let

 1    the livestock out.  So when I let the cattle out, I went along the road.
 2    I was all alone, roaming around.  There was nobody there.  And I didn't
 3    know what to do or where to go.  And then from down there there was the
 4    army, and there were trucks, and there were lots of people in the trucks,
 5    both in the truck and behind the truck.  Next to me they were passing by
 6    me, and a soldier was there and he said, "Old man, get up onto -- into the
 7    vehicle."  And I jumped up, of course, and I went with them wherever they
 8    were going.  I jumped up onto the car.  When I jumped up onto the car
 9    there was the army, and there were two women and a child.  I didn't ask
10    who they were, but they were sitting next to my son.
11            I tried to talk to the soldiers a little bit but they didn't want
12    to talk to me.  They didn't want to talk to us at all.  And then we went
13    off into town, this whole column.  There were big cars and small cars.
14    And I thought, well, let's go into town, come what may.  We'll see.
15            Then when we crossed the bridge, on this one side there were lots
16    of people, and they were painted on their heads and had stockings, and
17    they went to a cafe.  There were lots of people there, all different
18    people wearing different clothing.  There was civilians and policemen and
19    people wearing military uniforms as well.  I turned my head to take a
20    look, and I said -- some of them were cursing our balija mothers.  Others
21    were saying, "We'll slaughter you."  And I complained to one of the
22    soldiers, whether they would take us down from the car.  And he laughed
23    and said, "There wouldn't be anything" -- "What would be wrong with that?"
24            So I looked to see if there was anybody I recognised, whom I
25    knew.  When we moved towards the station, went through town, a man was

 1    crying.  He was crying and moaning, said, "They took me down from the
 2    truck, and he said, "[redacted], my son, brothers, help me.  What am I going to
 3    do?"  He was crying, going up and -- walking up and down.  I didn't dare
 4    ask the soldiers to help the people, because they would see where is --
 5    they would say, "Where is Musan [redacted].
 6            And when we reached the station, on the -- down below there was
 7    the stadium where the football matches are, and they had all guns, young
 8    soldiers, and one of them said, "Let's go and search all the houses up
 9    there to see if there are any balijas in them."  And I said to him, "Why
10    take us now?"  Well, he said, "We're taking you down there now.  Later on
11    you're not going anywhere."
12            I found so many people down there.  They were all quiet, with
13    their big bags and bundles.  Nobody said a word.  And then somebody said,
14    "Here comes the commander in a helicopter."  And I sort of hid a little
15    bit.
16            The commander arrived.  Lots people gathered round him, and some
17    other people too, and the army, the soldiers were holding their guns,
18    pointing them upwards to the sky.  They didn't talk to anybody.  Then they
19    positioned two soldiers in the centre, and every man and woman had to pass
20    by them, these soldiers, and they searched the people passing by, as they
21    passed by.  When that was done, some other people came up to him.  I think
22    his name was Ojdanic.  They referred to him as Ojdanic, and they
23    said,  "Well, we'll go home.  What are we going to do with them in the
24    camp?"  And he said, "Who is from Musici and the nearby villages Jelacici
25    and so forth.  They can go back home.  We've liberated that."  Well,

 1    there's nobody to liberate it from.  It's only the people, the
 2    inhabitants, no army at all.
 3            But anyway we went off, and we went through town hiding.  There
 4    were two bridges.  Some of us took the lower bridge, others took the upper
 5    bridge, and we tried to avoid being caught.  We were afraid.  And we
 6    arrived home.
 7            What happened to the others who stayed on, I don't know.  I don't
 8    know when they were released or whatever.
 9       Q.   Mr. 116, I'd ask you to take a drink and water, and I'm going to
10    ask you a few specific questions earlier on in your account.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  May I remind you that he should not name his son?
12    And he also named either himself or -- yes, himself.
13            MR. GROOME:  Himself.  We've handed up the redactions.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we've picked them up, but it's very
15    difficult.
16       A.   No.
17            MR. GROOME:
18       Q.   Mr. 116, I know that it's difficult.  This is kind of an
19    artificial set of circumstances we work under, but to the extent you're
20    able, try not to refer to names or other identifying facts.
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   I want to take you back to where you -- to the point in time where
23    you describe first seeing these army trucks.  Were they JNA -- were they
24    Yugoslav People's Army trucks?
25       A.   Yes.

 1       Q.   And you saw -- said that you saw many.  Can you give us your best
 2    idea regarding approximately how many of these army trucks you saw --
 3       A.   Lots.
 4       Q.   -- at that time?  And was this on a road leading --
 5       A.   I can't say, but on the road, a large column, lots of trucks.
 6    They were full, and there were soldiers, too, all young soldiers.
 7       Q.   And was this on one of the roads leading into Visegrad?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   And would it be fair to say that in the preceding days to this
10    event, you had been hiding in the woods?
11       A.   Every day.
12       Q.   Now, when you first saw the trucks, did you see your son on one of
13    those trucks?
14       A.   Well, yes, I did.  Yes.
15       Q.   Now, the soldiers that you mentioned, were they armed?
16       A.   Yes.  Each one of them was armed with an automatic weapon.
17       Q.   On the truck that you saw that your son was riding in, were there
18    soldiers on that truck?
19       A.   All soldiers, yes, young soldiers.  I know what the -- what an
20    army is.
21       Q.   You testified that somebody called out to you and instructed you
22    to get on the truck.  Can you tell us exactly what was said to you as best
23    you remember?
24       A.   Well, he said, "Old man, get up onto the truck."  He sort of
25    screamed at me.

 1       Q.   And he was one of the soldiers in?
 2       A.   Yes, yes, a soldier, not a civilian.  None of them were
 3    civilians.  And my son didn't even dare say a word.  Nobody dared say a
 4    word.  The soldiers were very angry.
 5       Q.   And would it be fair to say that this incident you're describing
 6    for us now occurred on the left bank or the western side of the Drina
 7    River?
 8       A.   Yes, on the left-hand side if you go downstream to the Drina.
 9    Ustipraca, my village, and the right bank is the other side.  So left --
10    on the left-hand side of the town as you go downstream, down the Drina
11    River.
12       Q.   Now, which of the two bridges or did this truck cross one of the
13    bridges into Visegrad?
14       A.   They all crossed.
15       Q.   And which bridge did the truck that you were riding in cross?
16       A.   The old bridge up there, the first as you come in from Ustipraca.
17    The old bridge.
18       Q.   And would it be fair to say that the entire bridge was filled with
19    army trucks?
20       A.   Yes, that's right.
21       Q.   In addition to carrying people on the trucks, did some of these
22    trucks also carry artillery equipment and other military equipment?
23       A.   Those same trucks carried the artillery which was joined to the
24    truck.
25       Q.   Now, of the civilians that you saw on these trucks, of those

 1    civilians that you recognised, were they all Muslim?
 2       A.   All of them.
 3       Q.   Did you see any people of Serb ethnicity that were civilians on
 4    these trucks?
 5       A.   Well, it's difficult to say, but no, no, there wasn't a single
 6    Serb there, just Muslims from my villages, the villages around my own
 7    village.
 8       Q.   Now, as the truck that you were riding in reached the end of the
 9    bridge, the end of the bridge on the right bank of the river, what did you
10    see?
11       A.   On the left-hand side.  On the left.  On the left side, there was
12    a garden and poplars, poplar trees.  And people were standing there
13    masked.  They had soot on their faces, paint on them, with some stockings,
14    and you could just see the eyes.  But we were a big column.  I didn't dare
15    look too much, because the soldier would kill me.
16       Q.   Now, these men that you saw, they were on the right bank of the
17    river; is that correct?
18       A.   Yes, yes.  We crossed the bridge on our side, and we crossed the
19    bridge and the left-hand side, I come to the right side, and then we
20    passed by the poplars.  The bridge is straight ahead to the left.
21       Q.   So you're indicating that these men were standing to the left of
22    the bridge as you left the bridge?
23       A.   When you cross the Drina River and want to go into town, then it's
24    to the left in town.  I come into town, and we're moving towards the
25    station through town, and the stadium.

 1       Q.   Are you familiar where the Hotel Visegrad is located?
 2       A.   I do know, yes.  I know Hotel Visegrad.  It's just when you cross
 3    the bridge on the left-hand side, a new hotel.  And that's where they were
 4    lined up, right down this small street, all lined up.  And they cursed us,
 5    swore at us.  And we took the road, the upper road into town, moving
 6    towards the station the column was.
 7       Q.   Can you tell us what they said to you?
 8       A.   Well, the ones that were standing down there, well, they sworn
 9    our balija mothers, cursed our balija mothers, and they said, "You won't
10    last long.  We'll slaughter you.  We'll slit your throats."  And I thought
11    they would take me down on the truck, but we passed by somehow, by the
12    stadium somehow.
13       Q.   And you were able to hear this clearly from where you were sitting
14    in the truck?
15       A.   Well, yes.  It wasn't two metres away from them, from where they
16    were standing right by the road.
17       Q.   Would the soldiers on the truck have been in a position to have
18    heard these threats as well?
19       A.   Well, of course they were able to hear.  And they were laughing.
20    They laughed.
21       Q.   Did you at any time hear or see any of the soldiers do anything or
22    take any action to stop these threats against the Muslims?
23       A.   No, no, no.  No, nobody lifted a finger.  They just looked at
24    us --
25       Q.   These men that you're describing as having their faces --

 1       A.   -- devouring us with their eyes.
 2       Q.   These men that you're describing as having their faces disguised,
 3    as best you're able, can you approximate how many there were for the
 4    Court?
 5       A.   Well, as far as I was able to see, some 50 metres off along the
 6    road on the left they were lined up, right along the road, all along the
 7    road.  There was a lot of them.  I can't tell you exactly, I didn't count
 8    them, but lots.
 9       Q.   Did there come a time when your truck, put the people on your
10    truck to the bus station in Visegrad?
11       A.   I didn't understand you.
12       Q.   Did this truck eventually carry you to the bus station in
13    Visegrad?
14       A.   Yes, it did.  The whole column arrived at the station and all the
15    people in it arrived at the station, on the truck and in the little cars.
16    Everybody left in big cars, small cars.  They had to, because we thought
17    that somebody would protect us.  But that wasn't the case.  As far as I
18    was able to see, nobody tried to do anything in contravention to these
19    soldiers, the young soldiers, to protect anyone.
20       Q.   In fact, you described for the Court seeing somebody standing at
21    the side of the road that you recognised; is that correct?
22       A.   You mean on the left-hand side, among those people there.
23       Q.   You referred to a person crying.  That's the person I'm referring
24    to now.
25       A.   I don't remember.

 1       Q.   Did you see a person crying by the side of the road?
 2       A.   When we started off and passed the people, the station, there was
 3    a man crying, jumping up and down, coming up to our truck, and as far as
 4    he I remember, he said, "They took my son from the -- [redacted] from the
 5    truck, Musan Smajic.  They took them from my car.  They took my son from
 6    my car, Musan Smajic."
 7       Q.   And who did you understand him to be referring to when he said
 8    "they"?
 9       A.   I'm sorry, I didn't find him and ask him actually what happened,
10    but he was just crying and jumping up and down.  And I'm sorry that I
11    didn't actually ask him more.  But he never saw his son again.  From that
12    day onwards, never again.  So he should tell you.  He should tell you what
13    actually happened and who had taken his son, seized his son.  He must know
14    who took his son away.  He must recognise someone.
15       Q.   I want to now take you to the --
16            JUDGE HUNT:  I think it might be a good idea if you came back to
17    it after lunch.
18            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  We'll adjourn until 2.30.  The -- there are a few
20    confusions as to whether or not he's referring to his son or to somebody
21    else's son in that evidence.  We've just redacted something which I think
22    actually was not meant to be his son, but it is very confusing.
23            We'll come back to it, sir, later.  Thank you.
24            We'll adjourn.
25       A.   Not my son.

 1                          --- On resuming at 2.30 p.m.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome.
 3            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, before I resume, I'd just like to
 4    correct a few bookkeeping matters regarding an exhibit referred to earlier
 5    on today, and the video that was shown, referred to as Prosecution number
 6    142, I'm going to propose that it be called 142.1.  And, Your Honour, I
 7    will not be tendering it at this time.  I will need to establish some
 8    foundational facts regarding other portions of the video with another
 9    witness, but I have turned it over to the custody of the registrar, and it
10    will remain there until this other witness testifies.
11            Your Honour, by agreement with Defence counsel, Mr. Domazet, I
12    would propose to tender Exhibit number 142.2, and that is a video capture
13    of the key portion of that, and I would move to tender that under seal as
14    it does reveal the identity of this witness.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm not sure that this does that, but just in case,
16    certainly.
17            There's no objection to this -- what did you call it, a video
18    capture?
19            MR. GROOME:  A still photograph taken from the video.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection, Mr. Domazet?
21            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.  I have to objection.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  It will be Exhibit P142.2 and it will be under seal.
23            MR. GROOME:  Just one other minor matter, Your Honour.  The other
24    day, a witness made markings on P131 and P133 and they made those markings
25    in highlighter.  Unfortunately that highlighter cannot be reproduced if it

 1    is photocopied.  By agreement with Defence counsel, we have authorised to
 2    have the registrar retrace that highlighted markings with some type of pen
 3    that will allow it to be pre-produced for the Court.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Hopefully a black one.  Yes, I remember them well.
 5    Very well, we'll get the court deputy on to that in her spare time, if she
 6    has any.  Thank you.
 7            MR. GROOME:
 8       Q.   Mr. 116, good afternoon.
 9       A.   Good afternoon.
10       Q.   Just before lunch, you were referring to a person who was telling
11    you something about his son.  Do you recall that testimony?
12       A.   I do.
13       Q.   Just so that the record is clear, the son that we're referring to
14    is his son and not your own son; is that correct?
15       A.   Yes, his son.  His son.  He was standing by the car, close to the
16    station, when the column started moving.  Musan Smajic was his name, and
17    he was crying out, "They took my son away."  I don't know whether it was
18    from the truck or from a car.  And he stayed behind crying, as we went on.
19       Q.   Now, at the bus station, approximately how many Muslims --
20       A.   When we were on our way to the bus station, at a bend in the road
21    in the centre of town this happened.
22       Q.   When you arrived at the bus station, were there other Muslims
23    present at the bus station?
24       A.   Yes.  Almost the whole stadium was almost full.  I don't know when
25    they had got there.  I didn't ask.

 1       Q.   I'm asking you now before you arrive at the stadium, but at the
 2    time that you arrive at the bus station.
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   Is it true that other Muslims --
 5       A.   Before.  I see.
 6       Q.   Is it true that other Muslims, like yourself, arrived in army
 7    trucks at the bus station as well?
 8       A.   I don't know.  I only know about the trucks coming from our
 9    villages carrying Muslims.  They had probably brought some before, but I
10    didn't ask, so I don't know.
11       Q.   At some point later on in this day, did you go to the football
12    stadium in town?
13       A.   I didn't go there.  I didn't dare go into town.
14       Q.   Did you go to some football stadium in Visegrad?
15       A.   I did go when they took us there that day, but not after that.
16    Later -- not later.
17       Q.   Where in town or where in Visegrad is this football stadium?
18       A.   At the railway station.  This was later -- the bus station as
19    well, but to the left of that station was where the stadium was built for
20    football matches, and that is where they took us.  And the whole stadium
21    was almost packed full with people.  There were women and children as
22    well.
23       Q.   Are you able to approximate for the Court how many Muslims were
24    gathered in that stadium that day?
25       A.   I wouldn't dare make an estimate, but from all the surrounding

 1    villages and from the right bank of the river and from the left bank of
 2    the Drina, I recognised people there, but how they got there, I didn't
 3    ask.  Those villages are quite far away from town.
 4       Q.   And were there soldiers from the Yugoslav People's Army there as
 5    well?
 6       A.   Yes, of course.  They held their rifles pointing upwards.  The
 7    people were scared.  Then this man in the helicopter arrived.  The
 8    soldiers approached him.  They called him Ojdanic.  And they talked and
 9    talked about us, and then they selected two soldiers to stand one next to
10    another so that each person had to pass between the two of them so as to
11    be searched.  What they were looking for, weapons or what, I don't know.
12    And when all this was over, darkness was approaching, and the people from
13    my villages asked to go home.  And he said, "As Musici are close by to
14    town and to the let of my village, (redacted)," and he said, "Those two
15    villages have been liberated so you may go home."
16            So each one of us went his own way, finding his path through town
17    so as to avoid being caught by those people with paint on their faces and
18    socks over their heads.
19       Q.   And did you see those same people as you left town?
20       A.   I did see them walking around town.  They had scattered.  They
21    were no longer lined up, and they walked around town later on.  There were
22    a lot of them.  And we, all of us, hid out of town so as to avoid being
23    caught.  We wanted to get home.
24       Q.   Did they say anything to you or the people around you when you
25    tried to leave town?
 1       A.   I can't say that, because -- because I took a winding path.  I was
 2    all alone.
 3            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time, I'm just going to ask that
 4    the large Exhibit 17.1, it's the large overview shot of Visegrad, just be
 5    set up for a few minutes so that the witness can indicate some of the
 6    places he's referred to.
 7       A.   I can when you show me that map.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, there is a problem.  Well, the simplest way will
 9    be to go into private session, because if he stands up, he loses the
10    facial distortion.
11            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  All right.  We'll go into private session then.

13            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  We are now in public session.
14            MR. GROOME:
15       Q.   Mr. 116, after you returned to your home, did there come a time
16    when a --
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   -- a person by the name of Captain Bunardic arrived at your house
19    with a list of names?
20       A.   No.  He came -- Pavle, Pavle Bunardic.  He was the commander.  And
21    when the soldiers came, there were the houses, Crnici over there, from the
22    direction I came along, and they were sitting there with my neighbours and
23    brothers.  And then Pavle, he was the most important person.  He was
24    walking round the villages on a daily basis looking for weapons, saying it
25    had to be surrendered.  People who had hunting rifles.  There were no
 1    other weapons except hunting rifles.  And he said whoever didn't give
 2    in their weapons would be executed.  And everyone went to give up their
 3    weapons so as to avoid being executed.
 4       Q.   Was there a particular day when he came to your village which you
 5    saw him in possession of a list containing the names of Muslims that he
 6    was looking for?
 7       A.   Maybe the second or third day of that operation, I went there and
 8    sat with them.  My brothers were there.  There were barracks there.  They
 9    were taking showers there.  And about ten days later, my wife was in
10    Sarajevo, my youngest son was in the house.  He was cooking beans.  I told
11    him, "Make some beans," because my wife was not there.  And we went to dig
12    the fields.  And then on my meadow, young boys play ball.  And I didn't
13    pay any attention.  And when the shooting started from a hill close to the
14    Drina, I saw well --
15       Q.   Were they shooting at you?
16       A.   -- that bullets were falling close to my legs.  I don't know, but
17    the bullets were falling round my legs.
18            And let me just add, there was a pear tree, and I was digging
19    close to the pear tree.  I approached the pear tree, and I found a bullet
20    in the pear tree.  I knew my son was in the house and he would get killed
21    by this large column of soldiers.  I threw down my hoe and ran to the
22    house to save my child, and my neighbours said, "The one who is sitting
23    there with us every day," they said, "Hold on to this old man."  And a
24    small young soldier was holding a pipe, and he said, "Let's set his house
25    on fire."  But I said I had served the army in Belgrade and everywhere and

 1    that he was familiar with Serbia.  And this soldier said, "Don't do
 2    that."  When they sat down - Pavle was their commander, this Pavle - he
 3    asked me, "Do you, old man, have any rakija?"  Then another one said, "Are
 4    there any Serb villages around?"  And I said, "Yes, close by."  And then
 5    they asked, "Did any Muslims get killed or did any house get burnt?"  And
 6    I said, "No."  And then they said, "The SDA party keeps saying that the
 7    Muslims are getting killed."  And I said, "That is not true.  We're
 8    sitting together every day."
 9            Then we brought some walnuts and gave them these walnuts to
10    eat.  And he was holding this list, and he was mentioning people who were
11    in various parties and who used to be in the police.  And when we were
12    leaving the stadium, Ojdanic read out himself and said, "Is such-and-such
13    a person here?"  And all these people came up to Ojdanic.  And I said,
14    "Why should I be held responsible for those people when you had released
15    them down there at the stadium?"
16            Then there was a cave somewhere down there which I had never
17    seen.  And then my son went to my brother's, and then there was a pair of
18    shoes and he tore them opening looking for something inside.  And then
19    there was one of them from Serbia wearing a fur hat.
20       Q.   Excuse me, Mr. 116.  I just want to clear up some things you're
21    speaking about.  You began to say that somebody in the group among the
22    soldiers said, "Let's burn his house down."  Were they referring to your
23    house, to your knowledge?
24       A.   Yes.  Yes.  I calmed them down.  I said that I had been a soldier
25    in Belgrade.  I know all the towns and villages.  So they sat down, and

 1    they ate those walnuts, and then they took out this list and mentioned the
 2    cave, and they asked me if I had any weapons.  I said I didn't have any.
 3    Then he talked to me at length.  He said, "Give up your weapons.  They'll
 4    kill you."  I said, "I don't have any."  And then he asked where this
 5    other brother of mine was or, rather, my son, and Paja [phoen] said, "What
 6    son?  What son?"  I said, "He's my son.  He's gone to cook lunch.  I don't
 7    know where he is."  "He's a hostage.  If you don't bring that son, this
 8    one is done for."  And he said, "Where will I find you?"  And he said,
 9     "You know where our headquarters are."  And then they took my son.
10       Q.   Mr. 116, at one point did these men take your older son into
11    custody?  Yes or no, if you can answer it that way?
12       A.   Those same people, yes, they took this son in front of the house.
13    Then I followed them to see them off.  This was my custom.
14       Q.   Let me ask you another question.  Did they make it -- or did they
15    try to make a deal with you regarding your oldest son?  Did they try and
16    make an arrangement to ask you to bring your youngest son to them as
17    well?
18       A.   Yes.  They ordered that if I don't bring this son, they would kill
19    this other one, the one they were taking down there, and that they would
20    come the next day to set fire to the whole village and kill everyone.
21            So I saw them off part of the way, and then a soldier, they called
22    him Zaric, said, "It's better to get one killed than two."  So I went back
23    and I called this son of mine who had run away to the wood.  And this
24    neighbour of mine, Fadil, was with him.  They were playing ball.  He said,
25    "Father, why are you calling me?"  And I said that I had to take him down

 1    there.  And he said, "You want to take me to get killed."  And I said I
 2    had to.  And Fadil said, "Better take him down there.  It's better to do
 3    that than have the whole village burned down, because they'll blame us,
 4    and this way there will be fewer victims."
 5            So I went after them to the place where they told me the
 6    headquarters were.  I found two officers playing cards, and Pavle was
 7    there.  And I said, "Comrade Commander, I've brought two young men."
 8       Q.   Excuse me, Mr. 116.  Did you bring your other son to a place where
 9    Muslims were brought to be interrogated?
10       A.   I brought them to the place where Pavle had told me to bring them,
11    this other son, because if I hadn't, he said that they would burn down the
12    whole village.  And he said to a soldier, "Take him over there."  And
13    there was a holiday home nearby.  They would interrogate them there and
14    then send them to the prison in Visegrad.
15            And I appealed to the man who was called Zaric, and I said,
16    "Zaric, they'll kill my son.  Please go and protect him."  And he cursed
17    everybody and said that was all wrong.  He ran down the road to the
18    stable, and Zaric went to this weekend home, and then a military van
19    appeared from town, and I saw the van, how they picked them up and they
20    took them off to Visegrad, to the prison.
21       Q.   Mr. 116, did there come a time when you were able to convince them
22    to release your sons?  Yes or no?
23       A.   At the time up there near the house do you mean?
24       Q.   At the time you went to the place of interrogation.  Were you able
25    to get your son released from that place of interrogation?

 1       A.   I went to my sister's when they took this younger one, but the
 2    older one wasn't there.  He wasn't where they said he would be.  Pavle
 3    tricked me.
 4            Then I took a directory, and I called up as many people as I knew
 5    to get my son out of prison.  And I can't say now, but one man said to me
 6    that they would be released.  He said I wasn't -- "I'm not commander of
 7    the prison, but I will certainly release them, even at the cost of my own
 8    life."  I spent two days at my sister's, and again I called his wife and
 9    his son, and then my sister said, "Go home.  Your wife is not there.  You
10    have the livestock to tend to, and the man said he would release them."
11            Then my wife came back and she was crying, and then first Fadil
12    came and then later this young man came, and then later my son, the
13    second -- both the first and the second one were released.  They released
14    14 of them, not just my children, that day.
15       Q.   Mr. 116, you mentioned that -- that these men threatened to burn
16    down the entire village if you did not bring your sons to this place.  Was
17    your village burnt down that day?
18       A.   Well, I took him there.  That's what he said.  He said, if I
19    didn't take the younger son -- that's what I did.
20       Q.   Was your village burnt down that day?
21       A.   No, because I took him off.  I carried out his order.
22       Q.   Did there come a time when your house was burnt down?
23       A.   We were in the woods for many months hiding.  Each house had five
24    or six bunkers from the shells on the right-hand side of the Drina.  We
25    had some binoculars.  The right side is close by, and every second or
 1    third day, military trucks from Uzice would come in bringing mortars and
 2    shells, and the artillery was set up from the Visegradska Banja downwards,
 3    tanks, tops.  And we saw them bringing in the tanks.
 4       Q.   Mr. 116, was there a time that your house was burnt down?  If you
 5    can answer that yes or no, I'd appreciate it.
 6       A.   Not straight away.  When we withdrew from all the villages, that's
 7    when, but we hid there for a very long time in the woods from the five
 8    villages or ten villages, all us people.
 9       Q.   Mr. 116, is it correct that all of the houses in your village were
10    burnt down?
11       A.   There's not a single one standing.  You don't know where they
12    were, where they used to be.  You can't see.
13       Q.   And did all those houses in your village belong to Muslim
14    families?
15       A.   Yes, all of them.
16       Q.   Thank you Mr. 116.
17            MR. GROOME:  I have no further questions, Your Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
19                          Cross-examined by Mr. Domazet:
20       Q.   [Interpretation] Sir, let me ask you first of all something about
21    the last thing you said, what you've just said.  How much time was it all
22    after the events with the officer and when your son was taken off and when
23    your house and the other houses were set fire to?  How much time had gone
24    by?
25       A.   Well, a lot of time had gone by, because we were all in the

 1    woods.  We had taken to the woods.  Some of the houses were shelled and
 2    destroyed, and no houses were left standing, not even sheds.  There was
 3    nothing standing.  Everything was razed to the ground.
 4            On Saturday, for the people who came up for the weekends, they hit
 5    us all the time.  The recruits from Uzice came, and the artillery came,
 6    sir, but they handed in their weapons on the other side.
 7       Q.   Sir, could I ask you to answer my questions, please, what I'm
 8    asking you, and try and be specific and give specific answers.  Let us
 9    repeat.
10            You said that your house and the village was set fire to later on,
11    while you were in hiding.  How long afterwards was that, after your son
12    had been taken and released?  How many days or months, if it was a long
13    period of time?
14       A.   We were in the woods and a lot of time went by.  We had our
15    bunkers in the woods.  We saw that we couldn't stay there.  And then later
16    on, there were some people who stayed on, but I can't remember who they
17    were.  They stayed in the woods, some of them.  But there was a strong
18    offensive from the army at our villages, and that's when all the houses
19    were burnt.
20       Q.   I'm not sure I understood your answer.  I wasn't able to follow
21    you exactly.  Well, let me ask you something else.  Do you remember the
22    day when the Uzice Corps left the Visegrad area?
23       A.   Well, I didn't know that I would come here for me to remember all
24    those dates and things like that.
25       Q.   I didn't mean the date, I meant do you remember the departure of

 1    the Uzice Corps, when the Uzice Corps left?
 2       A.   I remember that they left.  They were there for a time.  How long
 3    they were there, I really can't say.  I don't remember.  And when they
 4    left, when they went back, I was interested in who had left the guns there
 5    to fire at us and the trucks with the ammunitions.  That's what I'm
 6    interested in, who sent the young soldiers to be trained there and sent
 7    all the ammunition and everything else.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, look, sir, please, you really must just answer
 9    the question.  If there is something that the Prosecution wants you to add
10    to your answer later, they will be able to ask you, but at the moment,
11    just answer the question which Mr. Domazet asked you.  He said, "Did you
12    remember the departure of the Uzice Corps?"  And you have said, "Yes."
13    Now, that's the answer to it.
14            Now, you ask your next question, Mr. Domazet.
15            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.
16       Q.   The burning the houses, your own and the other houses in the
17    village, did that take place the day after the Uzice Corps left Visegrad?
18    Yes or no?
19       A.   Afterwards.  Afterwards.  When the army column went to ransack the
20    villages, that's when it happened.
21       Q.   Let us go back to the first day, the day that you were transferred
22    to Visegrad in the truck.  Let's look at that day.
23            According to what you told us today, it wasn't quite clear to you
24    why you were being taken to Visegrad; is that right?
25       A.   Yes, that's right.  I didn't know why I was being taken to

 1    Visegrad.  I apologise for being a little nervous a moment ago.  All we
 2    knew was that they were taking us off to be killed.  When we look at the
 3    photographs from Bijeljina, and the pictures from Bijeljina, everybody
 4    thought that that would happen to us, that we would never return, and
 5    that's why I went to set the livestock free, to let the cattle out.
 6       Q.   In your village, (redacted) I think it's called --
 7       A.   Yes, that's right.
 8       Q.   With the army, did VG22 come?  You know who VG22 is?  He's a
 9    witness.  Did he come too?
10       A.   Yes.  He was there.  That witness was there as well.
11       Q.   What did he say at the time?  Did he tell you to go to Visegrad
12    with the army?  Did he call you to go with the army to Visegrad?
13       A.   Yes, he did.  I was -- we were trying to save ourselves, and
14    that's when I left and went to let my cattle out, because I didn't know if
15    I would return.  The people kept asking him, pleading with him.  They
16    said, "If we leave the Drina, it won't be a good thing.  If we stay in the
17    woods" -- our villages were up there, all the weapons and clothing as
18    somebody had given them weapons and clothing to these Orthodox people.
19    That's why we escaped this way.
20       Q.   Witness 22, therefore, was in the village with the army, and he
21    called upon you and the other inhabitants to go to Visegrad with the army;
22    is that right?  Is that what happened?
23       A.   I don't see seem to remember that.
24       Q.   You said a moment ago that he talked to you and that he spoke
25    about the fact that you should go to Visegrad.

 1       A.   He said that we should go to Visegrad.  The people told him to
 2    look out for our safety because we didn't know what to do or where to go.
 3    So the people asked this person, 22, to look out for our safety and to
 4    see what we should do, and he left.
 5       Q.   You knew Witness 22, didn't you, personally?
 6       A.   Yes, I did.  I knew him personally.  He was with us in the column
 7    going off towards the stadium.
 8       Q.   Is he a relative of yours?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   What kinship relations do you have?
11       A.   He is my brother's son.
12       Q.   So you are his uncle.
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   At that time --
15       A.   He was with the people.
16       Q.   Please let me finish my question before you answer, Witness.
17            Do you know that he was a prominent functionary?
18       A.   Yes, he was.  That's right.
19       Q.   And Witness 22 also went with you and the people in the trucks
20    towards Visegrad; is that right?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   Thank you.  You mentioned a moment ago, and I think that this led
23    to some misunderstanding, that you were brought to the station, the bus
24    station or what used to be the railway station; is that right?
25       A.   Yes.  I went to let out the cattle and then down to the road.

 1       Q.   I'm asking you about Visegrad.
 2       A.   Well, I went across the bridge, and the whole column did, and then
 3    you reach the station right after the bridge up there.  I can show you on
 4    the -- I can't show you on the map because I can't see those small lines,
 5    those thin lines.  I can't see the details on the map for me to be able to
 6    point them out to you.
 7       Q.   Is it true that the station is located right by the city stadium?
 8       A.   Yes, that's correct, just a little to the left.  The stadium for
 9    all the matches is just a little to the left.
10       Q.   When you arrived at the station in the trucks, there were a lot of
11    people in the stadium, weren't there?
12       A.   Yes.  More than half the stadium was already full.  I didn't ask
13    how they had reached the stadium across the Drina River from the
14    right-bank villages.
15       Q.   So that meeting wasn't at the station in fact, it was at the
16    stadium next to the station; is that right?
17       A.   Yes, it was at the stadium.
18       Q.   And you then saw an officer arriving by helicopter, that he talked
19    to you later on, addressed you, and that he was addressed as Ojdanic, that
20    his name was Ojdanic?
21       A.   Yes, that's right.  And the soldiers surrounded him when he
22    arrived.
23       Q.   Did he say that you could return to your villages, that is to say,
24    the villages that you mentioned that they said were safe or liberated,
25    which was the term you used?

 1       A.   Well, we didn't know what was going to happen to us, so we asked
 2    them what to do, whether we could go to the nearby villages.  And they
 3    said, "Well, wait a little while."  And number 22, Witness 22, was next to
 4    him, and he said, "We just have to take care of something."  And they
 5    lined up the soldiers, and the soldiers searched our belongings.  When
 6    this was completed, when the search was completed, he said, "(redacted),
 7    Musici, Jelacici, all the nearby villages have been liberated.  You can go
 8    home now."  That's what he said.
 9       Q.   Thank you.  You've already told us that.  Now, you spoke about the
10    search your belongings.  Did they look for weapons or did they confiscate
11    other things as well?  Did he they loot the people or did they just check
12    for weapons and then let you be?
13       A.   No, they didn't loot us.  They didn't loot our belongings.  The
14    soldiers didn't loot us.  I didn't see them looting.  I personally didn't
15    see them looting.  That's what I can say.
16       Q.   Well, what were they looking for then?  What were they looking for
17    when they searched you?
18       A.   Well, I don't know, because they searched the women, too, in the
19    way that wasn't really very nice.  It wasn't as it should have been.  It
20    wasn't in order.  People just had small bags and some food.  People didn't
21    have any weapons, and they had collected up all the hunting rifles that
22    people had had and handed in.  What they were looking for, I have no idea,
23    actually.  But they did do a lot of searching.  They searched through our
24    shoes as well.  They looked inside.  Why, I don't know.
25       Q.   Yes, but you didn't notice them confiscating anything, taking

 1    anything from the people?
 2       A.   I did not notice anything, no.  I personally didn't.  I stood
 3    along the fence of the stadium.  I wanted to make myself scarce.  I was
 4    afraid.  So I tried to get as far away as possible.  Perhaps somebody else
 5    saw what they were doing and what their behaviour was like.  I personally
 6    didn't.
 7       Q.   At that particular time prior to the meeting at the stadium, did
 8    most of the population flee from Visegrad?  Do you know that?
 9       A.   You mean before they arrived?
10       Q.   Yes, that's right?
11       A.   Lots of people left Visegrad many people.  They went where they
12    could.  Everybody looked out for themselves from the military department
13    and lots and lots of people fled because they saw that they would come to
14    Visegrad.  And my two villages, Gornja and Donja --
15       Q.   Sir, please answer my questions as I ask them, as I put them to
16    you.  Did you hear about the hydroelectric power plant problem, that
17    somebody was in control of the dam and that they wanted to release the
18    water from the dam, and was that the reason why most of the -- why all of
19    these people wanted to leave Visegrad?
20       A.   Well, I can't know that.  I know that there was a man called Murat
21    at the hydroelectric power plant and that the soldiers went up there to
22    guard the place that the corps went up there to the power plant.  There
23    might have been some other people as well at the power plant, maybe some
24    other people as well.  Everybody had heard that he wanted to release the
25    water.

 1       Q.   I didn't quite understand you.  Did you hear that he wanted to
 2    release the water from the dam and that that was the problem?
 3       A.   Nobody would flee from the water, no, not from the water.  We were
 4    afraid.  Everybody was afraid because we knew, more or less, that they
 5    would occupy Visegrad, and a lot of weapons had been given up.
 6       Q.   Sir, I didn't ask you about any weapons.
 7       A.   Well, the people didn't flee from the water from the dam.
 8       Q.   Thank you.
 9            MR. DOMAZET:  I have no further questions for this witness, Your
10    Honour.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Re-examination?
12            MR. GROOME:  No re-examination, Your Honour.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, sir.  That is the end of your task here.
14    Thank you for coming to give the evidence.  You are now free to leave.
15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you all, too, and I am very
16    happy to have seen you all.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, when you and your co-counsel want to
18    discuss things, perhaps you could remove the earphones and then you don't
19    have to shout.
20            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  I told him just now.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.
22                          [The witness withdrew]
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, before you go, I know people have
24    different styles of taking witnesses, but if I may suggest to you the best
25    for the witness like is to say to him - and you must have discovered this
 1    is what he was going to be like when you spoke to him earlier - is to say
 2    to him, "Just answer my question and I'll take you through the story."  If
 3    you just let them talk, we are inundated with irrelevancy.  But if you
 4    take him and say, "What happened on this day?  Where did you go?  Who did
 5    you speak to?" you'll get through it very much more quickly.
 6            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I said that many times to him -- I said
 7    that to him many, many times yesterday.  I think just the excitement of
 8    being present here in the Tribunal, he was off on running.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  It is, if I may say so, a general style of
10    examination that you pursue and it is very much more efficient if you do
11    interrupt them and ask questions.  You may not have been able to control
12    that witness.
13            By the way, we were talking at some stage about your five best
14    witnesses; I assume you have exhausted them, have you, on the issue of
15    attacks on the Muslim population?
16            MR. GROOME:  There will be --
17            JUDGE HUNT:  You were going to limit your -- the number of
18    witnesses you were going to call on that issue.
19            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  Much of the evidence that was
20    brought out through Mr. Domazet's questions I purposely did not go into
21    those topics with the witness.  The only points I wanted to bring out with
22    this witness were the paper and the -- so we have made an effort.  We have
23    struck some of the witnesses off and any of the witnesses that are talking
24    about matters that have already been introduced into evidence, we are not
25    asking them questions on in our case in-chief.
 1            JUDGE HUNT:  He had new material on persecution, I realise that,
 2    but I hope we've now finished calling witnesses solely upon the issue of
 3    an attack upon the Muslim population, because there hasn't been any real
 4    dispute about it, so far as I can see.
 5            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  Well, whose your next witness?   Mr. Ossogo.

19                          Examined by Mr. Ossogo:
20       Q.   Mr. Mevsud Poljo, could you confirm your name.   Could you tell us
21    your name.
22       A.   Mevsud Poljo.
23       Q.   Where and when were you born?
24       A.   On the 4th of May, in the village of Vlahovici.
25       Q.   Where is that village located?

 1       A.   That village is 15 kilometres away from Visegrad.
 2       Q.   Are you married?
 3       A.   Yes, I am.
 4       Q.   Do you have any children?
 5       A.   Yes, I have.
 6       Q.   How many?
 7       A.   Three.
 8       Q.   What is your current profession?
 9       A.   At the moment, I have a private business, private enterprise.
10       Q.   Towards the end of 1995 -- 1991 and the beginning of 1992, where
11    were you living?
12       A.   I lived in the village of Vlahovici.
13       Q.   At that time, had barricades been set up on the main road between
14    Prelovo and Zupa?
15       A.   Yes, they had.  There were several barricades.
16       Q.   Do you have any idea as to why the barricades were set up?
17       A.   Tensions were growing between the Serbian and Bosniak or Muslim
18    people.
19       Q.   After the barricades had been set up, did you leave your village?
20       A.   The barricades were set up a month before.  I didn't leave the
21    village.  I passed the barricades.  They were mostly manned during the
22    night.  During the day, they were dismantled.
23       Q.   In 1992, did you, nevertheless, leave your village at some point?
24       A.   Yes, I did.  In 1992, I was among the first to leave my village,
25    and it was sometime in March, I think.  I'm not quite sure.  Maybe April.

 1    I can't tell you exactly.
 2       Q.   Why?
 3       A.   It was a mixed population, and some shooting started.  There were
 4    disturbances.  Our villages were attacked during the night.  Different
 5    weapons were used, small calibre rifles.  There was shooting from
 6    small-calibre rifles.  Our houses were shot at, and the borderline
 7    villages, and the people were afraid and fled to the interior.
 8       Q.   Which destination did you take when you fled from your village?
 9    Where did you go?
10       A.   I went towards Zepa.
11       Q.   And at Zepa, which locality were you living in?
12       A.   I lived in a small village called Slap, on the banks of the Drina
13    River.  That is to say, I had crossed over into that village, the village
14    of Slap, and I stayed there until the autumn of 1992.
15       Q.   Can you tell us the distance, approximate distance between Zepa
16    and Visegrad?
17       A.   It's about 20 kilometres.  I'm not quite sure.
18       Q.   At Slap, in the Zepa region, did you have an occupation of any
19    kind?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   Which?
22       A.   As the dam was released and the Drina had flooded the area and
23    when the Drina retreated to its riverbed, there was a lot of mud and
24    sludge and slush that was left over.  So I and a neighbour of mine went
25    off with two vehicles to Slap, and we weren't able to cross, to approach

 1    the Drina, because the boats were on the other bank.  And we called to
 2    them to come to our bank, and we cleaned on our side, they cleaned on
 3    their side.  And they told us what the situation was like in Zupa, in the
 4    place that I was from.
 5            Can I continue?  May I continue?
 6       Q.   Yes.  Go ahead.
 7       A.   When we had cleaned this area up and were able to approach the
 8    Drina, the river, then we took up some boats and we told the people from
 9    Zepa that all the people from Zupa would have to leave and that they ought
10    to empty some of their houses so that they could take in the people that
11    were coming in.  The people weren't able to remain where they were because
12    they were threatened.  There was this great threat.  So they asked them to
13    evacuate a few houses.
14       Q.   While you were carrying out this task, were you part of a group
15    that was pulling out bodies from the Drina River?
16       A.   Yes.  For several days, we would carry our relatives and
17    neighbours across the river.  We would transport them across the river.
18    And when we crossed to the other side, I was given the task of being night
19    watchman on the Drina bank, at the lake itself, together with other locals
20    from Zepa.  I carried out that task.  For about a month I was on watch
21    duty.
22       Q.   Where were these bodies coming from that you pulled out of the
23    river?
24       A.   The bodies were coming from Visegrad, downstream.
25       Q.   When did you see those bodies floating for the first time?

 1       A.   One body, the first one, arrived in mid-May.  It was an elderly
 2    man who had no documents on him.  All he had was some prescriptions and
 3    medicines for diabetes, as he suffered obviously from diabetes.  And then
 4    we had connections with Rogatica.  Rogatica was the municipality for
 5    Zepa.  And then the police and judges came from Rogatica.  They pulled out
 6    the body and processed it according to a procedure, the name of which I
 7    don't know.  And then other bodies started arriving in June and July.
 8       Q.   For how long did you continue to perform this function, so to
 9    speak, this role?
10       A.   I think I stayed until October of that same year.  September or
11    October.
12       Q.   How many bodies were you able to pull out together with your
13    comrades during that period?
14       A.   As far as I now remember, we pulled out 170 or 180 bodies, and
15    after I left, I think there were more.  Another 10 or 15, as far as I
16    heard.
17       Q.   What were they, these bodies?  What was your role in this group?
18       A.   I was a member of a group.  There were two or three gentlemen
19    whose task was to row the boat without an engine and also to pull out the
20    bodies during night-time and early in the morning before it became light.
21    So I think the person who collected most of the bodies was a young imam,
22    a hodza, Muratagic.  I now forget his first name.  He alone pulled out
23    more than half of those bodies.  I think up to a hundred.
24            As for my role, my role was once the bodies were taken out of the
25    water, to try and identify them, to search them.  There were five other

 1    men who were searching them, taking out objects from their pockets and
 2    everything else they found on them.  And we worked in such a way that if
 3    we found a document, an ID document or a passport or a health card or a
 4    driving licence, we wouldn't go on searching the body but we would
 5    immediately bury it in a pit not very deep, about 30 centimetres deep.
 6    Depending on whether there were several bodies, we had to dig deeper and
 7    so on.  It depended on the number of bodies we had to bury.
 8            And I would write the description, if we knew who it was, the date
 9    of birth and other particulars.  If we didn't know, if there were no
10    documents on the body, then we would describe it, saying how the person
11    was killed, and we would describe any clothing or shoes or anything that
12    we found on him, and then we would put in a bag those objects and keep
13    them safely.
14       Q.   Could you tell us the percentage of men, women, and children among
15    the bodies that you pulled out of the river?
16       A.   Women, as far as I can now remember -- sometimes I was absent.  I
17    would go to fetch food, because I would also hunt game.  So I think there
18    may have been not more than ten.  Seven or eight women, as far as I can
19    remember, and the rest were men, about 160 or 170 of them.
20       Q.   Did you say the rest were men or women?
21       A.   I didn't quite understand your question.
22       Q.   When I asked you the question as to the percentage share of women,
23    men, or children among the bodies, if you can remember that ratio.
24    Maybe it was due to the translation.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  I guess it must have been, Mr. Ossogo.  The English

 1    translation is very clear.  The witness said, "Seven or eight women, as
 2    far as I can remember, and the rest were men, about 160 or 170 of them."
 3            MR. OSSOGO: [Interpretation] Very well, Mr. President.
 4       Q.   And what general condition were they in?  I'm not asking you for
 5    the specific condition of each individual, but the general condition in
 6    which you found those bodies.
 7       A.   May I just explain this?  I said that there were 160 or 170 men
 8    and that there were women, seven or eight, not more than ten.  Did I make
 9    myself clear?
10            As for children - you asked me about children - two or three small
11    children of a few months old.
12       Q.   It's quite clear now, Mr. Poljo.  But to go back to the last
13    question that I asked you.  What was the general condition of the bodies
14    that you pulled out of the Drina?
15       A.   The bodies we pulled out of the Drina were in a very bad
16    condition.  They had been mutilated.  It's hard to describe.  I can start
17    from the head.  There were 15 or 16 bodies with half their heads missing,
18    several bodies without one eye, some didn't have both eyes.  There were
19    broken arms and legs.  There were bodies that were black and blue, beaten
20    up on the back and the chest.  There were a couple of bodies
21    with their genitals cut off.  I remember one or two bodies that had their
22    sexual organ cut off.  Then their testes were hanging loose, up to their
23    knees.
24            In any event, they had been beaten up.  Those that we examined and
25    that we stripped naked, those were the ones that didn't have any documents

 1    on them.  As for those that had documents, we didn't look further.  We
 2    immediately buried them because there was shelling, we were in a hurry, it
 3    was hot, the bodies were stinking.  For three months you couldn't
 4    approach the Drina River because of the stench.
 5       Q.   Were you able to pull out all the bodies or were there bodies that
 6    you were unable to pull out for any reason, for one reason or another?  At
 7    first we really didn't know what to do for a couple of days.  Those bodies
 8    went by.  They flowed down the river.  And then we sort of tried to
 9    organise ourselves.  I was the one who took the initiative, that we should
10    try to pull out some bodies.  I had two brothers and an uncle and some
11    relatives employed.
12            So while I was on guard duty, I saw these bodies passing by, and
13    then we agreed that we should try and pull out as much as we could, but we
14    pulled out perhaps 20 per cent of the bodies.  The rest flowed by.  We
15    were able to pull them out only during night-time and early in the morning
16    while there was still a mist, because the shelling.
17       Q.   Were there bodies that were so decomposed that you were unable to
18    deal with them?
19       A.   There were bodies that stank so much, as if they had been in a
20    washing machine.  They were all broken up.  I remember two small children,
21    two or three months old.  They were in a plastic bag and then in a jute
22    bag.  And when we pulled out those bags, we tore them open with a
23    Gillette, and we saw they were babies, and we didn't want to do anything.
24    There was a naked baby.  I was in the boat when we tried to pull it out,
25    and we just couldn't.  So we let it flow down the river.

 1       Q.   So the bodies that you were able to pull out and examine were in a
 2    relatively acceptable state, to put it that way?
 3       A.   Yes, that's right.
 4       Q.   Could you describe to us the condition in which -- the condition
 5    of the first body that you were able to take out?
 6       A.   The first body, the one that arrived sometime in May, I was
 7    present all the time while the description was being done.  I couldn't
 8    notice anything, whether he had been killed or whether he had thrown
 9    himself into the river.  I don't remember any evidence of any blows or any
10    fractures on him.
11       Q.   Did this body have his genitals out or any organs broken?
12       A.   I was speaking about the man whose -- that is, the body that
13    reached us in May,  And it was in June and July that bodies came on a
14    daily basis.  First some bodies flowed by, and then we managed to catch
15    some that had their skulls broken up to their eyes.  There was no brain
16    left, and small fish were entering the cavities in their heads.  And their
17    legs had been broken.  Some had one leg.  I don't know which.
18       Q.   This body that was in such a condition was pulled out in the month
19    of June, wasn't it, more or less, roughly?
20       A.   In June, the bodies were in a worse condition.  But later on, as
21    time went by, in the summer, the bodies came in a very bad condition.  So
22    I think that most of the crimes that occurred occurred in June.  Seventy
23    or 90 per cent in June and then in July.
24       Q.   Could you describe the condition of the body of a woman whose
25    tongue had been torn out?

 1       A.   Yes.  I remember there was a youngish woman, under 30, that was
 2    naked and wrapped up in a blanket, and her tongue had been pulled out and
 3    tied with some wire or something and tied to the side, towards her ear,
 4    with cord or a wire.  I can't remember.
 5       Q.   Were you able to pull out of the Drina bodies of women wrapped up
 6    in sheets, but several bodies at the same time?
 7       A.   Yes.  On one occasion, I think there were two younger women and a
 8    woman of some 50.  So two under 30 and one of 50 who came in that
 9    condition.
10       Q.   Were you able to identify to whom those sheets belonged?  Was it
11    to an individual or an institution?
12       A.   As regards this one young woman, she came later, wasn't it?  Three
13    or four women came at once.  One was a young girl, I think she was, a
14    young woman, and her name was, or surname, rather, I think it was Smajic
15    or Smajlovic.  She came from a village close to mine.  Lasci or something
16    like that, village of Lasci.  And this young woman arrived together -- she
17    was clothed, nicely dressed.  We found on her, in her leather jacket, a
18    passport belonging to another young woman who was working abroad.  I think
19    it was in Austria.  And we buried her.  We just took the documents.  And
20    she had some money on her, wrapped around her waist.  She had sewn some
21    money into her clothing.
22            When we had finished all that, we had said who it was, and the
23    story was, as parents would come there daily, women looking for their
24    husbands, checking to see whether they could recognise anyone, and when we
25    said about this young woman, they said it was not true, that that young

 1    woman was alive, that she had crossed somewhere up there the village of
 2    Luka, I think, that she had crossed into Luka and that she was alive
 3    there, that this could have been someone else.
 4            Then the brother or father, anyway, relatives of that young woman
 5    came together with that girl who was alive, and it had to do with the
 6    documents.  She was afraid because she had worked abroad, and she had
 7    given her her documents and this money so as not to be killed, and this
 8    other woman was very poor.
 9       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Poljo.  I would like to know, for the
10    record, the colour of those sheets.  You spoke of three women that you
11    pulled out of the river, and they were wrapped up in sheets.
12       A.   Yes.  Two other youngish women and an older woman.  One was
13    younger and the other older.  As if they were mother and daughter, they
14    were in blankets.  They were wrapped in blankets.  And there was another
15    older woman, but I think that was later.  I think it was my aunt.  She
16    arrived that same day.
17            The blankets, they were multicolored.  I think they were brown
18    in colour.  Mostly they were brown in colour.
19       Q.   Could those blankets have belonged to a hotel?
20       A.   As we found the documents on this girl and as they arrived on the
21    same day, a couple of hours later, I had been to the Vilina Vlas Hotel,
22    and I knew, when I was visiting a relative there - and there are other
23    people who confirmed this  - that these blankets could have come from the
24    Vilina Vlas Hotel.  This young woman had to pass by that hotel.
25            These other two women on whom we found no documents, these people

 1    recognised them as neighbours.  I think they used to work for Smajlovic.
 2    She came from Kamenica, and she was the sister or daughter of a forester,
 3    and she had married into this Lasci village, and she had to pass by that
 4    hotel.  So this was another element that was taken into consideration.
 5       Q.   Did you pull out bodies from the Drina on which there were traces
 6    of bullets or firearms?
 7       A.   Yes.  I remember two men.  They were not neighbours, but I knew
 8    them well.  One of them had worked on my house.  I can't recollect just
 9    now.  His name was Hamed Kresmer and Ibrahim Kresmer.  They were killed in
10    the easiest way.  They just had one bullet hole in the chest.  One had one
11    in the chest and the other one had one in the neck.  They were well
12    dressed, clean, the bodies were fresh.  They had cigarettes
13    on them,  All the documents, as if they were on their way to a party.
14    They were clean-shaven, only they had gone stiff and their arms were
15    raised upwards.
16       Q.   Were you able to see any traces of abuse on the legs or bodies of
17    females?
18       A.   We described everything the way we found it.  There were traces on
19    the chest and the neck of one young woman, and this other one as well, the
20    one came previously.  I don't remember whether they had been killed with
21    a weapon or something like that or that they had any fractures.  They
22    could only have been strangled or poisoned.
23       Q.   You said a little earlier that there were objects that you took
24    from the bodies and recorded.  What was the general condition of those
25    objects?  The clothing, were they in civilian clothing or possibly in

 1    military clothing?
 2       A.   The objects, I consider objects to be lighters, for instance.  I
 3    think that there were empty wallets.  There were a lot of those.  Then
 4    there were some medical booklets, a passport here and there, a driving
 5    licence.  There were prescriptions, documents, titles to land.  There was
 6    some photographs.  A couple of bodies were found with some money on them.
 7    I remember that a man had 500 German marks on him. He was from a place
 8    called Varnice.  And the girl that I mentioned a moment ago, she had some
 9    money on her too.
10            So there were some small objects.  I remember a man who had five
11    or six watches, pocket-watches on a chain.  And then a body or two would
12    have a wristwatch on it.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Ossogo, it's 4.00.  We'll adjourn now until 9.30
14    in the morning.
15                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 4.00 p.m.,
16                          to be reconvened on Tuesday, the 18th day
17                          of September, 2001, at 9.30 a.m.
