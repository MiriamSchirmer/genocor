 5                          --- Upon commencing at 3.00 p.m.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Case number IT-98-32-T, the Prosecutor versus
 8    Mitar Vasiljevic.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, we will go through to 4.00 as you
10    requested and then we will take a 20 minute break before we proceed.
11            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
12            [Interpretation] Your Honour, I would like to say that I have
13    noticed three errors in my written final brief, which I wish to correct
14    now.  Although I do not think they are important.  One is in the table of
15    contents, under number 8, where witness VG81 is incorrectly marked VGD81.
16    And on page 41, instead of Pionirska Street, in the afternoon, it should
17    read, in the evening hours.  And another error I noticed is on --
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Whereabouts on page 41?  In the heading?  I see.  In
19    the heading?  It should be evening hours?
20            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
22            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] And on page 108, in the last line,
23    it says, "VG133."  It should read VG13.  I apologise for these errors.
24            Your Honour, I shall continue my closing arguments, from the point
25    where I explained whether Mitar Vasiljevic, based on the submissions of
 1    the Prosecution, really was or was not a member of Milan Lukic's group.
 2    One of the arguments of the Prosecution, to support this claim, was the
 3    fact that Mitar Vasiljevic said certain things in his testimony.  And I
 4    would like to take a few minutes to talk about this in private session.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Very well.  We will go into private session.  How
 6    long do you think you will be?
 7            MR. DOMAZET:  A few minutes only, Your Honour.

12            JUDGE HUNT:  We are now back in public session.
13            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] In our view, the Defence has
14    provided evidence to show where Mitar Vasiljevic spent the time from the
15    19th or the 20th of May when the Uzice Corps withdrew from Visegrad, to
16    the 14th of June, 1992.  Until the end of May, he was in Prelovo as a
17    mobilised member of the Territorial Defence, where he worked in the
18    kitchen, and this was borne out by the testimony of a number of witnesses
19    whom I have mentioned in the final brief, so I will not repeat what they
20    said now.
21            After he left Prelovo in early June, Mitar Vasiljevic spent a few
22    days in Uzamnica because of the incident in the headquarters when he gave
23    back his weapons and refused to go back to Prelovo.  After these few days,
24    in the view of the Defence, this was around the 3rd of June, he was
25    released from prison, and the reason for this seems to have been that he
 1    wanted to attend the funeral of his cousin.  Evidently, however, no other
 2    measures were pronounced against him for what he had done and this was
 3    probably due to his behaviour and the danger that he might cause an
 4    incident in Prelovo, so that as far as his obligation toward the
 5    Territorial Defence went, he was relieved of his duty and his weapons, and
 6    was instead charged with another duty, which was almost humiliating and
 7    this was to look after the cleanliness of the town.
 8            It's hard to imagine that a member of a group such as Milan
 9    Lukic's unit, which consisted of young, well-equipped, well-armed men who
10    were always on the move, as is evident from the evidence produced in this
11    case, to have in their ranks someone like Mitar Vasiljevic and for the
12    reasons I have put forward, this was also physically impossible.
13            In our view, the evidence produced in this case shows that there
14    is no evidence to show that he actually belonged to Milan Lukic's
15    paramilitary unit.
16            Mr. Groome in his closing arguments did say that if he did not
17    belong to the group formally, he could have belonged to it informally.  It
18    is difficult to imagine what kind of membership we are talking about here,
19    informal and formal membership of the group, and whether this informal
20    membership in the group would also imply an ad hoc membership in a
21    specific moment, at a specific time, which cannot be accepted, nor can it
22    be used as a proof for something that is quite crucial in this case,
23    namely the possible participation in common design and perpetration of
24    criminal acts.
25            Therefore, we believe, Your Honours, that neither formal nor

 1    informal membership can be ascribed to Mitar Vasiljevic, and it is our
 2    submission that the situations which were discussed here in this case,
 3    namely when he was in the company of Milan Lukic, were sufficiently
 4    explained, and as such cannot be used as evidence to support this fact, to
 5    prove this fact.
 6            Let me now try to analyse some of the facts which concern the
 7    events of the 14th of June, 1992.  After that, and after I assess a number
 8    of other facts and evidence about this incident, I should like to turn to
 9    the so-called Drina River incident and give you my interpretation of that
10    incident.  It is not disputed that Mitar Vasiljevic was present at this
11    incident.  However, what we do dispute is his participation in the
12    incident.
13            I will try not to repeat what is already stated in the final brief
14    of the Defence and concentrate on certain crucial points which I believe
15    are significant for the purposes of assessing the testimony of witnesses
16    who testify about the events of the 14th of June, 1992.
17            First of all, we are faced with a very important issue from the
18    perspective of the Defence, which is whether Mitar Vasiljevic was at any
19    point in time on this day in the centre of the town before the new hotel
20    in Visegrad, in front of the new hotel in Visegrad, where the group from
21    Koritnik had gathered, the group which was late for the bus.  We believe,
22    Your Honours, this to be very important also in view of the fact that the
23    indictment charges the accused Vasiljevic with sending this group from
24    Koritnik to Pionirska Street and with placing them in the Memic house.
25            Witnesses of the events which occurred in front of the hotel in

 1    Visegrad are six in total, and they were also witnesses as to the events
 2    which happened later on that day, because all six of them from -- were
 3    part of this group that had come from Koritnik.  The Chamber and other
 4    participants in these proceedings know who these witnesses are and I
 5    should like to move directly to the assessment of the Defence of their
 6    testimony regarding these particular events.
 7            As for these six witnesses, three testified that they had not seen
 8    Mitar Vasiljevic in front of the Visegrad Hotel.  They also testified that
 9    he had not gone with them.  They testified that he -- they did not testify
10    that he had gone with them to Pionirska Street.  I'm referring to
11    witnesses VG13, 18, and 84.  Let me first dwell on the testimony of these
12    three witnesses, who spoke about having seen Mitar Vasiljevic, because I
13    think that from what they testified before the Court, and in view of their
14    prior statements as to the same events, it follows quite clearly that they
15    were not in a position to see Mitar Vasiljevic in front of the hotel on
16    that day, that they could not have seen him.  Out of these three
17    witnesses, two are sisters and they did not part at any point in time on
18    that day, as they testified.  However nevertheless, they provided two very
19    different testimonies about this event.
20            One of them, VG78, testified that she had seen Mitar Vasiljevic
21    immediately together with other individuals in front of the hotel.
22    Furthermore, that he had a rifle slung on his shoulder, a fact which was
23    not seen by any of the witnesses later that day, including in Pionirska
24    Street.  Quite the contrary.  We heard testimony that he did not have a
25    rifle in Pionirska Street.  However, this person stated that an individual

 1    whom she identified as Mitar Vasiljevic followed them to Pionirska Street
 2    together with two or three other armed individuals.
 3            Your Honour, it is the opinion of the Defence that this witness,
 4    as well as her sister, VG101, at that time did not actually know Mitar
 5    Vasiljevic at all, and that if they gave a description of an individual in
 6    front of the hotel in this way, we submit, Your Honours, that they must
 7    have referred to another individual, because the sister of this witness,
 8    VG101, testified that the individual whom she had identified as Mitar
 9    Vasiljevic had arrived by car.  She could not remember the car, she could
10    not provide any further explanation.  However, she was sure that he had
11    arrived in a car, and that he had also left later on in a car, which is
12    not credible in view of the fact that Mitar Vasiljevic never owned a car
13    or a driver's licence for that matter, nor did he ever drive any car, and
14    except for this witness, no one ever saw him in such a situation.
15            This witness described the individual in question as wearing a big
16    chain and a cross.  Now, this is something that no one ever saw on Mitar,
17    neither on that day nor later on the same day, and we believe that it is
18    evident that unless this witness has invented such an individual, that
19    this must have been someone else and not Mitar Vasiljevic.
20            It is interesting to point out the fact that this witness stated
21    that no one had followed them to Pionirska Street, which is different from
22    the testimony of her sister, who was always with her, and who stated that
23    they had been escorted by two or three individuals, including Mitar
24    Vasiljevic, or the individuals whom she identified as being Mitar
25    Vasiljevic.

 1            What we believe to be quite significant and rather telling, as
 2    regards the testimony of VG78, is the fact, Your Honours, that both before
 3    the Chamber during the cross-examination, when confronted with her
 4    statement given to the MUP of Bosnia and Herzegovina, she admitted that
 5    she had given a statement to that effect.  She confirmed that it was
 6    indeed her statement, and the statement reads as follows in this respect:
 7    "There was a certain Mitar near the hotel at the time, a Mitar from
 8    Pozdercici whose surname I don't know.  He was wearing civilian clothes
 9    and a traditional Serb hat on his head, whereas others were wearing
10    camouflage uniforms."
11            The witness gave this statement in 1995, some three years after
12    the events, and it is quite clear that if she was indeed speaking about
13    this Mitar, because Mitar Vasiljevic, as we know, is not from Pozdercici,
14    nor did he ever wear sajkaca, the traditional Serbian hat, she was
15    probably thinking of another individual whom she didn't know by name or
16    surname.  In view of that, it is quite strange that a year ago, and now,
17    before the Court, that she should know the surname of the individual whom
18    she had not known before, and that she knew a number of other things about
19    him.
20            The third witness who claimed --
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, everything you've told us about the two
22    twin sisters are in your final brief.  You haven't given us any new
23    information about it.  Now, please do proceed upon the basis that we have
24    read your final submission.  What we want you to do is to elaborate
25    something if it can be elaborated, but you've spent now 20 minutes telling

 1    us what's on one page of a document of 120 something pages long.  Now, we
 2    will be here for weeks if we go at this rate.  We have read your
 3    submissions, they are very helpful.  There are a few questions we will be
 4    asking you about them later but we would like you to deal with other
 5    material now, not what we've already read.
 6            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.  [Interpretation] It is
 7    quite possible, I'm afraid, that I am repeating myself, but I deemed this
 8    to be very important.  Let me finish with just a few words about this
 9    third witness who apparently had seen this person talking to Lipovac for
10    about ten minutes, though it is quite evident that the individual in
11    question had never reached Visegrad, and that he was at the head of the
12    column for Pionirska Street.
13            As for the three persons who did not see Mitar Vasiljevic, the
14    most important in my opinion is the fact that VG13 was able to fully
15    recognise the person who was in uniform and to whom she had spoken and who
16    had issued them some instructions.  She told us that this was Brane
17    Tesevic, a waiter from Visegrad.  There is no reason not to believe this
18    witness, and Witness VG18, who claimed that Mitar Vasiljevic was not in
19    front of the hotel.  In particular, because of the fact that VG13 is a
20    witness who severely charged Mitar Vasiljevic for his participation in
21    what happened later that evening.  So she surely would not have said that
22    the individual in question was Brane Tesevic, the person who was in front
23    of the hotel, if that had been Mitar Vasiljevic.
24            Mitar Vasiljevic, furthermore, could not have been in front of the
25    hotel at the time, and I think that this is a fact which could have been

 1    easily established from the testimony of Prosecution witness VG87, who
 2    almost one hour before the Koritnik group reached the Memic house had seen
 3    Mitar Vasiljevic walking along that street.  He described him the way he
 4    saw him, and he also told us what he had in his hand.  I do not wish to go
 5    into details, because they are contained in my brief.  However, let me
 6    just point out that it is the testimony of this witness that indicates
 7    that Mitar Vasiljevic was not in front of the Visegrad Hotel and that the
 8    Koritnik group could have been seen by him only at the same time as it had
 9    been seen by VG87, that is at the moment they reached the house belonging
10    to the Memic family, when, according to this witness, they actually
11    entered the house so they were no longer visible to him.
12            VG87 clearly stated that at that moment, Mitar Vasiljevic was in
13    the street in front of his house, but he also stated that he didn't see
14    when he actually went towards this house.  But that, however, is not in
15    dispute.  It is also not in dispute that at one point in time during that
16    afternoon, Mitar Vasiljevic did find himself in the company of (redacted)
17    (redacted), who was in the Koritnik group and who arrived in Pionirska
18    Street with them.  It is not in dispute that they talked, and I believe it
19    is not in dispute that they had a drink together, that they drank brandy,
20    as they had done on numerous previous occasions, because the witnesses
21    knew them both in this context.
22            What is in dispute here is what was actually said in their
23    conversation, and whether Mitar Vasiljevic also talked to other persons
24    and especially whether he made any suggestions or gave them any
25    instructions as to where and how they should go.

 1            These facts have been interpreted very differently by all the
 2    witnesses who testified here about this event and the six witnesses I
 3    mentioned as witnesses to the beginning of the event in front of the
 4    Visegrad Hotel.  I will not repeat their testimonies, even briefly,
 5    because I have summarised them in my final brief, but I will point out
 6    certain details which I consider to be important, although most of these
 7    witnesses mention a certificate given to (redacted) by Mitar
 8    Vasiljevic, they speak quite differently about the circumstances, about
 9    the way in which the certificate came to be issued, how, in what manner,
10    and what the certificate actually contained.
11            As regards the certificate, Mitar Vasiljevic stated here that he
12    had tried to remember it but that he was really unable to remember that he
13    gave anything in writing to (redacted), although he allowed for the
14    possibility that perhaps he had done something of the sort, although he
15    couldn't remember it.  The question is:  Would Mitar Vasiljevic be able to
16    remember anything about this event, had not (redacted), whom he knew
17    well, and whom he remembered, who helped him to remember the events in
18    Pionirska Street.  However, not only has time eroded his memory, because
19    Mitar Vasiljevic probably never thought that he would be called upon to
20    remember these details and that after so many years had passed, this would
21    be very important for him personally.  Also, I believe that at that
22    moment, he really had been drinking and, of course, after the passage of
23    so much time, this cannot be established.  We cannot know whether he was
24    only tipsy or whether he was drunk, whether he was more or less
25    inebriated, but he evidently was under the influence of alcohol and as

 1    VG87 explained, he was walking up and down the street, holding a bottle in
 2    one hand, and this was certainly the bottle from which he had started
 3    drinking even before he met (redacted).  And this witness evaluates
 4    his behaviour differently now, like all the witnesses who experienced this
 5    tragedy in Pionirska Street and who, in my view, have been trying to
 6    identify and establish persons who, apart from the direct perpetrators,
 7    may have played a role.
 8            This is what this witness, as well as some other witnesses, is
 9    trying, in view of the behaviour of Mitar Vasiljevic on that afternoon, to
10    understand.  They are trying to establish that his behaviour could have
11    had some connection with what happened to them later in the course of that
12    evening.
13            In my view, the behaviour of Mitar Vasiljevic on that occasion
14    really has nothing to do with what happened to those people on that
15    evening, with what Milan Lukic and the others did to them.  Not only
16    because Mitar Vasiljevic was not a member of this group, and not only
17    because he went directly from that spot to the next village or hamlet to
18    get a horse, which he mounted and then had an accident where he fell off
19    the horse in the town, after which he was taken first to the out-patients
20    clinic and then to the hospital, but because, in my view, Mitar
21    Vasiljevic's behaviour that afternoon, which was not, so to speak, normal,
22    could have resulted only from the fact that he was under the influence of
23    alcohol and this was the reason he behaved in the way described by Witness
24    VG87, who saw him walking up and down the street, saying -- uttering
25    disconnected sentences.  He also saw him at a certain point in time

 1    barefoot, and if this really happened and it was a cloudy, windy, rainy
 2    day, it really was not normal behaviour or the behaviour of a sober
 3    person.  This could only have meant that this was a man who was under the
 4    influence of alcohol and it explains the fact that he can not remember his
 5    entire conversation with (redacted) and what many witnesses are
 6    saying, that is, that he actually wrote something in his own hand.
 7            If we accept that he really did write something at (redacted)
 8    (redacted) request or on his own initiative, and that he then handed this
 9    to the other man, and if we assume that the content was what only one
10    witness in my view claims to have read, I think the witness is VG13, and
11    according to that witness, what was written on that piece of paper was --
12    I had read from the transcript in English:  "Nobody is going to harm
13    you."  [Interpretation] Signed with Mitar Vasiljevic's first and last
14    name.  This is what VG13 said in court, although it's telling that she
15    never said this before to the OTP investigator, even though she made her
16    statement three or four years prior to her testimony.
17            In my view, these witnesses obviously have a common purpose, which
18    is to lay the blame at the door of Mitar Vasiljevic for aiding and
19    abetting in what happened to them that night.  I am not sure that this
20    whole story involving the certificate is not a total fabrication, because
21    I truly cannot see the importance of a certificate containing this sort of
22    message, written by a man who -- whom they knew either through hearsay or
23    in other ways was a waiter, that he was an alcoholic, who had no position,
24    although I shall go back to this, some witnesses say that he was connected
25    to the Red Cross, but even were this so, what sort of personal guarantee

 1    given by a man like that, written by hand and handed over in this manner,
 2    could be useful while in the view of the OTP this is a crucial piece of
 3    evidence, I think that even the word "intelligent move" was used, intended
 4    to deceive these people or to trick them, and in my view, this is not
 5    tenable, even had a certificate been written down in this manner.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, Mr. Domazet, we will take a 20-minute break now
 7    but I've been adding up sometimes.  You have had about an hour and a
 8    quarter now.  We have to finish this afternoon or this evening.
 9            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, we will finish, Your Honour, I am sure.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, let's hope, then, that we will be speeding up a
11    little bit through the evidence.  We do have most of that already in the
12    final brief that you filed.  We will adjourn now until 4.20.
13                          --- Recess taken at 4.00 p.m.
14                          --- On resuming at 4.20 p.m.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet?
16            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.  [Interpretation] Your
17    Honours, I will try to speed up a little bit.  I'm not going to mention
18    things that have been explained in detail in my brief.  However, as for
19    the event which I haven't finished yet, I should like to mention just a
20    few additional things.
21            Apart from what I have said regarding the certificate and its
22    value, if it indeed existed, there is one more fact that needs to be
23    mentioned, that is whether Mitar Vasiljevic was in the position to give
24    such information to this group, that is to give the information about the
25    group to Milan Lukic and his soldiers, as some of these witnesses

 1    suspected.  This also being the Prosecution case.
 2            First of all, their presence in the centre of Visegrad around
 3    noon, in front of the hotel.  They were seen by a number of people there,
 4    including soldiers and police officers, as they themselves testified, and
 5    also some individuals who were obviously members of the paramilitary
 6    forces.  All those who were in the vicinity of the Visegrad Hotel
 7    apparently knew that they were going to the Mahala neighbourhood, to
 8    Pionirska Street.  That group of people could also be easily seen in the
 9    very centre of the town, as it was moving in the direction of Pionirska
10    Street.  Although it has been alleged here that the area in question was
11    far from the centre of the town, one must mention the fact that Memic's
12    houses are only about 100 metres away from the main road leading from
13    Visegrad towards Uzice, in the area where the petrol station is located,
14    the petrol station which was mentioned by VG77.  So their transfer to
15    Pionirska Street could by no means constitute a secret for anyone.
16            On the other hand, the insistence that they should be only in one
17    house has nothing to do with what actually happened that evening.  In this
18    regard, let me remind you that the perpetrators of the crime took people
19    not only from the Memics' house to the Omeragic house, but also from the
20    house of VG87, that is his wife and four other persons, which had nothing
21    to do with the Koritnik group.  On the other hand, one must not lose sight
22    of the fact that these people reached the Memic house on their own and
23    stayed there because that was the only solution for them at the time.  Any
24    instruction or any insistence on the part of anyone, including Mitar
25    Vasiljevic, really had no significance whatsoever, if indeed such an

 1    instruction existed.
 2            Furthermore, this group of people was at no point in time guarded
 3    by anyone, and it is true that they could have, if they wanted or dared,
 4    in view of the fact that they were likely to encounter various groups of
 5    individuals on their way, gone to some other part of the town.  It is
 6    obvious, however, that the group wanted to stay together, because they
 7    believed that the following morning, they would take the first bus and
 8    leave the town, having missed the bus on that day.
 9            On the other hand, never, before that day, on the 14th of June,
10    something of this sort had happened in the town of Visegrad.  Never did
11    such a large group, including women, children and elderly, never was such
12    a large group exposed or been killed or murdered in this way.  So I think
13    that it is not likely that these people feared that.  They may have feared
14    the possibility of being robbed, because regrettably, that had already
15    been a common occurrence.  Moreover, without having -- without having any
16    witnesses testifying at this Court, people who arrived on that evening, or
17    rather on that afternoon, about this particular fact, it is impossible, it
18    is unacceptable for this certificate to be invoked at all.  So it is
19    either that this certificate never really existed or they themselves were
20    aware that such a piece of paper could not help them in cases of such
21    groups, that is groups of paramilitaries.
22            It is true that a witness, a lady witness, mentioned that there
23    was talk about the possibility of showing the certificate to the police,
24    if necessary, which is quite strange, that the police should need a paper
25    of this kind, in particular a certificate issued by Mitar Vasiljevic.

 1            I should now like to conclude with this event, which was described
 2    in my brief in detail, by saying that it is the position of the Defence
 3    that whatever Mitar Vasiljevic may have said or written at that moment,
 4    given the situation he was in, cannot be interpreted as any kind of
 5    intention to retain these people together so that they can be robbed or
 6    killed.  Furthermore, he had nothing to do with what later happened to
 7    them, although some of them still do not believe this and, in my view,
 8    that is the only reason why they wanted to testify that they had seen him,
 9    whereas that simply could not have been the case.
10            As regards the other event which took place on that afternoon,
11    that is the arrival of the group of paramilitaries, the robbery and the
12    rape of two women, even here, during the testimony of some of the
13    witnesses, actually in the case of only two witnesses, the mother and the
14    son, VG13 and VG38, only they make mention of the fact that they had seen
15    or heard Mitar Vasiljevic somewhere in the vicinity of the house at the
16    time.  I do not want to dwell too long on this issue because the
17    Prosecution has not charged Mitar Vasiljevic with being present amongst
18    the group which arrived in the house on that afternoon, at least this is
19    what we can conclude from count 18.  However, the event which followed on
20    that evening is in dispute because Mitar Vasiljevic has been charged with
21    being one of the people who transferred the group of people from the first
22    house to the Omeragic house, and also with being one of the participants
23    in the killing of these people.
24            I will devote sometime to the alibi of the accused, that is the
25    fact that he was not, nor could he be, in Pionirska Street on that

 1    evening.  Later on, but for the time being, I should just like to say a
 2    few words about the testimony of the witnesses who charged him with being
 3    present in the house on that evening, though this has been explained in
 4    detail in my written brief.
 5            Let me mention first of all that today, after we have heard all
 6    evidence regarding Pionirska Street, it is the position of the Defence
 7    that the situation the way it was described by the witnesses and charged
 8    in the indictment simply could not have happened.  The event in itself is
 9    not in dispute.  This group of people was indeed locked up in the Omeragic
10    house, as it is not in dispute that the room was set on fire.  What is in
11    dispute is what happened afterwards regardless of who the participants of
12    the event were.
13            Of the surviving witnesses, four were in the room and two had
14    managed to escape earlier on.  All of them claim that these men were next
15    to the house, next to the rooms in question, and that it was right beneath
16    the windows that they waited and stood guard to see if anyone should
17    attempt to jump out of the window, and that they opened fire in such
18    cases.  They also claim that Mitar Vasiljevic was one of these
19    individuals.  However, Your Honours, not only would it have been quite
20    impossible for these four persons, two women and two boys, to have jumped
21    out of the window and found themselves in the vicinity of these armed men
22    and avoid being killed by them, but also for the father of VG61 and
23    another elderly gentleman to leave the house through the door.  The man in
24    question testified that he had passed by the house as he was going towards
25    the creek.  Since it is quite obvious that the fire was so severe that it

 1    was impossible to survive for any longer period of time inside the room,
 2    and that only those who managed to escape at the very beginning survived,
 3    we believe, Your Honours, that the people, the men who had set the house
 4    on fire, left the scene immediately and that, furthermore, they did not
 5    remain in the vicinity of the house, as it has been described by the
 6    witnesses.
 7            What makes me quite confident about this particular fact is the
 8    testimony of Witness VG87.  He was able to follow the events from the
 9    attic.  He was able to hear things and observe things.  It was his wife
10    who was with a group of people in his house at about 1100 that evening,
11    who was taken in the direction of this house and never returned.  She
12    perished in the fire.  Had there been any shooting from automatic rifles,
13    as stated by the other witnesses, it would not have been possible for
14    Witness VG87, whose house was some 50 or 80 metres away, not to have heard
15    this or noticed this, and the only reasonable possibility is that this did
16    not actually happen.
17            I will not go into an analysis of the testimonies of the witnesses
18    who claim to have seen Mitar Vasiljevic such as witnesses 78 and 101, who
19    were sisters, and who either did not identify him or misidentified him in
20    front of the Visegrad Hotel, so it is not credible that they saw him that
21    night, or Witness VG13, who departed from her first statement made to the
22    investigators in which she stated that she saw Mitar Vasiljevic using a
23    flashlight, which is not credible because the person who is actually
24    holding a flashlight is usually not visible.  Witness VG13 then expanded
25    on her statement, before the Court, saying that in the situations, she had

 1    described previously, involving Sredoje Lukic as a participant, and it is
 2    quite telling that until her cross-examination, she never once mentioned
 3    this name, although she mentioned it as many as 16 times in the statement
 4    she gave to the investigators.  It is my submission, therefore, that
 5    because of the numerous contradictions and discrepancies, these witnesses
 6    should not be believed when they say that the event that took place in the
 7    evening happened in the way described, but I will not dwell on this any
 8    further because the Defence of Mitar Vasiljevic is a Defence of alibi.
 9            A lot of evidence has been provided to support this.  There were
10    witnesses who saw Mitar Vasiljevic riding a horse and falling off the
11    horse in Visegrad that afternoon, and also witnesses who treated him in
12    the medical centre, who took him to Uzice from Visegrad.  In his closing
13    statement, Mr. Groome stated that he did not believe Mitar Vasiljevic was
14    injured in the way described or that he had ridden a horse at all that
15    afternoon.  Eye witnesses who saw this were referred to by him as friends
16    and acquaintances of Mitar Vasiljevic.  These were people who knew him but
17    none of them had ever entered his home, so these were not special friends
18    of his, especially not friends so close that they would risk perjury to
19    state a fact such as this.
20            Let me just remind you that in his testimony, Mr. Roy, an
21    investigator of the Prosecution, in response to a question put to him by
22    the Defence, confirmed that he had interviewed a person of Muslim
23    ethnicity who confirmed that she was a witness to the fact that Mitar
24    Vasiljevic had ridden a horse and fallen off the horse in the centre of
25    Visegrad, but this person was never brought to testify before this

 1    Tribunal.  What is much more important than the witness statements in the
 2    view of the Defence, is the medical documentation, which shows very
 3    clearly that Mitar Vasiljevic's alibi is well-founded.
 4            Apart from the eye witnesses who saw him fall off a horse, his
 5    alibi is also confirmed by people such as Dr. Loncarevic, who gave him
 6    first aid in the health centre in Visegrad, and then referred him to
 7    Uzice; people who accompanied him in the ambulance, the driver, Mr. Savic,
 8    and Mr. Novakovic, the financial manager of the health centre, who was in
 9    the vehicle.  Then their stop in Vardiste and the testimony of Mitar
10    Vasiljevic's uncle, who saw them there.  What is very important is the
11    fact that when the ambulance arrived in Uzice, according to the driver,
12    this was before 9.00 p.m., which is the official time recorded as the time
13    of his admission to hospital in Uzice, or rather the official time is 9.35
14    that evening.  This must be the established time, although it is quite
15    possible that the vehicle arrived earlier and that various formalities
16    concerning his admission to hospital were being implemented so that the
17    time gap can be explained by the time needed to fill in all the forms and
18    to have the patient admitted to hospital.
19            This is Exhibit P137, which is a hospital ledger -- the hospital
20    admissions ledger, where persons brought in from the battle-front were
21    recorded.  This term was contested here and I think that we put in a lot
22    of effort to establish why all the patients coming from a certain area,
23    which was in Bosnia and Herzegovina, would be listed as having come from
24    the battlefield, even if they arrived as patients with diseases that were
25    not injuries suffered by soldiers.  Examples were provided during the

 1    proceedings to show that all those who arrived from the territory affected
 2    by war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were entered into the books as persons
 3    coming from the war front.
 4            The Prosecution doubted the medical history, Exhibit P138, because
 5    it states that Mitar Vasiljevic was injured by falling on to a flat
 6    surface on the battle front.  It has already been explained why the term
 7    "battlefield" was used.  It is true that he was injured by falling on to
 8    a flat surface, because he fell in the middle of a street or a square, but
 9    what is not true is that he sustained the injury while falling either off
10    or with a horse.  We don't know why this was not entered.  The witnesses
11    who were examined here could only speculate about this, and they stated
12    that this was either an omission or perhaps the manner in which the injury
13    was sustained was not entered precisely because these were all people
14    coming from a battlefield.
15            We wished to bring Dr. Dr. Jovicevic here, who was the doctor who
16    officially admitted Mitar Vasiljevic to hospital that evening because
17    Dr. Moljevic was only a member of the screening team that evening, but
18    Dr. Jovicevic was the doctor who was on duty, and in the concluding
19    arguments of the Prosecution, it was pointed out that this witness was not
20    brought to testify here.  I have to say that I deeply regret that we were
21    unable to bring this witness here, although it is doubtful whether he
22    would remember why he hadn't noted down this fact after so much time has
23    passed, but I wish to say that the reason he did not come was not only
24    because he is suffering from back pain and because he has undergone an
25    operation on his spine, but also he refused to come, saying that he did

 1    not recognise this Tribunal and that he was awaiting a law on cooperation
 2    between Yugoslavia and this Tribunal which would make it incumbent upon
 3    him to come.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, I remonstrated with Mr. Groome about
 5    giving us material that is not in evidence.  Please do not tell us what is
 6    not in evidence.  If it's not in evidence, we do not consider it.
 7            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, I know.  Okay.
 8            [Interpretation] In my view, however, a sufficient number of
 9    witnesses have confirmed what is really important here.  Some of them
10    remembered Mitar Vasiljevic's case very well, especially because of the
11    unusual injury he sustained, that is a fall off a horse, and apart from
12    Mr. Moljevic, who was a patient in the orthopaedic ward, Dr. Jovanovic
13    also remembered this, as did the nurse, Slavica Pavlovic, who brought with
14    her a ledger kept by the nurses in their own hand, which has been produced
15    as Exhibit D31.  This exhibit also shows that on the evening of the 14th
16    of June, the patient Mitar Vasiljevic was admitted to the orthopaedic
17    ward.
18            In my view, what is especially important with respect to this
19    documentation is Exhibit P136, which is the ledger in which all the
20    patients in all the wards of this hospital were entered in 1992,
21    containing the first and last name, the number of the medical history, the
22    date of admission, and the ward to which the patients were referred.  An
23    inspection of this ledger, which is authentic beyond any doubt, and the
24    authenticity of which has not been brought into question, it can be seen
25    that the number 10.014, which is the code for the medical history, was

 1    actually the code given to the patients admitted on that day because the
 2    numbers follow in sequence, according to the time when the patients are
 3    admitted in chronological order.
 4            Several examples of this nature have been provided.  They are
 5    listed in the Defence submission, and all the -- this information can be
 6    compared to the information in the other books, P137 and in the case of
 7    patients referred from the Visegrad Health Centre, and I'm referring to
 8    absolutely all of them who were referred to Uzice, data was entered both
 9    in ledger P137 and in ledger 136.  It would not have been possible for
10    anyone, including Mitar Vasiljevic, to forge this sort of documentation in
11    any way, or to tamper with it.
12            Let me just remind you that the ledger from Visegrad, and that is
13    Exhibit D26, has also not been challenged, although its authenticity was
14    checked, apart from a single entry which was referred to in Mr. Groome's
15    closing statement, and that is that on the 14th of June, the first patient
16    entered was a patient bearing the name of Sredoje, while the last name was
17    altered so that it now reads Gogic and not Bajic, while it may actually
18    have been Lukic, as it appears.
19            In his closing argument, the Prosecutor addressed the position of
20    the Defence that from the age column of the ledger, one can clearly see
21    that this could not have been Sredoje Lukic, and that an obvious mistake
22    must have been corrected.  However, Mr. Groome thought that such an
23    addendum was entered later on, in hand.  But from the evidence submitted
24    to support this, we were able to see the photocopy of the relevant page
25    and also that in the column which contains numbers, number of patients,

 1    which is something that is always entered in any case, that the first six
 2    digits represent the day, the month and the year of birth, and that the
 3    person in question was born on the 5th of February, 1927.  Therefore, it
 4    is evident that it must have been some other person and not Sredoje Lukic,
 5    although it would not be so surprising for such a patient to be examined
 6    as the first patient on that day, because we have another example, which
 7    has also been relied upon by the Prosecutor, and that is that on the 7th
 8    of June, 1992, Milan Lukic, with his year of birth accurately registered,
 9    was registered as one of the patients in the book of patients.  It was
10    alleged that this had been done as some kind of alibi in view of the event
11    which took place on the 7th of June, 1992.  However, it is quite clear
12    from that entry that Milan Lukic was not referred anywhere else.  He was
13    only examined and if we look closely at the testimonies of VG14 and VG32,
14    the testimony I'll go back to later on when discussing these particular
15    events, it is clear that both witnesses had noticed, as early as at
16    Bikovac, that Milan Lukic had some kind of bandage or Band-Aid on his hand
17    and that he had obviously seen a doctor for that, which, quite contrary to
18    the position of the Prosecutor, is even more supportive of the Defence
19    case that the document in question is authentic, and that it was
20    impossible for -- for example, Mitar Vasiljevic, to have been injured on
21    the 27th or 28th of June, as it is attempted to interpret from
22    testimonies of some witnesses, in particular VG81, because such an entry
23    does not exist, nor was any such alteration possible; whereas, witness
24    Loncarevic, Dr. Goran Loncarevic, who admitted Mitar Vasiljevic to
25    hospital, was himself injured on the 24th of June and transferred to the

 1    Uzice hospital.  So although he personally does not remember the date when
 2    he examined Mitar Vasiljevic, and states the date as being such only on
 3    the basis of this information, this could not have been on the 27th or the
 4    28th of June, as VG81 was trying to establish.  For quite specific
 5    reasons, because here was a witness who stated that it was during that
 6    period of time, from the 14th to the 25th of June, he had seen Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic in various situations, together or without Milan Lukic, which
 8    is quite impossible.
 9            So when taking into account other medical documentation which is
10    on record in this case, namely the book of surgeries at the orthopaedic
11    department, D32, some other medical documents, as well as the medical
12    documentation from the psychiatric ward where Mitar Vasiljevic was
13    subsequently transferred, and the assessment of all these testimonies,
14    testimonies of the medical staff, physicians and nurses alike, who
15    certainly would not, for Mitar Vasiljevic, whom some of them could
16    remember, some could not, as a patient of the hospital, falsely testify
17    about this fact or participate in the forgery of such documents, and we
18    believe that it is fortunate that such medical documentation was properly
19    kept during these times, and properly preserved.
20            I have to say at this point that much to his regret, Mitar
21    Vasiljevic has not kept any of his medical documents or x-rays that he had
22    from these examinations, checkups and the treatment in general, which
23    would have significantly facilitated the proceedings before this Court.
24    The proceedings which have been further complicated with the expert
25    analysis of the x-rays which doctor Moljevic brought on the 1st of

 1    November, 2000, with other medical documentation and which was later on
 2    analysed by experts.  Due to time constraints and the fact that this has
 3    already been mentioned in the brief, I'm not going to address the issue of
 4    the expert analysis of these documents, and whether or not it is possible
 5    that this is an x-ray of Mitar Vasiljevic or an x-ray which can be
 6    compatible to Mitar Vasiljevic.  But I shall restrict myself to saying
 7    that even if the x-ray in question was not Mitar Vasiljevic's x-ray, that
 8    is of his leg, and even if it was erroneously marked as such at the
 9    hospital, and inappropriately handed over together with the rest of the
10    medical documentation, this doesn't mean that any of these written
11    documents that I have discussed can in any way be challenged and brought
12    into question.
13            Dr. Moljevic himself, during his examination-in-chief, when asked
14    whether such cases of erroneous markings and confusion of x-rays had
15    already happened, stated that unfortunately such cases are always
16    possible, even today, and that he himself had a similar case.  We believe
17    that there is a possibility that, especially in view of the times, that
18    x-rays could have been confused or mistaken.  Mitar Vasiljevic did not
19    give this as an x-ray of his leg, nor could he know, nor can I know,
20    whether the x-ray in question is indeed the real one, that is his x-ray.
21            Let me remind you that from the beginning of the proceedings,
22    Mitar Vasiljevic has not disputed medical examinations and medical expert
23    analysis, and he was quite agreeable with this documentation being
24    appropriately checked and verified.  Therefore, both in case, if this is
25    accepted as an x-ray which did not belong of his leg, nothing from the

 1    statements of witnesses, in particular the statements of the ten witnesses
 2    that I mentioned in this respect, nothing can prove that Mitar Vasiljevic
 3    was not in this hospital undergoing treatment from the 21 hours 35 minutes
 4    on the 14th of July, 1992, until the 28th of July, 1992.  I'm not going to
 5    mention testimony given by other witnesses who paid him a visit.  I should
 6    just like to remind you of the statement given by -- or rather the
 7    testimony given by Mr. Roy from which testimony we can conclude that a
 8    Muslim national was in the same hospital at the same time and he had given
 9    a statement about that fact in 1997, prior to the issuance of indictment
10    against Mitar Vasiljevic before this Tribunal.
11            I believe, Your Honours, that the evidence clearly indicates that
12    Mitar Vasiljevic, in view of the information that you have and which is
13    identical with the exhibits, was indeed injured, that he was admitted to
14    the health centre in Visegrad on the 14th of June, 1992, from where he was
15    transported to the Uzice hospital, where he stayed a certain amount of
16    time.
17            Allow me, Your Honours, one more sentence concerning this issue.
18    The Prosecutor expressed in his final submissions his doubt that Mitar
19    Vasiljevic -- his remark that Mitar Vasiljevic was entered as the
20    third-before-last patient on this list of patients and that this casts a
21    certain doubt as to the time of admission of the patient, which
22    unfortunately was not entered as a piece of information, except in six or
23    eight cases which were recorded by a nurse in Cyrillic alphabet and who
24    was the only nurse who actually entered the exact time of admission.  This
25    was simply not done.  This number of six to eight entries is quite

 1    insignificant in view of the overall number of other cases.  Let me also
 2    remind you that only three patients before Mitar Vasiljevic, Dragan
 3    Filipovic, was examined.  Dragan Filipovic had been wounded and was
 4    transferred to the Uzice hospital before Mitar Vasiljevic, and according
 5    to P137, he was admitted to Uzice hospital at 15.45, which means that he
 6    must have left Visegrad sometime before 2.00 in the afternoon, and that
 7    later on that day, as the third patient after him, Mitar Vasiljevic was
 8    examined and admitted, which is quite probable.  Furthermore, if one bears
 9    in mind the fact that it was a Sunday and a holiday, and that only urgent
10    cases reported for examination.
11            [In English] Your Honour, I don't know to --
12            JUDGE HUNT:  I think if you go on until half past, it will divide
13    the remaining time into half.
14            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] This documentation, which can be
15    verified in many ways, and which was introduced either through
16    cross-examination or examination-in-chief of witnesses, as well as the
17    examples which we ourselves discovered, shows how credible these documents
18    are, and to what extent the documents from Visegrad are compatible with
19    the medical documentation in Uzice with respect to patients who arrived
20    there from Visegrad.
21            It is true that omissions were made, which also happened in other
22    cases of a similar nature, as explained by witnesses.  For example, not
23    all the columns were filled in in the medical history, so that, for
24    example, Mitar Vasiljevic's medical history, P138, contains spaces for the
25    day and time of injury, which were not filled in, but as witnesses

 1    explained in most cases this was not done.  This goes to show that there
 2    was no intention to falsify anything or forge anything because this could
 3    have been entered at a later date, and then it could have been established
 4    with more or less difficulty.
 5            Let me remind you that the medical history was subject to analysis
 6    by an expert witness from the Forensic Institute of Holland at the request
 7    of the Prosecution, and that the Defence insisted that this be admitted
 8    into evidence, because it shows that the medical history was filled in
 9    using three different typewriters, which according to the expert findings,
10    were in use in 1992, but the same typewriters were used when filling in
11    data coming from different wards.  It is evident, for example, that the
12    same typewriter, which was used to fill in the name of the doctor from the
13    psychiatric ward who took over the treatment of the patient, the
14    psychiatric diagnosis and the date of release from hospital, all this
15    information was filled in using the same typewriter which was obviously
16    the typewriter which existed in that ward.  This is only one piece of
17    evidence which goes to show that the documentation is authentic, but as I
18    understood from the Prosecution closing brief, the Prosecution did not
19    challenge the authenticity of any of the exhibits I have referred to.
20            For all these reasons, I submit that the medical documentation and
21    witnesses who are either eye witnesses or indirect witnesses to
22    Vasiljevic's injury, treatment, people who visited him in hospital, all
23    this shows that from the 14th of June, 1992, in the afternoon, from the
24    time he was taken to the health centre in Visegrad, it was quite
25    impossible for him to be seen taking part in any incident, either on his

 1    own or with others on the territory of Visegrad.
 2            If I focus on issues raised by the Prosecution, showing that Mitar
 3    Vasiljevic took part, allegedly took part in various incidents prior to
 4    this event which would support the veracity of the charges against him,
 5    according to what the Prosecutor said, this would refer to the testimony
 6    of Witness VG80, who allegedly on two occasions during June of that year
 7    saw from the window of her house in Visegrad Mitar Vasiljevic on one
 8    occasion accompanied by several other men, and bearing arms.  However,
 9    with respect to this event, this witness did not give even an approximate
10    indication of the date when she allegedly saw Mitar for a few seconds in
11    front of a nearby garage.  If this is true, it could have been during the
12    period when he was a reservist Prelovo and would visit Visegrad in uniform
13    and with weapons.  It is not evident that he knew any of the persons he
14    was seen with or that they were members of any paramilitary or other unit.
15            As for the second event when she allegedly saw Mitar Vasiljevic
16    leaving her house, she may have been mistaken because this would have been
17    several days before she left Visegrad so it could have been the last day
18    of June, because she left Visegrad in early July, and she could not have
19    seen Mitar Vasiljevic at that time.
20            Another characteristic of this witness's testimony is that when
21    she made her earlier statement to the police, she mentioned more than 20
22    names of Serbs who, according to her, had perpetrated acts in Visegrad but
23    on that occasion she never mentioned the name of Mitar Vasiljevic.  What
24    is much more important, however, is the testimony of VG81, on which the
25    Prosecution mostly relies, attempting by means of this witness to prove

 1    that Mitar Vasiljevic engaged in illegal activities in the period leading
 2    up to the 14th of June, 1992, and thereafter.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  We will resume again at ten to 6.00.
 4                          --- Recess taken at 5.30 p.m.
 5                          --- On resuming at 5.52 p.m.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet?
 7            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
 8            [Interpretation] Before I evaluate the statements and testimonies
 9    of several Prosecution witnesses, which the Prosecution also made special
10    reference to, I would just like to correct my statement about witness
11    VG80, because it might have been understood that I said she saw Mitar
12    Vasiljevic from her house, or which would refer to a family house.  This
13    was in fact a block of flats.
14            With respect to Witness VG115, on which the Prosecution relies to
15    support three different events, which allegedly took place before the 14th
16    of June, 1992, I would like to say the following.  With respect to events
17    after the 14th of June, this witness claims that up to the 25th of June,
18    she saw Mitar Vasiljevic in different ways which, in the view of the
19    Defence, discredits this witness, who is on especially bad terms with the
20    Vasiljevic family.  The first of the events mentioned in the closing
21    arguments of the Prosecution is the alleged confiscation of the identity
22    card of this witness by Mitar Vasiljevic, and this is connected by the
23    Prosecution with similar actions committed by Milan Lukic.
24            Let me remind you that the wife of the accused was examined as a
25    witness with respect to this circumstance, and she, like the accused,

 1    denied ever having had an encounter of this nature with the witness, with
 2    VG81, in the vicinity of her house, and let me correct myself.  I said 115
 3    when I was referring to this witness.  I am in fact speaking of Witness
 4    VG81.  She claims that at the time of the withdrawal of the Uzice Corps,
 5    and she says this was on the 19th of May, in the vicinity of the house of
 6    Mitar Vasiljevic, she was stopped at the checkpoint that had been set up
 7    there, that it was manned by three armed soldiers, and that Mitar
 8    Vasiljevic was carrying weapons and was wearing a black waiter's uniform
 9    and that his wife was also present.  It is hard to say why this witness
10    should testify in this manner, but it is evident that at that time this
11    was a checkpoint of the Uzice Corps, manned by the soldiers she mentions,
12    and that no one had the right to take part, especially not in the manner
13    described, wearing a waiter's uniform, standing at this military
14    checkpoint manned by the army.  The time when this took place, and the
15    time of the presence of the Uzice Corps, do not support this incident and
16    so it cannot be given any weight in these proceedings.
17            The second example referred to in the Prosecution closing argument
18    is of a very serious nature, the claim that on the 19th of June, 1992, he
19    was in a car, together with Milan Lukic, and that on that day, he took
20    part in catching Rasim Torohan and pushing him into the car, thus
21    participating in spiriting away a person who was never seen thereafter.
22    This was also mentioned as happening on the 9th of June, both in the
23    closing arguments and in the brief, but it is obvious that this is an
24    error made by the Prosecution, because the witness spoke of the 14th of
25    June as the date when this happened, not only in the statement she made

 1    previously when she said that this event took place four or five days
 2    before she left Kosovo Polje, that is before the murder of Stanko
 3    Pecikoza, and she used this as a reference point for calculating the date,
 4    but also in her testimony during her examination-in-chief.  If one looks
 5    at the transcript carefully, the date which appears as the 9th of June is
 6    not linked to Rasim Torohan because she first explained that on the 14th
 7    of June, she saw the group from Koritnik and then, when asked by Mr.
 8    Groome on page 1224, "Later on this day, did you have occasion to see Mr.
 9    Mitar Vasiljevic?" [Interpretation] She replied "yes," and she went on to
10    describe an event involving a red pass at, that is on the day that she saw
11    the Koritnik group, that is on the 14th of June.  However at one point in
12    time, she said that he -- she saw Igbala Kurspahic at that moment and then
13    she said, "No, I apologise.  This took place on the 9th of June.  I have
14    to concentrate a little."  It is therefore obvious that she described the
15    event involving Torohan, as she did with everything else, as happening on
16    the 14th of June and that something else happened on the 9th of June.
17            In Exhibit D34 which is the stipulation between the Prosecution
18    and the Defence concerning this particular witness, this statement is also
19    included as not in dispute, that is when she stated that she had eye
20    witnessed the event on the 14th of June.  If we bear in mind the fact that
21    she said this had taken place at sunset, around 6.00, and if we know that
22    according to the information that we received, the sunset was after 8.00
23    on that day, it is obvious that on that day, if such an event involving
24    Lukic and Milan Torohan indeed happened, is not an event in which Mitar
25    Vasiljevic took part.  Nor was he present there.  All the more so because

 1    the way the witness calculated the date when she claimed persistently
 2    before the Chamber that it was on the 19th of June, that Stanko Pecikoza
 3    was killed and that in view of that, on the day when she learned, she and
 4    others, when they learned about his death, they fled and crossed the
 5    Drina.
 6            So all the events happening before this date, including the
 7    killing of Nurka Kos which he claimed had taken place two days before, and
 8    she also implicates Mitar Vasiljevic in this event, she also calculated
 9    this date with respect to the date of Stanko Pecikoza's death.  From
10    official written documents, we see that Pecikoza was killed on the 20th of
11    June.  And looking back on these days, this event could have also happened
12    not on the 14th of June but on the 15th of June, including all other
13    events which took place a day later.  It is obvious that she made up the
14    participation of Mitar Vasiljevic in this event and in subsequent events
15    too.
16            We can also assume that there was a confusion in respect of other
17    event that she also fabricated when she said that on the 10th of June,
18    that is the day before Kordan Bajram, Mitar Vasiljevic, as a front-seat
19    passenger in a green Zastava or some other similar type of vehicle, passed
20    through the area and said some abusive words about Bajram meat, thus
21    offending Muslims.  We have to note that she did not mention the incident
22    in the statement given to the OTP, although she said that she saw Mitar
23    Vasiljevic during the period of one month approximately.  However, she
24    never mentioned an incident of this kind.  It is our position, Your
25    Honour, then, in respect of a testimony of this kind, a testimony which

 1    can obviously be assessed as inaccurate in many of its respects, one
 2    should not trust the first part either, in respect of which we do not have
 3    any reliable evidence, all we have are discrepancies and contradictions in
 4    her statement.
 5            Let me remind you that this witness is the person who had
 6    organised illegal recording of the gathering in Kosovo Polje in February
 7    last year.  The gathering I do not wish to address because it has been
 8    sufficiently discussed in my brief, and in the arguments made by the
 9    Prosecution, so bearing all this in mind, and in case VG30 was really
10    referring to his voice, I cannot of course exclude the intention, because
11    we are dealing here with a witness who was brought here and confronted
12    with the fact that she had sold out information and video tapes, so we
13    cannot rule out the possibility that the witness in question could have
14    intentionally provided this information, which would have led this lady
15    witness to produce this evidence and to make all these pieces fall.  The
16    witness stated that it was the first time after she had seen the witness
17    on TV that she learned about him, that it was not on the 27th or 28th of
18    June, which was obviously inaccurate because the videotape before the
19    beginning of the trial was submitted for analysis to an institute here in
20    the Netherlands, sometime at the beginning of August, so this must have
21    been planned much earlier than what she said.
22            I addressed her testimony at some length in my written brief.  Let
23    me just say a few words about several other witnesses which we believe to
24    be very important in terms of credibility of their evidence.
25            One of them is Witness 105, who was referred to by Mr. Groome on

 1    several occasions in a rather touching manner.  Allegedly it is from her
 2    testimony that we can conclude that Mitar Vasiljevic patted a little girl
 3    trying to convince her that her father was alive in Sarajevo, although we
 4    know that his body was found in the Drina.  This was mentioned before the
 5    Court several times and I have to say, on the outset, that it is not true
 6    that this witness stated that it was on the 13th of June that she had been
 7    transferred to the fire department.  During the examination-in-chief, in
 8    response to a question whether it was on the third day of Bajram that she
 9    arrived in the fire department, she replied that she knew it was a
10    Wednesday but that she, being illiterate didn't know exactly when Bajram
11    was, but however that she was sure it was on Wednesday.
12            However in cross-examination, in response to a question that I
13    asked, when confronted her with her prior statement, when she said it was
14    on the 17th of June, she replied that, yes, indeed, she had arrived in the
15    fire department on the 17th of June.  However, what is even more important
16    than this date is her claim that this person, whom she described as having
17    patted the little girl and whom she identified as being Mitar Vasiljevic,
18    that is her claim that this person had a mustache, and she repeated that
19    twice in response to one of my questions.  She didn't say anything
20    specific in respect of Mitar Vasiljevic.  She only said that she had heard
21    this from other persons, and although she mentioned him several times, she
22    failed to recognise him in the photo array.  She identified a person whom
23    I think she said she thought was from Kragujeac, so in spite of the fact
24    that she said she had seen him on TV and in papers, she failed to
25    recognise him, which makes this evidence unacceptable and one can only

 1    conclude that the individual so described was by no means Mitar
 2    Vasiljevic, not only because of the date, which is subsequent to the 14th
 3    of June, but for other reasons that I have just described.
 4            All this demonstrates a rather strange intention of the witnesses
 5    to implicate Mitar Vasiljevic in something that he could not have been
 6    implicated in.  I have to repeat that up until the confirmation of the
 7    indictment, there had been only a few witnesses who had allegedly spoken
 8    about his misdeeds.  However, after his arrest and after the beginning of
 9    these proceedings, the majority of the witnesses were interviewed and gave
10    statements regarding his alleged participation.  In relation to that, we
11    have to analyse the identification conducted by the Prosecution, the
12    identification which took place after Mitar Vasiljevic's arrest.  They
13    used a photograph of Mitar Vasiljevic taken in the detention unit in
14    Scheveningen, together with a group of other photographs, although the
15    witnesses could have seen him a number of times on TV and elsewhere,
16    including the specific photograph taken in the detention unit.  This is by
17    no means reliable evidence and it should not be taken into account.  The
18    same goes for the dock identification.
19            When it comes to the two witnesses who provided relevant evidence
20    about Pionirska Street and who were not from the Koritnik group, I should
21    only briefly address their testimony.  I don't deem their testimony to be
22    credible and reliable at all.  Two of such testimony being only partially
23    credible and one of them being totally incredible.  The testimony of VG77
24    is probably accurate in so far as it -- she states that she passed through
25    Pionirska Street on that day, that she saw a group of people at the Memic

 1    house, and that she spent five or ten minutes talking to them.  She went
 2    on, down the street, together with her husband and father-in-law, and she
 3    stated that it was on the junction of Pionirska Street and this other
 4    street that she saw Mitar Vasiljevic standing together with a group of
 5    soldiers.  Why this portion of her evidence is absolutely inaccurate?
 6    First of all, she stated that she knew Mitar Vasiljevic only from sight,
 7    that she had only seen him a couple of times as a waiter.  So obviously
 8    she didn't know him very well.  She failed to recognise him in the photo
 9    album, despite this procedure which would have led her to recognise him
10    relatively easily.  She stated that the person whom she identified as
11    Mitar Vasiljevic was standing with a soldier who had a yellow hat, a fact
12    which was not mentioned by any other witness.  If we bear in mind the fact
13    that VG87 had a very good view of what was going on, because that was the
14    only thing he was doing at the time, being at the attic -- on the attic of
15    his house, he stated that at the time of the arrival of this group of
16    people, Mitar Vasiljevic was in the vicinity of his house, so it is quite
17    obvious that he could not have been further down the street at the spot
18    that she described.  And that she was mistaken when she identified the
19    person standing with the soldier as being Mitar Vasiljevic.
20            However, her testimony is very significant in the part where she
21    says that on that day, she did not see Witness VG115 at all, and when she
22    explains where this witness in fact resided in Pionirska Street.  She was
23    quite certain that she hadn't seen her on that day.  This is important
24    because Witness 115, who claims not only to have been an eyewitness to the
25    events in Pionirska Street and who, as is explained in the brief, tells a

 1    story which is totally incredible because she says it was sometime in the
 2    evening at about 19 hours or after 19, that it was just before dark, that
 3    it was warm, and we know that it was raining, and that she saw a group of
 4    people whom she joined briefly, and that all the Lukics and Zoran
 5    Vasiljevic and others in addition to Mitar Vasiljevic, were there
 6    accompanying them.  This statement of hers in relation to Pionirska Street
 7    is evidently a total fabrication and does not even remotely correspond
 8    with the actual events, but it is interesting that she mentions meeting
 9    Witness 87.  She says that she had a brief encounter, that they exchanged
10    glances and that she was on her own.  This can only mean that she heard
11    something like this and that she worked it into her story, not knowing
12    that this witness was accompanied by his or her parents-in-law, and not
13    knowing many other details which she got completely wrong.
14            If we bear in mind that this witness claims to have been an
15    eyewitness to the murder and the fire on Bikavac, which is theoretically
16    possible but hardly likely, this description of the events in Pionirska
17    Street cannot be trusted.  She says that in all these other situations,
18    she also saw Mitar Vasiljevic and others perpetrating these crimes.  This
19    refers primarily to the events she describes which are not contained in
20    the indictment, and about which evidence was not collected by the Defence,
21    where she says that on one evening, she -- and she describes her house
22    quite differently, because Witness 77 says she lives at the end of
23    Pionirska Street and not on the spot that this witness described, that
24    Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic and another soldier arrived on the spot
25    and that she watched them allegedly entering a house in the neighbourhood

 1    and searching it with flashlights starting on the third floor, going down
 2    to the second floor, and finally the first floor, where they found the
 3    Kurspahic couple and she says that she allegedly heard them shooting that
 4    couple and that on the following day, she saw their corpses through the
 5    open door of the house and that they remained there for five or six days.
 6    Bearing in mind that the people who had arrived from Koritnik and the
 7    witness who entered the house and came back and said that she had found
 8    these people who had been murdered, we have to note not only that they
 9    were not at the door but inside the house, the wife next to the cooker and
10    the husband on the settee, but also that they had not been shot, rather
11    their throats had been cut.  It is quite clear that this witness also
12    fabricated the participation of Mitar Vasiljevic in this event, and she
13    referred to it as an event that took place in late June, in the summer.
14            The other alleged events which according to her took place in July
15    are events I will not comment upon because it is evident that she invented
16    at least the participation of Mitar Vasiljevic even if the events actually
17    took place and the other persons she described did take part in them.
18            There is just one more witness I would like to mention, and that
19    is VG61, who was a hearsay witness and who heard his father saying who the
20    perpetrators of the events in Pionirska were, although he was affected by
21    this because he lost part of his family in this crime, and he probably
22    wishes to implicate not only Mitar Vasiljevic but some others as well, it
23    is evident that he could not have obtained this information from his
24    father because we saw in this Court a video recording in which this man
25    only about 20 days after this tragedy recounts his recollection of it and

 1    says how he managed to get to the front door when the fire started and how
 2    he managed to flee.  And he says that he was unable to recognise the
 3    participants and that they were young people.  He did not implicate
 4    anyone, including Mitar Vasiljevic, and it is not possible that he would
 5    have done so at a later date.
 6            Let me just add that this witness's statement, that some ten days
 7    later or immediately after the event took place, he learned about it from
 8    witness VG13, who came to where he was in the police station, that this is
 9    inaccurate if we bear in mind that this witness went there in late July or
10    early August of that year.
11            In any case, I submit that the testimony of this witness is not
12    only because of the alibi but for all these other reasons, not credible
13    and should not be relied upon.
14            There is one other witness who was suggested by the Prosecution
15    and that is Witness VG117, but I have dealt extensively with this witness
16    in my brief and explained in detail why this witness cannot be relied
17    upon, so I will not dwell on it now.  I simply ask that you take into
18    account the arguments I have put forward in my brief.
19            Before I go on to my conclusion, where I will analyse the events
20    on the Drina and the crime at which Vasiljevic was present, as well as my
21    final conclusion, I will just briefly address what the Prosecutor stated
22    about the Defence witnesses and the guarantees required.  Let me just say
23    that the Defence asked for guarantees for all the witnesses coming from
24    the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina regardless of whether they asked
25    for them or not.  Most of them did not.  Because we, as Defence counsel,

 1    wanted to avoid unpleasant situations so this does not have the
 2    significance that the Prosecution attaches to it, and I would like to try
 3    to rectify a few other matters.
 4            The Prosecution in their brief stated that the encounter with
 5    Koritnik was not the first encounter between him and Mitar Vasiljevic or
 6    rather that Vasiljevic had been convicted of singing a song previously.
 7    The village in question is called Klasnik and not Koritnik, and Article
 8    119 is mentioned.  This was an offence for which a sentence of over ten
 9    years in prison was prescribed and from the expert report of professor
10    Djurdjic, it can be seen that this crime was prosecuted and that the
11    prescribed sentence was up to three years in prison, while the other crime
12    to which the Prosecution refers was far more serious, that is the type of
13    crime for Alija Izetbegovic, for example, was prosecuted.  As I stated a
14    moment ago, I will not expound on the other parts of my brief, which refer
15    to the psychiatric expert report, because I have explained this at great
16    length in my final brief.
17            I will now discuss the event on the river Drina with which Mitar
18    Vasiljevic is charged, the Drina River incident.  In the Defence brief,
19    relating to this event, undisputed facts have been put forward, on page 19
20    of their brief.  I have not heard anything about these facts being
21    challenged so I will simply draw attention to those facts which I feel are
22    contentious and those which I feel are important.  I will not dwell on the
23    offence that happened at Bikavac and the behaviour of Milan Lukic, because
24    this does not concern the accused in any way.
25            I will speak at greater length about Mr. Groome's doubts that --

 1    or suspicion that Milan Lukic was entered as a patient at the health
 2    centre.  I have already mentioned this in my introduction and I said that
 3    two witnesses confirmed that they saw bandages on Milan Lukic and that
 4    they assumed he had seen a doctor so I will not go into this any further.
 5    This can be seen on pages 242 and 424 of the transcript.  When they
 6    arrived and entered the Vilina Vlas Hotel, both witnesses heard and saw a
 7    soldier wearing a camouflage uniform who was complaining to Lukic that
 8    that fool, referring to Susnjar, had released the prisoners.  Then Lukic
 9    discussed this with Susnjar who justified his action by saying he had not
10    had anything to give them to eat for two or three days, while Lukic was
11    unsuccessfully looking for the keys to lock up the people who had been
12    brought in, both witnesses noticed Mitar Vasiljevic leaning against the
13    counter at the reception, at the entrance to the swimming pool area, and
14    this is in disputable.  What is disputable is that Witness VG32, who had
15    seen Mitar well enough to see the insignia on his shirt pockets, to see
16    that he was not armed, and that his arms were crossed.  Had he had a
17    rifle, or had a rifle been next to him, this witness would certainly have
18    mentioned it, but it's evident that Mitar did not have a rifle and that
19    counter to the testimony of -- and that the testimony of Witness VG14,
20    which is different, is actually the true story, is incorrect, especially
21    if we bear in mind that Mitar was holding a gun.  In 1998, he said that he
22    had seen Mitar carrying a semi-automatic rifle, and this was accepted by
23    Ms. Korner as correct, because when the Defence put the question to him,
24    the witness was unable to remember this, but he stated that he knew about
25    weapons and that he was familiar with them.  Both witnesses, to be sure,

 1    testified that they saw Mitar Vasiljevic on the stairs holding an
 2    automatic rifle.  VG14 says that this was the rifle he had described
 3    previously and VG32 described it as a Kalashnikov.  The Defence submits
 4    that the witnesses testified falsely on this occasion with the intention
 5    of implicating Mitar Vasiljevic as a co-perpetrator of the tragedy that
 6    had taken place because they assumed that he could have done something or
 7    they considered, without any proof, that he was part of Milan Lukic's
 8    group at the time when they made their first statements about this event.
 9    Although there are many discrepancies between the statements of these two
10    witnesses, in important and less important details, let me mention only a
11    few.  According to one, when leaving Vilina Vlas, there were five persons
12    in the Yugo car.  According to the other witness, there were six, which is
13    really difficult to believe.  According to Witness VG32, they walked
14    abreast toward the River Drina in a row so that he was unable to cross
15    from one side to the other, and approach his relative, and Witness VG14,
16    who says that they moved in single file, and that Milan Lukic and Mitar
17    Vasiljevic were on their left, while he said in his statement to the
18    investigators that they were on their right.
19            It is much more important to note what they say about the moment
20    when they were lined up facing the river, and when Witness VG32 says that
21    Meho Dzafic first started to beg and then his brother-in-law, but that
22    this was interrupted by the shots, and that he did not hear Mitar
23    Vasiljevic utter a single word, either then or just before, while he was
24    in -- close to him.
25            Witness VG14, on the other hand, says that he heard only Meho's

 1    voice but that allegedly he heard Mitar reply to him and he obviously
 2    invented this because, had this really happened, VG32 would also have
 3    heard it.  And he says that after these words were spoken, the shooting
 4    began.  If we bear in mind that Meho was shot, that he was hit even before
 5    shots were heard, then certainly what Witness VG32 said is more credible,
 6    that Meho was hit and that no one, including Mitar, could have replied to
 7    his appeal.
 8            What is quite important to establish in this case is who actually
 9    shot at these people, because the two witnesses were not in a position to
10    see that, which is accepted by the Prosecution.  However, they make a
11    conclusion that Mitar Vasiljevic took part in the incident by the mere
12    fact that he was armed.  And also by the testimony of VG32, who said that
13    after the order was made to open fire, he heard -- he had heard three
14    clicks of the weapon switching from automatic to single fire.  And VG14
15    heard four shots, one of them was muffled, from the rifle with the
16    silencer.  Both witnesses, in particular VG32, made several statements
17    about this event, first to the BH MUP and then in 1998 to the
18    investigators of the OTP, and it was on the basis of these statements that
19    the initial indictment was confirmed.  However, neither of them at that
20    time mentioned the fact that they mentioned before the Court.  VG32
21    explained this by saying that when he initially gave the statement to
22    Mr. Hansen in 2001 unlike the statement that he made in 1998 when the
23    investigator did not allow him to expand, he wanted to provide more
24    details.  The investigator, however, told him that this was not
25    important.  This story is not credible because one knows very well that

 1    the investigators always ask for as many details as possible, and this is
 2    not an unimportant detail.  This is a significant detail.  Investigator
 3    Hansen asked him to try and think hard and try to remember what he heard
 4    at the Drina River.  When he said that he had heard a click, Mr. Hansen
 5    asked him, "Sir, please, think hard now and tell me how many clicks you
 6    heard."  The witness replied, "I rewound the tape.  I was sure that I
 7    heard three clicks."  Not only is this explanation by the witness
 8    illogical and unacceptable, that is that he was able in a few seconds to
 9    remember the details which had taken place nine years before, but also, it
10    is strange that the witness later stated that this remained imprinted in
11    his memory, although we know that he had not mentioned this in any of the
12    previous statements.  This was obviously a calculation on the part of the
13    witness.  His intention was to prove by this the direct participation of
14    Mitar Vasiljevic in the event because he was aware that his statement that
15    Mitar Vasiljevic was armed would not have been enough, so it was necessary
16    for him to make this addition.
17            It is the submission of the Defence that not only is it incredible
18    and illogical that the witness should remember this nine years later, but
19    also it is impossible to believe that the witness was able to hear that so
20    clearly and that moreover he was able to hear three distinct clicks, not
21    only because of the difficult situation he found himself in, but also
22    because these three clicks, if they existed, happened probably at the same
23    moment it was impossible to establish where they were coming from.
24    Furthermore, we have to bear in mind the kind of situation these witnesses
25    found themselves in.

 1            The same objection can be made in respect of witness VG14, whose
 2    testimony is different from the testimony of VG32.  He couldn't remember
 3    the number of clicks.  However, he too remembered nine years down the
 4    line, and this is something that he had not mentioned in any of his
 5    previous statements, that he had heard four shots, one of them being
 6    muffled, obviously implying the sniper rifle with the silencer belonging
 7    to Milan Lukic.  From such statements, which were made subsequently, one
 8    can conclude that neither the clicking nor the opening of fire took place
 9    at the same time, but in sequence.
10            As for the shooting itself, this is perhaps possible -- this is
11    possible because one soldier could fire several such individual shots, one
12    after the other.  So three or four individual shots that the witness could
13    have heard, perhaps, does not mean that those hits should have necessarily
14    come from three or four different rifles, and that that should be the case
15    here as well.  However, unlike these unreliable and partial witnesses, who
16    only tried to make Mitar Vasiljevic's situation even more difficult and
17    who is the only one who is held accountable, regrettably, for their
18    tragedy, there is a testimony which is crucial for this event and I'm
19    referring to the testimony given by VG79.  The Prosecutor dedicated only
20    one single sentence to this witness by saying only that he had observed
21    the event from the other side of the river, without making any comment on
22    this statement.  It was only in the oral submissions by Mr. Groome,
23    probably because of the Defence final brief in respect of this witness,
24    that we heard Mr. Groome saying that although he did believe this witness,
25    he also believed that he couldn't see the event very well because of the

 1    distance and also because of the fact that he had already given the
 2    binoculars to a friend who spent more time observing the event.  If we
 3    analyse carefully this testimony, we can come up with some very important
 4    facts.  Despite the fact that the witness was on the other side of the
 5    river, some 40 or 400 or 500 metres away, he was observing the event quite
 6    closely through his binoculars up to the moment when the shots were heard.
 7      This is -- this is a significant and crucial moment for the description
 8    of this event.  When we bear in mind the fact that witness VG79 recognised
 9    two individuals in the group of seven individuals who were lined up on the
10    bank of the Drina, Meho Dzafic and Amir Kurtalic, those were the only two
11    whom he actually knew, and that he was also able that one of the armed
12    individuals was fair and had fair hair, later he concluded that this could
13    have been Milan Lukic.  If we, furthermore, bear in mind the fact that he
14    was able to see that one of the weapons was a sniper rifle and that one of
15    them was an automatic rifle, it is quite clear that he was very well
16    positioned to follow and to see what was going on.  Furthermore, he knew
17    Mitar Vasiljevic very well, that is not in dispute, and he would have
18    surely recognised Mitar Vasiljevic if he had been one of the three
19    soldiers whom he had seen quite clearly and who were standing behind the
20    line of seven civilians.  He also saw them at the moment they opened fire.
21            He mentioned in his statement to the investigator that he had seen
22    seven civilians and three soldiers.  This was explained by him before the
23    Court that he was not sure about the fourth soldier, that is the fourth
24    uniformed individual, because he would only see him intermittently as they
25    were moving towards the river.  It seemed to him at moments that there

 1    were three of them and at moments that there were four of them.  However,
 2    at the bank the river, he didn't see the fourth soldier.  It is his
 3    assumption that he remained somewhere in the woods, standing on the left,
 4    as looking from the position that he was at.  This is a -- the probable
 5    explanation of Vasiljevic's testimony, who declared that he was in a state
 6    of shock, that he felt embarrassed and that he did not approach the
 7    scene.  So it is obvious that he remained in the woods and we can be
 8    certain that he was not one of the soldiers who were marked by VG79, I'm
 9    referring to Exhibit D1 which you had an opportunity to see.  Exhibit D1
10    was provided by the witness to the investigators at the time he gave the
11    statement.  Mr. Groome tried to explain this in greater detail by using
12    the diagram made by VG32.  According to this diagram none of the
13    soldiers -- out of the soldiers who were there, the second one looking
14    from the left, and who was in the woods, was therefore behind the trees.
15    He said that, according to -- that is to VG32, that Mitar Vasiljevic was
16    third from the left.  But it was Witness VG79 who stated that he was not
17    able to see the soldier who was at the far left end, on his side.  This
18    could only have been Mitar Vasiljevic, not only because of this
19    explanation but also because of the fact that the witness, this witness,
20    would have surely recognised Mitar Vasiljevic had he been amongst the
21    three soldiers who opened fire.
22            It was only after the shooting started that he handed over the
23    binoculars to his friend.  He had seen everything that was relevant and
24    crucial and it is quite important to realise that he was able to see well,
25    and that he claimed that Meho Dzafic whom he was able to recognise in the

 1    group of seven civilians, he also saw an unknown civilian who was standing
 2    close to Meho Dzafic.  When we bear in mind the testimony of the two
 3    survivors who noticed that Meho fell down before they heard the shots
 4    coming from automatic rifles, we can conclude that Milan Lukic killed one
 5    more individual from this group before Meho Dzafic was killed, before his
 6    soldiers opened fire and before he opened fire again.  Witness VG79 was
 7    quite categorical about this.  The testimony of this witness excludes the
 8    reasonable doubt that Mitar Vasiljevic, apart from physical presence, had
 9    any other type of participation in this event, which involved the killing
10    of number of people.
11            If one should try to establish whether it was possible for him to
12    prevent this crime in any way, we, the Defence, submit that it would have
13    been quite impossible, even if he had a weapon, and also, in view -- in
14    light of the behaviour of Milan Lukic's group, and also in light of the
15    statement given by witnesses VG14 and 32, who in response to a question
16    put to them by the Defence during the cross-examination, that is whether
17    they thought that anyone could have had any influence on Milan Lukic on
18    that occasion, to order him anything or to cause him to change his
19    decision, the witnesses responded with, "No" in case of witness VG32.  And
20    in response to an even more direct question, they replied that there could
21    not have been an individual of that kind in their vicinity.  The other
22    witness replied to the same question by saying,"No, not when it comes to
23    the people who were around him."
24            One also has to note that the Drina River does not bend on this --
25    in this area, the area of the village of Musici and that that witness had

 1    a very clear and unobstructed view of the event.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, I think it's fairly clear that you're
 3    not going to finish by 7.00.  I'm not criticising you for that but it's
 4    clear you won't.
 5            MR. DOMAZET:  My only conclusion is a few minutes.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, Mr. Groome, are you going to ask for some right
 7    to reply?
 8            MR. GROOME:  Nothing I've heard so far, I'm not going to ask for
 9    reply to anything I've heard so far, Your Honour.
10            JUDGE HUNT: The problem is that not only is it Friday night but I
11    have an official engagement that I have to go to.  I don't want to bring
12    you back just for a few moments but I don't want all the same for to you
13    hurry through something and we do have questions for you.  I think that we
14    better say now that we will have to resume one day next week.  Now, I
15    don't know when.  We have got plenty of opportunity because one of the
16    trials has closed down for three weeks due to the illness of one of the
17    judges so there will be plenty of time, we can fit.  My only concern is
18    that we will have to organise our own affairs in other cases to ensure
19    that we can finish off.  But I really have to go at 7.00.  So I think that
20    we'll -- what date would you be back here, Mr. Domazet?
21            MR. DOMAZET:  Your Honour, next week, I think --
22            JUDGE HUNT:  What day is best for you?  I suppose, Mr. Groome,
23    you're the same as we are, you've got other things to do but you can come
24    at any time.
25            MR. GROOME:  That's correct, Your Honour.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  What about you, Mr. Domazet?
 2            MR. DOMAZET:  Possibly the end of the week to have some days
 3    because we are return back tomorrow morning.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  What day are you thinking of, though?  When you
 5    say the end of the week.  Friday is not possible, but Thursday is.
 6            MR. DOMAZET:  Maybe Thursday.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  All right.  We will make it Thursday afternoon and we
 8    will let you know later on what the actual time will be but let us assume
 9    that we've got half an hour to an hour to go.
10            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  It will probably be late-ish in the afternoon so that
12    are all -- but not too late, so that we are not maintaining the evening
13    shift, which I must confess I have found very difficult to take when you
14    get to work at around 8.00 in the morning.  All right, then we will
15    adjourn now until Thursday, but we'll let you know more later as to the
16    details.
17                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 7.00 p.m., to
18                          be reconvened on Thursday, the 14th day of March,
19                          2002.
