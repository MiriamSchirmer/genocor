          2                 [Open session]
          3                 --- Upon commencing at 9.50 a.m.
          4                 [The accused entered court]
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning, ladies and
          6  gentlemen.  I'll be acting as the Presiding Judge
          7  today.  Mr. Cayley is in charge, I can see.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good
          9  morning.  Good morning, my learned friends for the
         10  Defence.
         11            The next witness, Judge Riad, is a protected
         12  witness.  So prior to the witness entering the
         13  courtroom, with your permission, if the blinds could be
         14  brought down.
         15            Your Honour, we may have a slight technical
         16  problem with the transcript.  There's no transcript
         17  appearing, and the court reporter is indicating to me
         18  that in just a couple of minutes it should be working
         19  again.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  We have to be patient.
         21  But the witness can come in in the meantime?
         22            MR. CAYLEY:  I think so, Your Honour.  That
         23  would probably save time.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Madam Registrar, would you order
         25  that the witness comes.

          1                 [The witness entered court]
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  Your Honour, I think the
          3  technical problems are now sorted out, so we can
          4  continue and there will be a record of what we were
          5  saying.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning.  The witness has
          7  got a name, a pseudonym?
          8            THE REGISTRAR:  "R," Your Honour.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning.  I won't call you
         10  by your name.  I will ask you to take an oath, as the
         11  bailiff will indicate to you.
         12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
         13  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
         14  and nothing but the truth.
         15                 WITNESS:  WITNESS R
         16                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Please sit down.
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  Your Honour, if the witness
         19  could just be shown his name just to confirm his
         20  identity, and I'll hand that to the Court's officer.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes, show him the paper.
         22            MR. CAYLEY:  Witness, is your name written on
         23  the paper that was shown to you?
         24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  And it will be?

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  Witness R.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Witness R.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes, Your Honour.  Your Honour,
          4  with your permission, if the blinds could be raised.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  I see.  So it is not a full --
          6            MR. CAYLEY:  No, it's not a closed session,
          7  Your Honour.  The witness will have his face
          8  distorted.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  So much the better, I hope,
         10  because I think some people are in the gallery, coming
         11  from some universities.  Yes, here they are.
         12            Please proceed, Mr. Cayley.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I'll
         14  just wait one moment until the blinds are fully up and
         15  then I'll start my examination.
         16                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:
         17       Q.   Witness R, I shall call you Witness R so that
         18  your identity is protected.  You're perfectly safe.
         19  Please relax as best you can.
         20            You're Bosnian by nationality.
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   And you're a Muslim by faith.
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   I think you were a member of the Bosnian army
         25  until June or July of 1993, at which time you left as a

          1  result of injury; is that correct?
          2       A.   That is correct.
          3       Q.   Now, without naming the village to protect
          4  your identity, in July of 1995 you were living in a
          5  village in the Srebrenica enclave; is that correct?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   I want you to cast your mind back to the 11th
          8  of July, to 5.00 or 6.00 in the afternoon on that day.
          9  You were in the village of Susnjari.  Can you tell the
         10  Judge what you recall happened at that time?
         11       A.   Simply, the enclave was captured by the
         12  Serbs, by the Serb army.  I heard that it fell, that
         13  the town had fallen, simply.
         14       Q.   What did you do?
         15       A.   We sent our families, women and children, to
         16  the UNPROFOR base in Potocari.  I felt that I was
         17  capable, as a younger man, that I shouldn't go, so I
         18  stayed behind so that more people would gather together
         19  and head to the woods.
         20       Q.   Now, when you speak of more people gathering
         21  together to go to the woods, who were these people?
         22       A.   They were people of Muslim ethnicity who were
         23  living in the enclave.
         24       Q.   Were they men or women or children, or a
         25  mixture of all three?

          1       A.   Mostly men, and women.  The children had left
          2  towards the UNPROFOR base in Potocari, and most of the
          3  women as well, of course.
          4       Q.   What was the age group of the men who
          5  gathered?
          6       A.   From 10 years old up to 60, even 70 years of
          7  age.
          8       Q.   Now, after you had gathered, what did this
          9  group do, this group of what you described as mostly
         10  men from 10 to 60 or 70 years of age?
         11       A.   A kind of column was formed.  Those are
         12  narrow paths so we knew we had to form lines.  And we
         13  headed towards the woods, in the direction of Tuzla.
         14       Q.   Whereabouts were you in this column?
         15       A.   Somewhere around the middle.
         16       Q.   On what date did you leave?
         17       A.   It was the 12th, at about 2.00 or 3.00 in the
         18  morning when I set off from that place.
         19       Q.   Now, I think you were armed.  Can you
         20  describe to the Judge the weapon that you had with you
         21  and how much ammunition you had.
         22       A.   There was a hunting rifle but not a proper
         23  rifle.  It's a souvenir of my father, a single barrel,
         24  handmade rifle that was very old, maybe 100 years old.
         25  I had five or six bullets.  Though the gun had never

          1  been used in battle and it wasn't a reliable one to
          2  shoot with.
          3       Q.   Now, I know you had an eventful journey
          4  through the woods, and the Defence indeed may have some
          5  questions for you about that, but I want to move ahead
          6  to the 13th of July and I want you to think about
          7  approximately the events that happened on the morning
          8  of the 13th of July, at 7.00 or 8.00 in the morning.
          9            First of all, I'd like to show you a map that
         10  you drew for me.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         12  Prosecutor's Exhibit 159.
         13            Your Honour, this is a map which is computer
         14  generated.  But the witness drew it for the Office of
         15  the Prosecutor on Sunday and he's, in fact, confirmed
         16  the route that he drew on this map matches the broken
         17  line that you see on the map.
         18       Q.   Witness, does this accurately reflect the
         19  route that you took from the Srebrenica enclave,
         20  ultimately arriving in Nezuk sometime after the 19th of
         21  July?
         22       A.   Yes, that is the path.
         23            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. Usher, if you could place
         24  that map onto the ELMO.  That's fine.
         25       Q.   Witness R, could you point out to the Judge

          1  where you were located on the morning of the 13th of
          2  July?
          3       A.   [Inaudible response]
          4       Q.   Could you say that again because I don't
          5  think the interpreters heard you.  Could you speak up?
          6       A.   It was between Kasaba and Konjevic Polje,
          7  somewhere here [indicates].
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          9  witness is identifying an area on the dotted line that
         10  lies directly between Konjevic Polje and Nova Kasaba,
         11  so on a vertical line running through Konjevic Polje
         12  and Nova Kasaba.
         13       Q.   At what time were you at that location?
         14       A.   Between 7.00 and 9.00, just then.
         15       Q.   You can take the pointer off that now.  It's
         16  clear.  Thank you.
         17            What were you doing?
         18       A.   A large group of people had congregated.  In
         19  my estimate, I think there were 2.000, maybe even 3.000
         20  people.  It was morning, it had already dawned, and
         21  there was an open space without any woods to protect
         22  us.  But the road had already been blocked,
         23  Kasaba-Konjevic Polje, by Serb units so that it was
         24  impossible to pass.  We were there for about an hour or
         25  two, at least I was, and then I decided to move away

          1  from that spot into the surrounding woods about 500
          2  metres away, and I stayed there the whole day.
          3       Q.   Now, the 2.000 people that you're speaking
          4  of, these were people that had left the Srebrenica
          5  enclave and had travelled in the column from the
          6  enclave, trying to escape to the free territory; is
          7  that right?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Can you tell the Judge, while you were hiding
         10  in this wooded area, when you said you moved away to
         11  the surrounding woods, what you saw from your vantage
         12  point.
         13       A.   At about 1.00, I saw the Serb army
         14  surrounding this large group of people.  Everyone
         15  separated from the group, 10, 20, or 30 metres, were
         16  killed by these troops; that is, they killed all those
         17  who were away from the group.  However, most of the
         18  others were captured and forced towards the asphalt
         19  road leading from Konjevic Polje to Nova Kasaba.
         20       Q.   When you're referring to the large group,
         21  this is the group of 2.000 people that you spoke of
         22  earlier.
         23       A.   Yes.  Yes, that's that group.
         24       Q.   Did you see anybody actually killed yourself
         25  on that day?

          1       A.   Yes, I did.  It was quite a number of people,
          2  only I wasn't right next to them to be able to
          3  recognise them or know their names.  I was at a
          4  distance of 500, maybe 300 metres, as the crow flies,
          5  and I saw them killing these people, all of those who
          6  were around the group; whereas the group itself that
          7  was in one group, they were forced forward.
          8       Q.   Can you recall how many people from the group
          9  you saw killed?
         10       A.   Quite a large number of people.  In my
         11  opinion, between 200 and 300.
         12       Q.   Who was doing the killing?
         13       A.   The Serb troops, the military.
         14       Q.   And you say that you were at a distance of
         15  between 300 and 500 metres from this shooting.
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Let's now move on to the 14th of July of
         18  1995, and if you can tell the Judge what you did on
         19  that day?
         20       A.   On that day, I took a roundabout route in the
         21  direction of Kasaba, and on the way I saw the tanks and
         22  APCs and Pragas and other weapons lined up.  However,
         23  during the night, that is, on the 14th, early in the
         24  morning, we managed to cross over, about five or six of
         25  us -- actually, six to be precise.

          1       Q.   Can you show Judge Riad on the map in front
          2  of you where it is you crossed the road.  I think your
          3  route is marked across the road.  The usher will put it
          4  onto the ELMO.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  If you could move it up a bit,
          6  please, Mr. Usher.
          7       A.   Here [indicates].  It was here [indicates].
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show, on
          9  Prosecutor's Exhibit 159, that the witness is
         10  indicating that he crossed the road between Konjevic
         11  Polje and Nova Kasaba at a point which is bisected by
         12  the dotted line.
         13       Q.   Now, let's move ahead in time to the 18th of
         14  July of 1995.
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  If that could be left on the
         16  ELMO, please, Mr. Usher, and if you could move it down
         17  just a little bit.  That's fine.
         18       Q.   Can you indicate to Judge Riad the route that
         19  you took and the point at which you arrived, on the
         20  map, on the 18th of July.
         21       A.   I took this route [indicates], and on the
         22  18th of July we got here [indicates], we arrived here
         23  [indicates].  The place is called Bajkovica, as far as
         24  I knew, though I'm not too familiar with the parts.
         25  But some of the men who had already got there before us

          1  said that the place was called Bajkovica.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          3  witness is indicating, on Prosecutor's Exhibit 159,
          4  that he followed the broken line then to an area which
          5  is marked approximately by the shaded circle labeled
          6  "Bajkovica," and he states in his evidence that he
          7  arrived at that point on the 18th of July.
          8       Q.   How many people reached Bajkovica on the 18th
          9  of July?  How many from the group that had left
         10  Srebrenica?
         11       A.   These groups were moving in various
         12  directions so one cannot say that they arrived
         13  together.  But at any event, when I got there, there
         14  were about 500 men already there.
         15       Q.   Did you stay with this group?
         16       A.   Yes, but very briefly, for an hour, because
         17  again we could hear shooting in the vicinity and we
         18  were called upon to surrender by the Serb army.
         19       Q.   So when you were called upon to surrender by
         20  the Serb army, what did you do?
         21       A.   Again, knowing from experience what had
         22  happened between Konjevic Polje and Kravica, and
         23  fearing that I would be killed, again I decided,
         24  together with another group -- there were ten of us in
         25  all -- we split from that group and went into the woods

          1  again to pass around that road and avoid being with a
          2  large group.
          3       Q.   Now, let's move ahead in time again to the
          4  19th of July of 1995, and if you can tell the Judge
          5  where you found yourself on that day, and in fact with
          6  how many other Bosnian Muslim men you were with on that
          7  day.
          8       A.   Yes.  It is this place here [indicates] that
          9  has been marked on the map as Bajkovica, that has been
         10  shaded in and encircled in black.  Together with ten
         11  other Muslims.
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         13  witness, on the 19th of July, again was in and around
         14  an area which is marked approximately on the map as the
         15  area of Bajkovica.
         16       Q.   Can you tell the Judge what happened to you
         17  and these other men on the 19th of July?
         18       A.   It was a tragic day.  We were in a place
         19  where the Serb army had its front trenches, I think the
         20  first trenches at the beginning of the war, and we
         21  could see the Serb front line at a distance of a
         22  kilometre away from us, on a hill, in a wood.  It was
         23  about 12.00, 12.30, when we were captured.  We were on
         24  a small path next to these trenches.  It was a freshly
         25  laid path and one could see that footsteps; I don't

          1  know whose they were.  We took shelter in some bushes
          2  next to this small path, two or three metres away.  We
          3  were tired, hungry.  We sat down to have a rest.
          4            We were sitting there for some 15 minutes
          5  when we heard the Serb troops calling out that we
          6  should surrender.  We couldn't see them because we were
          7  in the bushes, and if we were to get up they would be
          8  able to detect us.  We hoped that we would manage to go
          9  unnoticed.  However, not more than half an hour after
         10  their arrival, heavy shooting started above our heads.
         11  It went on for about ten minutes, and again they were
         12  shouting that we should surrender.  And one of my
         13  comrades raised his hands.  One by one we followed.  I
         14  was the last one to do that.
         15            We came out to this path, which was only two
         16  or three metres away from us.  I was the last in the
         17  group.  I had a green shirt on.  When I came out, there
         18  were two to three Serb soldiers on either side of the
         19  path that we took to reach them.  We were slightly
         20  hit.  However, I was hit the most because I had a green
         21  shirt, and I can show you the scars I still have here
         22  on my chin, and of course elsewhere too.  I was beaten
         23  up the worst.
         24            We reached this path.  They took us some 30
         25  or 50 metres away and they told us to lie down on our

          1  stomachs, with our heads down and our hands stretched
          2  out.  I then heard one Serb soldier saying, "Stari is
          3  coming," meaning the old man, "and he will tell us what
          4  to do."  He can't have been far away, this Stari, maybe
          5  50 or 100 metres away and he arrived very soon.  He sat
          6  next to a tree and he asked, "Where is the rest of this
          7  army?"  A soldier was carrying a radio transmitter, a
          8  Rup 12, which was next to this man they called Stari,
          9  and the soldier was sitting next to him, and they kept
         10  asking us where the other army was, the rest of the
         11  army.  And one of us was saying that there were some
         12  close by, where the 500 men had stayed behind, and then
         13  Stari telephoned immediately, giving instructions.  And
         14  I heard him saying to his soldiers, "The Vukovi," or
         15  the Wolves "will deal with that."
         16            Then he ordered us to give up all the
         17  documents or valuables and money that we had on us.  We
         18  could only turn around to take out everything we had.
         19  Though I didn't surrender all my documents, most of the
         20  others did.  And then the interrogations started one by
         21  one, asking us how many troops there were, what
         22  happened in Srebrenica, who the commanders were, and so
         23  on.
         24            The first thing that happened was that a
         25  young boy between 15 and 16, he was first asked how

          1  many men the brigade in Srebrenica had.  The boy didn't
          2  know; he had not belonged to the army anyway because he
          3  was so young, as far as I know.  And he said that there
          4  were between 30 to 50 men in a brigade.  He ordered a
          5  soldier behind him, there was a Serb soldier standing
          6  behind each one of us with an automatic rifle pointed
          7  at our backs, and he ordered this soldier to take him
          8  away.  He took this young boy to the right of us as we
          9  were lying there, at a distance of some four to six
         10  metres from us, and we just heard a single shot.  I
         11  didn't hear a sound of a voice or anything.  And the
         12  soldier came back.
         13            The second was again a boy who was already
         14  disabled.  He was disabled from childhood, that is, he
         15  had two fingers missing on his left hand.  And he was
         16  asked how he had lost those fingers.  He told him the
         17  truth, that he had lost them as a child using an old
         18  hunting rifle, and that the rifle went off and took
         19  away his fingers, and that he wasn't a member of the
         20  army and I knew that he wasn't.  He ordered that he
         21  should be taken away too.  The soldier who was standing
         22  behind him with a gun pointed at him said, "I wouldn't
         23  like to do that now."  I think he refused the
         24  commander's orders.  The commander looked at him and
         25  said to another soldier that he should take him away,

          1  and that is what he did.  He took him to the right,
          2  three metres away from us.  Again we heard a single
          3  shot.
          4            I was the third.  Stari said to me, why was I
          5  talking so much.  He asked me where the army was and
          6  where it was moving.  As I didn't know, I told him I
          7  didn't know where they are and where they are going
          8  to.  I said there were men and they were on the move
          9  but I couldn't tell him exactly where they were.  He
         10  immediately ordered this soldier behind me to take me
         11  off.  As I was getting up, I felt awful so that I only
         12  just managed to get up.  I took my time.  And he asked
         13  me, "What's wrong?  Why aren't you getting up?"  I
         14  looked at him because he was the one who had beat me
         15  the most and he knew very well what was wrong.  But I
         16  managed to get up, nevertheless, and when I did I saw
         17  this other man who had been shot, who was lying on his
         18  side, and I could see that he was dead by the colour of
         19  his skin.
         20            As the ground was uneven, there was a slope
         21  there where they were sitting and we were lying on this
         22  small path, I headed towards this comrade who was
         23  already dead, so I went slightly down the slope.  I
         24  turned my head and looked at the soldier cocking his
         25  trigger, with his automatic rifle pointed at me.  The

          1  distance between him and me was one metre, and when he
          2  stretches out his arm it couldn't have been more than
          3  half a metre.  He fired the shot which hit me here
          4  [indicates].  I can show the doctor's certificate of
          5  where the shot hit me in my left shoulder.
          6            I was waiting to die, but I still felt quite
          7  well, and I thought that I would die a little later.
          8  However, I survived.  It was very hard to live through
          9  this.  A Serb soldier, after I fell to the ground, sat
         10  down some two or one and a half metres away from me, so
         11  I could see a part of his boots.  He was sitting there
         12  smoking and looking at me.  I couldn't breathe because
         13  he might notice and repeat the shot.  The worst part
         14  was that I was bleeding all over, and when I was
         15  beaten, there was blood coming out my mouth and nose
         16  and ears, so the ants were attracted by the blood and I
         17  had to keep my mouth open to be able to breathe, and
         18  these ants were coming into my mouth and I could hardly
         19  endure it.  However, I managed until late into the
         20  night.
         21            It was already dark when they left this
         22  spot.  While I was lying there, another man was taken
         23  out.  I could feel it and not see it because he passed
         24  by me, led by this soldier, to a spot three or four
         25  metres away from me.  And the same scene repeated

          1  itself: one shot and he fell.  I could hear him
          2  breathing his last sigh of life.  And lying there, I
          3  could hear more of these shots, more of these
          4  comments.  Stari pointing at us, having probably
          5  captured some other soldiers, he was saying, "See how
          6  your soldiers have fared lying there in the woods?"
          7  And that is the end of that story.
          8       Q.   Now, Witness, I just have a number of
          9  questions to clarify what you've said.  Now, you spoke
         10  in your testimony about a man called Stari.  How was he
         11  dressed?
         12       A.   Yes, that's what they called him, Stari.  He
         13  had a military uniform on, without any insignia or
         14  rank, and it was a camouflage army uniform.  He was
         15  somewhat older, he was bald, he had hairy arms, short
         16  in build.  That's what he looked like, what I was able
         17  to notice at least.
         18       Q.   Now, you said in your evidence that the
         19  soldiers looked to Stari for instructions.  Did Stari
         20  appear to be in charge on the ground at this spot?
         21       A.   Yes.  Yes, Stari was in charge there.  That
         22  was obvious.  You could notice that quite evidently.
         23       Q.   Now, you say that you saw another soldier
         24  with a radio transmitter; do you recall that?
         25       A.   Yes, I do.  There was a soldier with a radio

          1  transmitter, a Rup 12.  I knew this because I had done
          2  my military service in the former Yugoslav People's
          3  Army and I could recognise this type of radio
          4  transmitter.
          5       Q.   And you saw, I think, Stari on the radio
          6  passing instructions to another unit; is that correct?
          7       A.   Yes.  Yes, that's correct.
          8       Q.   And those instructions, I think you said in
          9  your evidence, concerned the other group of 500 Muslim
         10  men who were still in the woods; is that correct?
         11       A.   Well, yes, that's how it was.  One of them
         12  explained that the group was there and he gave strict
         13  orders that the group should be finished off.
         14       Q.   And again, just for absolute clarity, you're
         15  talking about the other group of 500 Muslim men in the
         16  woods.  That's the group that he said should be
         17  finished off.
         18       A.   No.  The group at Baljkovica, where I arrived
         19  on the 18th.  There wasn't another group in the woods.
         20  There were the ten of us there who had left on the
         21  18th, and on the 19th we gathered at that place where
         22  we were executed.
         23       Q.   So when he said, "Finish them off," who is he
         24  referring to?
         25       A.   Well, that group.  That group was there where

          1  we explained it was.  And as the group was there, you
          2  could notice some voices, some people were groaning who
          3  were not able to go further away.  Quite simply, they
          4  didn't know where to go.
          5       Q.   And how many were in that group?  How many
          6  men?
          7       A.   About 500 people.
          8       Q.   Now, when you were taken to be shot yourself,
          9  you only saw one other dead man; is that right?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   But you stated in your evidence how two men
         12  had been taken away to be shot before you.  Where was
         13  the other man?
         14       A.   Yes.  We were taken to the left, the other
         15  one was taken to the right.  So that -- the fern was
         16  fairly high so you couldn't see properly, that is to
         17  say, I didn't even have time to look, to look at that
         18  first one, the first one that was shot, that young
         19  boy.
         20       Q.   Now, while you were lying there after you had
         21  been shot, how many further shots did you hear; do you
         22  recall?
         23       A.   There were a number of shots.  One, two or
         24  three minutes after me, as far as I was able to assess,
         25  although it was a very difficult moment for me and I

          1  can't give you a time span.  But very shortly after me,
          2  one was taken off; I'm certain of that.  But several
          3  shots were heard.  Now, I don't know whether they took
          4  them off to the right-hand side, perhaps where that
          5  first young boy had been shot, or perhaps they had
          6  taken them off further from me, that they were not as
          7  close to me.  And I couldn't see anything at that
          8  moment because, as I said, my head was facing
          9  downwards, into the ground, and I couldn't see
         10  anything.  All I could do was hear things.
         11       Q.   Let's go back to uniforms again.  I realise
         12  these were very difficult moments for you.  Do you
         13  recall on any of these Serb soldiers, on any of these
         14  50 soldiers, seeing any badges on them?
         15       A.   Yes, there were some signs, insignia.  On the
         16  left-hand arm, as far as I was able to notice, although
         17  as I say, this was a very short space of time and it
         18  was all very difficult for me to see.  I had my head
         19  down on the ground, to the left.  But on the left-hand
         20  arm there was a yellow insignia.  Perhaps there was
         21  some other colour there but it was predominantly
         22  yellow, and there was a yellow sort of circle and it
         23  said "The Krajisnici," men from Krajisnici, something
         24  like that, on this circle in this patch.  It was
         25  difficult to make it out because he moved his arm

          1  around so I couldn't actually see.  But I'm certain of
          2  that.  And that was the patch that most of the soldiers
          3  had on them.  But I think, that is to say, I'm quite
          4  sure, actually that it said "Drinski" on some of the
          5  patches as well.  I just saw the "Drinski", the word
          6  "Drinski".  What the "Drinski" was after what the
          7  other word was, I couldn't see.  I couldn't see the
          8  whole of this circle on the patch, just the "Drinski"
          9  part.
         10            As far as the Krajisnik or Krajisnici are
         11  concerned, I'm 100 per cent certain of that.
         12       Q.   Now, you said later into the evening the
         13  Bosnian Serb soldiers left.
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   What did you do after they'd left?
         16       A.   Well, I'd been lying there for quite some
         17  time, and when I was sure that there were no more
         18  noises, and nobody around, and it was already dark, I
         19  raised my head a little to see if there was anybody
         20  about anywhere, just to make sure, but I didn't hear
         21  anybody.  So I raised my head and I found it very
         22  difficult to get up because I had become rigid from all
         23  that lying down.  But I did manage to raise myself a
         24  little and sit down, and I saw that there was nobody
         25  anywhere around.

          1            I called out two or three times, "Is there
          2  anybody alive" in a quiet voice but nobody responded to
          3  my call.  One of the people lying next to me, I was
          4  able -- I looked to see if he was alive, but he gave no
          5  signs of life, he was already dead.  I touched him to
          6  see.  But I didn't have the strength to examine the
          7  others, to see what had happened to them, as I was in
          8  the woods and it was dark.  But I did manage to see
          9  that he was dead, and I carried on towards free
         10  territory.
         11       Q.   Could you just indicate to Judge Riad on the
         12  map next to you the route that you took from
         13  Baljkovica?
         14       A.   It was this direction here [indicates], with
         15  the dotted line.  The dotted line shows the route
         16  towards Nezuk.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         18  witness is showing, on Exhibit 159, a route leading
         19  from an area shaded Baljkovica, across the
         20  confrontation line to the town or village of Nezuk.
         21            Now, if the witness could be shown
         22  Prosecutor's Exhibit 151, and this shouldn't go on the
         23  ELMO because it identifies the witness.  And if he
         24  could be shown 151A which is the Bosnian version.
         25       Q.   Witness, this is a letter of discharge from

          1  the war hospital and it essentially describes the
          2  injury to your left shoulder.  Can you just confirm,
          3  for our record, that these in fact are your medical
          4  records.
          5       A.   Yes, they are my medical records.
          6            MR. CAYLEY:  Judge Riad, the English
          7  translation is Exhibit 151.
          8       Q.   Now, Witness, I just have a few more
          9  questions for you.  I'm not going to show you this
         10  statement, but this is a statement -- although in fact
         11  the Defence may wish to, but this is a statement that
         12  you gave to the Bosnian authorities on the 26th of
         13  August of 1995, and you and I have already discussed
         14  this.  You state, and I'll read slowly for the purposes
         15  of the record, at the beginning of that statement:
         16            "I was together with the majority of the
         17  inhabitants on the defence lines in the area of
         18  Susnjari and Jaglici."
         19            And this is referring to early July.  Now,
         20  you will recall in your evidence you stated that you
         21  had left the Bosnian army in June or July of 1993.
         22  Were you on the defence lines in July of 1995, or is
         23  that statement incorrect?
         24       A.   I was not on the defence lines at that time,
         25  in 1995, in June, because, as I've already said, I left

          1  in June/July 1993, I left that army; that is to say, it
          2  wasn't actually an army in my opinion, even up until
          3  then, it was the Territorial Defence, in fact.  And
          4  with the proclamation of the demilitarised zones there
          5  was no army in Srebrenica because the weapons had been
          6  taken away from the overall Territorial Defence.
          7       Q.   Now, I just have a couple more questions for
          8  you.
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  Judge Riad, if we could go into
         10  closed session because I want to ask him about one of
         11  the survivors, and if he starts naming individuals who
         12  are executed and the survivors, he will identify
         13  himself.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  For how long, do you think, for
         15  the gallery?
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  A couple of minutes.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  A couple of minutes.  Thank
         18  you.  You can draw the curtains.
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  The curtains don't need to go
         20  down.  We can have a private session, just so that the
         21  public feed is cut for a couple of minutes.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  We don't need to draw the
         23  curtains.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  No, Your Honour.

         24                 [Open session]
         25            MR. CAYLEY:
          1       Q.   Now, you've said that the execution took
          2  place on the 19th of July, and I know this is not a
          3  time that you were inspecting your watch regularly, but
          4  do you recall approximately what time these executions
          5  took place?
          6       A.   I think it was about 12.30.  From 12.00 to
          7  1.00 in the afternoon, in that time.
          8       Q.   How many of your male relatives did you lose
          9  during Srebrenica?
         10       A.   Many.  I lost many members of my family.  My
         11  brother, my father, and a lot of other family members,
         12  practically all of them.
         13       Q.   Are you one of the few male members of your
         14  extended family still alive?
         15       A.   Yes, I'm the only one.
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  Judge Riad, I have no further
         17  questions of the witness, so I can offer him for
         18  cross-examination.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Cayley.
         20            Would you rather have a break now before the
         21  cross-examination starts?  Who will assume the
         22  cross-examination, Mr. Visnjic or Mr. Petrusic?
         23            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         24  Mr. President.  Witness R's cross-examination will be
         25  done by me.  I am counsel Petrusic.  And we agree with
          1  your proposal to have a break now.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  Then I'll ask the witness
          3  to have a rest and to come back.  You know the
          4  procedure here is that you will be asked questions by
          5  the Defence counsel, who will help finding out the
          6  truth which we are all searching for here.
          7            So we will adjourn for half an hour.  Thank
          8  you very much.
          9                 --- Recess taken at 10.50 a.m.
         10                 --- On resuming at 11.23 a.m.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Petrusic, would you proceed,
         12  please.
         13                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         14       Q.   [Interpretation] Witness R, good morning to
         15  you.
         16       A.   Good morning.
         17       Q.   I'm going to put some questions to you in
         18  keeping with the procedure, and I shall try not to have
         19  to take you back to everything that you lived through.
         20       A.   Yes.  Please go ahead.
         21       Q.   My first question, Witness R, is who told you
         22  that you had to leave the Susnjari area on the 11th of
         23  July?
         24       A.   From two men, two men I don't know, who
         25  passed through the region and explained to the people

          1  that the women and children should be sent towards the
          2  UNPROFOR base in Potocari, that is to say, and anybody
          3  else who wanted to, and the ones who didn't want to,
          4  that they should gather in one spot and take to the
          5  woods.
          6       Q.   Were they soldiers, members of the
          7  Bosnia-Herzegovina army?
          8       A.   For the most part they were not soldiers.
          9  And in fact at that time there was no army of
         10  Bosnia-Herzegovina.  What did exist was the Territorial
         11  Defence, until the demilitarisation of Srebrenica.  So
         12  with the gathering of these people, there were those
         13  who were, perhaps, in uniform but they came by the
         14  uniforms in their own way, they got them themselves.
         15       Q.   Witness R, these two individuals, my question
         16  is directed towards them, were they wearing uniforms,
         17  military uniforms?
         18       A.   No.
         19       Q.   Witness R, you gave a statement to the State
         20  Security Service of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina
         21  on the 26th of August, 1995; do you remember that?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         24  I should like to have this statement shown to the
         25  witness and the Trial Chamber.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Madam Registrar will handle
          2  that.
          3            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] For you to be
          4  able to follow, I have marked the passages on page 1
          5  that I'm going to discuss.
          6       Q.   Witness R, this statement, that is to say,
          7  the signature at the end of it, is it your signature?
          8       A.   Yes, it is.  It's my signature.
          9       Q.   Is it your statement, therefore?
         10       A.   I think it is.  I didn't read through the
         11  whole of it, but looking at the signatures, they are
         12  mine.
         13       Q.   Witness R, my learned colleague Mr. Cayley
         14  indicated a portion of this statement, read it out, and
         15  I should like to say that in the first sentence you
         16  state the following, after the first sentence which
         17  ends with "Zeleni Jadar," you go on to say:  "I was
         18  together with the majority of the inhabitants on the
         19  defence lines in the region of Susnjari and Jaglici."
         20            Did you, in fact, state that?
         21       A.   That I was in the vicinity of Susnjari and
         22  Jaglici, yes, but that I was at the lines, no.
         23       Q.   Further on you say that:  "At around 1800
         24  hours, on the 11th of July, 1995, after the breakdown
         25  of the defences of Srebrenica, two soldiers unknown to

          1  me came to Susnjari and told the people that women,
          2  children, and the elderly should retreat to the UN base
          3  in Potocari, while the men of fighting age were, with
          4  the other civilians, to try to break through the enemy
          5  lines and reach the free territory with the remaining
          6  citizens."
          7            Did you tell that to the State Security
          8  Service on the 26th of August?
          9       A.   No, I didn't say that the two soldiers were
         10  there, and that I said that we went towards this
         11  breakthrough, I did not -- to try to break through, I
         12  did not use the word "breakthrough,"  "proboj," in
         13  respect of the army and weapons.  I think that most
         14  probably, according to the stories, how it was
         15  recounted, they drew up this statement.
         16       Q.   But you did sign the document nonetheless,
         17  did you not?
         18       A.   Yes, I did sign it.  However, as I was not
         19  confronted with the giving of -- I had never given
         20  statements before this case, I cannot agree.  I don't
         21  agree that I said all this in this particular way and
         22  that every word is as I said it and that it means
         23  something.  I am not a lawyer myself, and what I did
         24  was recount the events.
         25       Q.   Do you consider that the people who took down

          1  your statement were qualified, educated, and trained to
          2  do so?
          3       A.   Well, I don't know the people who took the
          4  statement down, I just met them; that is to say, they
          5  found me and they called me to give a statement.  They
          6  just introduced themselves.
          7       Q.   Do you consider that they forged your
          8  statement?
          9       A.   Well, judging by this, perhaps they added
         10  some words of their own to it.  That is a possibility.
         11       Q.   Witness R, as far as you are aware, how many
         12  able-bodied men gathered in Jaglici or Susnjari on the
         13  11th of July?
         14       A.   I cannot give you an exact figure because I
         15  didn't count them, but it was a very large group of
         16  people.  But they were not all of military age.  There
         17  were some from 10 up to 60, and even 70 years of age,
         18  and they were mostly civilians, civilian persons.
         19       Q.   You had a hunting rifle, an old hunting
         20  rifle.
         21       A.   Yes, with one barrel, handmade, as a souvenir
         22  from my father.
         23       Q.   Did you notice that possibly some other
         24  members in the group had similar weapons, hunting
         25  weapons?

          1       A.   Yes, there were a number of such weapons, but
          2  not a large number; a few.
          3       Q.   Was any military, so-called military weapons
          4  left over, automatic rifles, Kalashnikovs,
          5  semi-automatic rifles, the kind of weapons used by the
          6  army?
          7       A.   There were some but very, very few.
          8       Q.   Witness R, did you hear from your fellow
          9  citizens when you crossed into free territory, did you
         10  hear anything in connection with the part of the column
         11  that was armed?
         12       A.   I heard about a part of that column that
         13  crossed over, a very, very small number of people, that
         14  they were assisted by the BiH army at the crossing at
         15  Baljkovica to pull out.  A certain number, how many, I
         16  don't know, I didn't see them, but they didn't really
         17  have any weapons.  At the beginning they didn't.
         18       Q.   So when the column was formed, they didn't
         19  have any weapons?
         20       A.   They did have weapons but not real weapons.
         21  They had some hunting rifles and some Kalashnikovs,
         22  automatic rifles.  They had something.
         23       Q.   As you were going from Susnjari, Jaglici, to
         24  Buljim and descending towards the Konjevic Polje-Kasaba
         25  road, was there any exchange of fire within the group

          1  you were moving with, within the column?
          2       A.   At one point, near the village of Kamenica,
          3  this large group congregated and we were surrounded,
          4  and there were shots fired from all sides.  I cannot
          5  say that I saw shooting or fire exchanged within the
          6  group, because of course one cannot hit one's own when
          7  everyone is seeking salvation.  But there was shooting
          8  and you couldn't really tell.  It was coming from all
          9  sides, and anyway, we were totally encircled.
         10       Q.   Did you hear anything about possibly
         11  suicides?
         12       A.   There were several killings in a large group
         13  between Konjevic Polje and Kasaba.  In this large
         14  group, several wounded persons killed themselves, and I
         15  saw that.  They simply couldn't go any further.  They
         16  were lying down, they put grenades under their bodies
         17  and committed suicide.  They had no other choice.
         18       Q.   Sir, you were living in a locality close to
         19  Srebrenica which was part of the demilitarised zone.
         20  Tell me, please, did you ever hear about the existence
         21  of a military formation called the 28th Division, under
         22  the command of Naser Oric?
         23       A.   Yes, I did know of the 28th Division,
         24  everyone knows that, but it was the Territorial Defence
         25  and that was at the beginning.  Simply, everyone

          1  defended his own village until Srebrenica was
          2  demilitarised.
          3       Q.   So after the demilitarisation of Srebrenica,
          4  there was no 28th Division, nor Naser Oric there.
          5       A.   I'm not saying that they weren't there.
          6  Naser was there; I saw him.  But as for the army, it
          7  was not there.  I didn't see them.
          8       Q.   Does that mean that Naser was the commander
          9  of a unit without troops?
         10       A.   I don't know how I can answer that question.
         11  If there are no troops, how can he be a commander?
         12       Q.   But you said that you saw Naser and that he
         13  was a commander.
         14       A.   I saw him as a person.  I couldn't see him as
         15  a commander.  I don't know how I can say he was a
         16  commander.  You can tell me someone here is a
         17  commander, but how can I know that?
         18       Q.   On three occasions since 1995 to the present,
         19  you gave statements to the Ministry of the Interior, to
         20  the State Security Service, and to the team of
         21  investigators of the Prosecutor's Office.
         22       A.   Yes, I did give those statements.
         23       Q.   This was in August 1995.
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Your recollections in August 1995 regarding

          1  those events -- and you must understand me, please, I
          2  do not wish to insist on the horrors that you
          3  experienced -- but I have to say that your
          4  recollections then were surely fresher than they are
          5  today.  This is a biological fact, I might say.
          6       A.   One might say that I am in a more focused
          7  state of mind now than then.  It was fresher, more
          8  recent, but the concentration, after a time has gone
          9  by, can improve.
         10       Q.   Witness R, today you are telling us about an
         11  event involving a large number of people, a very
         12  significant event, when, according to you, about 200
         13  people were executed in Konjevic Polje, close to the
         14  group which numbered about 2.000 people.
         15       A.   They were not people who were executed, lined
         16  up and executed.  Some people were sitting; some were
         17  standing.  But all those who were separate from this
         18  large group, who were some distance away from the group
         19  were simply killed because they were surrounded on all
         20  sides.
         21       Q.   Perhaps I didn't use the right expression.
         22  But according to your testimony, 200 people were
         23  killed.
         24       A.   As far as I can tell, the number is between
         25  200 and 300.  I didn't count them.

          1       Q.   Can you explain, Witness R, the fact that
          2  never in any of your previous statements, and there was
          3  this professional team of investigators interviewing
          4  you which, in the opinion of the Defence, could not
          5  have allowed themselves the luxury of leaving out such
          6  an important event, was never mentioned?
          7       A.   Yes.  In every statement they kept cautioning
          8  me that it wasn't important that -- that it was
          9  important to say only what I actually saw.  If I was a
         10  little further away, that wasn't important.
         11       Q.   You were cautioned to that effect by the
         12  investigators?
         13       A.   Yes.  They told me that I should recount the
         14  things that happened to me, whereas other people would
         15  tell about other experiences. .
         16       Q.   Further in your statement, one notes that you
         17  mention for the first time today units that you
         18  describe as Drinski.
         19       A.   Yes.  I mostly spoke about the Krajisnici,
         20  Krajiska.  But in thinking over what actually happened,
         21  I could see one letter, like "D", like "Drina", like
         22  "Drinski".  So in my opinion, there were soldiers with
         23  such insignia as well.
         24       Q.   You just mentioned a single letter?
         25       A.   Yes, one letter.  It was on the left sleeve,

          1  and they always faced us or were behind us.  My head
          2  was bent, looking at the ground, so I couldn't turn
          3  around to read whatever it said.  So we could see very
          4  little.
          5       Q.   But you saw the letter "D"?
          6       A.   Yes, "Drinski".  Maybe I wasn't able to
          7  decipher each and every letter, but "Dre" and then one
          8  naturally concludes that it must be "Drinski".
          9       Q.   Witness R, the investigators that interviewed
         10  you in August certainly asked you about units, because
         11  you mentioned Krajisnici and such like.  Can you
         12  explain then, as this happened to you, why did you not
         13  mention then the unit that was wearing this emblem with
         14  the word "Drinski" or something like that?
         15       A.   I just explained a moment ago that thinking
         16  back to that event, I was reminded that I saw "Drinski"
         17  on a few of those soldiers.  Not all.  Most of them
         18  were "Krajiska", "Krajisnici", most of them.
         19       Q.   In what alphabet was that written?
         20       A.   In view of the fact that I studied Latin and
         21  Cyrillic scripts, there was no Cyrillic, as far as one
         22  could remember.  But this was a very difficult moment
         23  when you can't notice or hear or register everything.
         24  It is hard to imagine, and it is hard to be certain at
         25  that moment.

          1       Q.   Yes, I quite understand.  But as far as I'm
          2  able to understand from what you just said, both
          3  scripts were represented, the Cyrillic and the Latin.
          4       A.   Well, since "K" is written in the same way in
          5  both scripts, the letter "K" was there.  And since the
          6  letter "R" has only one more line, it is "P" in the
          7  Latin script and "R" in the Cyrillic script, the two
          8  are similar again.  And I studied both scripts at
          9  school, so it's not so confusing to me.  I can read
         10  both.  But as far as I can remember, it was in Cyrillic
         11  script, but it's quite possible that it might have been
         12  in Latin script.
         13       Q.   So you're not sure.
         14       A.   Yes, I'm sure it said "Krajisnici",
         15  "Krajiska", or something to that effect.
         16       Q.   Witness R, I'm asking you about Drinski.
         17       A.   Well, that's a different question.  You asked
         18  me about the Krajisnici.  As for Drinski -- I don't
         19  know how I can explain this to you.  Everything I have
         20  said about Krajisnici also applies to Drinski.  I
         21  studied the Latin and Cyrillic scripts, and that is how
         22  I deciphered the patch.
         23       Q.   So my question is:  Are you sure that it was
         24  one or the other script or a mixture?
         25       A.   I'm sure that it said "Krajisnici".  And

          1  thinking things over well, I have a feeling that there
          2  was "Drinski" too.  This is a feeling.  But
          3  "Krajisnici", "Krajiska", that I'm sure of.
          4       Q.   So regarding "Drinski", you have a feeling
          5  that it was there?
          6       A.   Yes.  As to what I feel now and remember now,
          7  I must underline once again that these were difficult
          8  moments, and in such moments it is difficult to expect
          9  a lot, because just imagine if you were in such a
         10  situation, how you would feel.
         11       Q.   To wind up this cross-examination, when you
         12  crossed over to free territory, did you learn from your
         13  friends and acquaintances, who had also crossed into
         14  that territory, anything about who had crossed the
         15  Rajkovici mountain, the confrontation line there, that
         16  an agreement had been made between the commander of the
         17  Zvornik Brigade and the commander who led that group;
         18  in other words, that an agreement had been reached to
         19  open the lines at Bajkovac and to allow the convoy to
         20  pass?.  This was on the 17th or the 18th of July,
         21  1995.
         22       A.   I sorry, I didn't hear that, but I know that
         23  they went through similar troubles with the assistance
         24  of the BiH army that somehow managed to deblock the
         25  area to help this group pull out.  That is what I
          1  heard.  But that there was an agreement, I didn't hear
          2  anything about it; nor did I see the Serb army allowing
          3  anyone to pass, nor did I hear about any such thing.
          4            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          5  the Defence has no further questions.
          6            Witness R, thank you.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Petrusic.
          8            Mr. Cayley, would you like to respond?
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  Your Honour, I have no further
         10  questions for the witness.  Thank you.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Cayley.
         12                 Questioned by the Court:
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Witness R, I would like to just
         14  clarify a few points which you mentioned.
         15            When you spoke of what Mr. Cayley called a
         16  vantage point in the woods -- I don't know how they
         17  translated that in Serbo-Croat because "vantage point"
         18  is a very sophisticated word -- I think you saw between
         19  200 or 300 people killed by the Serb troops.  Were they
         20  killed in the fighting or was it a summary execution?
         21  Were you able to see that?
         22       A.   Yes, I saw that.  It wasn't in fighting, it
         23  was killing people at random, people who were standing
         24  there, who had decided to surrender to the Serb army
         25  because they didn't know where to go.  And they were

          1  waiting for the Serb army to approach them, and as they
          2  approached them, the Serb troops, they killed those
          3  around.  I assume they killed them.  Anyway, I saw
          4  people falling to the ground and being shot at.  What
          5  actually happened --
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  You saw that very clearly from
          7  where you were?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  You saw the shooting or you saw
         10  the bodies on the ground?
         11       A.   I saw the bodies, and I saw a man, as he was
         12  hit, falling down.  Some people crying out, screaming
         13  out, I saw that.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  So you saw the whole event and
         15  not the aftermath, just people lying down.  You saw and
         16  heard the shots?
         17       A.   Yes.  It was from the nearby woods.  It
         18  wasn't far away, as the crow flies.  If we were to
         19  measure this distance, it would be 300 to 500 metres
         20  away.  And as we were on the hill and they were down in
         21  the vale, one could see it.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Very good.  Now, when you spoke
         23  about this old man, Stari, among other things which you
         24  said, he said, "The Wolves will deal with them," if you
         25  remember what you said.  What did you conclude from

          1  that?  What is the meaning of "Wolves" and what is the
          2  meaning of "deal with them", if you can put that in the
          3  context you are in?
          4       A.   The Wolves, I think, were -- as I could hear
          5  from others, that they were a unit, a Serb unit.  And
          6  when he said they would deal with them, what I thought
          7  he meant was that they would catch them and do
          8  something.  I don't know what.  Probably what he did
          9  with us.  That was my idea.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  What they did with you, it means
         11  shooting or killing, what you said about yourself.
         12  That was your conclusion?
         13       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, speaking of you, you were
         15  shot at a distance of one metre, and you were lying
         16  down on the ground in your blood until night.  Now,
         17  were you in shape to move after that?  Did you have the
         18  strength to start moving after that?  What happened
         19  exactly?  Did somebody carry you or were you able to go
         20  through?
         21       A.   There was no one there to help me.  I managed
         22  to get up.  It was hard.  I was all stiff.  But by
         23  budging left and right, I managed to sit up.  And after
         24  sitting for five to ten minutes, I somehow managed to
         25  climb up against a tree to get on my feet.  As I was

          1  wounded in the shoulder, I could walk.  I hadn't lost
          2  so much blood as not to be able to walk.  I could walk
          3  with difficulty but ...
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  Very good.  Just with reference
          5  to the insignia you thought you saw, the Drinski
          6  insignia, you said you had the feeling that this
          7  insignia existed.  Can you just explain how this
          8  feeling came to you?  What gave you this feeling?  You
          9  heard people mentioning the word or you read it?  If
         10  you can try to know the origin of this feeling, if you
         11  could.
         12       A.   Well, it is difficult because this Stari who
         13  was giving orders said, "The Wolves will deal with it,"
         14  and I thought he meant the Drina Wolves because I had
         15  heard of that unit.
         16            As for Krajisnici or Krajiska, I am sure of
         17  this emblem.  It is a yellow-coloured patch on the left
         18  sleeve worn by all these soldiers.  But when I think
         19  hard, I have a feeling that there were soldiers who
         20  were also wearing similar patches with the word
         21  "Drinski."  But I have this feeling now after a long
         22  period of time and after thinking hard.  For Krajiski,
         23  Krajisnici, or Krajiska, I am sure of that.  It was a
         24  yellow patch, and I can show you this patch.  If you
         25  can get a hold of an example of this patch, I'm sure I

          1  would be able to recognise it.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  The Krajisnici.  You are
          3  concentrating on the Krajisnici badge; is that right?
          4  This is the thing you are sure of?
          5       A.   Yes.  There are three possibilities;
          6  Krajisnici, Krajiska, or something to that effect.  I
          7  think it said "Krajiska," "Krajisnici," something to
          8  that effect.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  And did you have an idea of
         10  where these people would come from?
         11       A.   No.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you hear them speak?  Did
         13  you hear their dialect?
         14       A.   Well, the dialect amongst the Serbs, at
         15  least, is similar, so I can't judge by their speech.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  So you don't know whether they
         17  were coming from Serbia, from Bosnia.
         18       A.   No, I couldn't tell.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  That's all the questions I
         20  wanted to ask you.  I would like to thank you very much
         21  for coming and congratulate you for getting out of this
         22  great ordeal alive and safe and sound.  Thank you very
         23  much.
         24            Mr. Bailiff, we'll have to take him out.
         25            MR. CAYLEY:  Judge Riad, before the witness

          1  leaves, we have a number of exhibits that need to be --
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  Before he leaves.  Then
          3  before he leaves, I would like to ask him if he would
          4  like to add anything to what he said.  Anything you
          5  would like to mention, to tell the Tribunal?  You have
          6  come the whole way, and you are entitled to be heard.
          7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] This was my
          8  only wish, to have the opportunity to tell about what
          9  happened to normal people so that they can feel and see
         10  what they did, so that they can remember what they
         11  did.  That's all.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much, Witness R.
         13  I can't say your name.
         14            Mr. Cayley.
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  Your Honour, there are a number
         16  of exhibits, and I think my learned friend has one
         17  exhibit too.
         18            First of all, Exhibit 151, which is an
         19  English translation of a letter of discharge and
         20  medical report, and Exhibit 151A, which is the original
         21  of that report in the Bosnian language.  I would apply
         22  for formal admission into evidence of those two
         23  documents.  They should remain under seal because they
         24  identify the witness.
         25            The second item is Exhibit 159, which is the

          1  map which the witness originally drew a trace, which we
          2  then incorporated into a computer-generated image of
          3  what he drew us.  That document does not need to be
          4  under seal.
          5            And then lastly, if the private session --
          6  where he gave evidence in private session could remain
          7  under seal, because he does identify an individual in
          8  that part of his evidence.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Cayley.
         10            Does the Defence have any document to present
         11  into evidence?
         12            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] The Defence
         13  has no objection regarding the documents tendered by
         14  the Prosecutor.  And I think D19 is the exhibit shown
         15  to Your Honours which we would like to tender.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Cayley.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:  If I can add in respect of D19,
         18  and I'm sure my learned friend won't object, it should
         19  be under seal because the document identifies the
         20  witness.  It has his signature and name upon it, so it
         21  should remain under seal.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  I think we have to keep it under
         23  seal.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes.  Yes.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.  Now, Witness R,
          1  we'll ask you to leave, and thank you again.  We better
          2  draw the shutters.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes, Your Honour, I think so.
          4            Judge Riad, while this is taking place,
          5  Mr. McCloskey and I will change places because he's
          6  leading the next witness, unless you wish to take a
          7  short break at this time.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  No, we can continue.  Perhaps
          9  you can ask him if he wants to lead the witness.

         21                 [Open session]
         22            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         23       Q.   Witness S, you are a Bosnian by nationality;
         24  is that correct?
         25       A.   Yes.
          1       Q.   And a Muslim by faith.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Can you tell us where you were living in July
          4  of 1995 and who you were living with?
          5       A.   I lived in Srebrenica with my family, my wife
          6  and two children.
          7       Q.   And on July 11th, did you decide to do
          8  something along with your family?
          9       A.   On the 11th of July we had to separate.  I
         10  decided to go with the other men, to take to the woods,
         11  and my wife and children remained and went with the
         12  other people to the UNPROFOR base at Potocari.
         13       Q.   Can you briefly describe the circumstances
         14  why you decided you had to leave your home and your
         15  family had to leave their home.
         16       A.   Well, I saw that the situation was a chaotic
         17  one, a terrible one, and there was no other way out.
         18  We could only expect death down there because we had no
         19  protection from UNPROFOR, and we decided to take to the
         20  woods.
         21       Q.   Is that because the Serb army had taken over
         22  Srebrenica on the 11th?
         23       A.   Yes, it had already taken over half the town,
         24  from the hill of Bojna.  And there was no reason to
         25  wait any longer, there was no possibility for safety.

          1       Q.   Your family went to Potocari, and where did
          2  you go?
          3       A.   I went with all the other men towards the
          4  village of Slatine and Susnjari, upwards.
          5       Q.   About how many other men were gathered in the
          6  area of Susnjari when you got there?
          7       A.   Well, there were about 12.000 and 15.000.  I
          8  can't give you an exact figure, but there were a lot of
          9  us.
         10       Q.   Do you know roughly how many of those men
         11  might have been armed in some way?
         12       A.   As far as I was able to note, about a third,
         13  I'd say, with hunting rifles, not very strong weaponry;
         14  hunting rifles and other types.  But a third of them, I
         15  would say.  Not more.
         16       Q.   Did you, yourself, have some kind of
         17  armament?
         18       A.   No.  No.
         19       Q.   Did you have some military explosive?
         20       A.   In my bag I had a hand grenade which I put
         21  there, if I were captured by the Serbs, to be able to
         22  take my own life.
         23       Q.   When you set off -- what time did you set off
         24  from Susnjari?
         25       A.   Well, from a field in front of a house, I

          1  left there at around noon, between 12.00 and 1.00,
          2  towards the Bojna hill.
          3       Q.   Was that the evening of the 11th, or was it
          4  noon on the 12th?
          5       A.   It was in the evening of the 12th -- no, I'm
          6  sorry.  It was between the 11th and 12th.  We started
          7  out on the 11th, at about 2.30, and in the evening we
          8  arrived at Susnjari at about 10.00.  We had a
          9  consultation there.  So that at about 12.00, midnight,
         10  that is to say, we started out.  The night between the
         11  11th and 12th.
         12       Q.   What was this consultation you referred to?
         13       A.   Well, we lined up so that as many people
         14  could cross as possible, because the Serb lines were
         15  very near and there were a lot of us.  Around Causi and
         16  the surrounding hills, that's where they were.
         17       Q.   Was someone leading the consultation or
         18  leading this large group of men?
         19       A.   No.  They just tried to line us up so that
         20  people with weapons and without weapons would be mixed
         21  up together, and if we came across an ambush, to
         22  prevent as many people losing their lives as possible.
         23       Q.   When you say "they," -- so there were some
         24  people leading this, or trying to communicate to the
         25  large group?

          1       A.   Well, there was the head of the municipality,
          2  those in charge of civilian authority, and some others
          3  who were in Srebrenica in the course of the war, the
          4  chiefs of some secretariats for example.
          5       Q.   Did you notice military people too that had
          6  been in the military?
          7       A.   Well, there was the Territorial Defence.  It
          8  wasn't an army, because it was a demilitarised zone, so
          9  there was just this sort of Territorial Defence if the
         10  situation would arise, as it in fact did.
         11       Q.   So there were some Territorial Defence people
         12  there also.
         13       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         14       Q.   I know you spent some time through the woods,
         15  but I'm going to -- the counsel for the Defence may ask
         16  you about that, the Judge, but I would like also, I'd
         17  like to take you, if I could, through the 12th and
         18  start out with the late evening hours of the 12th.  If
         19  you could tell us where you were on the late hours of
         20  the 12th and what you recall happening then, and then
         21  work your way onto the morning of the 13th when you
         22  were captured.
         23       A.   On the 12th, at 11.30, I crossed the first
         24  Serb lines.  At about 2.00, 2.30, there was an ambush
         25  towards the village of Kamenica --

          1       Q.   You mean 11.30 a.m. and then 2.30 p.m. on the
          2  12th there was an ambush?
          3       A.   No, at noon on the 12th, because I was at
          4  Buljim, in front of the first Serb lines from the
          5  morning, from 5.00 a.m. until 11.30.  We were not able
          6  to cross over, and the column was interrupted.  And at
          7  11.30, I crossed the first Serb line with a group and
          8  then we came across an ambush by a stream.  And
          9  sometime in the afternoon I reached the Kamenica Hill,
         10  where I saw a lot of soldiers who had gone ahead.  The
         11  situation was one of chaos.  First of all, they said
         12  that the wounded should go in front, and I took a
         13  wounded man and went in front.  But towards evening we
         14  went to the village of Kamenica and moved on towards
         15  the village of Unice [phoen].  As we were going down
         16  from the village of Kamenica I drank a lot of water,
         17  and by 12.00 we went up through the village of
         18  Burnice.  I felt very sleepy and I don't know what time
         19  it was, 12.00, 12.30, and I lost consciousness.  I woke
         20  up in the morning at around 3.00 a.m. and got to
         21  Konjevic Polje.
         22       Q.   So this is the morning of the 13th that you
         23  got to Konjevic Polje.
         24       A.   Yes.
         25            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness

          1  what is marked as Exhibit 176, and could that be placed
          2  on the ELMO, please.
          3       Q.   I believe you've told us previously that you
          4  were near the intersection at Konjevic Polje.  Could
          5  you point out just roughly where you found yourself the
          6  morning of the 13th.  You can just point with your
          7  finger on that map.  No, you've got the pointer.
          8  That's great.
          9       A.   I found myself by the road, between Kravica
         10  Rijeka and the road towards Bratunac.
         11       Q.   Okay.  Why don't you use the pointer and show
         12  us what you mean.
         13       A.   It is this section here [indicates].
         14       Q.   That's the -- you're pointing to the
         15  intersection just, it looks like, perhaps a kilometre
         16  south of the little dot that says "Konjevic Polje."
         17            Can you describe the situation you found
         18  yourself in that morning.  What occurred?
         19       A.   When I came to, regained consciousness, I
         20  looked at my watch and it was about 3.00 a.m.  I was in
         21  some grassland and then went into a cornfield of some
         22  kind.  And I saw that I was in a very grave situation.
         23  As I knew the terrain slightly from before the war, I
         24  saw a bridge which goes towards Kasaba.  I thought
         25  about what I was going to do next, and I went down

          1  towards the river, which flows from the Kravica
          2  direction and it flows under the bridge and joins up
          3  with the Jadar River.  But I thought that the river was
          4  enormous, it looked enormous to me, and then when I
          5  looked down to the River Jadar from the bridge it
          6  seemed even larger and I thought that it would take me
          7  off.  So I went back to the field, that cornfield
          8  actually, and I sat down there.  There was a burnt-down
          9  house there.  In front of it there was a slightly newer
         10  house which had not been burnt to the ground.  And I
         11  took some tobacco out of my pocket and wanted to roll a
         12  cigarette to make myself feel better.  But when I got
         13  the tobacco out, I put it on my knee, rested it on the
         14  knee of my leg, and I just couldn't get my fingers
         15  together to roll up a cigarette, I felt so awful.  And
         16  I shook my head to see if that would help me regain
         17  consciousness fully and to feel better, but it didn't.
         18            And then I heard that there were some people
         19  close by, and I tried to go into a house which had been
         20  partially burnt down.  At the entrance to that house,
         21  at the stairway, I stepped on a brick, that is to say,
         22  a tile from the roof, and it snapped.  And the people
         23  saw me and started shouting at me.  They said,
         24  "Surrender.  We can see you."  And they shot up in the
         25  air above me and I put my hands up, put my bag up on my

          1  shoulder.  They told me to approach, towards the
          2  asphalt road, which led from the intersection to
          3  Bratunac.  I came up to these group of men, and they
          4  said, "Put your hands up," and I raised my hands even
          5  higher.  They asked what I had in my bag. "Do you have
          6  any weapons?"  I said I did not, and they told me ...
          7       Q.   Witness, as you know,  what you're saying has
          8  to be interpreted.  I can tell that you're going a
          9  little -- if you can just slow down a little bit and
         10  just tell us the main things that occurred.
         11       A.   At that moment the first policeman came up to
         12  me, he took my bag away, took out the hand grenade
         13  which was in the bag and which I had intended to commit
         14  suicide with.  He asked me what I had in my pockets.
         15  Then he searched my pockets and took out the tobacco,
         16  he took out my lighter from my pocket and wallet, in
         17  which I had 310 German marks.  I had my passport, my ID
         18  card, my diary and telephone directory with the
         19  telephone numbers of my family abroad, and I had a
         20  ticket.
         21       Q.   Did he take --
         22       A.   Which I had for work --
         23       Q.   So he took all those identification
         24  documents.  That's the first thing -- that's one of the
         25  first things that this person you've described as a

          1  police officer took; is that right?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Now, can you describe what this person you've
          4  described as a police officer was wearing, and what the
          5  other people that he was with were wearing who captured
          6  you that morning at Konjevic Polje?
          7       A.   There were several of them there.  They were
          8  standing five to ten metres away.  They had dark blue
          9  uniforms and slightly multicoloured.  They weren't all
         10  blue, they were the mass type of blue uniform and they
         11  were all in one.  They had a belt around their waist in
         12  front.
         13       Q.   Did you notice any insignia?
         14       A.   No.
         15       Q.   After they took all your ID documents, what
         16  happened?  And tell us when you come to a point where
         17  you were able to recognise someone so we can stop.
         18       A.   That other policeman, the second one who was
         19  standing next to the one that had taken my documents
         20  from me, he said, "Lie down so I can slit your
         21  throat."  I laid down by the roadside and said, "Go
         22  ahead.  Slit my throat.  Go ahead."  But a third person
         23  was there and he said, "Don't touch him.  Leave him
         24  alone," and he told me to get up.  I got up, and he
         25  said to the other one, "Take him up there."  And he

          1  took me off towards a school building.
          2            And in the meantime, while they were shooting
          3  at me, a civilian jumped out of the grass, he threw a
          4  grenade.  He was on half of this asphalt road.  He was
          5  of medium height.  He had a check jacket on and his
          6  face was covered in blood.  They shouted at me and
          7  said, "Is that your brother?"  And I said no, it's
          8  not.  They asked me whether I knew him, and I said I
          9  didn't.  And he said that I should pull him off the
         10  asphalt road, onto the bank, the grassy bank by the
         11  side.  I took him by the legs and pulled him over.
         12       Q.   Let me ask you, what exactly did this person
         13  do with the grenade?
         14       A.   I think that he had this grenade and he threw
         15  it, and he killed himself on that road.
         16       Q.   With the grenade?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   And that happened before you were captured or
         19  after you were captured?
         20       A.   I think while they were shooting at me, he
         21  must have been close by, some 50 metres away.  I didn't
         22  notice him, but I found him there dead.
         23       Q.   Let's get on with your testimony.  You said
         24  that you were taken to a place near a school.  Where
         25  were you taken?

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Can we just dwell on this man
          2  with the grenade?  Did he throw it on himself to commit
          3  suicide, or did he throw it at the people shooting at
          4  Witness S?
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:
          6       Q.   Just to try to confirm that, did the person
          7  with the grenade use that grenade to kill himself, or
          8  did he throw it at the Serb soldiers?
          9       A.   I think that he tried to run across the
         10  road.  I was a little further away so I didn't quite
         11  see it.  And he had no other way.
         12       Q.   Do you know if the explosion of the hand
         13  grenade killed him or whether Serb bullets killed him,
         14  or could you tell?
         15       A.   His face was covered in blood and he had a
         16  jacket on him.  I couldn't see any other wounds.  And
         17  he was lying face down, with his arms spread out on the
         18  asphalt road.
         19       Q.   Did you see the hand grenade explode?
         20       A.   No.  It was fear, probably.  There were five
         21  or six of them, they were shooting over me from
         22  automatic rifles.  I was scared so I didn't see.
         23       Q.   Did you see him throw the hand grenade away
         24  from himself?
         25       A.   No.  He may have been some 40 metres away

          1  from me, so I didn't see him.  I just saw him dead.
          2       Q.   Why did you think there was a hand grenade
          3  involved in his death?
          4       A.   That's what they told me, and the blood was
          5  still hot.  When I picked him up first by the arms, and
          6  then the legs, my arms were bloody and his blood was
          7  warm, so it was a fresh wound.
          8       Q.   Okay.  It's important that when you're
          9  testifying, just testify about what you saw and heard,
         10  and if someone -- if you're testifying about what
         11  someone else told you, make sure you tell us that also,
         12  okay?
         13       A.   Okay.
         14       Q.   Can you tell us where you were first taken by
         15  these men?
         16       A.   They took me to an area in front of the
         17  school.  There was a like a small shed.  And there were
         18  a couple of soldiers in camouflage uniforms in that
         19  shed.  There were two other men that I knew.  There
         20  were traces of blows on them.  The man brought me
         21  there, a man I knew, and he told them, "Don't anyone
         22  touch him."  But they tried to enter, there was one
         23  with a rifle there who was watching over us, they
         24  wanted to come in and beat us and they said, "Look at
         25  him, how big he is."  Afterwards a man came talking to
          1  me, asking me where I had worked, what I did, where I
          2  was during the war, did I have money, had they taken
          3  the money from me, and things like that.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Your Honour, I think we've
          5  reached the point where he recognises some people, so
          6  we should go into private session, I believe.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Okay.  Madam Registrar, please
          8  order a private session.

         17                 [Open session]
         18            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Exhibit 177.  And could you
         19  put that on the ELMO, please.
         20       Q.   Do you recognise the little building depicted
         21  in 177?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Can you tell us where you were taken in
         24  relation to that building, and show us with your
         25  pointer.

          1       A.   He took me along this path [indicates], and
          2  then I entered the house from this side [indicates].
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, he shows that
          4  he entered this little brick building, in the forefront
          5  of the photo, from what would be the right side.
          6       Q.   You've already testified that there were at
          7  least two Muslim men you knew in there that were
          8  captives, and a Serb policeman that you knew.  What
          9  occurred in the building, and where did you go next?
         10       A.   The Serb policeman brought me there, and
         11  apart from us -- next to us were soldiers in camouflage
         12  uniforms, and he disappeared.  He later came again and
         13  told us that we had to go somewhere for some officers
         14  to question us.  And then he led us from this small
         15  building forward, along this path, across a meadow, to
         16  another house.
         17       Q.   Now, the person that led you to another
         18  house, was that a Serb policeman that you had known
         19  earlier?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   And he wasn't the one you just saw very
         22  briefly and then disappeared, he was the one who you
         23  saw for a longer period of time.
         24       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         25       Q.   In fact, this one Serb policeman was with you

          1  most of the time in Konjevic Polje, until you were
          2  given to the execution squad; is that correct?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   All right.  So you were -- where did you go
          5  from that little brick building in the last exhibit?
          6  Where did this policeman take you?
          7       A.   We crossed a meadow, towards the crossroads.
          8  I don't know how many metres away exactly.
          9       Q.   Where did you go?
         10       A.   When we got in front of this house, we found
         11  there four men in uniform who were sitting around a
         12  table lengthwise, and there was another table at right
         13  angles and we stood next to that table.  To my left was
         14  the policeman I knew, and to my right were another two
         15  policemen whom I did not know.
         16            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness
         17  Exhibit 178, and could we put that on the ELMO. .
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. McCloskey, I suggest that in
         19  five minutes we have a break.
         20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  That's fine.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  And we will resume at a quarter
         22  past.
         23            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, Mr. President,
         24  please.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.  I'm sorry to the

          1  interpreters.
          2            Mr. McCloskey, I suggest that in five minutes
          3  we have a break and we'll resume at a quarter past
          4  one.
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Perhaps, Mr. Petrusic, can we
          7  continue until 2.15?
          8            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
          9  Honour, Mr. President.  Yes.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         11            Please proceed, Mr. McCloskey.
         12            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         13       Q.   Can you point with the pointer again to the
         14  house where you were taken to the outside, where these
         15  men were?
         16       A.   Next to this big building [indicates], in
         17  front of this tree [indicates].
         18       Q.   Do you remember those trees?
         19       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         20       Q.   You've always told us that you remember those
         21  two apple trees.  Are those the two apple trees that
         22  you recall?
         23       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         24       Q.   Now, can you describe the men that questioned
         25  you, how many there were and what they were wearing.

          1       A.   Yes.  One of them was sitting at the head of
          2  the table, and the other three to the side.  And the
          3  one sitting at the head questioned us most.  When they
          4  lined us up in front of this other table, he said,
          5  "Don't lie.  We know everything."  And then he asked
          6  me where I was, what I was, where I worked.  I answered
          7  some questions, and he said that he didn't believe me.
          8  Then he went on to the man next to me, and then on to
          9  the third man.
         10            The officers who were sitting around the
         11  table had a bottle of liquor in front of them and four
         12  small glasses, and they were drinking this alcoholic
         13  beverage.  Then they questioned us in some detail.
         14  They told us about certain things, whether we had heard
         15  about them, some operations, offensive operations
         16  against Srebrenica.  I said no.
         17            And then later they asked us whether we were
         18  hungry.  We said we were.  And from a wooden hut they
         19  brought us two small loaves of bread and some salami.
         20  We started eating.  We took a little.  We didn't have
         21  much strength.  And they encouraged us, "Why aren't you
         22  eating?"  And we said we couldn't.  And they said, "Are
         23  you thirsty," and we said we were.  And then he ordered
         24  one of the policemen to bring us water.  He went into
         25  the house and brought us water.  We drank.

          1            In the meantime, while they were still
          2  questioning us and we were answering, along the asphalt
          3  road from Bratunac, 12 buses came with women and
          4  children on board, and they told us to leave the food
          5  and to turn around and face the road, which we did.
          6  After that they asked us, "Did you see that?"  We said
          7  yes.  Then they said, "Turn around."  And then he said,
          8  "You see how respectful they were of us, that they
          9  didn't force too many people onto the buses but only as
         10  many as could sit down."  And I said, "Yes, you're
         11  good."
         12            And after a short while this policeman came
         13  up, the one who was sitting at the head of the table.
         14  I must not mention his name yet.  He said, "Take them
         15  down there."  And then this policeman took us into this
         16  house, in front of this house, and when we entered that
         17  house --
         18       Q.   Let me stop you there.  Before we get to this
         19  new policeman that you -- you know at least this
         20  policeman's first name; is that right?
         21       A.   It is the same one who took me to the small
         22  house and brought me from that small house to the
         23  people who were interrogating me.
         24       Q.   So it's the same guy that you've been talking
         25  about all along?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Now, I want to ask you some more particular
          3  questions about the person that you said was sitting at
          4  this table that first asked you questions.  Can you
          5  describe what he was wearing?
          6       A.   He was wearing a camouflage uniform.  His
          7  sleeves were turned up.  He had a moustache.  And the
          8  other one, or rather the third one at the end of the
          9  table was grey-haired --
         10       Q.   Let's just stay with this one guy first.
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   The first one with the moustache, what colour
         13  uniform was he wearing, camouflage uniform?
         14       A.   It was the colour of camouflage uniforms worn
         15  by their officers.
         16       Q.   It wasn't blue.
         17       A.   No, no.  No, no.
         18       Q.   It was a regular soldier's camouflage
         19  uniform.
         20       A.   Yes.  All four were wearing this military
         21  camouflage uniform.
         22       Q.   All four of the men that were at this table,
         23  that were participating in the interrogation, were all
         24  in military camouflage uniform, not blue.
         25       A.   Yes.  But the one at the head of the table

          1  put most questions, and the one at the end.  The other
          2  two kept quiet.  They just looked at us; they didn't
          3  ask us much.
          4       Q.   Okay.  The person at the head of the table,
          5  he had a moustache; is that correct?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   What did he tell you about himself?
          8       A.   He told us that he had been in command of the
          9  operation on Srebrenica in 1993, in the area of Kade
         10  Voda and Osmace.  And he told us how many shells they
         11  fired.  They expected to find thousands dead, but they
         12  only found four soldiers dead in a bunker.
         13       Q.   Did he tell you his nickname?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   Can you tell us his nickname?
         16       A.   Yes.  He said, "You have heard on the
         17  Motorola the name Cica.  That was me."
         18       Q.   You said there was a grey-haired man at the
         19  other end of the table.  Can you describe that person.
         20       A.   He was a little taller than this one.  He was
         21  a little plumper.  And I just remember the way he
         22  looked at us, as he was closest to us.  He had grey
         23  hair.  He was maybe over 50, a couple of years over 50,
         24  in my opinion.
         25       Q.   About how tall?

          1       A.   He was sitting down.  Once they got up very
          2  briefly -- actually, these two in the middle were
          3  saying that General Mladic was coming, so we didn't
          4  dare turn around.  They jumped up.  The one at the head
          5  of the table said that it wasn't General Mladic; it
          6  wasn't his car.  And then he said, "You've had it if
          7  Mladic comes."  And then they looked, and then they sat
          8  down again, saying it wasn't Mladic.  We didn't turn
          9  around, so we didn't see what colour the car was.
         10       Q.   How tall was, your best guess, the
         11  grey-haired fellow?
         12       A.   Well, maybe 170, 180 centimetres.  He was
         13  quite heavy.  In his 50s; 55 maybe, in that age group.
         14       Q.   Thank you.  One last question before we
         15  break.  About what time did this occur, where these
         16  people were interrogating you?
         17       A.   About -- between 7.00 and 9.00 in the
         18  morning.
         19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  All right.  Thank you, Your
         20  Honour.  This may be a good time to break, on your
         21  recommendation.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. McCloskey.  We'll
         23  resume at twenty past one.  Thank you.
         24                 --- Recess taken at 12.53 p.m.
         25                 --- On resuming at 1.24 p.m.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Please proceed, Mr. McCloskey.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I
          3  just noticed the defendant coming in.
          4       Q.   Witness S, we had just left off and you were
          5  about to be taken from the place where you'd been
          6  interrogated by four people in camouflage army
          7  uniforms, and you were being taken by the police
          8  officer that you'd known.  Where did he take you this
          9  time?
         10       A.   Well, there's a detail that I forgot to tell
         11  you.  While I was being interrogated, they asked us
         12  whether we drank alcoholic beverage and I said we did,
         13  and he said to another policeman to bring us a glass.
         14  Then he poured some alcohol from the bottle.  I took
         15  the glass first and swallowed the alcohol, but I felt a
         16  sort of shock going through me.  I passed the glass on
         17  to the other one, he took a sip, and then to the third
         18  and he returned the glass back to me.  I took another
         19  sip, as much as I was able.  I passed it around again.
         20  The next man just took a little bit and said he didn't
         21  want any more, and so on.  And I drank the whole of
         22  that glass full of this alcohol myself.
         23            And then the policeman took us off into
         24  another house which was empty.  It didn't have a door.
         25  We were on the ground floor level of that house, and

          1  there were three rooms on the ground floor.  They took
          2  me to the one furthest away, on the right-hand side, at
          3  the window to that room; that is to say, there was just
          4  a wooden frame round the window, and on the window
          5  there was just some plastic.
          6            In the room there were two mattresses, one on
          7  each side, and in another corner there was a small
          8  stove.  The policeman whom I knew told us, "Don't
          9  anybody try to escape.  You can't escape."  And having
         10  drunk that alcohol, I began to regain consciousness.
         11            A boy was brought in after that, he was 14 or
         12  15, he was barefoot, and the policeman asked him where
         13  he was from.  He told him.  He asked him his name.  He
         14  asked him whether he knew a man, that is to say, a
         15  policeman who was that person's neighbour.  He asked
         16  him whether he was hungry, the boy said yes.  Then he
         17  said, "Take some tins and eat them."  The young boy
         18  began to eat.  He was frightened.
         19            Another policeman came in asking for that boy
         20  because allegedly the boy had wounded some policeman by
         21  the road.  They began to beat him outside in the
         22  hallway.  They took him off somewhere, they searched
         23  him for a rifle -- for a pistol, then they returned
         24  him, they brought him back.
         25            After a certain amount of time had passed,

          1  they brought in another man whom I knew as well.  And
          2  later on they brought yet another man in whom I did not
          3  know, and the second policeman asked me whether I knew
          4  him and he asked me some other things from before the
          5  war.  And later on they brought in another man; he was
          6  a Muslim whom I did know.
          7            We stayed there for some time.  I talked to
          8  the policemen about the people -- to this one policeman
          9  about our common acquaintances.  He would ask where
         10  they were, what they had been in the war, and he said,
         11  "See what your government has done to you.  It's sold
         12  you out.  Why didn't you stay with us?"  I said that I
         13  didn't know.  At one particular point I just said that
         14  I was just beginning to feel better and coming to, and
         15  he said, "Well, it's difficult."
         16            After some more time had gone by, another man
         17  came, I knew this man as well, and he said --
         18       Q.   Was this new man a Serb or a Muslim, this new
         19  arrival?
         20       A.   He was also a Serb and he came and said these
         21  four men should go downstairs, these other ones should
         22  stay where they are.  So we left the house by the
         23  crossroads, we crossed over the road, and they took us
         24  to a warehouse of some kind which was situated on the
         25  banks of the River Jadar.
          1  MR. McCLOSKEY:  If we could go into private
          2  session briefly again.

          7                 [Open session]
          8            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If the witness could refer to
          9  Exhibit 178 again, which should be up there, and if we
         10  could put that on the ELMO.
         11       Q.   Now, do you see on this photograph, 178, the
         12  area where the warehouse was that you were taken to
         13  that day?  And could you point to it if you see it,
         14  just the general area.
         15       A.   You can't see the warehouse now.  It was
         16  destroyed.  There was never a petrol pump here before
         17  the war.  He was here [indicates] -- it was here
         18  [indicates] in front of the petrol pump, this area
         19  here, the general area of the petrol station.
         20       Q.   All right.
         21       A.   That was built on part of the area where the
         22  warehouse stood.
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, he's pointing
         24  to an area on the left-hand side of the photograph
         25  where you can just make out some big yellow bars which

          1  is a petrol station.
          2       Q.   Now, you were taken to this very area by
          3  Mr. Ruez of the Office of the Prosecutor relatively
          4  recently, and you took him around to all these places,
          5  didn't you?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   What happened at this warehouse?
          8       A.   When we went into the warehouse, before the
          9  war there was an agricultural chemist there, and the
         10  warehouse was 15 or 20 metres long, and you could buy
         11  medicines for agricultural purposes.  When we entered,
         12  there were two rooms.  One room actually was the
         13  entrance to the warehouse itself.
         14            So when I went into this smaller room, they
         15  started shouting at us, and (redacted)
         16  (redacted)  And they started shouting,
         17  they said, "Take your clothes off."  They began beating
         18  us.  We took our clothes off and they lined us up along
         19  the wall.  And while they were lining us up, I counted
         20  12 people, Muslims, who were in their underpants.
         21  Their clothes had been taken off.  I began to be
         22  afraid.  I began to shake.  He said, "Why are you
         23  shaking" and began to beat me.  And I noticed a
         24  colleague of mine from the company I worked for, we
         25  worked together, amongst the Muslims, that is.  And

          1  they beat us there, they inflicted blows on us, and we
          2  fell to the ground.
          3            And then a young man turned up.  He was
          4  between 18 and 20 years old.  I noticed him too.  At
          5  the first point, he asked me where I was, what I had
          6  been doing, what I was (redacted)
          7  (redacted), "Why did you make these people take their
          8  clothes off?  They are going to go for an exchange."
          9  He said, "They won't be exchanged, I'm going to kill
         10  them all," and a young man that I had buried some 40
         11  days ago.  And he said,  "If anybody is going to kill
         12  them, I'll kill them.  I did this 15 days ago." And
         13  then they hugged each other and went outside.
         14            Later on another man with a moustache came
         15  in, he was thin, and said, "Put your clothes on."  The
         16  four of us dressed, began to dress.  We took up our
         17  clothes.  The other one said that they couldn't find
         18  their clothing, and he said he'd bring them some.  And
         19  he went into some room and brought some clothing, as
         20  much as he was able to carry.  The people then dressed
         21  themselves but they said, "This isn't my clothing," and
         22  he said, "Don't be choosey.  Put anything you can find
         23  on because that's all there is."
         24            Then from that small room they transferred us
         25  into this larger room, which was where the shop was,

          1  and there were some bars there but no glass.  They
          2  lined us up against the wall and beat us.  I was beaten
          3  most and I was a little frightened.  But after I had
          4  drunk the alcohol, I felt a bit better.  Our hands had
          5  to be up against the wall and our stomachs had to be up
          6  against the wall.  They hit me on my back, on my head,
          7  with their clubs or batons.
          8            Next to me throughout that time was my bag,
          9  and then he said, "Who does the bag belong to?"  I said
         10  it belonged to me, that it was mine.  He told me to
         11  turn around.  I turned around, he said, "Open the bag
         12  and throw out the things you have in it."  I did so.  I
         13  threw them out onto the floor.  There was a pair of
         14  trousers, a couple of T-shirts that I had taken with
         15  me, some bandages.  I had some injections to stop
         16  bleeding, something like that, I got it from
         17  humanitarian aid, and I took this along with me just in
         18  case I happened to be wounded, so I could dress my
         19  wounds.  Then he began to inflict wounds on me, he
         20  said, "What do you need that for?"  I fell on the
         21  ground again, and they beat me again.
         22            And after some time a bus parked in front of
         23  the warehouse.  There were no signs up on the bus.  I
         24  wanted to try and remember, but there was nothing
         25  written up on the bus.  It was driven by a blonde

          1  lady.  I think she had a white shirt on and she had the
          2  sort of bicycle, short trousers on, she was wearing
          3  (redacted),
          4  come and board the bus.  Put your hands behind your
          5  neck.  Get into the bus, and don't you dare sit down.
          6  Don't any of you dare sit down."
          7            And as they were boarding the bus, and when I
          8  boarded the bus, my seat was at the back, and standing
          9  between the seats, I looked to the back of the bus and
         10  on the front door there were these two men, these
         11  uniformed people, and Deronjic was amongst them, two at
         12  the front and two at the back.  And then I was
         13  wondering where this bus was going to go, and I
         14  thought, if it starts for Kravica, then that would be
         15  the end of it.  But the bus moved towards Drinjaca.
         16            It wasn't a long ride.  The bus stopped once
         17  again.  And they put on the music in the bus louder,
         18  and when the bus stopped he told us to get out.  We got
         19  out of the bus --
         20       Q.   Let me stop you there for a second.  Can you
         21  tell me -- I want to go back to the house where you
         22  were being beaten right before you got onto the bus.
         23  What were the people wearing that were beating you in
         24  that house?  What kind of uniforms?
         25       A.   They had camouflage military uniforms,

          1  trousers and the kinds of shirts they wear, and they
          2  had rifles with a folding butt, automatic weapons.
          3       Q.   I think you mentioned, or it was at least
          4  translated as a baton.  Do you remember being hit by
          5  anything that was like a baton, the kind that police
          6  carry, or was it just rifles?
          7       A.   Well, they beat us with anything they could.
          8  He got hold of my hair and threw me down on the
          9  ground.  My worst moment was when he stepped on my head
         10  in his army boots and pressed me down against the
         11  concrete.  They beat us with all kinds of things.
         12       Q.   Can you recall seeing any baton, a billy
         13  club, a stick, anything like that?
         14       A.   Yes.  Yes.  The one with the moustache would
         15  come from time to time and I think he would go down
         16  there, underneath the warehouse, which is where there
         17  was a cellar of some kind, the cellar to this
         18  agricultural warehouse.  He went down there.  And I
         19  think that the people's clothes had been down there,
         20  people who had undressed.  They asked for our
         21  valuables, for our money, asked who had taken our
         22  money.  So this man with a moustache would come from
         23  time to time.  He would go downstairs and then come up
         24  again.
         25       Q.   I just want to identify, if I could, what

          1  kind of implements you were hit with.  Did you see a
          2  stick or was it just rifles, or could you tell?
          3       A.   I saw the stick when he was carrying it.  It
          4  was about 60 or 70 centimetres long.  I think it was
          5  wooden.  But they beat me most with rifle butts and the
          6  barrel, against my back, my head, and the spine.
          7       Q.   When you got on the bus, how many Serb
          8  soldiers were on the bus?
          9       A.   Four.
         10       Q.   What were they wearing?
         11       A.   The same soldiers who were beating us, they
         12  were the same ones.  On the front door was the one I
         13  knew, and another one, and the other two, the one with
         14  the moustache and another one, were at the back door.
         15       Q.   Do you recall if any of those four soldiers
         16  were armed with weapons while they were on the bus?
         17       A.   Yes, they all had automatic rifles, with a
         18  folding or collapsible butt.
         19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  All right.  If we could
         20  direct the witness to Exhibit 176, which may be up
         21  there already.
         22       Q.   Now, if you could just take a look at that.
         23  Do you recall looking at this map last night and
         24  pointing out to a little area where the bus stopped,
         25  and do you see that area marked on this map that you

          1  pointed to last night?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Could you point out the little area where the
          4  bus stopped now with the pointer?
          5       A.   It is this yellow dot [indicates], on a large
          6  bend.  To the right there's a river and to the left
          7  there's a parking area for one bus.  But he stopped
          8  where there was a widening of the road.  He crossed
          9  over to the other side of the road, and we got off
         10  then.  And they lined us up next to the road and I was
         11  thinking of jumping over the fence of the road, but
         12  (redacted)
         13  the moustache said, "No, not there.  Let them come down
         14  to the river."  Then they told us to cross over --
         15       Q.   Sorry, I just signalled for you to stop for a
         16  moment.  Can you tell us how many Muslims got off that
         17  bus and were lined up there along the road, how many in
         18  number?
         19       A.   There were the 12 and us four, which makes it
         20  16, and two of them stayed behind in the house and
         21  nothing is known about what happened to them.
         22       Q.   Including that person you described as a
         23  15-year-old boy, he was with you outside the bus.
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   How many of the armed Serb soldiers were with

          1  you outside that bus?
          2       A.   In front of the bus or in the bus?
          3       Q.   Well, how many came to this spot with you?
          4  How many Serb soldiers came with you?  I know four came
          5  with the bus.  Any more than those four?
          6       A.   No, no more.  Just the four of them.  And the
          7  bus just stopped, we got off, the bus moved forward,
          8  and I think that it later went back.  It stopped just
          9  for a moment for us to get off.
         10       Q.   Then tell us what happened to you and the
         11  group.
         12       A.   As I said, they lined us up against this
         13  fence, but (redacted), the man with the moustache, said, "Not
         14  there.  Let them come down."  There was grass next to
         15  the road.  We went downhill for some 15 or 20 metres,
         16  and then they lined us up alongside the river, and he
         17  told us that we should get to the river.  I was
         18  somewhere in the middle of that line, so I was third in
         19  line towards the Jadar River.  When we got there, we
         20  were lined up against the river bank.  I was third from
         21  the left.  To my left was the man I knew; behind me, I
         22  don't know how far, there was another one, two others
         23  at the other side.  And we waited for our lives to end
         24  there, and we expected -- there was half a minute or a
         25  minute of silence, and just then the images of my

          1  children appeared in my mind and I thought I was done
          2  for.
          3            However, the man who was standing in front of
          4  me, he was hit here [indicates].  I saw the bullet pass
          5  through his shirt.  I expected the shot to hit me.  It
          6  hit me on the left hip and I threw myself into the
          7  river.  I was wearing a leather jacket.  My face was in
          8  the water, and I held my breath for as long as I
          9  could.  I raised my head a little to catch some
         10  breath.  He noticed me raising my head, and I felt the
         11  bullets whizzing around my head.  I ducked under the
         12  water again.  And then I got hold of a rock in the
         13  water with my hand, and unnoticed I turned my head to
         14  the left to catch some breath, and with my right hand I
         15  pulled myself to the centre of the river.
         16            I was wearing this leather jacket.  It was
         17  blown up.  And he perhaps didn't notice that I was
         18  turning around, though I did it as indiscernibly as I
         19  could.  And then the current started carrying me down
         20  river, I let go and then I hit my head against a rock.
         21  Then I turned on my back and they saw that I had
         22  turned.  They opened bursts of fire on me.  I didn't
         23  believe I hadn't been hit.  I just spread out my arms
         24  and let the current carry me.  And they couldn't follow
         25  me any more because there was a small canyon, a

          1  hillside and a road and a concrete embankment.  I
          2  thought I was dead.
          3            Again I raised my head and I saw them going
          4  back to the road.  Later I got hold of a rock.  I stood
          5  on it, I looked over my body to see whether there were
          6  any wounds in my stomach.  I knew that I had been hit
          7  on the left side.  I went out of the river, crossed the
          8  meadow, reached a water tank.  I was terribly thirsty.
          9  On this tank there was a tap, and I went round this
         10  reservoir; there was no water.  I had a big wound, so I
         11  tore up my shirt to be able to dress the wound but I
         12  couldn't.
         13            I dragged myself up higher, and there was a
         14  meadow there.  And I saw a rather large building and I
         15  wondered what that could be.  Before the war I knew
         16  there was a kind of TO barracks there of the former
         17  Yugoslavia, and looking through the woods I saw a
         18  monument.  There used to be an old mosque there.  And I
         19  spent two and a half hours there drying my clothes and
         20  thinking what I should do.  I was bleeding heavily.  I
         21  tried to move but it was difficult.  And I was lucky
         22  that my bones were not fractured.  So I broke off a
         23  wooden stick, put on my clothes, and continued uphill,
         24  partly through the meadows, partly through the woods --
         25       Q.   Excuse me, Witness S.  Let me interrupt you

          1  to go back and clarify a couple of things.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness
          3  Exhibit 182.
          4       Q.   Witness S, were you able to find the river
          5  bank with Mr. Ruez this summer and actually show him
          6  the spot where you believed this to have occurred?
          7       A.   We found -- though at first we couldn't find
          8  it, and then they told me it was lower down.  I told
          9  them, it can't be lower down because the tank is on the
         10  other side.  We have to find it.  And from that spot
         11  you can see the bend in the direction of Drinjaca.  We
         12  went down to the river.  They said, "It must be here."
         13  I said, "It can't be there."  And then I recognised the
         14  path we took going down.  But there is no widening of
         15  the road there.  We saw a tree had fallen.  Nobody
         16  could have cut it, just its branches had been cut.  So
         17  when the water is high, it carries away whatever there
         18  is.  So I think it must be here [indicates].  And from
         19  the other side of the road we saw that some water was
         20  coming through.  There are two big rocks which I
         21  recognised very well because I hit my head against one
         22  of them.
         23       Q.   All right.
         24            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, the witness
         25  has pointed to the general rocky area by the bank of

          1  the river as the place he recalls this execution taking
          2  place.
          3            Could we also show the witness Exhibit 183,
          4  and I'm hoping we have a colour shot of that for the
          5  ELMO.
          6       Q.   Now, you mentioned that you were wounded in
          7  the side; is that right?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   And you bear the marks of those gunshots
         10  today, do you not?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   You were shot in the back by the troops, were
         13  you not, the back and in the side?
         14       A.   He hit me in my hip from behind, and the
         15  bullet passed right next to the bone and it cut through
         16  some tendons, so I couldn't walk properly.
         17       Q.   We took a Polaroid photo of you today.  I
         18  think that's upside down.  Yes.  Can you show us the
         19  entry wound, point that out for us?  I know this isn't
         20  the best photograph.
         21       A.   This is the entry wound.  It was much larger
         22  here [indicates], the exit wound.  And when I was
         23  bandaging it, my whole fist could go inside.  And my
         24  veins could be seen, the ligaments.  And I thought to
         25  myself if the bone had been fractured, then I won't be

          1  able to get anywhere.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, he pointed to
          3  a small area to the right side of the picture of a scar
          4  that he referred to as the entry wound, and then on the
          5  left side of the picture, a much larger scarred area
          6  that's been referred to as the exit wound.
          7       Q.   Witness S, in order to give you a chance so
          8  you can finish up today, I know that there's more to
          9  this story and that you survived a difficult hike
         10  through the woods and weren't able to get out to Nezuk
         11  until the 16th of July.  But at this point I'm going to
         12  stop my questions so the Defence counsel can ask
         13  questions, and then of course the Judge will ask
         14  questions.
         15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I have no further questions
         16  at this time, Your Honour.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. McCloskey.
         18            Mr. Petrusic, would you like to start and
         19  then we can see if you can finish, or you can continue
         20  tomorrow.  You decide.
         21            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I shall try,
         22  Mr. President, to finish today, bearing in mind what I
         23  have already notified you about, the medical treatment
         24  for General Krstic, but in any event to spare the
         25  witness coming into the courtroom again.
          1                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
          2       Q.   First of all, good afternoon, Witness S.
          3  Because of the protective measures, I can't address you
          4  by name.
          5       A.   I understand that.
          6  (redacted)
          7  (redacted)
          8  (redacted)
          9  (redacted)
         10  (redacted)
         11  (redacted)
         12       Q.   So you had both professional and private
         13  contacts with Serbs before the outbreak of hostilities,
         14  or rather the conflict in the municipality?
         15       A.   Yes, very good relations.
         16       Q.   Can you tell us something about those
         17  relationships, from your own personal experience?
         18       A.   I don't know which friends you're referring
         19  to, my friends or Serbs as a whole?
         20       Q.   I'm talking about --
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Excuse me, Your Honour.  I'm
         22  sorry to interrupt.  If you can let the witness know
         23  about being too particular about friends and things,
         24  because otherwise it will identify him.
         25            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, my

          1  learned friend.  My question referred to very general
          2  relationships, no specific relations between the
          3  witness and his friends and acquaintances.
          4       A.   I had very good relations with certain
          5  individuals and with my neighbours.  We hear one
          6  another even today, with some of them.  But there are
          7  others whom I knew very well as a child.  I better not
          8  talk about any details, how we knew each other.  If we
          9  go into closed session, I could tell you about that.
         10       Q.   Witness S, can it be said that those
         11  relations at the global level between Serbs and Muslims
         12  in the area, until the outbreak of hostilities, were
         13  correct?
         14       A.   Well, until up to a year before the actual
         15  beginning of the war, I did have good relations.  But
         16  many friends surprised me who used to be on very good
         17  terms with me.
         18       Q.   So the cooling of relations on both sides
         19  occurred, as you say, about a year prior to the
         20  beginning of the war.
         21       A.   As I say, a year before the war.  Though I
         22  still have friends that I communicate with, but after
         23  everything I've gone through, how can you trust them,
         24  and who can you trust?  Just imagine a situation when
         25  you meet a man in the street every day, you say hello

          1  to him, and at the end he kills you just because you
          2  have a Muslim name.  Is that the deign of a human
          3  being?  I can understand some things, but some things I
          4  simply cannot.  If I had been an important man, I might
          5  understand it.  But for an ordinary citizen, with a
          6  secondary school education, I think there's absolutely
          7  no explanation.
          8       Q.   In Srebrenica, or rather the protected area
          9  of Srebrenica, was there any armed formation?
         10       A.   There was the Territorial Defence, and
         11  UNPROFOR -- there were people who had organised
         12  themselves in all the villages until UNPROFOR arrived.
         13  After UNPROFOR arrived, I don't know any more, I don't
         14  know that anything existed, but maybe -- there probably
         15  was but I'm not familiar.  I was no longer in the
         16  Territorial Defence.  I was in civilian.  I engaged in
         17  various business activities.
         18       Q.   Are you aware of the column that was formed
         19  in Susnjari?  And who led that column?
         20       A.   What do you mean who led it?  Let me tell
         21  you, it was a situation where people had no choice.
         22  You have death on one side and on the other.  And there
         23  was no organisation, it was just an attempt to save
         24  one's life, if possible.
         25       Q.   You said that a part of the column was armed

          1  with some kind of weapons.
          2       A.   They weren't really properly armed.  They
          3  were just people who had weapons from before the war
          4  and those that found them during the war.  You know
          5  very well that we had conflicts with the Serbs over
          6  Srebrenica before UNPROFOR arrived.  We know very well
          7  what happened in Bratunac.  And what should we have
          8  done?  To wait for the same fate to befall us as in
          9  Bratunac, close the stadium and then call out people --
         10       Q.   Excuse me, Witness.  That part of the column,
         11  did it have a military leader?
         12       A.   Believe me, I am not aware of that.  I was a
         13  civilian.  I can't say what I don't know, but whatever
         14  I do know I will tell.
         15       Q.   When you were interviewed by these four
         16  officers, that conversation or interrogation, was it
         17  conducted in a correct manner?
         18       A.   On their part, yes.  While we were there,
         19  nobody beat us or touched us.  They gave us something
         20  to eat and to drink.  I told you what happened at the
         21  end.
         22       Q.   I really don't want to remind you about
         23  that.  Somebody mentioned that you should have been
         24  exchanged.
         25       A.   Yes.  This young man of about 18 or 20, he
          1  was very young, he had short blue pants on, a belt, and
          2  a pistol in a leather holster, a blue T-shirt, a beret,
          3  and he said that to this man that I said I knew, and
          4  after all that they gave each other a hug and went out
          5  in front of the warehouse where we were.
          6       Q.   Do you believe that somebody prevented him
          7  from carrying out this idea of an exchange?
          8       A.   You mean somebody who would not allow us to
          9  be exchanged?  I really don't think that he had the
         10  power to do anything, in view of the other people I
         11  saw.  He was a young man of 18 or 20.  That is my
         12  opinion.
         13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         14  I have no further questions.
         15            Witness S, thank you.
         16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you too.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Petrusic, thank you very
         18  much.
         19            Mr. McCloskey, would you like to respond?
         20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Just one question.
         21                 Re-examined by Mr. McCloskey:
         22       Q.   Could you tell us what time the execution
         23  occurred by the banks of the Jadar River?
         24       A.   It was in the morning, between 9.00 and 11.00
         25  or 12.00.  I don't know exactly because when this was
          1  happening to me, when I got out near the reservoir, my
          2  watch had stopped.  Maybe it had stopped while I was
          3  being beaten.  But anyway, it all happened before
          4  noon.
          5       Q.   On July 13th.
          6       A.   Yes.  Yes.
          7            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If we could go into private
          8  session for one last question, for the same reason
          9  we've been going into private session, Your Honour.

          3                 [Open session]
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  We are in open session now.
          5                 Questioned by the Court:
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Witness S, I would like to ask
          7  you one question which you passed quickly.  You said
          8  when you were interrogated by these four men in
          9  uniform, the policemen, you saw 12 buses coming with
         10  the women and children.  What happened to these 12
         11  buses?  Do you have an idea of where they took them?
         12       A.   At that time those policemen who were wearing
         13  blue camouflage uniforms were not questioning us.  But
         14  the four men who I assume were officers, military
         15  officers, they gave us to eat and then they told us,
         16  "Turn around to face the road."  We did and we saw
         17  these buses.  They were not overcrowded, there were as
         18  many people as there were seats, and they told us, as I
         19  have already said, "You see how we treat your people
         20  properly."  And those buses went off towards Milici,
         21  Vlasenica, and on from there.  We just saw them for a
         22  moment because we had to turn back to face them.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  So you don't know what happened
         24  to the buses, or to the people inside the buses.
         25       A.   No.  No.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  What about these military people
          2  who were questioning you?  Did you notice any insignia
          3  on their clothes, what division they belonged to?
          4       A.   They didn't have any insignia.  There was
          5  something in me, there was hope in me that I would
          6  survive all that, I had some strength of some sorts.
          7  But I didn't notice any insignia because their sleeves
          8  were rolled up, and one had even buttoned his sleeve up
          9  there.  So there were no ranks or anything on their
         10  chests, around the pockets or on the sleeves, as far as
         11  I could see.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, apart from the questions
         13  that were asked of you, would you like to add
         14  anything?  Is there something you would like to say
         15  independently?
         16            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Regarding
         17  everything, or regarding just my statement and my own
         18  experiences?
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Regarding everything, and your
         20  experience.  It has to be relevant to what's happening
         21  in your part of the world.
         22            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Well, I think
         23  after all this, the most important thing is that I have
         24  survived, though my health is poor.  I have come here
         25  to tell the truth, and I thank the attorneys of the

          1  accused who treated me correctly, and everyone else.  I
          2  would like to appeal to this Tribunal, if it can, to
          3  bring the people who did this to me so that I can look
          4  them in the face and we can clear everything up, and
          5  for Attorney Petrusic to be there too so I can tell him
          6  how this could have happened.  When you meet somebody
          7  in the street every day and say hello and then he turns
          8  around and kills you, it's something I find
          9  incomprehensible.  And I think friendship with those
         10  people who did this to me is over forever.  That's as
         11  much as I have to say.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much, Witness S.
         13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you too,
         14  Your Honour.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  And now you can be taken out.
         16            Mr. McCloskey.
         17            MR. McCLOSKEY:  We do have some exhibits,
         18  Your Honour.  We want to tender them.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  You want to tender some
         20  exhibits?
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, I'd like to tender some
         22  exhibits.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  But you know that the accused
         24  has to leave.  Shall we allow him to leave and we
         25  continue?

          1            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If the Defence has no
          2  objection, yes.  This shouldn't be a problem.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  So we'll ask for the
          4  accused to be taken away.
          5                 [The accused withdraws]
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. McCloskey, you want a closed
          7  session or an open session?
          8            MR. McCLOSKEY:  No, an open session.  No
          9  problem.  They are Exhibits 176, 177, 178, 182, and
         10  183.  I can describe them if counsel wishes but ...
         11            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] We have no
         12  objection to the documents tendered.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.  So please
         14  tender them in.
         15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you.  I would tender
         16  those, then.  Thank you.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Petrusic, do you have any
         18  exhibits to tender?
         19            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Not in
         20  relation to this witness, Your Honour.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.  I'd like
         22  to thank both the Prosecutor and the Defence counsel
         23  for this prompt day, trial day.
         24            We will resume tomorrow at 9.30.
         25                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at

          1                 2.18 p.m., to be reconvened on
