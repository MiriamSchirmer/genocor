         22            Mr. Harmon, the witness is yours.
         23            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  Good morning, Judge Riad,
         24  Judge Wald.  Good morning to my colleagues for the
         25  Defence.

          1                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          2       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Erdemovic.
          3       A.   Good morning.
          4       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, I'm going to be asking you a
          5  number of questions on direct examination, and
          6  following my examination you'll be asked questions by
          7  my colleagues from the Defence, and following their
          8  questions I'll ask you questions once again, and then
          9  the Judges will have an opportunity to ask you
         10  questions.
         11            Let me start, Mr. Erdemovic, by asking you
         12  how old you are.
         13       A.   I'm 28 and a half.
         14       Q.   Where were you born?
         15       A.   In Tuzla, a town called Tuzla.
         16       Q.   What is your ethnicity?
         17       A.   Croat, Bosnian Croat.
         18       Q.   Could you tell us about your educational
         19  background.
         20       A.   I went to a school for mechanical
         21  technicians.  I'm a locksmith.
         22       Q.   Before the war, then, you were a locksmith;
         23  is that correct?
         24       A.   Yes, but I hadn't been working yet.
         25       Q.   Now, I want to go into your history before

          1  this Tribunal.  I don't want to go into all of the
          2  complex litigation that surrounded your case, but on
          3  the 14th of January, 1998, did you enter a guilty plea
          4  to one count of a violation of our Article 3, which was
          5  a violation of the laws and customs of war,
          6  specifically murder?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   Was that guilty plea pursuant to a plea
          9  agreement that was entered into between yourself and
         10  your counsel and representatives of the Office of the
         11  Prosecutor?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Now, the underlying facts that supported your
         14  guilty plea was that you and members of your unit,
         15  along with soldiers from another unit of the Bosnian
         16  Serb army, did shoot and kill and did participate in
         17  the execution of unarmed Muslim men at the Branjevo
         18  Military Farm on the 16th of July, 1995; is that
         19  correct?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   On the 5th of March, 1998, were you sentenced
         22  by a Trial Chamber of this Tribunal to serve a term of
         23  five years' imprisonment?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Were you given credit for all of the time

          1  that you had been in custody, that is, from the time of
          2  March 28th, 1996 until the date of your judgement, your
          3  sentencing?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Have you now completed your term of
          6  imprisonment?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   You are testifying today freely and
          9  voluntarily; is that correct?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Judge Wald, I
         12  would ask the Court to take judicial notice of its own
         13  records in this proceeding.  There is an indictment and
         14  a sentencing judgement.  I've had an opportunity to
         15  talk to my colleagues from the Defence and we discussed
         16  the issue of judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 94, and
         17  they have no objection to Your Honours taking such
         18  notice.
         19       Q.   Now, Mr. Erdemovic, I'd like to focus your
         20  attention on your own military background in the
         21  various armies that were in the former Yugoslavia.
         22            First of all, let me begin by asking you, did
         23  you serve in the JNA?
         24       A.   I did.
         25       Q.   How long of a period of time were you in the

          1  JNA?
          2       A.   I was in the JNA for a year as my regular
          3  service, and then another four months in reserve
          4  forces.
          5       Q.   When did you finally leave the JNA?
          6       A.   At the end of March 1992.
          7       Q.   After leaving the JNA, did you return to your
          8  home in the Tuzla area?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   After you were in Tuzla, were you again
         11  called up by the JNA and asked to serve in the JNA?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Did you serve in the JNA again or did you
         14  refuse?
         15       A.   I refused.  I returned my call-up papers and
         16  said that I had already spent enough time in the army.
         17       Q.   Did you at any point in time, then, serve in
         18  the Territorial Defence in your village?
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Describe the nature of that service.  What
         21  kind of service was that?
         22       A.   It was a service in our local community.  At
         23  night we would walk around the village and keep guard
         24  in our village.
         25       Q.   Now, did you eventually join the Armija, the

          1  army of the Bosnian Muslim government?
          2       A.   Yes.  I think it was in July 1992, I got a
          3  call-up to report to the barracks in Tuzla.
          4       Q.   Did you respond to that call-up?
          5       A.   I did.
          6       Q.   Did you serve in the Armija from July of 1992
          7  until approximately October of 1992?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Could you describe your duties and
         10  responsibilities while you were serving in the army.
         11       A.   I was a member of a reconnaissance unit on
         12  mortars.
         13       Q.   Where did you serve the majority of your
         14  time?
         15       A.   In a position above Gornja Tuzla or Upper
         16  Tuzla.
         17       Q.   Were you on the front lines most of the time?
         18       A.   Yes.  Yes, but as a reconnoitre.
         19       Q.   Now, when you came to the Tribunal initially
         20  and you had a conversation with an investigator from my
         21  office, Jean-Rene Ruez, did you tell him that you had
         22  served in the ABiH?
         23       A.   No.
         24       Q.   Subsequently, when you testified publicly
         25  under oath at the Rule 61 hearing in 1996, did you then

          1  testify about your service in the ABiH?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Now, later did you volunteer to serve in the
          4  HVO?
          5       A.   In the military police of the HVO, in the
          6  village next to mine.
          7       Q.   Why did you volunteer to serve in the HVO?
          8       A.   Because I got a position in the military
          9  police, and because I didn't want to be exposed to
         10  danger on the front.
         11       Q.   So had you become essentially tired of
         12  serving on the front lines and wanted to have a safer
         13  position?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   Now, did you serve in the HVO from October of
         16  1992 until November of 1993?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   While you were serving in the HVO, were you
         19  arrested?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Could you briefly explain to the Trial
         22  Chamber the circumstances of your arrest.
         23       A.   I was assisting civilians, Serbs from Tuzla,
         24  to cross into territory under the control of the army
         25  of Republika Srpska.  In the first attempt I was not

          1  arrested, but in the second attempt, with a larger
          2  group of civilians who were mostly women and children,
          3  I was arrested on Mount Majevica by an HVO
          4  communications unit.
          5       Q.   Were you put in custody as a result of that
          6  arrest?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   Ultimately were you released from custody,
          9  and did you return to the HVO military police to serve
         10  with them?
         11       A.   No.
         12       Q.   What happened then?
         13       A.   When they questioned me and when I told them
         14  everything, they beat me, mistreated me.  They demanded
         15  that I admit certain things that I did not know of,
         16  some other attempts of transporting Serbs.  I was
         17  questioned by the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their
         18  police, and after some time they turned me back to the
         19  HVO police, and I asked the head of the HVO police to
         20  let me go home to have a bath and change my uniform.
         21       Q.   What did you do then?
         22       A.   When the head of the military police released
         23  me I went home, and I met a neighbour, a Serb, who
         24  asked me whether I could help him to cross into the
         25  territory held by the Serbs.  I told him, "You know

          1  that I'm arrested, and if I'm arrested again I won't
          2  fare well."  He told me then, and my wife was with me
          3  at the time, that he would help me go to Switzerland
          4  because his sons are working in Switzerland and I
          5  wouldn't have to spend much time in Republika Srpska.
          6  After thinking it over, I agreed to that because I
          7  wanted to leave.
          8       Q.   Did you then leave to the Republika Srpska?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   When did you arrive in the Republika Srpska?
         11       A.   On the 3rd of November, 1993.
         12       Q.   What did you do then?
         13       A.   When I reached Serb territory I was
         14  questioned by the command, which was headquartered in
         15  Lopare, at the foot of Mount Majevica.  Regarding the
         16  group I had transferred, this group had told them that
         17  I had been correct towards the Serbs and that I was
         18  correct with everyone.  And after a day long of
         19  questioning, in the evening they told me that the next
         20  day I would be released, as well as my wife and those
         21  two other persons who were of Croat ethnicity and who
         22  were with me.
         23       Q.   If could you describe very briefly,
         24  Mr. Erdemovic, what you did from that point on until
         25  the point in time when you joined the army of the

          1  Republika Srpska.  I don't want to go into great
          2  detail, but could you just tell the Judges in outline
          3  form what you did, where you went, and how you ended up
          4  in the army of the Republika Srpska.
          5       A.   When I reached Bijeljina, I started having
          6  problems with paramilitary units, of which certain
          7  people from Tuzla were members, they were Serbs, and
          8  they mistreated me.  And this man who promised to help
          9  me go to Switzerland simply turned his back on me and
         10  my wife and said, "I can't help you."  I had no other
         11  choice.  But a Croat who was with me called up his
         12  relative who was living in the Federal Republic of
         13  Yugoslavia, in Titov Vrbas, and he came about a day
         14  later to Bijeljina to take us to Titov Vrbas.  I
         15  couldn't stay in Bijeljina at that time because they
         16  were threatening me.  They said I had to join a
         17  paramilitary unit or simply that I couldn't stay on, I
         18  would be killed.
         19            So my wife, the two Croats, and I, and this
         20  man who came to collect us from Titov Vrbas, we they
         21  went to Titov Vrbas to stay with him.  That was also in
         22  the month of November.  After that, I can't remember
         23  exactly, but I think we stayed in Titov Vrbas until
         24  January, my wife and I and these two Croats.  As we had
         25  no money, we simply couldn't stay with these people,

          1  enjoying their hospitality, as they too were not
          2  well-off.
          3            After a while, I think it was in January of
          4  1994, police raids started in Serbia, so people who
          5  were not from Serbia and who were from Bosnia had to go
          6  back to Bosnia.  So with my wife, I decided to go back
          7  to Republika Srpska, to stay with her uncle in
          8  Trebinje.  We called him up from Serbia and he told us
          9  to come.  He knew I was a Croat, and still he said that
         10  we could come.  When we reached Trebinje, at the border
         11  between Serbia and Republika Srpska, the police
         12  identified me by my ID card, and he said, "You're not a
         13  Serb.  Your name is not Serbian, nor is your father's
         14  name."  I said I wasn't a Serb but that I was a Croat,
         15  but my wife was a Serb.  They let us go and told me to
         16  report immediately to the police station in Foca.
         17            I didn't report immediately.  I went to my
         18  wife's uncle's with her.  I didn't report because I
         19  didn't know where the police station in Foca was.  It
         20  was my first time in Foca.  We went to a place close to
         21  Foca called Miljevina, where my wife's uncle was.  And
         22  the next day we went to the police station, and this
         23  man treated me very kindly, he wasn't arrogant or
         24  anything.  He said I couldn't stay in Foca because
         25  there were no Croats or Muslims there, that I should go

          1  back to Bijeljina.  Of course I had to tell him the
          2  whole story, how I got to Foca.  He said I had to go
          3  back to Bijeljina where I had crossed to leaving
          4  Tuzla.
          5            So I returned to Bijeljina.  This must have
          6  been the beginning of April.  In Bijeljina I met a
          7  friend of mine whom I knew from before, from Tuzla, he
          8  was a Serb, he was a nice man.  I even stayed with him
          9  for a while.  He was very kind.  I explained everything
         10  that had happened, where I had been and everything.  He
         11  told me I couldn't achieve any rights in Republika
         12  Srpska, I wouldn't even be able to move around without
         13  a permit if I was not in the army.  So I decided to
         14  report to the army.
         15            I went to the military department in
         16  Bijeljina.  I had to tell them again this whole story
         17  from the time I left Tuzla, and they told me that a
         18  unit had been formed consisting of Croats and Muslims
         19  who had crossed over from Tuzla to Bijeljina, and who
         20  had also been helping Serbs.  And when I asked them
         21  where this unit was, they told me it wasn't far from
         22  Bijeljina, a place called Dvorovi.  I went there and I
         23  recognised some Croats whom I had known from Tuzla,
         24  from before.  I spoke to them, and they told me that
         25  they would help me join this unit, and after a few

          1  days, I did in fact join the unit, which then was not
          2  called the 10th Sabotage Detachment but was a special
          3  unit of the army of Republika Srpska.
          4       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, when you joined this special
          5  detachment, how many men were in it?
          6       A.   Eight.
          7       Q.   Did this special unit evolve into the 10th
          8  Sabotage Detachment?
          9       A.   Yes, in October 1994.
         10       Q.   Could you tell the Judges what kind of unit
         11  was the 10th Sabotage Detachment.
         12       A.   It was a sabotage unit which would go into
         13  the rear of the enemy and blow up munition warehouses,
         14  artillery storages, and that sort of thing.  That is
         15  what we did behind the enemy lines.
         16       Q.   So you were an infiltration and sabotage
         17  unit.
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   Now, turning our attention to July of 1995,
         20  can you tell me approximately how many men were in the
         21  10th Sabotage Detachment?
         22       A.   Do you mean the whole detachment?
         23       Q.   Yes.
         24       A.   As far as I was able to assess, there could
         25  have been about 60 men.  I don't know the exact

          1  number.
          2       Q.   Now, was the 10th Sabotage Detachment
          3  subordinate to the Main Staff of the Bosnian Serb army?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Would you describe to the Judges the
          6  structure of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, how many
          7  platoons there were, where they were located?
          8       A.   There were two platoons; one was in Bijeljina
          9  and the other was in Vlasenica.
         10       Q.   Now, how large, how many men were in each of
         11  those respective platoons?
         12       A.   I think in Bijeljina there were about 30
         13  men.  I don't know about Vlasenica.  But perhaps a
         14  similar number, three or four or five men less,
         15  perhaps.
         16       Q.   Let's focus your attention on the Bijeljina
         17  platoon that was part of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.
         18  Of those approximately 30 men, how many of those men
         19  were involved in infiltration and sabotage activities,
         20  and how many of those 30 men were rear services people
         21  who would support your activities?
         22       A.   I think that in the infiltration and sabotage
         23  activities, there were about 22 men, roughly, I would
         24  say.  I don't know the exact number of course.
         25       Q.   Did the remaining men then participate in

          1  rear service activities, support activities?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Could you tell us who the commander of the
          4  Bijeljina platoon was?
          5       A.   It was Franc Kos.
          6       Q.   Did he have a nickname?
          7       A.   We called him Slovenac, the Slovene, or Zuco,
          8  we used to call him Zuco.
          9       Q.   Who was the commander of the Vlasenica
         10  platoon?
         11       A.   I only know that they called him Lule.  I
         12  don't know anything else.
         13       Q.   I'd like you to then identify some of the
         14  hierarchy of the 10th Sabotage Detachment as you knew
         15  it in July of 1995.  Could you please tell us, from the
         16  highest levels working down to the level of Franc Kos
         17  and Lule, what was the reporting chain of command?
         18       A.   As far as I know, in first place there was
         19  Colonel Salapura from the Main Staff, the intelligence
         20  centre, he was there from the beginning when there were
         21  eight of us, and later on as well.  Under him, I think
         22  I got to know in March 1995, Major Pecanac.  Underneath
         23  Pecanac, there was Milorad Pelemis; he was First
         24  Lieutenant.  Underneath Pelemis, there was Radoslav
         25  Kremenovic, who was a First Lieutenant who came to the

          1  unit in 1995; sometime in February, I don't know
          2  exactly.  Underneath Kremenovic, there was Slovenac in
          3  Bijeljina who was the platoon commander, and Lule in
          4  Vlasenica.
          5       Q.   Thank you.  Now, you participated in some
          6  sabotage and infiltration activities, as did other
          7  members of your unit.  When your unit travelled to an
          8  area in the Republika Srpska that was under the command
          9  of, say, the Drina Corps or a brigade, what was the
         10  procedure, if any, to notify the other members of the
         11  VRS that you were going to be operating in and out of
         12  their territory?  Could you tell the Judges, please.
         13       A.   I know for certain what the situation was
         14  like at Mount Majevica, and that was the zone of
         15  responsibility of the Majevica Brigade.  Before we
         16  would start out from Bijeljina, the commander, or
         17  leader, would have to inform the command which was in
         18  that area of responsibility that we were coming, and
         19  what time we would be coming.  I don't know that -- I
         20  know that they didn't speak of the actual operations
         21  that would take place in that territory, and when I say
         22  "The zone of responsibility," it is a broader area.
         23  So they would be informed of our arrival and that we
         24  would have to undertake operations in that zone of
         25  responsibility.  They didn't actually say what

          1  operations we would be undertaking, but we had to
          2  inform them because otherwise we could not pass into
          3  their zone of responsibility and move around if the
          4  command had not been informed.
          5       Q.   So informing them was, in part, to ensure
          6  your own safety; is that correct?
          7       A.   Yes, both our safety and theirs.
          8       Q.   Now, when you conducted these operations,
          9  these sabotage and infiltration operations, normally
         10  did you conduct them with members of your unit alone,
         11  or were they joint operations?  When I say "joint
         12  operations," Mr. Erdemovic, I'm talking about
         13  operations with members of, say, a brigade or another
         14  company?  What was the routine, the normal
         15  modis operandi?
         16       A.   In the areas where we knew for certain where
         17  we were supposed to pass and what we were supposed to
         18  do, we worked alone.  But there were operations, for
         19  example, when we entered through an underground pit
         20  between Bratunac and Srebrenica, then we were led by a
         21  group which was from Bratunac because we didn't know
         22  this mine very well, and there were several corridors
         23  and we might have lost our way had we done it alone.
         24       Q.   In the operation that you just testified
         25  about, when members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment

          1  went into a mine, because they were unfamiliar with the
          2  various tunnels, they received assistance from people
          3  from the brigade who had been miners and were familiar
          4  with the mine routes; is that correct?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   But other than give you guidance in the
          7  mines, those people didn't participate in the
          8  operation; is that correct?
          9       A.   That's correct.
         10       Q.   Now, I want to focus your attention now to
         11  the attack on Srebrenica itself that took place in July
         12  of 1995, and, particularly, I want to focus your
         13  attention on the role of the 10th Sabotage Detachment
         14  in that attack.
         15            Could you tell the Judges on what date your
         16  unit, the 10th Sabotage Detachment, deployed to the
         17  area of Srebrenica?
         18       A.   On the 10th of July, 1995.
         19       Q.   And --
         20       A.   In the evening hours.
         21       Q.   From whom did you receive your deployment
         22  orders?
         23       A.   In the morning we received orders from the
         24  commander of the platoon, Franc Kos, in Bijeljina, that
         25  we should prepare to move into action.

          1       Q.   Then you arrived on the night of the 10th, is
          2  that correct, in the Srebrenica area.
          3       A.   Yes.  Yes, but we weren't told beforehand
          4  where we would be going until we actually got there.
          5       Q.   How many members of your platoon were
          6  deployed to the area of Srebrenica to participate in
          7  the assault on Srebrenica?
          8       A.   I think between 15 and 20.  I'm not quite
          9  sure of the exact number.  That's what I think.
         10       Q.   Did you, in fact, commence an assault on
         11  Srebrenica on the 11th of July?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Did you receive any special instructions
         14  prior to the assault from any of your superior
         15  officers?
         16       A.   Yes.  In the morning of the 11th, Pelemis
         17  came and told us that in no case should be fire at
         18  civilians and that we should send the civilians off to
         19  the football stadium at Srebrenica.  He told us on the
         20  occasion that the resistance would probably be strong
         21  and that at the first mosque would be the first
         22  resistance, that is to say, at the entrance into town.
         23       Q.   Now, when you participated in the assault,
         24  did you do this only with members of your unit, the
         25  10th Sabotage Detachment, or did you participate in the

          1  operation with a unit that was part of the Drina Corps?
          2       A.   Pelemis said that we would be joined by some
          3  15 men, I think about 15 men, from the Drina Wolves.
          4       Q.   Did you know the Drina Wolves were part of
          5  the Drina Corps?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   Now, you told us earlier in your testimony
          8  that normally the 10th Sabotage Detachment operated
          9  exclusively with its own men.  On this occasion, on the
         10  assault on Srebrenica, you're telling us that you
         11  worked with another unit, part of the Drina Corps.  Is
         12  that correct?
         13       A.   Yes.  And this seemed to us to be a little
         14  unusual because we were used to working on our own.
         15  But another thing that seemed strange to me and unusual
         16  was that we were not a unit to take control of the
         17  town.  We were intended for sabotage operations.
         18       Q.   So your normal mission for your unit had
         19  changed from sabotage to one of being part of the
         20  invading or the assaulting force; is that correct?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   Now, what was the objective of your group's
         23  operation?  Were you informed of what your objective
         24  was and what the Drina Wolves, who were working with
         25  you, what was their objective?

          1       A.   Pelemis told us that it was our objective to
          2  enter the town first with these people, and when he
          3  told us that he said that, "On your left-hand side," I
          4  can't quite remember who would be on the left and
          5  right, but I know that he mentioned Sekovici, Bratunac,
          6  Milici, Vlasenica, so that once we descend into town
          7  they would descend too from the surrounding hills.
          8       Q.   When you say Sekovici, Vlasenica, Milici, and
          9  Bratunac, are you referring to the brigades from
         10  Sekovici, Vlasenica, Milici, and Bratunac?
         11       A.   He said units.  He didn't use the word
         12  brigade.
         13       Q.   So units from those --
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   -- I take it units from those brigades would
         16  follow your penetration into Srebrenica, and after
         17  there had been penetration by your group and the Drina
         18  Wolves, then the brigade groups would follow; is that
         19  how I understand your testimony?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Who was the commander, to your knowledge, of
         22  the Drina Wolves?
         23       A.   I just know that his nickname was Legenda,
         24  legend.
         25       Q.   Who was the leader of the group of the 10th

          1  Sabotage Detachment that went with you in the direction
          2  of Srebrenica?  Was it Lieutenant Pelemis?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   To your knowledge, did Legenda also
          5  participate in the assault on Srebrenica?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   To your knowledge, did he and Lieutenant
          8  Pelemis communicate in order to coordinate their
          9  efforts?
         10       A.   Yes, because at one point Pelemis, that is to
         11  say, Legenda was to our left -- on raised ground to our
         12  left.  At one moment Pelemis told us that we should set
         13  fire to the first thing next to us.  For the artillery,
         14  the tank, and heavy machine-guns, to shoot at the
         15  surrounding hills and not at us, so that they could
         16  know the point where we had reached.
         17            MR. HARMON:  If I could have the assistance
         18  of the usher, and if the usher could place on the ELMO
         19  for the witness Prosecutor's Exhibit 4A, which is a
         20  map.
         21            I'm not getting the image on my monitor.  I
         22  don't know if Your Honours are getting the image.  It
         23  appears that the ELMO is not working, and we're going
         24  to need the ELMO throughout the testimony of
         25  Mr. Erdemovic.  Perhaps we can have the assistance of

          1  the technical people to see if this monitor could be
          2  made functional today.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  It's being taken care of.
          4            MR. HARMON:  It is?  Okay.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Harmon, could you proceed
          6  with your questioning in the meantime?
          7            MR. HARMON:  I'm going to quickly start to
          8  get to the point where he's going to need some exhibits
          9  to illustrate his testimony.
         10       Q.   I'll ask you some questions.  Mr. Erdemovic,
         11  let me ask you, you had been informed by Lieutenant
         12  Pelemis that your group and the Drina Wolves could
         13  anticipate heavy resistance.  Did you, in fact, get
         14  heavy resistance?
         15       A.   No.
         16       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges the manner in
         17  which your group divided?  How many different groups of
         18  10th Sabotage and Drina Wolves were there that advanced
         19  onto Srebrenica?
         20       A.   There were four groups in our detachment.
         21  The Drina Wolves, I don't know.
         22       Q.   All right.  But your group, consisting of
         23  Drina Wolves and 10th Sabotage Detachment soldiers,
         24  divided into four groups and advanced in the direction
         25  of the town of Srebrenica; is that correct?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Now, I had asked that Prosecutor's Exhibit
          3  4A, which is a map, be placed on the ELMO because I
          4  wanted you to illustrate and inform the Judges the
          5  direction in which you approached Srebrenica.  Without
          6  that map, perhaps you can just describe, did you
          7  approach the town of Srebrenica from the south of the
          8  town?
          9            MR. HARMON:  Oh, here it's working finally.
         10  Now, if we could have that so the town of Srebrenica is
         11  shown on the ELMO.  There we go.  Move it up a little,
         12  please.  That's fine right there.
         13       Q.   Now, using the pointer, Mr. Erdemovic, could
         14  you illustrate to the Judges the direction which your
         15  four groups took in the assault on Srebrenica?
         16       A.   This direction here [indicates], towards the
         17  centre of town.
         18            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record,
         19  Mr. Erdemovic placed the pointer initially at the
         20  juncture of the hairpin turn and moved it toward the
         21  top of the exhibit, in the direction of Srebrenica.
         22       Q.   So you moved from the south of the town,
         23  toward the centre of town; is that correct?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have

          1  Prosecutor's Exhibit 4/4 placed on the ELMO.
          2       Q.   Did you, in fact, Mr. Erdemovic, reach the
          3  centre of town?
          4       A.   I don't know for sure whether it was the
          5  centre of town, but that's what I assumed at the time.
          6       Q.   Let me show you Prosecutor's Exhibit 4/4, and
          7  this is a photograph of part of the town of
          8  Srebrenica.  Is this the location that you considered
          9  or thought was the centre of town?
         10       A.   Yes, here [indicates], that is the location.
         11       Q.   Was there a mosque in the general vicinity
         12  where you have just pointed?
         13       A.   Yes, here [indicates].
         14            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, it
         15  looks like a platform with a circle in the middle of it
         16  that is directly located in the centre of the picture.
         17       Q.   Was that mosque that you observed on the
         18  morning of -- on the 11th of July, was it intact?  Was
         19  it standing?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   When you entered the town, had you passed
         22  another mosque?
         23       A.   Yes, at the beginning, when we moved off.  It
         24  wasn't far from the beginning.
         25       Q.   Was that mosque standing as well?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Now, when you arrived in the location that
          3  you've pointed on Prosecutor's Exhibit 4/4, could you
          4  tell the Judges what happened?
          5       A.   When we arrived there, a civilian, wearing
          6  civilian clothing, surrendered and said, "I was never
          7  in the army."  He was about 30 years old, tall; he
          8  wasn't fat, as far as I could see, he was thin.
          9       Q.   To whom had he surrendered?
         10       A.   Because we were the first to descend into
         11  town, he surrendered to us.
         12       Q.   Now, did it appear to you that -- other than
         13  that one individual that you saw, was the town
         14  abandoned?
         15       A.   Yes.  But we called people to come out of
         16  their houses and to move in front of us, towards the
         17  stadium.  People did come out, I don't know how many,
         18  but most of them were elderly people who found it
         19  difficult to walk.
         20       Q.   Now, let's continue focusing on this young
         21  man who had surrendered.  What happened to him?
         22       A.   Later on, when we had already got there, the
         23  units descended from the surrounding hills and one
         24  particular group started to mistreat that young man, to
         25  beat him with rifles, with their fists, kick him and so

          1  on.  And after that, perhaps a minute or two after all
          2  of that abuse, Pelemis ordered one of the soldiers to
          3  go and slit that man's throat.
          4       Q.   Did, in fact -- first of all, can you
          5  identify the man who was ordered to go slit the
          6  captive's throat?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   What was his name?
          9       A.   Zoran.  Zoran, nicknamed Maljic, from
         10  Vlasenica.  I don't know his family name.
         11       Q.   Did Zoran follow the order of Lieutenant
         12  Pelemis and slit this young man's throat?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   Did you see that?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   Can you use the pointer, please, again
         17  referring to Prosecutor's Exhibit 4/4, and point where
         18  in this picture the execution occurred?
         19       A.   Here [indicates], in between these two
         20  buildings here [indicates].
         21            MR. HARMON:  Indicating two buildings that
         22  are on the left-hand side of the exhibit, slightly
         23  above a curve in the road that appears in the centre of
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibit 4/4.
         25       Q.   All right.  That's fine.  Thank you,

          1  Mr. Erdemovic.
          2            Now, what happened?  Did that man's body
          3  remain in the location where it had dropped?
          4       A.   Yes.  It remained there on the pavement.
          5            MR. HARMON:  Now, I'm going to ask the usher
          6  to please bring two exhibits: Prosecutor's Exhibit
          7  28/17 and Prosecutor's Exhibit 147.
          8       Q.   Do you know why Lieutenant Pelemis gave the
          9  order to Maljic to kill this man, particularly since he
         10  had earlier given an order that no civilians were to be
         11  hurt?
         12       A.   I really don't know why but I think it was
         13  because he was -- because he was fit for military
         14  service.  That's what I think, but I don't know
         15  exactly.  I'm not aware of the actual reason.  It
         16  looked a little strange, particularly in view of the
         17  fact that he had told us not to touch anybody, and
         18  after having said that he ordered us to slit this man's
         19  throat.
         20       Q.   All right.  We're going to start with one
         21  exhibit.  I'm still waiting for another exhibit.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, could you place that
         23  on the ELMO, please.
         24       Q.   Let me ask you, this photograph has two
         25  individuals marked, one with the number 1 and one with

          1  the number 2.  Do you see Zoran Maljic, the man who
          2  executed the Muslim civilian who was in the custody of
          3  your unit?  And could you point him out, please?
          4       A.   Yes [indicates].
          5            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, in
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 147, the man with the number 2 on
          7  his shoulder.
          8       Q.   Now, in that same picture there is a man with
          9  the number 1 marked on his shoulder.  Do you see that
         10  man, Mr. Erdemovic, and can you identify him for the
         11  Trial Chamber?
         12       A.   Yes.  That is the leader of the platoon from
         13  Bijeljina, Franc Kos [indicates].
         14       Q.   All right.
         15            MR. HARMON:  Perhaps we can use my exhibit.
         16  I can use the next exhibit.
         17       Q.   Let me show you what is Prosecutor's Exhibit
         18  28/17, and I ask that that be placed on the ELMO,
         19  please.  Now, Mr. Erdemovic, you've mentioned
         20  Lieutenant Pelemis who gave the order to execute the
         21  young man in Srebrenica.  Do you see him in this
         22  particular picture?  Can you point him out, please?
         23       A.   [Indicates]
         24            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, the
         25  man on the right-hand side of that picture being

          1  Lieutenant Pelemis.
          2       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Erdemovic.  Thank you,
          3  Mr. Usher, that's all I need.
          4            Now, after this young man was executed,
          5  Mr. Erdemovic, were you given an order by Lieutenant
          6  Pelemis to do anything?
          7       A.   Yes.  He told us to go back.  At the time I
          8  didn't know it was the southern part of the town of
          9  Srebrenica.  Anyway, he told us to go back to where we
         10  had come from and to provide security at the entrance
         11  of the town.  He told this to me and other members of
         12  my unit.
         13            On the way back he told me to report to him
         14  when General Mladic reaches the town, General Mladic
         15  and the others.
         16       Q.   So at the point of town when you were in the
         17  centre, General Mladic, General Krstic, and General
         18  Zivanovic had not arrived in town yet; is that
         19  correct?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Did you follow Lieutenant Pelemis' order, and
         22  did you go to the entrance of the town in the south and
         23  did you set up a position?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Were you with other members of your unit?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Now, I forgot to ask you one question, and
          3  that is this:  Going back to the beginning of the
          4  assault, when your unit started the assault on
          5  Srebrenica, approximately what time was that?
          6       A.   I can't say now exactly.  But when NATO bombs
          7  dropped, I think, two bombs, a man from our unit looked
          8  at his wristwatch and said that it was about ten past
          9  eleven, I think.  We had already reached the first
         10  mosque in town by that time.
         11       Q.   Now, let me take you back to the location
         12  where you were at the southern entrance of the town,
         13  waiting for the arrival of General Mladic.  Your
         14  instructions were to notify Lieutenant Pelemis that
         15  General Mladic had passed your point.  How were you to
         16  do that?  How were you to communicate with Lieutenant
         17  Pelemis?
         18       A.   With a radio link, a Motorola.  We called it
         19  the 1000.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Now I'm going to play for Your
         21  Honours a film, which will be Prosecutor's Exhibit
         22  148.
         23       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, you've seen this film before.
         24  I'm going to ask you a number of questions about it
         25  after you've had an opportunity to see this.  This is a

          1  film that was taken outside of the town of Srebrenica,
          2  on the 11th of July, 1995.
          3            MR. HARMON:  So if we could dim the lights,
          4  please, and if we could play Prosecutor's Exhibit 148.
          5  Unfortunately, Mr. President and Your Honours, I have
          6  no transcript for this film.  One will follow.
          7                 [Videotape played]
          8            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Mr. Dubuisson,
          9  perhaps the next time we have a film one should dim the
         10  rights a little.
         11            MR. HARMON:
         12       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, the location where that film
         13  was taken, specifically where the Dutch UNPROFOR APC
         14  was on its side, was that at a location that was
         15  outside of the town and away from the location where
         16  you had set up your checkpoint, pursuant to the order
         17  of Lieutenant Pelemis?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have
         20  Prosecutor's Exhibits 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, and 157
         21  given to the usher, we're going to show those in
         22  order.  They are new exhibits.
         23       Q.   In the meantime, Mr. Erdemovic, having seen
         24  that film, did you see on that film a number of members
         25  of the 10th Sabotage Detachment present in the area

          1  where General Krstic was, where General Mladic was,
          2  where Colonel Pandurevic was and other representatives
          3  of the VRS army?  Could you members of the 10th
          4  Sabotage Detachment there?
          5       A.   Yes.  Yes, I saw three members of the 10th
          6  Sabotage Battalion.
          7       Q.   I'm going to show you a series of exhibits.
          8  We're going to start with Prosecutor's Exhibit 152.
          9            MR. HARMON:  All of these exhibits, Judge
         10  Riad and Judge Wald, are still images taken from the
         11  video we have just seen.  They are not of the best
         12  quality but they are the best quality we could obtain.
         13       Q.   Let me ask you, then, placing Prosecutor's
         14  Exhibit 152 on the ELMO, there are three individuals
         15  with yellow dots, 1, 2, and 3.  Did you, in looking at
         16  this film, have the ability to identify the individuals
         17  1, 2, and 3 as being members of your unit?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   So all three of these individuals are members
         20  of the 10th Sabotage Detachment; is that correct?
         21       A.   Yes, the 10th Sabotage Detachment, belonging
         22  to the Vlasenica platoon.
         23       Q.   Let's start with number 1.  Can you identify
         24  the man who is number 1?
         25       A.   He was a liaison officer, a signals officer,

          1  but I just know his name was Bujo.  That was his
          2  nickname, actually.
          3       Q.   Do you remember the name of the man who is
          4  number 2?
          5       A.   No.
          6       Q.   But you know him to be a member of the 10th
          7  Sabotage Detachment?
          8       A.   Yes.  He worked in the signals section.
          9       Q.   And number 3, can you identify him, please?
         10       A.   Yes.  He was also in the Vlasenica
         11  platoon formally, but sometimes he drove our commander
         12  Milorad Pelemis.
         13       Q.   What is his name?
         14       A.   Cico.
         15            MR. HARMON:  We can turn to the next exhibit,
         16  Mr. Usher, that is Prosecutor's Exhibit 153.
         17       Q.   The man with the yellow dot on his chest, is
         18  he a member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment,
         19  Mr. Erdemovic?
         20       A.   Yes.  His name is Bujo, and on the previous
         21  picture he was marked with the number 1.
         22       Q.   Now, in some of these images you'll see
         23  people with ribbons on their sides.  Could you tell,
         24  first of all, the Chamber, did members of the 10th
         25  Sabotage Detachment receive ribbons before they started

          1  the assault and what the purpose of those ribbons was?
          2       A.   In the morning, when we were about to enter
          3  town, we would receive red ribbons which we attached on
          4  our left shoulder, some maybe on the right.  I don't
          5  know.  But anyway we had to have those red ribbons so
          6  that we could be identified amongst the different
          7  units.
          8       Q.   Let's turn to the next image, which is 154.
          9  There are two individuals on Prosecutor's Exhibit 154
         10  with a yellow dot on them, 1 and 2.  Are both of those
         11  members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Now, even though one of these individuals has
         14  his back to us in this image, were you able to identify
         15  that individual in the film?
         16       A.   Yes.  It is Cico, the man nicknamed Cico.
         17       Q.   Were members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment
         18  normally issued blue helmets?
         19       A.   No.
         20       Q.   Is that helmet that Cico is wearing a UN
         21  helmet?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Now, the individual marked number 1 on this
         24  exhibit, a member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, do
         25  you know his name?

          1       A.   Yes, he is a member of the 10th Sabotage
          2  Detachment.  He worked in the signals department but I
          3  don't know his first or last name or his nickname.
          4       Q.   All right.  Now we'll turn to the next image,
          5  which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 155.  There is a man with
          6  a yellow dot.
          7            MR. HARMON:  If you could move that image
          8  over, please, Mr. Usher, so you can see the complete
          9  image of that man.  If you could move it up, please.
         10       Q.   Now, the man with the yellow dot is wearing,
         11  it looks like a grey T-shirt and green camouflage
         12  pants.  Is that the normal outfit for the 10th Sabotage
         13  Detachment?
         14       A.   No.
         15       Q.   What is the normal uniform worn by the
         16  members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment?
         17       A.   We wore a black uniform, the uniform worn by
         18  the army of Republika Srpska, and uniforms worn by the
         19  army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and by the Croatian Defence
         20  Council.
         21       Q.   But in terms of this operation that took
         22  place on the 11th of July, were members of the 10th
         23  Sabotage Detachment dressed in black, and were they
         24  also dressed in camouflage uniforms of the army of
         25  Republika Srpska?

          1       A.   Most were dressed in black uniforms but some
          2  had camouflage uniforms as well.
          3       Q.   Now, let's focus -- let me focus your
          4  attention on the man in this photograph holding, it
          5  looks like, a blue helmet and has a blue beret under
          6  his belt and has a yellow dot on his chest.  Can you
          7  tell the Judges, first of all, is he a member of the
          8  10th Sabotage Detachment, and can you identify him by
          9  name?
         10       A.   Yes.  He is a member of the 10th Sabotage
         11  Detachment.  His name is Cico, or rather his nickname.
         12  I'm not sure whether it was his name or nickname, but
         13  that's how they called him.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Let us turn now to the next
         15  exhibit, which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 156, another
         16  still image taken from the video we've just seen.  And
         17  in the upper right-hand corner, Your Honours, is the
         18  accused.
         19       Q.   Let me ask you to direct your attention to
         20  the man in the middle with the yellow dot.  Is that man
         21  a member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   What is his name?
         24       A.   His name is Zoran Stupar.  He comes from the
         25  Vlasenica detachment.

          1       Q.   Finally in this series of exhibits, let me
          2  turn your attention to Prosecutor's Exhibit 157.  In
          3  this image is the accused and General Mladic and other
          4  representatives of the Bosnian Serb army.  Do you
          5  recognise any of these people, and did you recognise
          6  any of these people on the 11th of July?
          7       A.   I recognised on that day only General
          8  Mladic.  I didn't know the other people, and I never
          9  met Mr. Krstic.  The same applies to the person on
         10  Mladic's right-hand side, I never met him, but I heard
         11  of the surname Pandurevic in the Drina unit.  But I had
         12  never heard of Mr. Krstic, nor did I ever see him.
         13       Q.   All right.
         14            MR. HARMON:  I'm finished with this series of
         15  exhibits, Mr. Usher.
         16       Q.   Let's return to your testimony.
         17  Mr. Erdemovic, before I showed you this series of
         18  exhibits, you told us you'd gone up to a particular
         19  location and you were to inform Lieutenant Pelemis of
         20  the arrival of General Mladic.  Did they, in fact, did
         21  General Mladic and other vehicles pass your location on
         22  the 11th --
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   -- I'm sorry.  On the 12th of July.  I'm
         25  sorry.  On the 11th of July.

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Approximately what time?
          3       A.   I didn't have a watch so I don't know
          4  exactly, but when we reached the centre of town, then
          5  after that -- after the raid, the bombing raid, maybe
          6  two or three hours later.
          7       Q.   Now, on the film that we have just seen,
          8  there was -- part of the images were of three vehicles
          9  descending a road, one of which contained General
         10  Mladic.
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   On the 11th of July, at your location did you
         13  see those vehicles and did those vehicles pass your
         14  location?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   Now, were those vehicles then driving in the
         17  direction of the centre -- toward the centre of the
         18  town of Srebrenica?
         19       A.   Yes.  They went in that direction.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Now, Mr. President and Judge
         21  Wald, I'm not sure when you want to take a break, but I
         22  have only a few more minutes of this particular line of
         23  examination, and if we could --
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Would 11.00 be all right with
         25  you, Mr. Harmon?

          1            MR. HARMON:  That would be fine.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  We will have a break for 20
          3  minutes.
          4            MR. HARMON:  I'm going to show Your Honours,
          5  it would be my next exhibit, Prosecutor's Exhibit 145.
          6  There are going to be two clips in this exhibit.  It's
          7  a very short film; it lasts about 50 seconds with the
          8  total of the two, so one has to watch fairly quickly.
          9  If we could then dim the lights and if we could play
         10  Prosecutor's Exhibit 145.
         11                 [Videotape played]
         12            MR. HARMON:  Now we'll show the second film.
         13  That should continue, please.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  How will we know what is being
         15  said?
         16            MR. HARMON:  I will submit a transcript.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         18            MR. HARMON:  You have to go back on that
         19  portion of the film, please.  It may be just as easy to
         20  start and show the whole thing again.  Both segments
         21  last 51 seconds.
         22                 [Videotape played]
         23            MR. HARMON:  I think that's fine, Judge
         24  Riad.  As I said, it was a very short film.
         25       Q.   I'm going to ask you now, Mr. Erdemovic.

          1  You've seen that film in my office.  Is the location of
          2  where that film was taken, is that in the town of
          3  Srebrenica?
          4       A.   Yes, between the position that I was at and
          5  the very centre of town, or rather what I assumed was
          6  the centre of town.
          7       Q.   Now, in that film that you saw, did you see
          8  members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   If I could show you, with the assistance of
         11  the usher, Prosecutor's Exhibit 158, please.
         12            MR. HARMON:  If that could be placed on the
         13  ELMO.  In this exhibit, Mr. Erdemovic, there are three
         14  individuals marked with yellow dots, 1, 2, and 3.  The
         15  accused is on the left-hand side of this image.  Are
         16  the individuals marked with 1, 2, and 3 members of the
         17  10th Sabotage Detachment?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   Could you identify them by name, starting
         20  with individual 1 and working toward individual number
         21  3?
         22       A.   Number 1 is Velimir Popovic from the
         23  Bijeljina platoon.  Number 2 is a man from the
         24  Vlasenica platoon whom I didn't want to mention in my
         25  earlier testimony, and if it is not absolutely

          1  essential, I would rather not today either.  I didn't
          2  want to mention his name.
          3       Q.   All right.  Well, unless I have -- but you
          4  know him to be a member of the 10th Sabotage
          5  Detachment; is that correct?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   If the Defence ask you a question or if the
          8  Judges ask you to identify him, you will be required to
          9  identify him by name, Mr. Erdemovic.
         10            Let's move on to the number 3, please.  Who
         11  is the individual with the number 3 marked on his body?
         12       A.   Stanko Savanovic from the Bijeljina platoon,
         13  a member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment.
         14       Q.   Now, I'd like to focus your attention if you
         15  would, Mr. Erdemovic, just briefly, on the man with the
         16  number 2, and on the left-hand shoulder of that
         17  individual there is a ribbon.  Is that the kind of
         18  ribbon that you said was placed on the shoulders of the
         19  individuals who participated in the assault on
         20  Srebrenica?
         21       A.   I can see there is a ribbon but I cannot see
         22  that it is red.  But I assume that that is the ribbon.
         23       Q.   Below the ribbon there's a patch, an
         24  insignia, on the man's left arm.  Do you recognise that
         25  patch?

          1       A.   Yes.  It is the patch of the 10th Sabotage
          2  Detachment.
          3       Q.   Lastly, turning your attention to number 3,
          4  the individual marked with the number 3, he's wearing a
          5  camouflage uniform, not a black uniform.  Do you know
          6  why he was dressed --
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   -- differently from your other colleagues in
          9  the 10th Sabotage Detachment?
         10       A.   I think in the morning, when we set off from
         11  Bijeljina, he was wearing that uniform and that is how
         12  he remained.  Whether he had a reserve uniform in his
         13  bag or not, a black uniform or some other uniform such
         14  as that of the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the
         15  HVO.
         16       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, thank you very much.
         17            MR. HARMON:  Judge Riad, I'm at a point where
         18  it would be convenient to break.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Harmon, how long do you
         20  foresee your examination-in-chief?
         21            MR. HARMON:  Approximately, two more hours.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Two more hours.  We'll have a
         23  break of 20 minutes now and then another break at
         24  12.40.  We have to adjourn at 14.10 today.  So at 11.20
         25  we'll be back here.  Thank you very much.

          1                 --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
          2                 --- On resuming at 11.20 a.m.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Harmon, you can proceed.
          4            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Your Honour.  If you
          5  could move that exhibit down just a little bit, please,
          6  Mr. Usher.  Down a little more.  A little more,
          7  please.  That's fine right there.
          8       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, just before we took the break,
          9  you had been testifying about Prosecutor's Exhibit 158,
         10  and I wanted to ask you, are you familiar with this
         11  specific location where this image was taken?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Now, sometime after General Mladic drove by
         14  you, your position, with the other vehicles, did you go
         15  down to this specific location that is found in
         16  Prosecutor's Exhibit 158?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   At that particular location, when you went
         19  down there, did you find members of the 10th Sabotage
         20  Detachment present?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   Were they with a man who you did not know?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Before I get into what you observed and what
         25  you heard at that location, can you identify the

          1  members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment who you found
          2  at this particular location?
          3       A.   Under number 1, Velimir Popovic.  Under
          4  number 2, an individual whom I did not wish to mention
          5  in my previous testimony, I didn't want to mention his
          6  name and I don't wish to mention his name today either
          7  and involve him in everything.
          8       Q.   Continue, please.
          9       A.   Under number 3 is Stanko Savanovic.
         10       Q.   Did you see any other members of your
         11  detachment at that location when you went down there?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Who else?
         14       A.   Opposite on the pavement, Koljevrat Dragan
         15  was sitting down, and somebody else was with him.  I
         16  don't remember exactly who.
         17       Q.   Would you describe to the Judges what you saw
         18  when you went down to this position, what you heard.
         19       A.   When I got to this position, I saw Velimir
         20  Popovic, under number 1, the individual wearing number
         21  2, and I didn't mention his name, and under number 3,
         22  Stanko Savanovic.  Opposite was Dragan Koljevrat, and
         23  they were all members of the unit.  With them there was
         24  just one individual whom I didn't know.
         25            When I asked who the man was, Stanko

          1  Savanovic said that it was the commander of the Drina
          2  Corps by the name of Zivanovic.  And then the man with
          3  number 2 on him, whose name I did not mention, said
          4  he's not a general, he's not a commander, he's --
          5            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness repeat
          6  that word, please.
          7       A.   -- he was drunk.  And there was a jerrycan
          8  with some alcohol, and it was tied to the battery of
          9  the car.  The man I did not know, I saw a hand launcher
         10  which I had not seen before, of the type I hadn't seen,
         11  and he said, "Who's that?"  And Savanovic said, "I
         12  found it in a house here."  And I gave it to the
         13  General -- I asked why he had given it to the General
         14  and he said, "Because he's going to retire soon."
         15            MR. HARMON:
         16       Q.   Now, what were these men drinking?
         17       A.   They were drinking, we call it in Bosnian,
         18  Slivovitz.
         19            THE INTERPRETER:  Which is plum brandy.
         20            MR. HARMON:
         21       Q.   Out of what kind of container were they
         22  drinking from?
         23       A.   They were drinking from a plastic jerrycan.
         24            MR. HARMON:  Now, I'd like to have
         25  Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/4 placed on the ELMO.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Harmon, the interpreters did
          2  not hear the grade of Stanko Zivanovic.  They said he
          3  was not a general, he was not a commander, and it was
          4  left open, an empty space there.
          5            MR. HARMON:
          6       Q.   Could you repeat, Mr. Erdemovic, what was
          7  said about Zivanovic?
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  Stanko Zivanovic.
          9       A.   He said he was the commander -- Zivanovic
         10  said that he was the commander of the Drina Corps, and
         11  to that the individual under number 2 answered that --
         12  he said, "He's not a commander but he's an alcoholic,"
         13  and everybody laughed at that and I did too.
         14            MR. HARMON:
         15       Q.   What was the reason that was given to you why
         16  the rocket launcher was given to this man?
         17       A.   Because he was going to be retired soon.
         18       Q.   Now, I have placed on the ELMO Prosecutor's
         19  Exhibit 28/4.  Do you see the man Zivanovic, who was
         20  drinking at the barricade with you and other members of
         21  the 10th Sabotage Detachment, in this particular
         22  exhibit?
         23       A.   [Indicates]
         24            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, the
         25  second individual from the right-hand side of the

          1  image.  Thank you, Mr. Erdemovic, and thank you,
          2  Mr. Usher.  I have finished with that exhibit.
          3       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, I'm going to turn your
          4  attention now to the 12th of July.  Can you tell us
          5  approximately what time you and members of your unit
          6  left Srebrenica and returned to Vlasenica?
          7       A.   I think that it was around noon, that is to
          8  say, in the morning hours, between 10.00 and 12.00.
          9  That's when we left Srebrenica.
         10       Q.   Prior to leaving, where had you and members
         11  of your unit been billeted?
         12       A.   Could you tell me what you mean by "where"?
         13  Do you mean where we spent the night?
         14       Q.   Where you spent the night and where you spent
         15  the morning hours of the 12th.
         16       A.   We spent the night on the southern side,
         17  where I was located, where we provided security to the
         18  entrance into town.  There were two houses there; one
         19  was a large house and the other one was a little
         20  smaller.
         21       Q.   Did you and did members of your group remain
         22  together until your departure on the morning of the
         23  12th of July?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Now, at any time on the 12th of July,

          1  Mr. Erdemovic, did you or did members of your unit
          2  enter the town of Potocari?
          3       A.   No.
          4            MR. HARMON:  If I could have the usher's
          5  assistance once again, please, if we could use
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1/E/1 which is an A3-sized map,
          7  and if that could be placed on the ELMO.
          8       Q.   I'm going to ask you to look at this map,
          9  Mr. Erdemovic, and I'm going to ask you to use the
         10  pointer and indicate for the Judges the location where
         11  you were and where you went and the route of your
         12  travel.  And if we could move that up on the ELMO,
         13  please.  That's fine right there.
         14            Could you use the pointer, Mr. Erdemovic, and
         15  just follow the line along your route of travel when
         16  you returned to Vlasenica.
         17       A.   We went this away [indicates], towards
         18  Milici, roundabout over Rudnik, and that was an open
         19  pit mine, I think here [indicates], this part of the
         20  mine.  I don't know the territory very well but I think
         21  it was.  And when we passed by, there was some
         22  machinery there and this sort of mining equipment.  So
         23  from Srebrenica we went along this route [indicates],
         24  the roundabout route to Milici, and from Milici we
         25  continued on to Vlasenica.

          1            MR. HARMON:  Indicating for the record, they
          2  travelled south from Srebrenica, passed Zeleni Jadar,
          3  up the road towards Milici and then over towards
          4  Vlasenica.  Thank you very much, Mr. Erdemovic.
          5  Mr. Usher, I've finished with that exhibit.
          6       Q.   Now, did you return to your base in Bijeljina
          7  or did you remain in Vlasenica on the 12th of July?
          8       A.   We remained in Vlasenica.
          9       Q.   Why didn't you go to Bijeljina?
         10       A.   I don't know.
         11       Q.   Now, I'm going to focus your attention,
         12  Mr. Erdemovic, on the time frame between the 13th of
         13  July and the 15th of July, and I don't want to go into
         14  great detail but I'd like you to tell the Judges in
         15  summary form where you and where certain members of
         16  your unit went and why you went to that particular
         17  location.
         18       A.   On the 12th, when we returned to Vlasenica,
         19  we were late because our truck -- there was something
         20  wrong with our truck and our unit was already there.
         21  When we came to Vlasenica, at midnight on the 12th, we
         22  learned that Pelemis had overturned, that is to say,
         23  the commander of the unit Pelemis had overturned with
         24  an APC not far from Vlasenica and our own base.  Our
         25  own base was on the road leading from Vlasenica to

          1  Kladanj, the Vlasenica-Kladanj road.  On that occasion,
          2  a soldier had lost his life, and he was Dragan
          3  Koljevrat and he was from Trebinje by birth.
          4            On the 13th, in the morning when we got up, a
          5  man who was in charge of the rear for our unit came up
          6  to me and said that I was to attend the funeral, along
          7  with some others, because I was a good friend of his
          8  and I was the leader of his group at one point in
          9  Bijeljina.  And that was on the morning of the 13th.
         10  We went to Trebinje, I myself, the individual who drove
         11  the vehicle, and it was the driver under number 2, and
         12  five or six others.  I don't remember exactly who they
         13  were but I think that's more or less how it was.
         14            So we left on the 13th to Trebinje, and as
         15  the journey was a long one, we had to pass by --
         16  roundabout Sarajevo and the road had been destroyed by
         17  the war.  We had to go through the forests, and we
         18  arrived in Trebinje on the 14th, in the morning, in the
         19  early morning hours, perhaps 4.00 or 5.00 a.m., I'm not
         20  quite sure.  But that particular day we spent in
         21  Trebinje.  The funeral was on the 14th, so that in the
         22  late afternoon hours, towards evening, we went towards
         23  Vlasenica, and because the road was so bad we arrived
         24  there on the 15th in the morning, once again at 5.00,
         25  6.00, or 7.00 a.m., thereabouts.  I don't know exactly

          1  but it was the early hours of the morning.
          2            And of course because we had spent the night
          3  of the 10th outside our house, and on the 11th and 12th
          4  I didn't get much sleep because we were travelling
          5  around until midnight, and the next day, the 13th, I
          6  attended the funeral; on the 14th, I was at the
          7  funeral; on the 15th, the whole night I spent
          8  travelling, so that on the night of the 15th, me and
          9  all the others who were with me slept for the most part
         10  of the day, until the late afternoon, 5.00 or 6.00,
         11  perhaps.
         12       Q.   Now, in relation to Vlasenica, where is
         13  Trebinje?
         14       A.   Trebinje is situated south, southwards in
         15  Herzegovina, in the vicinity of the town of Dubrovnik,
         16  which is in the Republic of Croatia.
         17       Q.   All right.  Mr. Erdemovic, we're now going to
         18  turn our attention to the 16th of July.  On the 16th of
         19  July, did you and did members of your unit receive a
         20  new assignment?
         21       A.   Yes, we did.
         22       Q.   From whom did you receive the assignment?
         23       A.   Brano Gojkovic came and told us, told me,
         24  Franc Kos, and Zoran Goronja that we should prepare for
         25  our assignment.  And when he asked him who said that we

          1  should go, he said that the order had been issued by
          2  Pelemis.
          3       Q.   Now, how many people were --
          4            MR. HARMON:  We've lost the English
          5  translation.
          6            THE INTERPRETER:  Can you hear the English?
          7            MR. HARMON:  I can hear the English.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  Judge Wald is bilingual.  It's
          9  okay.
         10            MR. HARMON:
         11       Q.   How many members of the 10th Sabotage
         12  Detachment received an assignment on this morning of
         13  the 16th?
         14       A.   Eight.
         15       Q.   Can you name the eight individuals who went
         16  on this particular assignment?
         17       A.   Brano Gojkovic, Aleksandar Cvetkovic, who
         18  drove the vehicle that we were in, it was our unit's
         19  van; Golijan Vlastimir; Franc Kos; Zoran Goronja;
         20  Stanko Savanovic; and myself.
         21       Q.   You mentioned Marko Boskic.
         22       A.   Sorry.  Sorry.  Yes, there was him too.
         23       Q.   Now, these individuals were some members of
         24  the Bijeljina platoon and some of the Vlasenica
         25  platoon; is that correct?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Could you name the individuals in this
          3  assignment who were part of the Vlasenica platoon?
          4       A.   Brano Gojkovic, Aleksandar Cvetkovic, and
          5  Vlastimir Golijan.
          6       Q.   And the other members of this group were
          7  members of your platoon; correct?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Who was the leader of this group?
         10       A.   Brano organised everything for us to pack,
         11  take all the equipment necessary for the operation.  He
         12  was the leader.
         13       Q.   Now, was the purpose of the operation
         14  explained to you while you were in Vlasenica?
         15       A.   No.  We were only told that we were going
         16  into an operation of some kind.
         17       Q.   Where did you go from Vlasenica?
         18       A.   From Vlasenica we went in the general
         19  direction of Zvornik, and we stopped in Zvornik.
         20            MR. HARMON:  If I could have Prosecutor's
         21  Exhibits 170, 171, and 172 placed on the ELMO.
         22       Q.   I'll wait until they are distributed to the
         23  Judges before I ask you some questions about these.
         24            Let's start, Mr. Erdemovic, with Prosecutor's
         25  Exhibit 170.  You said you went to Zvornik.  Can you

          1  identify the location in Prosecutor's Exhibit 170 as
          2  being the location where you went?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   Let me show you the next two exhibits.
          5  Exhibit 171, is this another view of the location where
          6  you went?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Lastly, 172, if that could be
          9  placed on the ELMO.
         10       Q.   Is that also the location where you and other
         11  members of your unit went in Zvornik?
         12       A.   Yes, it was in the compound there.  I don't
         13  know how many buildings like this were there, but I do
         14  know that that was the location.
         15            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if we could go back
         16  to 171, please.  That's fine.
         17       Q.   Now, Mr. Erdemovic, tell the Judges what
         18  happened when you arrived at this location.
         19       A.   When we arrived here, in front of this ramp
         20  [indicates], the ramp was opened up for us and our
         21  vehicle entered.  Only Brano got out of the car, and
         22  the driver, and they went off in this administrative
         23  building, reception area.  And there were two military
         24  policemen at the reception area.  In front of these
         25  buildings here [indicates], there were quite a number

          1  of military policemen.  Perhaps there were other forms
          2  of police as well, perhaps civilian, but all I know is
          3  that there were a lot of military policemen.
          4            MR. HARMON:  Now, the reception area, for the
          5  record, the witness pointed to the structure on the far
          6  right, in the foreground.  And when he said there were
          7  a lot of military policemen present, he was pointing to
          8  the smaller building in the background that's directly
          9  behind the gate that is open.
         10       Q.   Now, what did Brano Gojkovic do?  Do you know
         11  what he did when he went into this building?  Did you
         12  go with him, or did he go in there alone?
         13       A.   No.  We all stayed in the van.  Just he and
         14  Cvetkovic went inside, and that was the driver of the
         15  vehicle.
         16       Q.   Why don't you tell us what happened at that
         17  location?
         18       A.   While we were sitting in the van, I don't
         19  remember exactly whether I heard it over the radio or
         20  on a Motorola, but it was stated that the Muslims that
         21  broke through towards Tuzla had confiscated a vehicle
         22  with heavy machine-guns on it and that they had taken
         23  several policemen from Doboj prisoners.  I don't know
         24  if they were civilian policemen that these Muslims had
         25  captured or whether they were military policemen.

          1            After a few moments had gone by, from this
          2  building, Brano Gojkovic, Aleksandar Cvetkovic, and a
          3  Lieutenant Colonel whose name I didn't know, and two
          4  policemen, came out.  They had patches with the
          5  "Military Police Drina Corps" on them.  They came out
          6  of the building.
          7       Q.   Now, did you see the insignia that said
          8  "Drina Corps Military Policemen" on the two policemen
          9  who came out with Brano Gojkovic?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   And you said a Lieutenant Colonel came out as
         12  well.  How do you know that the individual who came out
         13  with two military policemen from the Drina Corps was a
         14  Lieutenant Colonel?
         15       A.   He had insignia denoting officer rank on his
         16  chest.  That individual had the insignia of officer
         17  rank, with the rank he actually was, on his chest, on
         18  the left-hand side.
         19       Q.   And that rank, again, was Lieutenant Colonel;
         20  is that correct?
         21       A.   Yes, it is.
         22       Q.   Now, Mr. Erdemovic, after these men came out,
         23  what happened?
         24       A.   Brano came.  We had opened the door of the
         25  van, and you would open it sideways, with a sideways

          1  motion.  He told us to shut the door.  And when we
          2  asked him where they were going, he said that we would
          3  be escorting the Lieutenant Colonel who was in front of
          4  us, in an Opel Kadett vehicle in front of us.
          5       Q.   Would Brano be escorting?  The way I
          6  understood your testimony, the way it was interpreted
          7  to me, Brano would be escorting the Lieutenant
          8  Colonel.  Was it the other way around; in fact, the
          9  Lieutenant Colonel would be escorting members of your
         10  unit to a location?
         11       A.   No.  Our vehicle followed the Lieutenant
         12  Colonel and those two policemen who were in front of
         13  us, in the Opel Kadett car in front of us.
         14       Q.   Where did you go?
         15       A.   We went in the direction of Zvornik, from
         16  Zvornik towards Bijeljina.  And not long afterwards we
         17  turned off the road, the Zvornik-Bijeljina road, we
         18  turned left onto a macadamised road surface -- it
         19  wasn't an asphalt road -- and we arrived at a farm.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Could I have Prosecutor's
         21  Exhibit 24/7, which is a large panorama, placed on the
         22  ELMO.
         23       Q.   I'm going to show you this image,
         24  Mr. Erdemovic, and ask you if the location that's shown
         25  on Prosecutor's Exhibit is the farm where you arrived.

          1            MR. HARMON:  If you could place that on the
          2  ELMO, if you could, Mr. Usher, and if you could move it
          3  slowly across the ELMO so the people in the audience
          4  could also see this location.
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   So this is the location that's depicted in
          7  this panorama where you, the two Drina Corps military
          8  policemen, the Lieutenant Colonel, and your group
          9  arrived.  By the way, did the Lieutenant Colonel have
         10  any insignia on his uniform -- was he wearing a
         11  uniform, in the first place?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   What kind of a uniform was he wearing?
         14       A.   He had the uniform of the Army of Republika
         15  Srpska.  I don't remember about his pants, but I know
         16  that his shirt was a summer shirt.
         17       Q.   Did he have any kind of insignia denoting
         18  what particular unit he was a member of?
         19       A.   No.
         20       Q.   Now, after you arrived at this farm, what
         21  happened?
         22       A.   The Lieutenant Colonel and the two policemen
         23  got out of the car.  The Lieutenant Colonel went into
         24  this building here [indicates], where some men were
         25  there, that I didn't know who they were.  I think it

          1  was an office belonging to those people who were
          2  working there.
          3       Q.   How long did he stay in there?
          4       A.   Not long.  Maybe two or three minutes.
          5       Q.   What happened then?
          6       A.   After that they all went; all those people
          7  who were there moved away.  Only the guard remained.
          8       Q.   When you say "all those people," you mean all
          9  the people who were working at the farm?
         10       A.   Yes.  They were on the farm.  Whether they
         11  were all working there, I don't know.
         12       Q.   How many people who had been present at the
         13  farm remained after these other people left?
         14       A.   Just one.
         15       Q.   What happened then?
         16       A.   After that, when they had all left, the
         17  Lieutenant Colonel was talking to Brano and I heard him
         18  say that buses would be coming.
         19       Q.   Please continue.
         20       A.   As soon as he said that, it wasn't long after
         21  that, he left with these two policemen in a car.  Then
         22  Brano came back to us and told us that buses would come
         23  with civilians from Srebrenica on them.  And I and some
         24  others started objecting, saying, "What are we going to
         25  do there?"  And he said that we would have to execute

          1  those people.
          2            In the course of this debate, the first bus
          3  was already arriving.  This may have been 20 minutes
          4  later or half an hour later.  So the first buses came
          5  in about half an hour, as he had said.
          6            When the first bus arrived -- I know about
          7  myself; I don't know exactly about the others, what
          8  they said -- I said that I did not want to do that,
          9  that I cannot do that, that that is not the task of our
         10  unit.  Brano told me then, "If you won't do it, stand
         11  up with them or give them your rifle, and you will see
         12  whether they will shoot you."
         13       Q.   Please continue.
         14       A.   When the first bus arrived, it parked here
         15  [indicates].  It parked here [indicates], where we see
         16  the green tractor-trailer.
         17            MR. HARMON:  Which is, for the record, near a
         18  building that appears to have many openings in it and
         19  appears to be the building that is on the farthest
         20  right of the panorama.  So there's a green
         21  tractor-trailer on the left-hand side of that building,
         22  in between a larger building that's a farmhouse with a
         23  red tile roof.
         24       Q.   So that's the location where the buses
         25  parked.  Would you continue with your testimony,

          1  please, Mr. Erdemovic.
          2       A.   When the first bus arrived, Brano told us
          3  that we had to deploy in a line from this garage here
          4  [indicates], from this building, in a straight line,
          5  perhaps 100 metres long.  I don't know exactly.
          6       Q.   You mean 100 metres away from the building
          7  that has the openings and the tree next to it?  You had
          8  to deploy 100 metres past that building; is that
          9  correct?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   Into an open field?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   All right.  Please continue, Mr. Erdemovic.
         14       A.   Then I saw two policemen taking men out, men
         15  who were in the bus, and these two men were probably
         16  the security for the transport of these men, and they
         17  reached Brano and Vlastimir Golijan.  And the first
         18  group of people were brought behind this garage down
         19  there, maybe 100 metres away, maybe more, but roughly
         20  to such a position.  Then Brano told us to form a
         21  line.  The men in front of us were ordered to turn
         22  their backs.  When those men turned their backs to us,
         23  we shot at them.  We were given orders to shoot.
         24       Q.   Did Brano also shoot?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   Did all of the members of your unit, the ten
          2  people who had been sent over there, did they all
          3  shoot?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   All right.  Continue, please.
          6            Actually, Mr. Erdemovic, let me ask you some
          7  questions at this point in time.  Did the buses that
          8  you saw coming to the Branjevo Farm, did they have any
          9  kind of markings on them that you could identify?
         10       A.   There were markings of "Centrotrans Sarajevo"
         11  and "Drinatrans Zvornik," transportation companies.
         12       Q.   After this first group of ten prisoners was
         13  executed, what happened, Mr. Erdemovic?
         14       A.   Brano and Vlastimir Golijan, we again formed
         15  a line to secure the path, and Brano and Golijan went
         16  for the next group of people.
         17       Q.   What happened then?
         18       A.   The second group was brought, and they were
         19  lined up immediately behind those first group.  Our
         20  backs were turned to the garage and we were moving in
         21  the direction of the garage.  And that is how groups
         22  were brought in:  Men again turned their backs to us
         23  and we shot that group of people who were in front of
         24  us.
         25       Q.   And then I take it another group was brought

          1  for execution, and they were executed as well?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   And is that how the scene repeated itself
          4  throughout the day?
          5       A.   Yes, only I have to say that the last group
          6  of the first bus, or at the beginning of the second
          7  bus, I know that Aleksandar Cvetkovic and Brano had the
          8  idea to speed up the execution so that we could use a
          9  machine-gun, an M-84.
         10       Q.   What happened with that M-84 machine-gun?
         11       A.   Then Aleksandar Cvetkovic took this
         12  machine-gun, positioned it, and started shooting at the
         13  group of ten.  However, because the ammunition was what
         14  it was, the people were just mutilated and wounded, and
         15  they begged to be finished off.
         16       Q.   Please continue.
         17       A.   Then a hot argument ensued between me, Brano,
         18  Slovenac, Goronja, and Aco, because some people could
         19  no longer listen to those men pleading to be killed,
         20  and we were saying if they have to die, why couldn't
         21  they die decently, peacefully, rather than being
         22  mutilated and hit and insulted and hurt?  And then they
         23  put away that M-84 machine-gun.
         24       Q.   Now, Mr. Erdemovic, were any of these men who
         25  were brought down to be executed blindfolded, did they

          1  have their hands tied, or do you recall?
          2       A.   I can only remember that in the first bus
          3  they were blindfolded and their hands were tied, as far
          4  as I can remember.
          5       Q.   Now, the policemen who escorted these buses
          6  of prisoners who were being brought to the execution
          7  field, could you see any insignia on those policemen?
          8       A.   Yes.  They were the same insignia as were
          9  worn by the previous two policemen who came with that
         10  Lieutenant Colonel.
         11       Q.   What did that insignia say?
         12       A.   The military police of the Drina Corps.
         13       Q.   Now, could you describe to the Judges the
         14  role that these Drina Corps military policemen had in
         15  the execution process that was taking place on the 16th
         16  of July?
         17       A.   In the course of the transport, they probably
         18  guarded the prisoners and escorted them in buses.  When
         19  they reached the farm, they took out ten men at a
         20  time.
         21       Q.   So they segregated the groups of ten that
         22  were passed on to members of your unit, and then those
         23  men were walked to the execution field and murdered,
         24  and then another ten individuals had been selected by
         25  the members of the Drina Corps military police, taken

          1  off the buses, and were waiting to be transported to
          2  the execution field.  Is that how it worked?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   Now, approximately how many buses arrived at
          5  the Branjevo farm on the 16th of July, as best as you
          6  can recall?
          7       A.   As far as I can recall, because those were
          8  terrible moments for me, I think between 15 and 20.
          9       Q.   What time did the executions start in the
         10  morning of the 16th of July?
         11       A.   I think around 10.00.
         12       Q.   What time did they end on that same day?
         13       A.   3.00 or 4.00 in the afternoon.
         14       Q.   Now, how many people do you estimate,
         15  Mr. Erdemovic, were executed at the Branjevo farm on
         16  the 16th of July?
         17       A.   I think about 1.000, 1.200.
         18       Q.   Your unit, the members of the 10th -- all of
         19  the members who went on this assignment, including
         20  Brano, participated in those executions, did they not?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   At some point in time, Mr. Erdemovic, did you
         23  have a conversation with one of the victims and attempt
         24  to spare him from the fate that awaited him?
         25       A.   Yes.  That man, as soon as he got off the

          1  bus, started saying that he had helped some Serbs to
          2  get out of Srebrenica and reach the Federal Republic of
          3  Yugoslavia, and he was showing some pieces of paper
          4  with the telephone numbers of those people.  I took him
          5  aside and told him, "Come here."  He did.  I started
          6  talking to him.  We spoke about what had happened in
          7  Srebrenica.  I let him light a cigarette.  As there was
          8  a tap, a water tap not far, and I think I also gave him
          9  some water to drink.
         10            I was sorry and I wanted to save that man and
         11  others, but I selected him because he said that he had
         12  saved Serbs in Srebrenica and helped them to reach the
         13  territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and I
         14  thought that I might save him thanks to that.  However,
         15  not long afterwards, Vlastimir Golijan came, he took
         16  the man, and then Brano came too.  And I said, "Why
         17  don't we investigate and see whether this man actually
         18  did what he said," to save him, and they said as one
         19  that they didn't want to have any witnesses.
         20       Q.   Was that man executed?
         21       A.   Yes.  I think Vlastimir Golijan killed him.
         22       Q.   Now, Mr. Erdemovic, did you see Brano
         23  Gojkovic order the bus drivers, who were transporting
         24  these prisoners to the Branjevo farm, to do anything?
         25       A.   Yes.  After the second bus, or the first -- I

          1  don't know exactly -- they started drinking and the
          2  spirits started to have their effect.  And then
          3  Vlastimir and Brano were saying that the drivers could
          4  also be witnesses, and I know that one of the drivers
          5  did shoot at a man and Brano gave him a gun to do
          6  that.  He shot at a man.
          7       Q.   Shot at him or killed him?
          8       A.   He shot at him.  Now, whether that man died
          9  straight away, I don't know, I can't remember, I can't
         10  say.  But he did shoot at him.
         11       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, did the 10th Sabotage Unit
         12  members who had gone to this farm kill all the 1.000 to
         13  1.200 people, or did another military unit arrive at
         14  the Branjevo farm arrive at some point during the day
         15  and participate in the executions?
         16       A.   All the members of the 10th Sabotage
         17  Detachment did not participate in these executions.
         18  About -- between 1.00 and 2.00, members came from
         19  Bratunac, so that I heard when somebody said that
         20  people from Bratunac had come to assist.  And they took
         21  over the killing of those people, in the same way as
         22  our group had done, only they recognised some of those
         23  people and they took it out on them.
         24            I think that one of the men from Bratunac was
         25  a native of Srebrenica and he recognised some.  I

          1  remember he recognised the butcher from Srebrenica, and
          2  I know that he said, "You're a good man, but I have to
          3  kill you.  I know that you were not a nationalist."
          4       Q.   Before we explore that, I want to correct a
          5  part of the record that is in the transcript.  The
          6  record says at 12:09:01, "All of the members of the
          7  10th Sabotage Detachment did not participate in these
          8  executions."  I understood your testimony to be that
          9  all of the members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment did
         10  participate in executions but didn't participate in
         11  killing all of the people who had been executed on the
         12  16th of July.  Is that correct?
         13       A.   Yes, yes.
         14       Q.   Okay.  Now --
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Harmon, just a second.  He
         16  said, "The people who came from Bratunac."  He said
         17  "people".  Were there also military people or --
         18            MR. HARMON:  I was going to get to that,
         19  Judge Riad, and I'll explore that.
         20       Q.   I'd like to explore now the identities of
         21  these people who came from Bratunac.  First of all,
         22  Mr. Erdemovic, how were they dressed?
         23       A.   They were, as far as I could remember, all
         24  dressed in uniforms of the army of Republika Srpska.
         25  Only one was wearing a uniform that I would see and

          1  that I recognised as being the uniform of the American
          2  army.
          3       Q.   Who was it who said, "The men from Bratunac
          4  have arrived"?
          5       A.   I think it was Brano, but I'm not certain.  I
          6  think possibly it was him, because I saw him first
          7  shake hands with them.  Some people recognised each
          8  other.  Aleksandar Cvetkovic was there, and I saw that
          9  they knew each other from before.
         10       Q.   Now, did it appear to you that the men from
         11  Bratunac knew some of the people who had been brought
         12  from Srebrenica?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   In fact, you recounted at least one
         15  conversation between one of the men who was from
         16  Bratunac and the butcher from Srebrenica; is that
         17  correct?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   Did you conclude, based on your observations
         20  of the interactions between the men from Bratunac and
         21  the victims from Srebrenica, that these were local
         22  people who knew each other?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges how the people
         25  from Bratunac acted toward the victims from

          1  Srebrenica.
          2       A.   They beat them from steel rods.  They kicked
          3  them, they hit them.  They forced them to pray in the
          4  Muslim way.  They simply took it out on them.  They
          5  humiliated them.
          6       Q.   In addition to the conversation between the
          7  man who knew the butcher, did it appear that other
          8  members of the Bratunac group knew other victims who
          9  were from Srebrenica?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Now, I'm going to ask that the
         12  three next exhibits, Prosecutor's Exhibit 173, 174, and
         13  175, be shown to the witness, placed on the ELMO, and
         14  distributed to the Judges, please.
         15       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, can you identify, in this
         16  image that was taken in Potocari, one of the
         17  individuals from Bratunac who was present and
         18  participated in the execution at the Branjevo Military
         19  Farm on the 16th of July, 1995?
         20       A.   This one here [indicates].
         21       Q.   Can you point to his face, please.
         22       A.   [Witness complies]
         23            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, in
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibit 173, the man who is on the far
         25  left-hand side of the image.  He has a bandana on his

          1  head.
          2       Q.   Could you turn to the next exhibit, please,
          3  174?  Do you see one of the men who participated in the
          4  executions at the Branjevo Military Farm on the 16th of
          5  July in this particular image?
          6       A.   Yes.  This one [indicates].
          7       Q.   Is that the man who appeared in the previous
          8  image?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, on Prosecutor's
         11  Exhibit 174, a man on the far right-hand side of the
         12  image, wearing a camouflage uniform and wearing a
         13  bandana on his head.
         14       Q.   Lastly, let me show you Prosecutor's Exhibit
         15  175.  Do you recognise the man in Prosecutor's 175?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Who is that man?
         18       A.   He's the same man who was at the farm that
         19  day, only in this case he's in civilian clothes.  But I
         20  remember him well.
         21       Q.   He's the same man who was wearing a bandana
         22  in Prosecutor's Exhibit 173 and 174; is that correct?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24            MR. HARMON:  I'm finished with those
         25  exhibits, Mr. Usher.  Thank you.

          1       Q.   Now, after the arrival of the men from
          2  Bratunac, did members of your unit also participate in
          3  the continued killings that were taking place at the
          4  farm?
          5       A.   I can't say regarding everyone, but I know
          6  that four men did not continue to participate.
          7       Q.   Who were those four men who did not continue
          8  to participate?
          9       A.   Myself, Franc Kos, Marko Boskic, and Zoran
         10  Goronja.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Could I please have Prosecutor's
         12  Exhibit 158 placed back on the ELMO.
         13       Q.   Did one member of your unit, Mr. Erdemovic,
         14  brag to you how many men he had killed at the Branjevo
         15  Military Farm?
         16       A.   Yes.  It is Stanko Savanovic, number 3.  He
         17  said that he had killed between 200 and 300 men, that
         18  he had counted them.
         19       Q.   So the man who is marked number 3 in that
         20  exhibit was a participant in the execution squad with
         21  you, and he told you that he had killed between 250 and
         22  300 of these individuals; correct?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24            MR. HARMON:  All right.  Thank you very
         25  much.  I'm finished with that exhibit.

          1       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, what was the age range of the
          2  people who were murdered at the Branjevo Military Farm?
          3       A.   As far as I could tell, between 17 and 60 or
          4  70.
          5       Q.   How were these people dressed?
          6       A.   They were all in civilian clothes, except for
          7  one who had camouflage pants.
          8       Q.   Did any of these people offer resistance of
          9  any kind to the execution squad or to the Branjevo --
         10  I'm sorry, the Bratunac Brigade soldiers who were
         11  present?
         12       A.   Yes, one man.  I think when they had just
         13  arrived, he started running, trying to escape, and they
         14  caught up with him and killed him.
         15       Q.   Now, were Drina Corps military policemen
         16  escorting each and every bus that came to the execution
         17  fields?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   Now, while the last bus was coming to the
         20  execution field, did anyone else appear with that bus
         21  at or about the time of the arrival of that bus?
         22       A.   Could you repeat the question once again,
         23  please?
         24       Q.   I'll ask it a different way.  Did the
         25  Lieutenant Colonel who had escorted you to the Branjevo

          1  farm return with anybody else later in the afternoon?
          2       A.   Yes.  He came at the end, when these men from
          3  Bratunac were emptying the last bus.
          4       Q.   And he was present when these executions --
          5  the last bus of people were being executed?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   Was he accompanied by anybody else when he
          8  came to the farm?
          9       A.   There were those men who were there before,
         10  those two military policemen who were there when we
         11  headed for the Branjevo farm.
         12       Q.   Tell the Judges what happened when he arrived
         13  at the Branjevo Military Farm.
         14       A.   We were sitting down against the wall of the
         15  building on the farm that I showed you on the picture.
         16  Then these men from Bratunac were still taking people
         17  and killing them.  Brano, Savanovic, and Cvetkovic were
         18  close to the bus, I think.  The Lieutenant Colonel went
         19  towards them, over there.  We were talking, and just
         20  then somebody asked the guard where the people would be
         21  buried, and he said they would be buried there, and he
         22  also said that people had been buried there before.
         23  Now, I don't know whether he meant before the Second
         24  World War, before this war, what exactly he meant.
         25            Not long after that, this Lieutenant Colonel

          1  and Brano came, Aleksandar Cvetkovic, Savanovic, and he
          2  said that we had to go to the nearby club where there
          3  were 500 Muslims from Srebrenica who wanted to break
          4  down the door.  Four of us said that we wouldn't go
          5  there to do that, that we'd had enough, that we were
          6  nobody's killing machines.  Brano said, "Why?"  We just
          7  said we didn't want to do any more, that enough is
          8  enough.  And then the Lieutenant Colonel turned around
          9  and went towards those men from Bratunac, and after a
         10  minute or two, or five -- I don't know -- they got into
         11  their vehicles and left.  And we were still at the
         12  farm.  There was the machine-gun and all the weapons.
         13  When we were loading it into the van, we heard the
         14  sound of gunfire coming from that direction.
         15       Q.   Coming from which direction?
         16       A.   From the direction -- well, you see, the
         17  farm, when you're coming from Zvornik, you come across
         18  that farm, the Zvornik-Bijeljina road.  You first reach
         19  the farm and then this place on the road to Bijeljina.
         20       Q.   Let me ask you:  Did all of the men who had
         21  participated in the killings at the Branjevo farm leave
         22  the farm to go to another location where people had to
         23  be killed?
         24       A.   The people from Bratunac went straight away.
         25  But Brano told us in the car that that Lieutenant

          1  Colonel had said that we ought to attend a meeting at a
          2  cafe in that place.
          3       Q.   Before we get into the next set of killings,
          4  I want to just ask you:  How many men from Bratunac
          5  were there who had arrived to participate in the
          6  killings and then went to another location to continue
          7  with the killings?
          8       A.   Perhaps ten, perhaps more, perhaps one or two
          9  men less.  I don't really know.
         10       Q.   Before we leave the Branjevo farm, I'd like
         11  you to take a look at another exhibit, which is
         12  Prosecutor's Exhibit 24/2, which is an aerial image
         13  that has markings on it.  I ask that that be placed on
         14  the ELMO.
         15            Mr. Erdemovic, you've seen this picture in my
         16  office before?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   Now, this is an aerial image of the Branjevo
         19  farm; is that correct?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Does this show the location where the people
         22  who had been executed fell?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Does this image accurately reflect the
         25  location of the buildings and the bodies from the

          1  executions on the 16th of July, 1995?
          2       A.   Yes.  I remember this building [indicates]
          3  and this other one [indicates].  I don't remember this
          4  one so well [indicates] but I do remember this one and
          5  the one over here [indicates].  I recognise that that
          6  is the farm and the place where the people were taken
          7  from the buses.
          8       Q.   Now, are there other locations where people
          9  were executed beside the area with the large oval that
         10  says "Bodies"?
         11       A.   Yes.  I think these people from Bratunac,
         12  those first people were taken off here [indicates],
         13  this area here [indicates].
         14            MR. HARMON:  Indicating for the record the
         15  area to the left of the word that says "Bodies," in
         16  between -- slightly above the word that says "Wheel."
         17  In that area, there were additional bodies.  All
         18  right.
         19       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, thank you.  I'm finished with
         20  this particular exhibit.
         21            Let's turn our attention back now,
         22  Mr. Erdemovic, to the departure of the people from --
         23  the soldiers from Bratunac who left and went to a
         24  particular location.  As you were leaving, you said you
         25  could hear shooting; is that correct?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   How soon after the departure of the soldiers
          3  from Bratunac was it that you left the Branjevo farm?
          4       A.   Perhaps some 10 minutes later, perhaps 15,
          5  thereabouts; 10 to 15 minutes.
          6       Q.   Where did you go?
          7       A.   We went in the direction of Pilica, the place
          8  of Pilica, which is where that cafe was located, the
          9  coffee bar where we were to have a meeting with that
         10  Lieutenant Colonel that Brano told us about.
         11       Q.   Describe the scene to the Judges as you
         12  entered this particular village where a cafe was
         13  located.
         14       A.   When you come from the Zvornik direction, the
         15  cafe is on the right-hand side.  It is the
         16  Zvornik-Bijeljina road.  The cafe is on the right-hand
         17  side, at a place called Pilica, and I think that is at
         18  the entrance to Pilica itself.  Opposite the cafe was
         19  this other place, and when we came in front of the
         20  cafe, in front of this building on the other side, we
         21  saw people lying down on the ground, lying around on
         22  the ground, and you could hear shots.
         23       Q.   Could you hear detonations from grenades as
         24  well?
         25       A.   Afterwards, when we'd already entered the

          1  cafe you could hear detonations.
          2       Q.   I'm going to show you a number of exhibits
          3  and ask you to identify the various locations that you
          4  are going to be testifying about.  If we could start
          5  first of all with Prosecutor's Exhibit 25/15, and then
          6  we will turn to 25/2, 25/5, and 25/7.
          7            While we're getting those exhibits,
          8  Mr. Erdemovic, how far apart was the cafe from the
          9  location where shooting was taking place?
         10       A.   I would say about 70 to 100 metres.  I can't
         11  say exactly.
         12       Q.   We're going to start by placing on the ELMO,
         13  Mr. Erdemovic, Prosecutor's Exhibit 25/15.  You
         14  mentioned the cafe.  Does this picture show the cafe
         15  where you and other members of the 10th Sabotage
         16  Detachment went after you left the Branjevo Military
         17  Farm?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   Is this the cafe -- and did you remain in
         20  this cafe while killings took place at a location
         21  across the road?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Did you remain in that cafe until the
         24  killings that took place across the road finished?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   Now, if we could turn to the next exhibit,
          2  25/2.  Mr. Erdemovic, can you point out to the
          3  Judges -- first of all, you've seen this picture in my
          4  office prior to testifying; is that correct?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Can you point out to the Judges first the
          7  cafe, where you and other members of your squad were
          8  sitting, and then point out the location where the
          9  killings were taking place.
         10       A.   [Indicates]
         11            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, first of all, the
         12  building that has the sign "Cafe" above it.
         13       Q.   Where did the killings take place?
         14       A.   [Indicates]
         15            MR. HARMON:  Indicating the cultural hall to
         16  the bottom part of the image.
         17       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, let's take a look at the next
         18  picture, please, which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 25/5.
         19  What is this building?
         20       A.   This reminds me of that hall in Pilica.
         21       Q.   All right.  Is this the location -- what
         22  happened at this location, Mr. Erdemovic?
         23       A.   Over here [indicates], I can't show you
         24  exactly, but somewhere here to the right [indicates],
         25  when we arrived, upon our arrival in front of the cafe

          1  with the vehicle, that's where the bodies were lying
          2  down on the ground, and shots were heard inside over
          3  there, but I didn't go there.
          4       Q.   All right.  Let's turn to our last exhibit,
          5  which is 25/7.
          6            MR. HARMON:  I'm sorry.  There should be one
          7  more exhibit.  We should have 25/2, 25/5, and 25/7.
          8  There should be three exhibits.  Mr. Usher, what is the
          9  number on that exhibit, please?
         10            THE USHER:  25/5.
         11            MR. HARMON:  If we could turn to 25/5, then.
         12       Q.   I want to lastly show you this picture.  Can
         13  you show to the Judges, Mr. Erdemovic, first of all,
         14  the location where the killings took place?
         15       A.   This building here [indicates].
         16            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, the
         17  building that's above the two buses that appear in the
         18  middle of the picture.
         19       Q.   And where is the cafe located where you and
         20  other members of your unit were sitting when the
         21  killings were taking place?
         22       A.   Here [indicates].
         23            MR. HARMON:  Indicating the building in the
         24  lower right-hand corner.  You can only see the roof
         25  portion of that building.

          1       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, when you were sitting in the
          2  cafe, was there something at the location where the two
          3  buses that appear in the middle of this image?
          4       A.   As far as I remember, that's where the
          5  checkpoint of the civilian police was located.
          6       Q.   Now we've set the scene for the rest of your
          7  testimony, Mr. Erdemovic.  Would you tell the Judges,
          8  then, what happened when you got to the cafe, who was
          9  there, what you saw, and what you heard.
         10       A.   When we arrived at the cafe -- when you go
         11  in, when you enter the cafe, at the entrance, on the
         12  right-hand side, I called this -- these were little
         13  separate places to sit, and on the right-hand side,
         14  this Lieutenant Colonel was sitting down with another
         15  military policeman.  I didn't see the other one.
         16       Q.   Please continue.
         17       A.   We all went inside.  I and Franc Kos sat
         18  right next to -- sat at the table on the left-hand
         19  side, by the door.  All the others went off, Brano,
         20  Vlastimir, Aco, Boskic, Goronja.  And the Lieutenant
         21  Colonel said, that is, he called the man working there
         22  and told him to bring drinks.  I and Slovenac, as far
         23  as I remember, had some coffee, the others were, I
         24  think, drinking brandy, and they were talking.  I
         25  didn't listen to what they were saying.  You could

          1  still hear the shooting, and the detonations were heard
          2  at that point in that building.
          3       Q.   "That building" being the building across the
          4  street.
          5       A.   Yes, that's right.
          6       Q.   How long did you remain there -- I'm sorry.
          7  How long while you were there did you continue to hear
          8  shots and detonations coming from the building across
          9  the street?
         10       A.   Not long.  Between 15 and 20 minutes,
         11  perhaps.
         12       Q.   All right.  Now, after 15 or 20 minutes, what
         13  happened, Mr. Erdemovic?
         14       A.   First of all, that man came, the one that I
         15  have already showed you with the bandana on his head,
         16  from Bratunac, he came inside and said that everything
         17  was over, and then the others came in as well.  And
         18  they talked to the Lieutenant Colonel for a while, and
         19  then we said that we wanted to go home.  And not long
         20  after that we got up, got into our vehicle, and went
         21  off.  And I remember that the Lieutenant Colonel just
         22  said, "Those who survived survived."
         23       Q.   I take it at this second execution site,
         24  which was in this town, no members of the 10th Sabotage
         25  Detachment participated in those killings; is that

          1  correct?
          2       A.   No.  That's correct.
          3       Q.   The killings that took place at this
          4  particular location were committed, as far as you could
          5  see, by the men from Bratunac, who were dressed in the
          6  military uniform of the army of the Republika Srpska;
          7  is that correct?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Now, Mr. Erdemovic, you said you wanted to --
         10  you asked to leave.  Did you, in fact, then leave the
         11  location of the cafe shortly after the killings that
         12  had taken place across the street occurred?
         13       A.   Yes.  We went in the direction of Vlasenica.
         14       Q.   Did all of the members of the execution squad
         15  from the 10th Sabotage Detachment return to Vlasenica?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Do you know where the men from Bratunac went?
         18       A.   No.
         19       Q.   Do you know where the Lieutenant Colonel
         20  went?
         21       A.   No.
         22       Q.   Do you know where the military policemen from
         23  the Drina Corps went?
         24       A.   No.
         25       Q.   All right.  Now, after your return to

          1  Vlasenica, did you eventually return back to your base
          2  in Bijeljina?
          3       A.   Yes.  When we returned, not much time went
          4  by, they said a bus would come to take us to Bijeljina,
          5  and that's what in fact happened.
          6       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, after these killings took
          7  place, you remained with members of your unit, first of
          8  all, in Vlasenica briefly, and then in Bijeljina, and
          9  you had an opportunity to converse with other members
         10  of your unit.  Is that correct?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   Now, did you hear at any time, in your
         13  conversations with your colleagues, that members of the
         14  10th Sabotage Detachment had participated in the
         15  separation of men from women and children in Potocari
         16  that occurred on the 11th and the 12th of July?  Did
         17  you ever hear anything from any of your colleagues that
         18  they had participated in that?
         19       A.   No.
         20       Q.   Did you ever hear, Mr. Erdemovic, in talking
         21  to your colleagues, that members of the 10th Sabotage
         22  Detachment had participated in the detention of men in
         23  Potocari, in Bratunac at various locations, at the Luke
         24  school near Kladanj, in the Petkovci school, or the
         25  Grbavci school, or the Pilica school, or the Rocevic

          1  school?
          2       A.   No.
          3       Q.   So you never heard any of your colleagues
          4  talking about that.
          5       A.   No.  But some of these places, I heard of
          6  them for the first time later on, when your
          7  investigators questioned me.
          8       Q.   All right.  Now, since your group was a
          9  reconnaissance group, Mr. Erdemovic, did you ever hear
         10  that members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment
         11  reconnoitred to find suitable detention facilities
         12  where Bosnian Muslims from Srebrenica were detained
         13  prior to being executed?
         14       A.   As far as I know, no.
         15       Q.   Did you ever hear that members of your unit
         16  participated in being guards or providing security for
         17  Bosnian Muslim prisoners who were detained at various
         18  sites prior to their execution?
         19       A.   No.
         20       Q.   Did you ever hear that members of the 10th
         21  Sabotage Detachment participated in mass executions at
         22  the Kravica warehouse, at Orahovac, at a dam, or at a
         23  location Kozluk?
         24       A.   No.
         25       Q.   Did you ever hear, Mr. Erdemovic, that

          1  members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment participated in
          2  the burial or the operation of heavy equipment of
          3  victims from massacres that took place at the Branjevo
          4  Military Farm, at the Kravica warehouse, at Orahovac,
          5  at the Dam, or at Kozluk?
          6       A.   No.
          7       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, to your knowledge, I take it
          8  that your understanding was that your unit participated
          9  in the executions only at the Branjevo Military Farm;
         10  is that correct?
         11       A.   Yes.  And I heard later on, when I left
         12  hospital, because after Srebrenica I was wounded and I
         13  was in a hospital in Bijeljina, first of all, and then
         14  at the military academy hospital, I heard rumours going
         15  around that individuals had been in the Nova Kasaba.
         16       Q.   All right.  But you didn't hear any rumours
         17  about those people participating in executions at Nova
         18  Kasaba, did you?
         19       A.   No.
         20       Q.   All right.  Mr. Erdemovic, thank you very
         21  much.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Judge Riad, Judge Wald, I've
         23  concluded my direct examination of Mr. Erdemovic.  I
         24  have no further questions.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  You said you had two hours.  So

          1  you've concluded.
          2            MR. HARMON:  I have concluded.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  I would like very much to
          4  express my admiration.
          5            We will adjourn for 20 minutes and resume at
          6  1.00.
          7            Mr. Erdemovic, you know from your experience
          8  that now the Defence counsel will ask you some
          9  questions.  I would like to seize this opportunity to
         10  tell you that the Bench appreciates very much you're
         11  coming to testify.
         12            We are adjourned until 1.00.
         13                 --- Recess taken at 12.40 p.m.
         14                 --- On resuming at 1.00 p.m.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Visnjic or Mr. Petrusic.
         16            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, Your Honour.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Please proceed.  Good
         18  afternoon.
         19            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good
         20  afternoon, Your Honours, my learned colleagues of the
         21  Prosecution.
         22                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         23       Q.   Good afternoon, Mr. Erdemovic.
         24            Mr. Erdemovic, can we say that you became a
         25  member of the Republika Srpska army in Dvorovi?
          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Did you then sign an agreement with the army
          3  of Republika Srpska as to your membership in the army?
          4       A.   Not then but afterwards.  Well, when Pelemis
          5  joined in October 1994.
          6       Q.   Can you tell us something about that contract
          7  or agreement.
          8       A.   I read it out, I had it in my hands, and it
          9  was between me, as a member of the 10th Sabotage
         10  Detachment, and the Main Staff, as far as I know, of
         11  the army of Republika Srpska.
         12       Q.   So that contract was between you and the Main
         13  Staff of the army of Republika Srpska, to make matters
         14  quite clear.
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   So we can say that you were a professional
         17  soldier of the army of Republika Srpska, were you not?
         18       A.   Yes, by signing that contract or agreement,
         19  you could put it that way, yes.
         20       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, I should now like to ask you
         21  some technical questions.  We're speaking the same
         22  language, you and I, so please make pauses between the
         23  question and the answer.
         24       A.   Yes, I will do so.  I apologise.
         25       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, do you know whether the other

          1  members, and I'm speaking of the Drina Corps
          2  specifically, individual brigades, Milicka, Bratunac,
          3  Bircka, Zvornicka Brigades, whether their soldiers had
          4  the same kind of contract with the army?
          5       A.   I'm not aware of that.  I don't know.
          6       Q.   Can we say that the command structure of your
          7  unit with respect to superiority was made up of the
          8  following hierarchy:  We had Colonel Salapura as the
          9  top man, top officer; then we had Major Pecanac; then
         10  we had First Lieutenant Pelemis and Kremenovic, whom I
         11  think was in charge of the rear for your detachment;
         12  followed by two platoon leaders, Lule of the Vlasenicki
         13  and Franc Kos of the Bijeljina platoon.
         14       A.   That is all correct.  But Kremenovic was not
         15  in charge of the rear, he was Pelemis' deputy.
         16       Q.   Can we then say that at the top of that
         17  pyramid, according to this chain of command, was the
         18  Main Staff of the army of Republika Srpska?
         19       A.   Yes, the intelligence staff of the army of
         20  Republika Srpska.
         21       Q.   And by the same token, the Main Staff of the
         22  Republika Srpska army.
         23       A.   Yes, that's right.
         24       Q.   In a military hierarchy of this type, in the
         25  command sense or in actual, practical terms, or in any

          1  other sense, you didn't have any links with the Drina
          2  command; is that correct?
          3       A.   Yes, that is correct.  Yes, it is correct.
          4       Q.   When you went on assignment to the zones of
          5  responsibility of other corps, in addition to
          6  information at the command level saying that you would
          7  be passing through, you continued to be under your
          8  command; that is, your platoon was under the command of
          9  Mr. Pelemis, was it not?
         10            I can't see an answer on the transcript.
         11       A.   The answer is yes.
         12       Q.   So nobody else was able to issue orders to
         13  you except for your command.
         14       A.   Yes, that is correct.
         15       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, can it be said that you didn't
         16  have your own area of responsibility, in fact?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   When other units joined you in your
         19  operations, in the particular case of the mine near
         20  Srebrenica, did the members of that unit come under
         21  your command, the same command as you?
         22       A.   They were not directly under our command, but
         23  they were attached to us just to show us the way.
         24       Q.   So their command could not issue orders to
         25  you.

          1       A.   No.  No.
          2       Q.   And could your command issue orders to them?
          3       A.   Well, if they were attached to us for that
          4  occasion, then probably our commander could issue
          5  orders to those men who were attached to us.
          6       Q.   This relationship, at what level did it
          7  function?  At the level of Pelemis command or a higher
          8  level?
          9       A.   I only know that if Pelemis was with us, then
         10  he could command those men.  If it was someone else,
         11  then he would be the one.  Now whether there was a link
         12  between Salapura, Major Pecanac, and the brigade
         13  command, of the people who were attached to us, I
         14  really don't know.
         15       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, I think you said, and please
         16  correct me if I'm wrong, that on the 10th of July you
         17  headed from Bijeljina, towards Zvornik, towards
         18  Bratunac.
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   And you arrived in Bratunac.
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   How many members of the 10th Sabotage
         23  Detachment were boarded onto, I suppose, some trucks or
         24  buses in Bijeljina?
         25       A.   Between 15 and 20, into a small bus.  I don't

          1  know exactly now but between 15 and 20.  That is what I
          2  think.
          3       Q.   You reached Bratunac on the 10th.  What time
          4  of day was it, roughly?
          5       A.   Well, maybe 2.00 in the afternoon.  I don't
          6  know exactly.
          7       Q.   Could you please describe your movements from
          8  Bratunac to the position in Srebrenica?
          9       A.   I don't know the area well but I know that we
         10  went a roundabout away through woods and over hills.  I
         11  know it was a difficult route for us to take.  Our
         12  group and the group from Vlasenica were led by two
         13  three-barrelled guns belonging to the former JNA.
         14       Q.   Was there a total of 15 of you, including you
         15  and the group from Vlasenica, or was the Vlasenica
         16  group independent?
         17       A.   No.  You asked me, "How many of you started
         18  from Bijeljina" and I said between 15 and 20.  But when
         19  we got to Bratunac, shortly after that these men from
         20  Vlasenica came.
         21       Q.   How many of them arrived?
         22       A.   I don't know.  I think there was a total --
         23  when we left on the 11th [sic] for Srebrenica, there
         24  must have been about 30 of us, but I don't know
         25  exactly.

          1       Q.   You reached the area above Srebrenica on the
          2  10th, in the evening.  Were you then under Pelemis'
          3  command?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Both platoons.
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   In the morning, on the 11th of July, who gave
          8  you orders to go to Srebrenica, into the town itself?
          9       A.   Milorad Pelemis, the commander of our unit.
         10       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, were there with you members of
         11  the regular units of the Drina Corps?  I mean members
         12  of the Milici, Bratunac, Zvornik, and Vlasenica
         13  Brigades.
         14       A.   There were about 15 men from the Drina Wolves
         15  which, as far as I know, were billeted in Zvornik, and
         16  they came under Pelemis' command because he went into
         17  town with us then.  They were attached to our unit.
         18       Q.   You were divided into several groups.  Can
         19  you tell us how many?
         20       A.   As far as I know, our unit was divided into
         21  four groups.
         22       Q.   Were members of the Drina Wolves with you in
         23  those groups?
         24       A.   No, they were not mixed up with us in those
         25  groups.

          1       Q.   So they were not under Pelemis' command
          2  either.
          3       A.   Well, judging by the way Pelemis spoke to us,
          4  I gathered that Pelemis could give them an order.
          5       Q.   Those members of the Drina Wolves, did they
          6  have their leader?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   At that location?
          9       A.   The leader of the group was certainly with
         10  them, the Drina Wolves.
         11       Q.   Do you know who that leader was?
         12       A.   No.
         13       Q.   If I understand you correctly, it's not
         14  Legenda.
         15       A.   No, Legenda was not there.
         16       Q.   In your examination-in-chief you mentioned
         17  the order that you should guide the population towards
         18  the football stadium.
         19       A.   Yes.  Pelemis told us -- people asked, "What
         20  if we come across civilians?"  He said that we should
         21  direct the civilians to go in front of us towards the
         22  football stadium.
         23       Q.   So you didn't come across civilians, rather,
         24  your group didn't.
         25       A.   Yes, we came across a couple.  Throughout

          1  that period there may have been 200 civilians that we
          2  came across, elderly people, women, people who couldn't
          3  move quickly.
          4       Q.   Did you see them go to the football pitch?
          5       A.   They went in front of us so I didn't see
          6  that.
          7       Q.   Do you know that that football pitch, viewed
          8  from Srebrenica, is in the direction of Potocari?
          9       A.   At the time I didn't know.  I do now.
         10       Q.   So you know the location where it is now.
         11       A.   Yes, today I know.
         12       Q.   Could you conclude today that they went in
         13  the direction of Potocari?
         14       A.   When I reached the centre of town, what I
         15  thought was the centre of town, I think they took the
         16  road towards Potocari.
         17       Q.   After a certain amount of time, after the
         18  bombing raids by NATO forces, you were given orders to
         19  withdraw to one of the checkpoints at the entrance to
         20  Srebrenica, on the southern side.
         21       A.   When we reached this second mosque, upon
         22  entering Srebrenica, Pelemis said that everything was
         23  finished and that members of various units were coming
         24  down from the hills -- I don't know exactly which units
         25  they belonged to, but they were coming down -- and

          1  Pelemis said we shouldn't move forward any more but
          2  that we should go back to where we had started out from
          3  entering the town, and to guard the entrance to the
          4  town.
          5            On the way there he told us to inform him
          6  when General Mladic and the others arrived.  He didn't
          7  say who the others would be.  I just remember him
          8  mentioning General Mladic.
          9       Q.   The road that you took on the way back, is
         10  that the road that General Mladic came along?
         11       A.   Three vehicles came.  First was a Mercedes
         12  belonging to the former JNA.  Mladic was sitting in
         13  front, and I didn't recognise the other persons.
         14       Q.   From the position where you were at that
         15  checkpoint, could you see how many troops had entered
         16  the town?
         17       A.   I don't know how many, I can't say now, but
         18  in my estimate there must have been 500 or 700 soldiers
         19  maybe.
         20       Q.   And they passed by your checkpoint?
         21       A.   No.  No, they were coming down from the
         22  surrounding hills.  And before the vehicles that passed
         23  were two APCs, a self-propelled and a Praga, as far as
         24  I can remember, but not many troops passed that
         25  checkpoint.

          1       Q.   At that checkpoint you spent the night.
          2       A.   Not at the checkpoint itself.  It was not a
          3  checkpoint.  We were protecting the entrance to the
          4  town.  I learnt here that this was the southern side of
          5  Srebrenica.  Yes, we spent the night there in houses, a
          6  big house, I remember, and a smaller house.
          7       Q.   The order for movement the next day, the 12th
          8  of July, between 10.00 and 12.00, came from Pelemis.
          9       A.   No.  A man who sometimes drove Pelemis, under
         10  the name of Zoran Stupar, came and said that that
         11  Pelemis had ordered us to move towards Vlasenica.  We
         12  were already supposed to go and search this mine, one
         13  at the entrance to Srebrenica and the other coming out
         14  at the Bratunac side, and we were informed that we
         15  should go to Vlasenica.
         16       Q.   So Stupar is conveying Pelemis' orders to
         17  you.
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   And Pelemis previously had issued orders that
         20  you should search the mine.
         21       A.   When we got down into town, after a few
         22  minutes a man came, I think his name was Garic, from
         23  Vlasenica, and the mine was in his area.  He asked
         24  Pelemis, as we knew the mine, that we should work
         25  there.  We should have done that the next day but we

          1  didn't.  I don't know why.
          2       Q.   Let us go back for a moment to the 11th
          3  again.  Your comrade from the detachment, I think the
          4  young man whose funeral you attended later, when he
          5  described General Zivanovic as a drunk, when he said,
          6  "He's not a General, he's not a commander, he's a
          7  drunk," did he mean "pijano," meaning drunk, did he
          8  mean a person who is frequently drunk?  Is that what
          9  the term implies?
         10       A.   That is what it sounded like to me, and since
         11  I saw him drinking brandy from the jerrycan, that is
         12  how we describe a man who drinks.
         13       Q.   So he wanted to describe him as a person
         14  prone to alcohol, and thereby that he shouldn't have
         15  the role he has as a commander.
         16       A.   Yes, that's what it sounded like.
         17       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, how many members of the 10th
         18  Detachment left Srebrenica and went towards Vlasenica?
         19       A.   As far as I can remember, all the members of
         20  the unit, on the 12th, left.
         21       Q.   Therefore, some 30 of you.
         22       A.   Yes.  May I just say, we didn't see Pelemis
         23  when we left Srebrenica, we met him on the way
         24  somewhere, towards the south, where there was this
         25  former UNPROFOR checkpoint, south of Srebrenica.  We

          1  found him, Cico, and another two soldiers there, who
          2  were with an APC that you saw on the video clip which
          3  they had seized from UNPROFOR.
          4       Q.   So your group went south of Srebrenica,
          5  Zeleni Jadar, that is, the mine, Milici, and then the
          6  road goes on to Vlasenica.
          7       A.   I don't know that area too well, but when we
          8  passed I could see that there were open cast mines.  So
          9  possibly those were mines.
         10       Q.   But regardless of your knowledge or not of
         11  the area, there's no doubt that you went to the south
         12  of Srebrenica, in the direction of Vlasenica.
         13            On that road, did you see members of the
         14  Drina Corps?
         15       A.   No.
         16       Q.   On the 16th of July you left Vlasenica via
         17  Zvornik, towards the farm, and then you saw a certain
         18  number of members of the police.
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Do you know under whose command they were?
         21       A.   I just saw the emblem.  It said, "The
         22  Military Police of the Drina Corps."  I don't know
         23  exactly under whose command they were.  The name of the
         24  person or his rank, I don't know.
         25       Q.   Do you know how units of the Drina Corps were

          1  deployed at the time in their area of responsibility,
          2  on the 16th of July?
          3       A.   No.
          4       Q.   Do you know that at the time another
          5  operation was under way?
          6       A.   I heard that over the radio, that the
          7  Muslims, who were going from Srebrenica, were breaking
          8  through towards Tuzla and that they had managed to
          9  capture a Praga or a self-propelled gun, and several
         10  policemen from Doboj.  I don't know whether they were
         11  civilian police or military police, or whether they
         12  were really from Doboj.  But that is what I heard.
         13       Q.   Do you know, and had you heard that on the
         14  16th of July there were other combat operations in
         15  Zepa?
         16       A.   No.
         17       Q.   You came across a Lieutenant Colonel in
         18  Zvornik?
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Could you describe him, please.
         21       A.   He was tall, I would say about a metre and 90
         22  centimetres, heavily built.  He had a rather big head.
         23  He had -- I don't know how to put it.  It was very
         24  sunny that day, very hot, and he had a cap.  As far as
         25  I could remember, he had greying hair and a receding

          1  hairline.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I beg your
          3  pardon, Mr. President.
          4       Q.   Excuse me, Mr. Erdemovic.  Are you sure,
          5  Mr. Erdemovic, that he had the rank of Lieutenant
          6  Colonel?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          9  with your permission, I should like to show 28/15,
         10  Prosecution Exhibit, on the ELMO for identification
         11  purposes.
         12       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, the officer whose head has a
         13  circle around it in red marker, is that the person you
         14  saw?
         15       A.   No.
         16       Q.   Thank you.  Members of this unit, or rather
         17  the soldiers who came to the farm from Bratunac, as you
         18  said, did they tell you that they were from Bratunac,
         19  or did they specify the unit they belonged to?
         20       A.   I heard this when Brano, I think it was Brano
         21  who said, "Men from Bratunac are coming to assist."  I
         22  don't know exactly whether they were from Bratunac, nor
         23  did I talk to them.
         24       Q.   So it was not stated that members of such and
         25  such a brigade were coming, but simply men from

          1  Bratunac.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, when all this was over in
          4  Branjevo and Pilica, you returned to Vlasenica.
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   So eight of you went to Branjevo and Pilica
          7  and eight of you returned.
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Where were the members of the 10th Sabotage
         10  Detachment from the 12th until the 16th, when you
         11  returned?
         12       A.   I'm afraid I didn't understand the question.
         13       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, there were 30 of you who
         14  reached Srebrenica.  From Srebrenica you all returned,
         15  with the exception of this young man who got killed,
         16  you got to Vlasenica.  From Vlasenica, eight of you
         17  went to Branjevo and Pilica.  Where were the others,
         18  the other members of the detachment, in the meantime?
         19       A.   I have to explain.  I don't know where they
         20  were on the 13th, 14th, and 15th, when I went to the
         21  funeral.  On the 16th, as far as I remember, they all
         22  stayed behind me in Vlasenica, and when we returned to
         23  Vlasenica we saw them all there, because a few minutes
         24  after that we went to Bijeljina.
         25       Q.   You stayed at the VMA, the military medical

          1  clinic in Belgrade, when you were being treated for
          2  your injuries, and you said that you heard some things
          3  there.  Did you hear anything about the movements of
          4  the 10th Sabotage Detachment at that time?
          5       A.   I definitely heard about the case of Nova
          6  Kasaba.
          7       Q.   What did you hear?
          8       A.   I heard that these persons from my unit were
          9  there, and this was recounted by somebody -- to my wife
         10  and she passed it on to me, that Velimir Popovic, Brano
         11  Gojkovic, Milorad Pelemis, that they were in Nova
         12  Kasaba, that they took a man, a young boy, who reported
         13  and said that he had 100.000 German marks in a house in
         14  Srebrenica, that they took him there, he found the
         15  money, and that they killed him.  And when I came home,
         16  I heard the same story from Marko Boskic, telling some
         17  people.
         18       Q.   Is that all that you heard about the
         19  movements of the members of the 10th Sabotage
         20  Detachment during the time when you were not with the
         21  rest of them?
         22       A.   I heard later, my wife told me again, that
         23  they had gone looking for gold.  I don't know about
         24  that for sure, but I think this could be true, because
         25  Marko Boskic told the same story a second time.
          1       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, do you know which unit was
          2  located in Nova Kasaba?
          3       A.   No.
          4            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours,
          5  I have finished my cross-examination.
          6            Mr. Erdemovic, thank you.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much,
          8  Mr. Petrusic.
          9            Mr. Erdemovic, first Mr. Harmon, would you
         10  like to ask some questions?  Thank you.
         11            MR. HARMON:  I have only a couple of
         12  questions.
         13                 Re-examined by Mr. Harmon:
         14       Q.   Mr. Erdemovic, you were asked by my colleague
         15  questions about the joint operation between your unit
         16  and the Drina Wolves that took place in the direction
         17  of Srebrenica on the 11th of July.
         18            My first question relates to an answer you
         19  gave in my direct examination.  You identified the
         20  leader of the Drina Wolves as a man named Legenda.  Do
         21  you remember that answer?  You have to answer aloud.
         22       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         23       Q.   Now, members of the Drina Wolves -- did it
         24  appear to you, when you were making the assault on
         25  Srebrenica, that members of your unit were working

          1  together with members of the Drina Wolves in making the
          2  assault in the direction of Srebrenica?
          3       A.   It appeared to me that they were working in
          4  cohorts, that Pelemis did have contacts with Legenda,
          5  which he probably did have in actual fact.
          6       Q.   To your knowledge, did Legenda -- let me ask
          7  that question differently.  To your knowledge, was
          8  Legenda a participant in the operations that were being
          9  directed against Srebrenica?
         10       A.   Yes, I saw that on the pictures, the video
         11  first, and later on you showed me a photograph and I
         12  identified it as being Legenda.
         13       Q.   I want to focus your attention back to the
         14  time when you were participating in this operation,
         15  that is, the 11th of July.  Were you aware that
         16  Lieutenant Pelemis was in communications with Legenda?
         17       A.   Well, I did know because Pelemis said that we
         18  should set fire to the first thing we came across on
         19  the left, on the right.  There was a haystack next to
         20  me and I should set the haystack on fire.  He said that
         21  we should set it alight so as not to be hit by the
         22  artillery and Praga and those heavy machine-guns that
         23  were positioned up on the hill.  And I do know that
         24  that was done -- that Legenda, in fact, was at that
         25  elevation point.

          1       Q.   So Legenda was at a location near Srebrenica
          2  where he could cover your operations with some kind of
          3  heavy fire if necessary; is that correct?
          4       A.   Yes.  Yes, that's correct.  And I also know
          5  because of another example.  When a bomb was thrown, we
          6  heard over the radio, our signals officers had said
          7  that a tank had been damaged, and the vehicle, a
          8  vehicle of the commander of the Drina Wolves, Legenda.
          9  A bomb fell on that hill where that communication line
         10  was located, and Legenda himself.
         11       Q.   Are you talking about a NATO bomb that fell?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   And did the NATO bomb hit a location, as far
         14  as you're aware, that was near a vehicle that was
         15  operated or owned by or used by Legenda?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Erdemovic.
         18            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Your Honours.  I have
         19  no additional questions.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Harmon.
         21            Judge Wald, would you like to ask your
         22  questions?
         23            JUDGE WALD:  Thank you.
         24                 Questioned by the Court:
         25            JUDGE WALD:  Mr. Erdemovic, as your unit was
          1  moving into Srebrenica on the 11th, I think you
          2  testified on direct that you didn't meet much
          3  resistance, but I wanted to make sure I understood
          4  correctly.  Is that right?  In other words, was there
          5  resistance from Muslim forces or other forces as you
          6  moved into the centre of Srebrenica?
          7       A.   No.  There was -- well, I can't say there
          8  wasn't any resistance.  You could hear shots shooting,
          9  but there was no great resistance of any kind.
         10            JUDGE WALD:  All right.  Now, did your unit,
         11  during that same movement into the centre of
         12  Srebrenica, did your unit, or later on any of the other
         13  units which came down into the town, engage in setting
         14  any of the houses on fire or individual searches of the
         15  houses that were in the area?
         16       A.   As far as I remember, only one house was
         17  burnt and it was at the entrance, when you enter the
         18  town from the south side.  It was close to the mosque,
         19  and it was when the NATO planes had already thrown
         20  their bomb.  And of course the members did take part in
         21  the search -- in searching the houses and buildings in
         22  the town of Srebrenica.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  At that time was anything done
         24  during the period that your unit was in Srebrenica to
         25  the mosques, either one?

          1       A.   No.  Only from the first mosque, the flag had
          2  been lowered, taken off the mosque.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Moving on to Branjevo.
          4  You said that in the course of the afternoon, something
          5  between 1.000 to 1.200 people, you estimated, were
          6  killed.  Were the bodies just left as each unit of
          7  ten -- as each group of ten was brought to be
          8  executed?  Were the bodies of those that were already
          9  executed just left there, or during the period you were
         10  there, did any kind of loading and carrying away of the
         11  bodies, putting them on trucks, et cetera, take place?
         12       A.   No.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  So in other words, as each new
         14  group of ten came up to be executed, they were brought
         15  up to the place where they could see all the bodies of
         16  the people who had been previously executed just lying
         17  there; is that right?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19            JUDGE WALD:  Incidentally, were the drivers
         20  of the buses that brought the victims to the Branjevo
         21  Farm, you mentioned that at one point it was said, "We
         22  don't want them to be witnesses," were they civilians?
         23  Were they police, military, what?  The drivers of the
         24  buses that brought the victims.
         25       A.   I only know that they drove civilian buses.

          1  Whether they were members of the military or not, I
          2  can't answer that.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  So you don't remember whether
          4  they wore any kind of distinguishing uniform or just
          5  civilian clothes?
          6       A.   I don't remember.
          7            JUDGE WALD:  Now, when you got to Pilica, you
          8  showed us where the cafe was and it was across the
          9  state from the Pilica Dom where the detainees were kept
         10  inside.  Now, this was, I gather, in the middle of the
         11  afternoon.  Were there any other people around in the
         12  area?  This is the middle of town, as I understand it.
         13  Besides the group that was with you in the cafe and the
         14  people who were inside the Dom across the street, there
         15  were no ordinary townspeople around?
         16       A.   Well, there were people there.  Between these
         17  two buildings there was a checkpoint of the civilian
         18  police, and people did pass by in cars.  And right next
         19  to the hall, there were houses, inhabited ones.  Yes,
         20  there were civilians.
         21            JUDGE WALD:  So there were some people around
         22  on the streets while this was happening.
         23       A.   Yes.  Yes.  Traffic was passing.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  You told us, I believe, that you
         25  heard the shots, and later detonations, inside the

          1  Pilica Cultural Dom across the street.  Did you see
          2  people attempting to escape or being shot outside the
          3  Dom, in front of the Dom, or did you just hear the
          4  sounds that were going on inside, while you were in the
          5  cafe?
          6       A.   When we arrived at the cafe, and when we
          7  turned off from the main road to get in front of the
          8  cafe to park the car, I saw people in front lying on
          9  the ground.  While I was in the cafe itself, I heard
         10  shooting and bombs.
         11            JUDGE WALD:  But did you actually yourself
         12  see anybody being shot and fall in front of the Pilica
         13  Dom?
         14       A.   No.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  My last question.  You
         16  and some of your colleagues from the 10th Unit were
         17  brought to Pilica, and then you say you went into the
         18  cafe and you sat down, you waited, and soon somebody
         19  came and said words to the effect that, "Well, it's
         20  over, and those who have survived have survived."  Did
         21  anybody ever explain why they brought you there if all
         22  you were going to do is sit in the cafe and watch from
         23  across the street?
         24       A.   Well, I couldn't see what was actually
         25  happening across the street.  Nobody had told me

          1  anything, told me why.  We were just told that there
          2  was to be a meeting of some kind, but as I noticed,
          3  there wasn't any meeting.  A man from Bratunac came and
          4  said that everything was over, that it was finished.
          5  When he came and said this, the Lieutenant Colonel got
          6  up and said, "Those who have stayed alive have stayed
          7  alive."  I don't know why he said that.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  My last question would be:
          9  Roughly what is your estimated number of the bodies
         10  that you actually saw outside the Pilica Dom?
         11       A.   I can't say with any certainty, but perhaps
         12  10 or 15.  I don't know exactly.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  Thank you.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Judge Wald.
         15            Mr. Erdemovic, I would like just to follow
         16  with you a little bit some of the phases of these
         17  unfortunate events.
         18            You said when you came into Srebrenica, at
         19  first they met a civilian who pleaded that he was not
         20  in the army and still Mr. Pelemis ordered to slit his
         21  throat.  That was just at the beginning.  What was the
         22  purpose, really, of that?
         23       A.   Well, it happened, as far as I was able to
         24  see, in Srebrenica, in the centre of town, where the
         25  second mosque was located.  What the purpose was of

          1  that killing I could only assume.  I assume that it was
          2  because perhaps he was of an age for the army, an age
          3  for military service.  I don't know, actually, what the
          4  purpose was.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Was it to intimidate the
          6  people?  I mean, just a sign to show them what's going
          7  to happen to them?  What was the reason?
          8       A.   I cannot say that.  I just cannot say.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  It was in front of all the
         10  people.  It was in broad daylight.
         11       A.   Yes, it was.  It happened in front of the
         12  soldiers.  There were no civilians there.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  There were no civilians.  Now,
         14  then they called on the people to move to the stadium.
         15  Were men and women included, or was it just for the
         16  men?
         17       A.   From the very beginning, when we moved into
         18  town, we called out to people, if there was anybody in
         19  the house to come out, because the houses would be
         20  searched, and we were told that we weren't allowed to
         21  fire at civilians.  So we called out to any civilians
         22  there, to come out of their houses and to move towards
         23  the stadium.  This was at the entrance to the town.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  All the people, you called on
         25  all the people of Srebrenica to move to the stadium.

          1       A.   Yes, from all the houses, if there was
          2  anybody in the houses, but there were only some 200
          3  people, in my assessment, who came out of those
          4  houses.  They were invalids, elderly people who found
          5  it difficult to walk, elderly women.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  And they moved to the stadium
          7  too?
          8       A.   They were moving in front of us.  I don't
          9  know where the stadium was or if it existed.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Were they included in the
         11  execution?  These people who you said were old, the
         12  infirm, those who could not walk, they also went to the
         13  buses, to the execution?
         14       A.   I don't know that.  I didn't see it.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  You didn't see that.  But what
         16  kind of people were being executed then, exactly?  Any
         17  women between them, to start with?
         18       A.   No.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Any old people?
         20       A.   I already said that they were between the
         21  ages of 17 and 60 or 70 years of age.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Between 17 and 70.  Those who
         23  were not between 17 and 70, what happened to them?
         24       A.   I don't know.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  But you were there.

          1       A.   Please could you explain your question.  I
          2  know I was there but --
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  What happened to the people who
          4  were not executed?  Were they left to stay at their
          5  homes?  What happened to them?  If everybody had to go
          6  to the stadium, was there any separation, or did
          7  everybody have the same fate?
          8       A.   All those people who had remained in their
          9  houses when we entered the town, they were told to come
         10  out and move in front of us in the direction of the
         11  football stadium in Srebrenica.  But I never reached
         12  that stadium, nor did I actually see this separation,
         13  the separation of these people, the individuals there.
         14  I just said that I know that the people that were
         15  brought to the farm were between the ages of 17 and
         16  70.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned also that Stanko
         18  Savanovic was bragging that he killed between 200 and
         19  300 men, and the squadron, the killing squad, was about
         20  eight people.  You who were killing, you were eight?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  If you count, then I think that
         23  reach -- was it a competition of who would kill more?
         24       A.   Well, that was it.  Actually, he did it --
         25  some people, after the first shooting, would fall down

          1  but they were not actually dead, and later on he would
          2  finish them on with his pistol.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  There was also shooting, as you
          4  said, by machine-guns and people were not killed, they
          5  were hurt and some of them were not killed.  Were they
          6  all finished after this?
          7       A.   Yes.  Yes, and Stanko Savanovic did most of
          8  that.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  There were no survivors, because
         10  you said the Lieutenant Colonel said, "Those who
         11  survived have survived."  Were there some survivors, in
         12  your opinion?
         13       A.   I can't say now whether there were or
         14  weren't.  I didn't examine all the people to be able to
         15  ascertain that.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  I think you mentioned something
         17  about -- when you mentioned about the cafe, you said
         18  after 15 minutes you were in the cafe and a man came
         19  and said everything was over.  What did you understand
         20  from that?
         21       A.   Well, that the execution in the Dom was over,
         22  and I didn't hear any more shooting after he had said
         23  that.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  So it was clear that he was
         25  speaking of the execution.

          1       A.   Well, to me it was clear that he was speaking
          2  of the execution because nothing else could have been
          3  over, finished.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you have an idea of who was
          5  in the Dom?
          6       A.   When that Lieutenant Colonel came towards the
          7  end, when everything was drawing to a conclusion at the
          8  Pilica farm, he said that there were 500 Muslims from
          9  Srebrenica who wanted to break through, so that I
         10  concluded that they were Muslims from Srebrenica.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Erdemovic, thank you very
         12  much.  Your testimony is over, and I repeat that we
         13  appreciate your coming.  Thank you very much.  You will
         14  now go out.
         15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] May I just ask
         16  a question of the President.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  And also I will request
         18  that if you have anything to add, you are welcome to
         19  add it, whether it's a question or whether it's any
         20  statement.
         21            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I should like
         22  to say that everything that occurred in Srebrenica,
         23  that against Mr. -- that is to say, General, against
         24  the General, I don't know him and I don't know that he
         25  issued any orders.  And I should like to thank his

          1  Defence counsel for their correct and proper conduct
          2  towards me.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Would you like to say anything
          4  else in general about your experience?
          5            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I hope that it
          6  is not repeated ever again to anyone.  That it doesn't
          7  happen to anyone ever again, that is my greatest wish.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  We share very much this wish.
          9  Thank you very much, Mr. Erdemovic.
         10                 [The witness withdrew]
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Harmon, we have ten minutes
         12  to go.  You can use them the way you like.
         13            MR. HARMON:  I would first like,
         14  Mr. President, Judge Riad, and Judge Wald, to introduce
         15  the exhibits that have been testified about by
         16  Mr. Erdemovic, and if I could move into evidence, then,
         17  the following exhibits:  28/17, which is a photograph;
         18  a film, which was Prosecutor's Exhibit 145; 147, which
         19  was a photograph; 148, which was a film; 152 through
         20  157, which were photographs; 158 as well, which was a
         21  photograph; Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/4; and Prosecutor's
         22  Exhibits 170 through 175, which were photographs.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Harmon.
         24            I assume that the Defence counsel has no
         25  objection.

          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No,
          2  Mr. President.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
          4            MR. HARMON:  We have no additional evidence
          5  today, Judge Riad.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  As I've mentioned before,
          7  tomorrow I will be the Presiding Judge, and we'll
          8  resume exactly our testimonies in the same way.  So
          9  we'll start tomorrow at 9.30.
         10            The hearing is adjourned.
         11                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
         12                 2.03 p.m., to be reconvened on Tuesday,
         13                 the 23rd day of May, 2000, at 9.30 a.m.
