          3                 [The witness entered court]

          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning.  I would like to
          7  greet the parties, the accused, and all the ladies and
          8  gentlemen whose cooperation is making this trial
          9  possible, and I extend my greetings to the public, who

         14  Radislav Krstic.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Egbers, good morning.  We
         16  are proceeding with your testimony and, I think, it is
         17  Mr. Mark Harmon who is in charge.  Please proceed, Mr.
         18  Harmon.
         19            THE WITNESS:  Good morning.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Thank you.  Good morning, Your
         21  Honours.  Good morning to my colleagues for the
         22  Defence, and good morning, Captain Egbers.
         23                 WITNESS:  VINCENTIUS BERNARDUS EGBERS
         24                 [Resumed]
         25                 Examined by Mr. Harmon: [Cont'd]

          1       Q.   Captain Egbers, when we finished your
          2  testimony yesterday, you were describing events that
          3  occurred on the 13th of July when you were escorting a
          4  convoy of Muslim women and children in the direction of
          5  Kladanj, and you had stopped your testimony after you
          6  were describing your observations of prisoners held in
          7  a football field in Nova Kasaba.  That's where we left
          8  off.
          9            I'd like you then, please, Captain Egbers, to
         10  continue, and would you describe your principal
         11  observations that you made on your journey toward
         12  Kladanj.
         13       A.   When I crossed the town Nova Kasaba, I headed
         14  south for Milici and then to the west, towards
         15  Vlasenica, and it was on this road that one of the
         16  buses broke down, from another convoy, I guess.  And I
         17  managed to stop a red Volkswagen with four military
         18  Bosnian Serbs, dressed in black overalls in it.  I saw
         19  one of the Bosnian Serb military was a colonel of the
         20  Bosnian Serb army, and I asked him to arrange an empty
         21  bus for the women and children who were in this broken
         22  bus.
         23       Q.   Did he do so?
         24       A.   Yes, he did, sir.
         25       Q.   Did the bus and did you then proceed in the

          1  direction of Kladanj?
          2       A.   Yes, we did.
          3       Q.   Did you arrive at a location where the Muslim
          4  women and children were discharged from the buses?
          5       A.   I reached the same point as the day before,
          6  where the women and children had to leave the buses and
          7  walk.
          8       Q.   And was there anything eventful at that
          9  particular location, or was it rather uneventful?
         10       A.   It was the same scene as the day before.
         11       Q.   Now, after all of the Muslim women and
         12  children were discharged from the buses, did you return
         13  back along the same route, in the direction of
         14  Potocari?
         15       A.   Yes, sir, I did.
         16       Q.   Tell the Judges what happened next.
         17       A.   I was stopped at a roadblock before entering
         18  the village of Nova Kasaba.
         19       Q.   Now, would you take the pointer that's next
         20  to you and would you approach Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E,
         21  and can you point on the large map, the location where
         22  you were stopped at the roadblock.
         23       A.   I was stopped at this location [indicates].
         24            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, it
         25  appears to be south of the town of Nova Kasaba.

          1       Q.   What happened at that location, Captain
          2  Egbers?
          3       A.   At that location there were a through
          4  infantry men pointing their AK-47s at us and telling us
          5  to stop.  They had -- they told us to get out of the
          6  car.  They took our car, drove it away, checked the
          7  car, checked our identification, and held us there.
          8       Q.   When you say "us", who are you referring to?
          9       A.   Well, at first I thought it was just the
         10  driver and myself who were there, but when I checked I
         11  saw other Dutch UN troops sitting on the side of the
         12  road, guarded by Bosnian Serb soldiers.
         13       Q.   How many UN Dutch troops were being guarded
         14  by UN -- by Serbian soldiers?
         15       A.   About ten at that time, I thought.
         16       Q.   And how many UN vehicles were in the area?
         17       A.   At that time there were four UN Mercedes
         18  light vehicles in the nearance [sic] of the roadblock.
         19       Q.   Were those soldiers and the vehicles free to
         20  leave that location or were they being detained?
         21       A.   We were not free to leave.  We had to wait at
         22  the side of the road.
         23       Q.   What did you do next?
         24       A.   I asked to speak with the commander in
         25  charge.

          1       Q.   The commander in charge of what?
          2       A.   The commander in charge of the soldiers who
          3  were pointing their guns at us, at the roadblock nearby
          4  Nova Kasaba.
          5       Q.   What happened next?
          6       A.   Then one of the conscripts, a soldier who
          7  could speak English, took me to a Major Zoran Malinic,
          8  who was in charge of the troops who were pointing their
          9  guns at us.
         10       Q.   Where did he take you in relation to the
         11  roadblock?  How far away?
         12       A.   It was about 100 metres from this road.
         13  There was a school, and this school was their
         14  headquarters.
         15            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have
         16  Prosecutor's Exhibit 87 and then Prosecutor's Exhibit
         17  88 given to the usher and also disseminated to the
         18  Court and counsel.
         19       Q.   I'd like to start with Prosecutor's Exhibit
         20  87 and place that on the ELMO and ask you, Captain
         21  Egbers, you have seen this particular exhibit in my
         22  office before coming to testify, have you not?
         23       A.   I have, sir.
         24       Q.   And were you able to identify in Prosecutor's
         25  Exhibit 87 the location where you were taken?

          1       A.   I did, sir.
          2       Q.   Could you take the pointer, please, and
          3  indicate where, on Prosecutor's Exhibit 87, you were
          4  taken by that conscript soldier?
          5       A.   Well, this is the road going towards Nova
          6  Kasaba [indicates], and the roadblock was over here on
          7  the road [indicates].  And this is a small path towards
          8  the school [indicates], and this is the school that was
          9  used as a headquarters.  This is a parking place and
         10  this is a small building [indicates].
         11            MR. HARMON:  For the record, when Captain
         12  Egbers has said "this is the road going to Nova
         13  Kasaba," he was referring to the large road that goes
         14  from the top, toward the right-hand side of the
         15  diagram.  It's the main road.
         16            When he was referring to the building where
         17  he was taken, he's referring to the large buildings at
         18  the lower portion of this Prosecutor's Exhibit.
         19            When he referred to the parking lot, he was
         20  referring to the area in front of the large building
         21  that appears to have two buses on it, and the small
         22  building is at the end of a long road, the main road
         23  leading to Nova Kasaba, prior to entering into the
         24  parking lot.
         25       Q.   Now, when you went to this -- let me show you

          1  the next exhibit, Prosecutor's Exhibit 88, and if that
          2  could be placed on the ELMO.  Do you recognise the
          3  building in Prosecutor's 88?
          4       A.   This is the school which I've just mentioned
          5  before.
          6       Q.   Okay.  This is the large building; is that
          7  correct?
          8       A.   This is the large building, used as a
          9  headquarters.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. Usher.  I've
         11  completed with these exhibits.
         12       Q.   When you arrived at the large building,
         13  Captain Egbers, you said you met a Captain Zoran
         14  Malinic?
         15       A.   He was a Major and his name was Malinic.
         16       Q.   Could you describe him, please?
         17       A.   He was about 40 years old, dressed in a green
         18  T-shirt, green camouflage trousers, black shoes, black
         19  hair, and one particular part of his hair was grey.  I
         20  think it was grey from his birth on.
         21       Q.   How did he identify himself to you?  Did he
         22  identify himself as being the individual in charge of
         23  the roadblock?
         24       A.   He told me that he was -- that his soldiers
         25  were handling that roadblock.

          1       Q.   Did he tell you where he was from?
          2       A.   He told me that he was in charge of three
          3  battalions that were surrounding Sarajevo, and he had
          4  to take one battalion and head for Srebrenica.
          5       Q.   Now, did you make a complaint to Major Zoran
          6  Malinic about your detention and the detention of the
          7  other UN soldiers at the roadblock?
          8       A.   Yes.  Not only did I mention the stolen
          9  vehicles, but I also mentioned the stolen guns, the
         10  stolen body armours, blue helmets, and I asked him to
         11  escort us back to Potocari so we could escort another
         12  convoy of deported women and children towards Kladanj.
         13       Q.   Now, let me ask you, Captain Egbers, did you
         14  prepare -- was it an oral complaint or was it a written
         15  complaint, or was it both?
         16       A.   I first told this Major that we couldn't
         17  accept the things that were going on at the time.  Then
         18  we had the time to type it all out in
         19  Serbian/Croatian.  There was an interpreter, he had a
         20  writing machine, and he wrote down a statement from me
         21  at the time, to be signed by this Major Zoran.  And he
         22  got a copy of this written letter -- how can you call
         23  this?
         24       Q.   Your complaint?
         25       A.   Letter of complaint, yes.

          1       Q.   Let me ask you, do you know a sergeant Mulder
          2  who was a Dutch soldier?
          3       A.   Sergeant Mulder came to us at the school and
          4  he told me about the things he had to be done -- he had
          5  to do for his Bosnian Serb soldiers he met on the way,
          6  and I complained about that as well.
          7       Q.   Could you tell the Judges what Sergeant
          8  Mulder told you and about what you complained to Major
          9  Malinic?
         10       A.   Well, he was stopped by Bosnian Serbs.  He
         11  had to sit on the front of one of the Dutch APCs,
         12  driven by Bosnian Serbs who were wearing blue helmets.
         13  He had an AK-47 given to him, and at first --
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  Who was wearing blue
         15  helmets, the UN or the Serbs?
         16            THE WITNESS:  The Serbs were --
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Are they entitled to wear blue
         18  helmets?
         19            THE WITNESS:  No, of course not, sir.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         21            MR. HARMON:
         22       Q.   Please continue with your description of what
         23  happened to Sergeant Mulder.
         24       A.   Well, at first he had to sit on the front of
         25  the APC and the Bosnian Serbs would drive this APC on

          1  the road and through the woods, and he had to call for
          2  the Muslims to come to the UN, that it was safe, and he
          3  had to shoot them when he saw them.
          4            Later on he had to do the same thing but not
          5  with an AK-47, but just shouting into the woods that it
          6  was safe for them to come out and join the UN.
          7       Q.   Who told Sergeant Mulder that he had to shoot
          8  the Muslims who were coming out of the woods?
          9       A.   Those were the Bosnian Serbs who were on one
         10  side of the road, facing -- facing the woods where the
         11  Muslims were at that time.
         12       Q.   And who told Sergeant Mulder that he,
         13  Sergeant Mulder, had to shoot the Muslims?
         14       A.   Well, he told me that it was told by the
         15  driver and the other guys that were on the APC.
         16       Q.   Now, what did Major Malinic say to that
         17  complaint?
         18       A.   Well, he said he wasn't the one who could do
         19  anything with this complaint, he had to inform his
         20  superior, which was a colonel called Beara.
         21       Q.   Now, let me ask you this question, Captain:
         22  At some point in time, while you were in this vicinity,
         23  did you order your soldiers to take the APCs that had
         24  been detained and returned to Potocari?
         25       A.   Well, I asked this Major Zoran why we

          1  couldn't go back to Potocari to escort another convoy
          2  towards Kladanj, because we were held over there.  He
          3  told me that there were a lot of other battalions
          4  gathering around the area of Srebrenica because there
          5  were a lot of Muslims in the woods, that they didn't
          6  expect that many Muslims.
          7       Q.   Did --
          8       A.   Sorry.  I'm just waiting for the
          9  translation.
         10       Q.   All right.
         11       A.   He told me that it was -- that he didn't have
         12  any influence on those troops and it was better for our
         13  own safety to stay with him, at his place, at that
         14  time.
         15       Q.   Did you direct two of your APCs that had been
         16  detained at the roadblock, nevertheless, to return to
         17  Potocari?
         18       A.   Well, there were no APCs, they were just
         19  light Mercedes vehicles.  We had four Mercedes vehicles
         20  with us at that time, and I ordered three of them, with
         21  UN troops, to go towards Nova Kasaba and try to reach
         22  Potocari.
         23       Q.   What happened to those soldiers and what
         24  happened to those vehicles?
         25       A.   Well, about 200 metres, they were stopped by

          1  men carrying AK-47s, they were pointed at their heads,
          2  and they had to all go back to the school in just one
          3  Mercedes instead of three.  They took two Mercedes.
          4  And they came back with just one Mercedes.
          5       Q.   What did you then decide to do?
          6       A.   I decided to stay at the school, report in
          7  headquarters at Potocari that another two vehicles were
          8  stolen, and I wanted guarantees from this Major Zoran
          9  that he would be able to guarantee a safe way back to
         10  Potocari.
         11       Q.   Now, while you were at the school or in the
         12  area of the roadblock, did you see stolen UN APCs
         13  driven by Bosnian Serb soldiers, dressed in stolen UN
         14  gear?
         15       A.   Yes.  There was one APC that was driven by a
         16  Bosnian Serb, wearing a blue helmet.
         17       Q.   Did you spend the night at the location of
         18  this particular school?
         19       A.   Yes, I did, sir.
         20       Q.   That night, did you hear any gunfire?
         21       A.   Yes, there was a lot of gunfire, there was a
         22  machine-gun, but they used it not the way we were told,
         23  just to make a few rounds.  There were about 100
         24  rounds, and then they stopped, and then another 100
         25  rounds.  So it was a long machine-gun fire we heard.

          1       Q.   Were you able to tell the direction from
          2  which that fire was coming?
          3       A.   No, we were not.
          4       Q.   How far away from this school, that is
          5  identified in Prosecutor's Exhibit 87, was the football
          6  pitch at Nova Kasaba?
          7       A.   About 800, 900 metres, I think.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Now, let me ask the usher once
          9  again to please put Prosecutor's Exhibit 87 on the
         10  ELMO.
         11       Q.   And let me ask you, Captain Egbers, while you
         12  were detained at this school, did you have an
         13  opportunity to inspect a small building that was
         14  located on the compound where you were being detained?
         15       A.   Yes, sir.  The next day I was able to check
         16  this little building for a few minutes [indicates],
         17  where they were holding Muslims.
         18            MR. HARMON:  For the record, Captain Egbers
         19  has pointed to a small building.  It appears to be a
         20  white dot on the road leading from the main road to
         21  Nova Kasaba, the road then leads from that main road to
         22  the school, there is a small white building in the
         23  centre of the page.
         24       Q.   Now, could you tell the Judges, please,
         25  Captain Egbers, your observations at that particular

          1  building.
          2       A.   Well, there was a fence, and behind the fence
          3  there were about 30 Muslim men sitting and waiting, and
          4  a few of them were wounded.  One of them was wounded in
          5  the belly and another one had a blue face.
          6       Q.   How long did you remain at the location where
          7  you made these observations?
          8       A.   A few minutes.  They wouldn't -- in the
          9  beginning we couldn't enter the building, and on day
         10  number 2, we were allowed to check in for a few minutes
         11  because we were complaining about the gunshots.
         12       Q.   And then what happened?
         13       A.   Later on that day, when I was making contact
         14  with Potocari, the school had been shot by a few rounds
         15  of just a rifle.  We don't know where it came from, but
         16  the Bosnian Serbs certainly reacted on this fire.
         17       Q.   How did they react?
         18       A.   Well, at first they fired a few mortars; then
         19  they fired with their machine-guns on top of their
         20  APCs; and then they took out two boys from this
         21  building and forced them as a shield towards, they
         22  thought, where the firing was coming from.
         23       Q.   Were these boys Muslim boys?
         24       A.   Yes, they were, sir.
         25       Q.   Did you see these boys return later?

          1       A.   Yes, I saw them return, and they were locked
          2  up again.  And they told us that they couldn't find the
          3  shooters.
          4       Q.   Okay.  Now, at some point in time, did a man
          5  arrive at this location who was identified as Colonel
          6  Beara?
          7       A.   Yes, sir.  He drove in a normal, personal
          8  car, and I approached him with my letter of complaint,
          9  as you call it that way.  I introduced myself.  I told
         10  him that we were held at a location and that we had to
         11  go back to Potocari to escort other convoys, and I
         12  asked him whether he could take care of the fact that
         13  we could be brought back to Potocari or escorted back
         14  to Potocari safely.
         15       Q.   What happened then?
         16       A.   He said he would look into the matter and he
         17  would contact us through this Major Zoran.
         18       Q.   Were you later contacted by Major Zoran?
         19       A.   No, we were not.  We were just -- we had to
         20  stay there, and he didn't say anything to us, so that's
         21  when I negotiated with Potocari, our headquarters,
         22  because of the fact that we were dressed in green
         23  T-shirts and green trousers, and the Bosnian Serbs were
         24  wearing our gear, our blue helmets, our armoured
         25  vests.  So there was no difference between peacekeepers

          1  and Bosnian Serbs.  I thought we had to leave the place
          2  as soon as possible.  That's when I asked clearance
          3  from Potocari to leave the two UN Mercedes behind at
          4  the school and asked for transportation in one of their
          5  APCs towards Potocari.
          6       Q.   Were you transported back to Potocari in a
          7  Bosnian Serb military vehicle?
          8       A.   I was, sir.
          9       Q.   Now --
         10       A.   It was a BOV, with four large wheels, and
         11  they were bringing us back towards the same road, of
         12  course, towards Bratunac and then to the enclave.
         13       Q.   When you say "BOV," I'm not familiar with
         14  that term, and I don't think the Judges are either.
         15  Could you explain what a BOV is?
         16       A.   It's a troop transportation vehicle, armed --
         17  armoured, with a machine-gun on top, with no -- with
         18  four big wheels they use to transport their troops.
         19       Q.   Now, in route back to Potocari, did you take
         20  the same route up through Nova Kasaba, Konjevic Polje,
         21  past Sandici, Kravica, Glogova, Bratunac, and then to
         22  Potocari.  Let me repeat for the benefit of the court
         23  reporter.  Did you travel along the route that took you
         24  past Nova Kasaba, Konjevic Polje, Sandici, Kravica,
         25  Glogova, Bratunac, and then to Potocari?

          1       A.   Yes, I did, sir.
          2       Q.   Could you describe to -- first of all, let me
          3  ask you this question:  Did you pass the football field
          4  at Nova Kasaba again?
          5       A.   Yes, I did.
          6       Q.   Could you describe to the Judges what you saw
          7  at that particular location?
          8       A.   There were no men left on the football
          9  field.  The football field was empty.
         10       Q.   Did you make any other significant
         11  observations in route back to Potocari that you can
         12  tell the Judges about?
         13       A.   I saw a lot of luggage burning on the side of
         14  the road.  I saw a lot of infantry facing the woods
         15  where the Muslims -- they thought the Muslims should
         16  be.  And I saw one dead body lying on the road we were
         17  travelling on.
         18       Q.   Are you able to describe more fully the dead
         19  body?
         20       A.   It was an old man, still carrying his
         21  rucksack, laying on his back in the middle of the
         22  road.
         23       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much, Captain
         24  Egbers.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, I've concluded my
          1  direct examination of Captain Egbers.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Harmon.
          3            Captain Egbers, you will now be asked to
          4  answer the questions of the Defence counsel.
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
          6  Your Honours, my learned friends.
          7                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
          8       Q.   Good morning, Captain Egbers.  On the 8th of
          9  July, late in the afternoon, you received the order and
         10  started for Srebrenica and the observation post.
         11       A.   Yes, I did.
         12       Q.   You set off to identify, to establish, the
         13  line of confrontation between the Serb and the Muslim
         14  forces.
         15       A.   That was my first -- that's correct.
         16       Q.   And at a distance of some four kilometres
         17  before that place, Muslim soldiers threw hand grenades
         18  at your vehicles.
         19       A.   That's correct as well.
         20       Q.   After that you headed for the Bravo Company
         21  in Srebrenica.
         22       A.   That's correct, sir.
         23       Q.   And there you could see very well what was
         24  happening in the area of Srebrenica.
         25       A.   Well, that's not totally correct.  At first I

          1  had to tell my Captain Groen at the time where the
          2  confrontation line between the Bosnian Serbs and
          3  Muslims was, without being taken by the Bosnian Muslims
          4  in their blocking position.  When they threw grenades
          5  at my two APCs, I decided to go back to this Captain
          6  Groen and reported that I couldn't stay there without
          7  being taken by the Muslims to -- to act in their
          8  blocking position.  So Captain Groen told me to go to
          9  another place nearby, not on his compound but towards
         10  the place I've said on the map, it's called blocking
         11  position 1, and when I was there I could see in the
         12  south of the enclave.
         13       Q.   That evening you spotted a number of groups
         14  of Muslim combatants.
         15       A.   I did, sir.
         16       Q.   They were wearing camouflage or Ukrainian
         17  uniforms.
         18       A.   Well, a few were wearing pieces of Ukrainian
         19  uniforms, but most of them were dressed in civilian
         20  clothes.
         21       Q.   And your battalion was also a part of the UN
         22  mission, wasn't it, the Dutch Battalion?
         23       A.   The Dutch battalion was a part of UNPROFOR,
         24  certainly.
         25       Q.   No, my question was about the Ukrainian

          1  battalion, which also made part of the UN mission,
          2  didn't it?
          3       A.   It did.
          4       Q.   As to the armament of those groups, or rather
          5  Muslim soldiers that you could see, they were carrying
          6  automatic rifles, AK-47s, and machine-guns, weren't
          7  they?
          8       A.   They were Muslim fighters who were carrying
          9  those guns you've described.
         10       Q.   Captain Egbers, yesterday in your testimony
         11  you mentioned anti-tank weapons.  Are these weapons
         12  RPG-7s?  Is that what you meant?
         13       A.   Yesterday I testified that when I entered the
         14  marketplace, there were anti-tank weapons and those
         15  weapons were called RPG-7s.
         16       Q.   All these happenings you describe now
         17  happened on the 8th of July.  Now, on the 9th of July,
         18  you received the order from your command to provide
         19  support for the remaining four vehicles that you had.
         20       A.   Yes.  On the 9th of July I was ordered to
         21  support the four APCs who were on the marketplace in
         22  Srebrenica.
         23       Q.   As you were leaving that position, the Muslim
         24  soldiers opened fire on you, didn't they?
         25       A.   Yes, that's true.  One of the gunners, we had

          1  two gunners who were above the armour, was hit, not
          2  seriously, but there was gunfire at us from the
          3  Muslims.  That's correct, sir.
          4       Q.   Captain Egbers, the Medecins Sans Frontiers
          5  evacuated the Srebrenica hospital.  Could you tell us
          6  if that happened on the 10th of July?
          7       A.   Well, it happened on the same day the two
          8  Dutch F-16s attacked [sic] the enclave and we could go
          9  back to Bravo Company.  And before the Bosnian Serbs
         10  entered the city, we took the sick and ill from the
         11  hospital in our vehicle and drove with them towards
         12  Potocari.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  You said two Dutch
         14  F-16s attacked the enclave --
         15       A.   No, they supported us, that is, close air
         16  support.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  It says here "Two Dutch F-16s
         18  attacked the enclave."
         19       A.   That was not correct, sir.  They carried out
         20  a close air support mission.  And on that day, when
         21  that was finished, we could go to the compound of the
         22  Bravo Company, and then at that time Doctors Without
         23  Borders, should I call it this way, they told us or
         24  they asked us whether it was safe to go to the hospital
         25  and take the patients, and asked us to move those

          1  patients towards Potocari.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
          3            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
          4       Q.   And apart from this close air support that
          5  day, was that the only air support that was provided in
          6  the protected area?
          7       A.   It was the only thing I saw.
          8       Q.   In your vehicle you drove some sick.  Do you
          9  mean the patients who were sick and lying there in the
         10  Srebrenica hospital, or were there amongst them also
         11  wounded people, people who had sustained woundings
         12  during one of those days, as of the 6th of July
         13  onwards?
         14       A.   There were only sick people, as well as
         15  mentally ill people, as well as women who were carrying
         16  babies on my vehicle, and I don't know whether there
         17  were wounded from shelling which happened from the 6th
         18  of July.
         19       Q.   Captain Egbers, in your testimony you said
         20  that the Serbs -- the Serb soldiers had surrounded the
         21  enclave so tightly that even your colleagues, your
         22  officers, fellow officers who had been on leave, could
         23  not come back to the enclave, that the Serbs would not
         24  let them get into the enclave.
         25       A.   That's correct, sir.

          1       Q.   Members of two SAS units were not members of
          2  the UN peace force, were they?
          3       A.   I don't know, sir.
          4       Q.   But the members of these two British special
          5  units, do you know, were you aware, of their presence
          6  in the enclave?
          7       A.   Yes, they were in the enclave, sir.
          8       Q.   Let me just clarify.  To my previous question
          9  you said that you did not know whether they were
         10  members -- whether they were part of the peace corps,
         11  of the peace force.
         12       A.   Well, they were staying at HQ from DutchBat.
         13  So they were wearing blue helmets, but of course they
         14  were not from our battalion.  But they were in the
         15  enclave.
         16       Q.   And they arrived in the enclave right before
         17  the 9th of July, didn't they, on the eve of the 9th of
         18  the July?
         19       A.   They were for a few months in the enclave.
         20  They were -- a few months we've spoken to them, I'd
         21  seen them a lot.
         22       Q.   Captain Egbers, your conversation with Major
         23  Malinic -- no.  Let me rephrase this.
         24            Did Major Malinic wait for Colonel Beara to
         25  authorise your departure from Nova Kasaba?

          1       A.   He only told me that he had to talk with his
          2  superior about us and we had to wait for him.
          3       Q.   So that superior was Colonel Beara.
          4       A.   I think that this colonel was the chief, the
          5  boss, of this Major Zoran.  That's what he told me.
          6       Q.   So you saw Colonel Beara, you talked to him.
          7  Did you happen to see the emblem, the insignia that he
          8  had, if he had any on his uniform?
          9       A.   He only wore a green infantry uniform, with
         10  his rank in yellow on it.  He didn't have any wolf
         11  emblems or anything like that on his uniform, sir.
         12       Q.   You spent quite a long time there, the whole
         13  afternoon and the next day.  Could you perhaps draw
         14  some conclusions as to what unit Major Malinic came
         15  from and thereby Colonel Beara too?  What unit?  Was
         16  that some special unit that they belonged to?
         17       A.   I only saw German Shepherd dogs that were at
         18  the school.  I've talked to this Major about his unit,
         19  and he told me that he was in charge of three
         20  battalions that normally would surround Sarajevo, and
         21  that he had to take one battalion and report, or
         22  something like that, at the surroundings of
         23  Srebrenica.  He was very well informed.  On his desk
         24  was a map of the enclave, and all the observation posts
         25  were on this map.  He knew what he was doing there.

          1  But he never told me from which unit he was.
          2       Q.   Captain Egbers, in your testimony you said
          3  that the Bosnian Muslim army was poorly dressed and
          4  poorly armed.  In your testimony you also drew certain
          5  conclusions, since you are an officer yourself.  And I
          6  should like to ask you something which has to do with
          7  those conclusions that you might have drawn.
          8            The Bosnian Muslim army was concentrated in
          9  Susnjari on the 10th and 11th of July and made a
         10  breakthrough the encirclement and reached Tuzla, some
         11  4.000 or 5.000 armed combatants.  Could you tell us,
         12  from your point of view, that is, what do you, as a
         13  military man, think?  How is it possible that such
         14  poorly organised, poorly dressed, poorly equipped
         15  troops succeeded in making that breakthrough?  How
         16  could it do that?
         17       A.   Well, I think they gathered all of the
         18  weapons in front of the party who had left the enclave,
         19  and perhaps the Bosnian Serbs weren't prepared for it.
         20  I don't know.  But what I saw, perhaps it wasn't the
         21  head of the men who would leave the enclave, perhaps I
         22  saw what was behind it, and they were very badly armed,
         23  almost no arms at all, and very -- and dressed in
         24  civilian clothes.
         25       Q.   Thank you, Captain Egbers.
          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours,
          2  I have no further questions.  Thank you.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Petrusic.
          4            Mr. Harmon, would you like to respond?
          5  Please proceed.
          6            MR. HARMON:  With just a few questions, Your
          7  Honour.
          8                 Re-examined by Mr. Harmon:
          9       Q.   You were asked by my learned friend about the
         10  Ukrainian battalion being part of the UN mission.
         11  Within the Srebrenica enclave, was there a Ukrainian
         12  battalion that was part of the UN mission?
         13       A.   No, sir, there was not.
         14       Q.   Where did the Ukrainian part of the UN
         15  mission quarter itself?
         16       A.   It was in the enclave of Zepa, in the south
         17  of our enclave, Srebrenica.
         18       Q.   You were also asked by my friend a question
         19  about your armoured personnel carrier being shot at by
         20  the Muslims.  I think it was, and correct me if I'm
         21  wrong, on the 9th of July; is that correct?
         22       A.   It was on the first day that I had to go
         23  south and make contact with Captain Groen.
         24       Q.   So you were essentially at a blocking
         25  position as the Serb army advanced into the enclave; is

          1  that correct?
          2       A.   That's correct.  But before that I -- because
          3  OP Echo and OP Foxtrot fell, the company commander in
          4  the south didn't know what was entering the enclave.
          5  So he told me to take two APCs and try to find the line
          6  of confrontation without being taken by one of the
          7  parties.
          8       Q.   Now, let me ask you, the expectation of the
          9  Bosnian Muslims within the Srebrenica enclave was that
         10  the UN battalion was there for their protection; is
         11  that correct?
         12       A.   That's correct, sir.
         13       Q.   And as you took your APC from the direction
         14  of the southern part of the enclave, did you travel
         15  with your APC, then, away from the southern part of the
         16  enclave, in the direction of Srebrenica?
         17       A.   I was -- when I saw those 50 infantry men
         18  entering the south of Srebrenica, I reported it to
         19  Captain Groen and he told me, "Go into your APCs and
         20  try to support them."  And I drove away from the
         21  Muslims.  Perhaps they thought that I was going to
         22  Potocari, or anything else, and that I would leave them
         23  alone.
         24       Q.   In thinking about why you received fire from
         25  the Muslims, do you have an opinion as to why they

          1  fired at you?
          2       A.   I couldn't explain to them why I was
          3  leaving.  I had to leave immediately to support the
          4  other four APCs, and that's why they thought that I was
          5  leaving them alone and we were finishing the blocking
          6  positions.  But we didn't, we went to the city of
          7  Srebrenica.  So that's why I think the lack of
          8  communication, and they were angry, and of course they
          9  were disappointed about what was going on in the south
         10  of the enclave, that they would fire a few rounds at
         11  us.
         12       Q.   So they were angry at you because they
         13  thought you were abandoning them at the southern part
         14  of the enclave; is that correct?
         15       A.   That's correct, sir.
         16       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much, Captain
         17  Egbers.
         18            MR. HARMON:  I have no additional questions,
         19  Your Honours.  Thank you.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Harmon.
         21            Judge Wald, would you like to ask your
         22  questions, if you have some.
         23                 Questioned by the Court:
         24            JUDGE WALD:  Captain Egbers, I want to go
         25  back to the incident that Sergeant Mulder reported to

          1  you when you were in Nova Kasaba.  As I recall your
          2  testimony, he said that he had been forced to go in a
          3  vehicle, with Serbs dressed in blue helmets, and to
          4  call out to people that it was okay to come in and
          5  surrender.
          6            Did he tell you, in fact, how many times that
          7  he was successful in doing that?  In other words, did
          8  he give you any notion of how many people did actually
          9  come out from the woods and answer to his call, if any?
         10       A.   He did not succeed.  Fortunately no one left
         11  the woods.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  So therefore he never was put in
         13  the position of having to shoot any of them if they did
         14  come out, even though you reported that that was what
         15  he had been told he had to do.
         16       A.   That's correct, ma'am.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Did he give you any idea of any
         18  specific threats that were held over his head to do
         19  that, such as whether or not they suggested they would
         20  kill him if he didn't do that?
         21       A.   He did, ma'am.  They pointed their AK-47s all
         22  the time at us.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  And said, "You do this or
         24  else."
         25       A.   Yes, ma'am.

          1            JUDGE WALD:  Did he or any of the other ten
          2  UN soldiers that were being held at that time say that
          3  others besides him were asked to do that kind of duty?
          4       A.   No, ma'am, nobody.  Only he.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  Only he was asked.  Okay.  Thank
          6  you.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Judge Wald.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  That's all.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         10            Captain Egbers, just to throw some more light
         11  on your already clear testimony, I'd like to ask you
         12  just a few questions.
         13            Just to start where Judge Wald stopped
         14  concerning Sergeant Mulder's incident.  Did you report
         15  this to the higher authorities, to the commanders of
         16  the Bosnian Serb divisions?
         17       A.   I had contact with this Major Zoran, and I
         18  complained to him about this action.  And it was all
         19  filled out on this written statement, in
         20  Bosnian/Serb -- so it was in Bosnian/Serb.  I
         21  complained to him about this incident, but also about
         22  the stolen gear from the UN and the use of it by the
         23  Bosnian Serbs.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Was there any action taken
         25  by them to restore what was stolen or to answer you

          1  about this violation, by calling the Muslims out to
          2  shoot them?  Did your complaint receive any answer or
          3  any action?
          4       A.   No, sir.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Was it repeated or was it the
          6  only incident, where you were being used to -- either
          7  your things taken, your clothes taken, or used to
          8  bring -- to pull out the Muslims for any purpose?
          9       A.   The vehicles that were stolen, that happened
         10  two days -- during two days.  The helmets and the
         11  armoured vests, those incidents happened all the time.
         12  And the Mulder incident just happened once.  But total
         13  we lost about 12 or 14 UN vehicles, and APCs were used
         14  by the Bosnian Serbs.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, to go to the football
         16  field, you passed by it, I think, on the 12th, near
         17  Nova Kasaba.  It was full of Muslims with their hands
         18  tied behind their necks.  Was that right?
         19       A.   I couldn't see whether they were tied or not,
         20  but their hands were on their neck.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Their hands were on their neck
         22  anyhow.  All their hands were on their neck, or were
         23  just some people brushing their hair?
         24       A.   All their hands were on their neck, and they
         25  were lined up.  So it was organised.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  It was organised.  Then you
          2  passed again and you found nobody at the football
          3  field.  You found it empty.
          4       A.   I did, sir.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  That was a day later, two days
          6  later?
          7       A.   One day later.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  One day later.  Was there any
          9  sign of what happened there, where these people went?
         10  Under the ground?  Over the ground?
         11       A.   It was almost dark and I couldn't see
         12  anything unusual on the football field at that time.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  No blood, nothing?
         14       A.   I didn't see that.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  You said you saw only luggage
         16  burning.  Was it on the field or beside it?
         17       A.   Not only on the field, but the entire road to
         18  Bratunac, there was places of luggage burning.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you think that that was the
         20  luggage of the people in the field?
         21       A.   I'm sure about that.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  But you never inquired about
         23  where the people went?
         24       A.   I did not, sir.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  And don't you think how many

          1  there were when you looked at the field?
          2       A.   I saw a few hundred men.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  A few hundred.  Now, you also
          4  mentioned at a certain stage that two Muslim boys were
          5  used as shields when they went out, but the boys came
          6  back.  Was this a recurring incident, where they would
          7  use people as shields, Muslim prisoners as shields?
          8       A.   I've only seen this happening once.  I don't
          9  know whether they had done it before.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  And how old were the boys?
         11       A.   I think about 14 or 15 years old.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  They were prisoners.  They were
         13  held prisoners.
         14       A.   They were held prisoners in the house that I
         15  pointed out.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Were there many children of that
         17  age held prisoner?
         18       A.   They were the youngest.  Most of the Muslims
         19  who were in that building were around 30, 40, 50 years
         20  old.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  But no women prisoners.
         22       A.   No, sir, no women.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  One of the last questions you
         24  were asked by Defence counsel was about what you said,
         25  the poor weapons and the poor dress of the Muslim

          1  combatants.  Being on the area, what was the source of
          2  weapons to the Muslims and to the Serbs?
          3       A.   I saw -- before the enclave fell, I was in
          4  the south and I saw there Muslims carrying weapons.
          5  They were -- I saw four, five, or six machine-guns; I
          6  saw AK-47s; I saw, during the fall of the enclave, I
          7  saw RPG-7s, and of course they had hand grenades.
          8            Bosnian Serbs, however, had vehicles, with
          9  anti-aircraft guns, had troop transportations,
         10  ambulances.  Every soldier had a weapon.  Not all the
         11  Muslims carried weapons because there were no weapons
         12  for all the men in the enclave.
         13            But I saw some Bosnian Muslims, groups, who
         14  were armed with the weapons I just told you --
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  What weapons?  Sorry.
         16       A.   Those AK-47s, a few machine-guns, and this
         17  one piece of artillery, which never fired.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Which never fired.
         19       A.   Never fired, sir.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  But there was a prohibition of
         21  weapon delivery from outside, wasn't there?
         22       A.   There was.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  For both sides.
         24       A.   No just -- the Muslims were not allowed to
         25  have weapons inside the enclave.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  I see.  Thank you very much.
          2            THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  I think this would be the end of
          4  your testimony, and we would like to thank you very
          5  much for your contribution.
          6            We'll have a break now, and if there are any
          7  exhibits, you are welcome to mention them.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  Thank you very much, Judge
          9  Riad.  I have four exhibits I would like to tender into
         10  evidence.  Prosecutor's Exhibit 87, which is the aerial
         11  image that Captain Egbers testified about; Prosecutor's
         12  Exhibit 88, which is a photograph of the school;
         13  Prosecutor's Exhibit 89, which is a large map of the
         14  enclave, showing the Charlie Company and Bravo Company;

         16  showing the blocking position taken by Captain Egbers.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Petrusic, any comment, or
         18  any exhibit you want?
         19            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] The Defence
         20  does not object to the exhibits tendered by the

         23            Thank you again, Captain Egbers.  And we'll

          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          4  morning.  For the record, let me just state that I will
          5  resume my capacity as Presiding Judge of the Trial
          6  Chamber.  Thank you to my colleagues who've enabled the
          7  hearing to go on.
          8            Witness, can you hear me?
          9            THE WITNESS:  [No audible response]
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         11  You are now going to read the solemn declaration that
         12  the usher will give you.
         13            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         14  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         15  truth.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         17  You may be seated.  Good morning to the interpreter,
         18  who is also under an oath.
         19            Witness, thank you very much for coming to
         20  testify before the Tribunal.  You are now going to
         21  answer questions that will be put to you by
         22  Mr. Cayley.
         23            Mr. Cayley, you have the floor.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         25  Welcome back to us.  Good morning, Your Honours; good
          1  morning, counsel.
          2                 WITNESS:  ANDRE STOELINGA
          3                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:
          4       Q.   Mr. Stoelinga, before we begin, we spoke
          5  before.  Between us, there is an interpreter, and there
          6  are a number of interpreters, so if you can try and
          7  remember to pause between my question and your answer,
          8  I will try to pace things quite slowly so that a pause
          9  naturally flows from my question.
         10            Your name is Andre Stoelinga.
         11       A.   That's correct.
         12       Q.   You were born in 1973; is that correct?
         13       A.   That is correct, too.
         14       Q.   And I think you joined the Royal Dutch army
         15  in January of 1994 on a two-year engagement.
         16       A.   That's also correct.
         17       Q.   And I think that your specialisation in the
         18  army was as a motorcycle dispatch rider; is that
         19  correct?
         20       A.   That's correct too.
         21       Q.   You left the army in January of 1997 as a
         22  private first class, and I think you're now a student;
         23  is that correct?
         24       A.   That's also correct.
         25       Q.   Did you serve with DutchBat III in the

          1  Srebrenica enclave from January of 1995 until July of
          2  1995.
          3       A.   That's also correct.
          4       Q.   Am I correct to say that in July of 1995 you
          5  were the driver of an armoured personnel carrier from
          6  the Dutch Battalion, based at observation post Kilo in
          7  the enclave?
          8       A.   Yes, I was.
          9       Q.   Could you just rise from your seat and look
         10  at Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E and just point to the Judges
         11  the location of your observation post in the enclave?
         12       A.   Observation post Kilo is here [indicates].
         13            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         14  witness has pointed to OP Kilo, which is located within
         15  the southern portion of the enclave, and the witness
         16  has pointed this out on Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E.
         17       Q.   Am I right in saying that on the 8th of July
         18  of 1995 your observation post was overrun by Bosnian
         19  Serb forces?
         20       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         21       Q.   And I think in accordance with the orders
         22  that had been given to your observation post commander,
         23  you surrendered to the Serbs and you went with them; is
         24  that correct?
         25       A.   That is also correct.

          1       Q.   What weapon were you armed with at the time
          2  that the observation post was overrun?
          3       A.   My personal armour, plus an Uzi.
          4       Q.   And when the observation post was overrun,
          5  what happened to that weapon?
          6       A.   At first I took it with me, and then after
          7  300 or 400 metres we had to stop and give our weapons
          8  away to the Serbs.
          9       Q.   Now, I think Serbs escorted you from
         10  observation post Kilo to the town of Milici; is that
         11  correct?
         12       A.   That is also correct.
         13       Q.   And I think that you, in fact, drove the
         14  armoured personnel carrier, the Dutch armoured
         15  personnel carrier, with the crew of the observation
         16  post in it to Milici?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   Can you just point to the town of Milici on
         19  the map in front of you.
         20       A.   It's right here [indicates].
         21            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the witness show that the
         22  witness has pointed to the town of Milici on
         23  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E, which is a town in the
         24  southern portion of that exhibit, on the road between
         25  Vlasenica and Nova Kasaba.

          1       Q.   Mr. Stoelinga, where did the Serbs take you
          2  in Milici?
          3       A.   They took us to what they told us was an old
          4  police station.
          5       Q.   What equipment did you still have with you?
          6  You've said in your testimony that at this time you had
          7  lost your personal weapon.  What other personal
          8  military equipment did you have with you?
          9       A.   Everybody still had their flak jackets,
         10  helmets, and personal belongings.
         11       Q.   Can you tell the Court what happened to these
         12  when you got to the old police station at Milici?
         13       A.   I had to park the APC.  We got out of the
         14  APC, everyone, and there were several Serbs there.
         15  They told us to give our flak jackets to them and our
         16  helmets.
         17       Q.   What colour was your helmet that you handed
         18  to the Serbs?
         19       A.   It was the colour blue.
         20       Q.   Now, at the old police station, how many
         21  members of the Dutch Battalion were placed there by the
         22  Serbs?
         23       A.   In the beginning, only the crew of OP Kilo,
         24  and those were ten guys of ours.
         25       Q.   How well did the Serbs treat you at the

          1  police station?
          2       A.   The first time, as we stopped at the parking
          3  lot, they made us give up our flak jackets and our
          4  helmets.  But after that, a commander of them showed
          5  and he reassured us that nothing would happen to us.
          6       Q.   Now, you were the APC driver.  Where did you
          7  park your armoured personnel carrier?
          8       A.   I parked the APC on a parking lot in front of
          9  the old police station.
         10       Q.   Did you notice anything about the APC over
         11  the next few days?
         12       A.   After we had gotten out of the APC, three or
         13  four Serbs covered it with a plastic cover so it
         14  wouldn't be able to be seen from the air.
         15       Q.   I think around the 12th or 13th of July, you
         16  were actually joined by the crew of observation post
         17  Charlie; is that correct?
         18       A.   That is correct.
         19       Q.   So how many Dutch soldiers altogether were
         20  there at the police station by this time?
         21       A.   About 20, because I don't remember the exact
         22  number of OP Charlie.
         23       Q.   Do you recall what date OP Charlie joined
         24  you?
         25       A.   It was after five days, I believe, that we

          1  had been there.
          2       Q.   And you were there on the 8th of July, so it
          3  would have been the 13th of July or thereabouts.
          4       A.   Approximately.
          5       Q.   Now, after OP Charlie joined you, I want you
          6  to recall a time when you were sitting by a river,
          7  cooling your feet, it was a hot day, with members,
          8  other Dutch Battalion soldiers, and this was a river
          9  near to the police station.  Can you tell the Judges
         10  what you saw from that location?
         11       A.   While we were sitting there, on the other
         12  side of the river there was a road, and on that road
         13  there were driving buses and trucks.  And in the buses
         14  and in the trucks there were only females and
         15  children.  And there were little convoys, in the
         16  beginning, led by a military vehicle of the UN, but
         17  after a few hours, there were no vehicles of the UN
         18  anymore with them.
         19       Q.   So I'm right in saying that you saw a number
         20  of convoys with women and children on board.  The first
         21  convoys that you saw had an escort with them from the
         22  DutchBat; is that correct?
         23       A.   That is correct.
         24       Q.   And then the later convoys that you saw, they
         25  had no escort with them at all; is that what you

          1  recall?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Now, I think on the 15th of July, you were
          4  told, all of the DutchBat soldiers at the police
          5  station, to get onto a bus; is that correct?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   Who accompanied you in that bus?
          8       A.   There was one Serb who accompanied us, and
          9  the driver was a civilian.
         10       Q.   You say there was one Serb who accompanied
         11  you.  Who was this Serb?
         12       A.   It was one of the guys of the -- who was also
         13  every day at the old police station.
         14       Q.   Was he armed?
         15       A.   Yes, he had his AK with him.
         16       Q.   And by that, you mean an AK-47.
         17       A.   A 47.
         18       Q.   Was he in a military uniform?
         19       A.   Yes, he was.
         20       Q.   Now, can you describe to the Judges the
         21  journey that you took from Milici?
         22       A.   As we moved, we went from Milici to the
         23  north --
         24       Q.   If you could rise, Mr. Stoelinga, and just
         25  show the Judges.

          1       A.   We moved from Milici, up to the north, on
          2  this road [indicates].
          3       Q.   If you can just wait one moment.
          4            MR. CAYLEY:  The witness is indicating on
          5  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E that the bus he was on drove
          6  north, from Milici, up towards Nova Kasaba and Konjevic
          7  Polje.
          8       Q.   If you can sit now.  Let's talk about the
          9  first part of that journey.  Can you describe to the
         10  Judges what you saw?
         11       A.   The bus was driving in the beginning quite
         12  fast, but after a while, there was a convoy of tanks
         13  and other APC vehicles of the Serbs in front of us.
         14  The bus driver tried to get past them, but it didn't
         15  work so he had to slow down and we had to follow the
         16  convoy.
         17       Q.   Now, on these tanks and APCs, could you see
         18  any soldiers at all?
         19       A.   There were several soldiers who were sitting
         20  on the vehicles, and other gear.  Some bicycles.
         21       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges how the Serb
         22  soldiers that you saw sitting on these vehicles, how
         23  they were dressed?
         24       A.   Some of them were -- most of them had their
         25  own uniforms, but some of them were wearing the Dutch

          1  T-shirts and Dutch uniform jackets, and a few of them
          2  had on our helmets, the blue helmets, and also the blue
          3  berets.
          4       Q.   Now, when you are referring to these
          5  individuals sitting on vehicles, you're referring to
          6  the armoured personnel carriers and the tanks that you
          7  saw travelling in front of you.  Do you recall
          8  approximately how many tanks and armoured personnel
          9  vehicles were in front of you on this road?
         10       A.   It's difficult to say because they were
         11  driving in front of us, but it was between 10 and 15
         12  vehicles.
         13       Q.   Now, while you were driving along this road,
         14  did you see any other military personnel?
         15       A.   Yes.  Alongside the road there were small
         16  groups of Serbs, about two and three, and they were
         17  sitting on the side of the road, and it looked like
         18  they were having a break, in small groups.  And in
         19  total, maybe 30 or 40 men.
         20       Q.   Can you describe their appearance to the
         21  Judges?
         22       A.   Well, they were sitting -- they were lying
         23  down a little bit, like they had been tired and now had
         24  the first time to rest.
         25       Q.   Now, I think when you got to the junction

          1  just before Konjevic Polje you turned off to the right,
          2  and if you could indicate to the Judges the route that
          3  you took.
          4       A.   [Indicates]
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          6  witness is indicating on Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E that
          7  he took a route which went right at a T-junction,
          8  towards the town of Bratunac, after the town, village,
          9  of Nova Kasaba.
         10       Q.   Now, can you explain to the Judges and
         11  describe to them the journey that the bus took
         12  immediately after it entered the road to Bratunac.
         13       A.   Would you please repeat the question.
         14       Q.   You've just described to the Judges, using
         15  your finger, that the bus you were on turned right on
         16  the road towards Bratunac.  Can you describe to the
         17  Judges that journey, what you saw from where you were
         18  sitting on the bus?
         19       A.   In the beginning -- at the first point, the
         20  Serb who was driving alongside of the bus, he reacted
         21  really nervous.  He tried to load his weapon, which he
         22  didn't succeed in.  Then he tried to do it with his
         23  feet.  And that was a very nervous reaction by him.  At
         24  that point we thought that maybe something was wrong --
         25       Q.   If you could just stop there for a moment.

          1  You said that the Serb who was driving alongside the
          2  bus -- you said there were two Serbs in the bus, the
          3  driver and a soldier.  Which was it?
          4       A.   It was the soldier who was in the bus.
          5       Q.   Please carry on.
          6       A.   At a given point we smelled something.  It
          7  was a smell I didn't recall at that point, but
          8  everybody knew that something was going to happen.  And
          9  at that point we saw a big truck, about -- just a big
         10  truck with a container on top of it.  That container
         11  was standing on the right side of the road, I was in
         12  the bus on the right side, and the bus overtook the
         13  still standing -- the truck which was standing still.
         14  I had a good look to the right and saw in the
         15  container, on the -- I couldn't look inside the
         16  container because it was too high, but I could see the
         17  bodies which were in them.
         18       Q.   Now, Mr. Stoelinga, do you recall how large
         19  the container or bucket on the back of this truck was?
         20       A.   Well, it was a regular truck, so in my
         21  recollection, it was about five to six metres long and
         22  about two and a half metres wide and about one and a
         23  half metres deep.
         24       Q.   Now, you say that you could see bodies.  You
         25  couldn't look inside but you could still see bodies.

          1  How many bodies did you see?
          2       A.   I saw about seven or eight bodies.  Those
          3  were the bodies that were coming on top of -- which
          4  were coming out of the container.
          5       Q.   Can you describe the appearance of those
          6  bodies to the Judges?
          7       A.   The bodies that I saw, they were all swollen
          8  and kind of bluish, and none of the bodies were -- all
          9  of them were just wearing trousers.
         10       Q.   Were they male or female?
         11       A.   The bodies I saw were male.
         12       Q.   Now, I know it's difficult to assess, in a
         13  situation like that, the age of the people that you
         14  saw, but can you give an approximate age to the Judges
         15  of the bodies that you saw?
         16       A.   I think the bodies were -- the average age of
         17  the bodies that I saw at that point were about from 20
         18  years until maybe about 40.
         19       Q.   Now, you say that they were wearing only
         20  trousers, and by that do you mean that they were
         21  stripped naked to the waist.
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Do you recall whether they had any shoes on?
         24  Do you recall?
         25       A.   No.  I'm sure that -- they did not have any

          1  shirts on.
          2       Q.   Now, you gave an answer no.  Do you mean that
          3  you can't recall?
          4       A.   I can't recall.
          5       Q.   Could you see the nature of any injury on
          6  these bodies?
          7       A.   No, I couldn't.
          8       Q.   Now, you described a smell, a smell that you
          9  could not recall from your memory.  How strong was that
         10  smell?
         11       A.   Very strong.  It was -- it's a smell I won't
         12  forget.
         13       Q.   Now, at the time, because of the level of the
         14  smell, the intensity of this smell, did you make any
         15  conclusions about the number of bodies in that truck?
         16       A.   At that time, not.
         17       Q.   Did you later think about what you'd seen and
         18  what you'd smelled?
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   And what did you conclude later on?
         21       A.   My conclusion later on was that the container
         22  of the truck probably was filled with bodies.
         23       Q.   Now, after you passed this truck on the right
         24  side of the road, can you describe to the Judges what
         25  you saw next?

          1       A.   The bus kept on driving, and at a given stage
          2  he slowed down.  There was one body lying on the road,
          3  and the driver did not know what to do, to pass the
          4  body or to stop.  There were also several -- there were
          5  two guys who were wearing a yellow jacket, and there
          6  were two vehicles there which -- one looked like a
          7  bulldozer and the other like a scrapper.  And it looked
          8  like they were cleaning up the street.  So they were
          9  standing next to the body and they were about to put
         10  the body into the scrapper.
         11       Q.   When you talk about a scrapper, you're
         12  speaking of a vehicle with a mechanical shovel on the
         13  front of the vehicle.  Can you answer that question?
         14  We need to have an audible response.
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   Now, when you saw this taking place, you saw
         17  this bulldozer and you saw a body on the side of the
         18  road, what did you think was happening?
         19       A.   I thought that they were cleaning up the
         20  street from -- they were cleaning up -- not cleaning
         21  up, they were getting rid of the bodies.
         22       Q.   How did the other members of the Dutch
         23  Battalion on that bus react when they saw all of this?
         24       A.   Some of us reacted to themselves, they didn't
         25  look outside anymore.  Others stood up and also tried

          1  to see some more.
          2       Q.   Did you carry on looking?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   Now, I think the bus then continued on for a
          5  few hundred metres.  And then can you describe to the
          6  Judges what you saw then?
          7       A.   After that point, it was on the right side of
          8  the road, there were small piles of clothing, and on
          9  some piles there was a knife or keys and shoes.  And
         10  all the piles, they were lying in a direct line, with
         11  every one in a range of a distance of about one metre.
         12       Q.   Just to make absolutely clear, for the
         13  record, you saw piles of clothing at one-metre
         14  intervals; is that correct?
         15       A.   That's correct.
         16       Q.   And on some of those piles of clothing, you
         17  saw a knife or keys or a pair of shoes.
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   For how many metres did you see these piles
         20  of clothing at intervals?
         21       A.   For about 200 or 300 metres.
         22       Q.   Were they placed in a messy fashion or were
         23  they neatly piled?  How did it look to you?
         24       A.   It looked to me like they were neatly piled.
         25       Q.   Now, you earlier testified that you'd seen a

          1  truck with corpses on the top, and then you saw this
          2  clothing neatly piled along the side of the road.  What
          3  did you think to yourself at the time?
          4       A.   At the time I didn't put those two things
          5  together.  That was afterwards.
          6       Q.   And what did you think afterwards?
          7       A.   I believe that the bodies in the truck
          8  probably could have been the people who had to strip
          9  off their clothes.
         10       Q.   Now, I think the bus drove on for five or ten
         11  minutes, and then you saw something else.  Can you
         12  describe to the Judges what you saw?
         13       A.   I saw on the left side of the road, in about
         14  a distance of 200 metres, other vehicles that were
         15  cleaning up.  There was a shovel and again a bulldozer,
         16  and there was a truck also standing there.  But the
         17  distance was too great to see something accurate.
         18       Q.   Now, I want you just to go back for a moment
         19  to the truck full of bodies and the piles of clothing
         20  at intervals, and I wonder if you could indicate on the
         21  map behind you, Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E, to the best of
         22  your recollection, where you think you saw the truck
         23  and the clothing on the side of the road.
         24       A.   To my recollection, it was between Kravica
         25  and Glogova.

          1            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.  The
          2  interpreters cannot hear that.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  I'll read it into the
          4  transcript.  The witness indicated that the location of
          5  what he saw was on the road between -- the road that
          6  runs between Konjevic Polje and Bratunac, and
          7  specifically what he saw was between the villages of
          8  Kravica and Glogova.
          9       Q.   Is that correct, what I've just said?
         10       A.   That is correct.
         11       Q.   I think you then drove on to Bratunac, and
         12  you were eventually evacuated out of the enclave --
         13  sorry, from Bratunac to Serbia, and then on to Croatia
         14  and back home to the Netherlands; is that correct?
         15       A.   That is correct.
         16       Q.   Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. Stoelinga.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no further
         18  questions of the witness.  I can now offer him for
         19  cross-examination.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         21  very much, Mr. Cayley.  You may sit down.
         22            I believe it will be Mr. Petrusic who will
         23  cross-examine you.  Mr. Stoelinga, you will now answer
         24  questions which the Defence for General Krstic, that
         25  is, Mr. Petrusic, will ask you.
          1            Yes, Mr. Petrusic.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
          3  Mr. President.
          4                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
          5       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Stoelinga.  Captain Groen
          6  was the commander of the Company B, wasn't he?
          7       A.   That's correct.
          8       Q.   Did he advise you that if Serb troops came
          9  and took over the observation posts, that you should
         10  decide to respond depending on the situation?
         11       A.   He didn't give that advice to me, but he gave
         12  that advice to the observation post commander.
         13       Q.   I apologise.  When I say "you", I mean the
         14  unit you belonged to.
         15            So in that situation, your commander decided
         16  that you should head along together with the Serbs.
         17       A.   I believe that our captain tried to make
         18  clear that -- he wasn't at the scene at that time, so
         19  he didn't know what was going on.  And he gave the
         20  observation post commanders, who had the best insight
         21  into the situation, the choice.
         22       Q.   So was it the commander of the observation
         23  post then?
         24       A.   The commander of our observation post decided
         25  to go along with the Serbs.

          1       Q.   And members of the army of Bosnian Serbs, did
          2  they use any weapons or threats to use weapons on that
          3  occasion?
          4       A.   We had been under fire by an artillery piece
          5  for six hours, and the guys -- the Serbs who overtook
          6  our observation post didn't use firing weapons.
          7       Q.   Mr. Stoelinga, are you aware that at the
          8  place where you saw that truck with the container that
          9  you testified about, that is, whether any fighting had
         10  taken place between the Serb and Muslim forces?  Were
         11  you aware of that?
         12       A.   I'm not aware of any fights in that part of
         13  the enclave.
         14       Q.   Mr. Stoelinga, you were a soldier at the
         15  time.  Do you know what it means to take care of the
         16  area, to sweep the area, to clean the area?
         17       A.   In what way do you mean "to clean the area"?
         18       Q.   After a combat, after a battle.
         19       A.   After a battle I think it's common sense to
         20  get the people who were killed together and try to bury
         21  them.
         22       Q.   Mr. Stoelinga, thank you.  I have no further
         23  questions.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         25  Mr. President.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          2  Mr. Petrusic.
          3            Mr. Cayley, do you have any supplementary
          4  questions?
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Just a couple, Mr. President.
          6  Thank you.
          7                 Re-examined by Mr. Cayley:
          8       Q.   Mr. Stoelinga, my learned friend Mr. Petrusic
          9  asked you a number of questions about these bodies that
         10  you saw, and he asked you whether or not you'd seen any
         11  fighting taking place in the area, to which you
         12  answered no.  Do you recall just saying that?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   Now, his suggestion in the questions that he
         15  was asking you is that the soldiers, the individuals
         16  that you saw in the back of that truck, those dead
         17  bodies, were combatants.  At the time of --
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES:  Mr. Cayley, excuse me.  I
         19  see that Mr. Petrusic is on his feet.
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         21  in my questions I did not claim anything at all.  I was
         22  not trying to lead or make any suggestions.  And I'm
         23  objecting to the question asked by Mr. Cayley.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         25  Mr. Cayley.

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  If I could respond,
          2  Mr. President, I think the inference was very clear to
          3  everybody that Mr. Petrusic was suggesting that the
          4  bodies that Mr. Stoelinga had seen were combatants.  I
          5  think that inference was what I understood, and I'm
          6  sure that's what everybody else understood in the
          7  courtroom, and I would like to ask the witness what he
          8  thought at the time, whether or not these were people
          9  who had been killed in combat.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         11  Mr. Cayley, you may ask your question.
         12            You understand what Mr. Cayley has just
         13  said.  I believe that he's right, Mr. Petrusic.
         14            Mr. Cayley, you may go on.
         15            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes.
         16  Mr. President, what I objected to was to what
         17  Mr. Cayley said, that I claimed.  I did not claim
         18  that.  And that is what I objected against, but of
         19  course I shall gladly accept your suggestion.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         21  Mr. Cayley.  Mr. Cayley, ask your question.
         22            MR. CAYLEY:
         23       Q.   At the time, Mr. Stoelinga, when you saw
         24  these bodies and you saw this clothing along the side
         25  of the road, did you believe that these individuals
          1  that you saw in the truck had been killed in combat?
          2       A.   No, I don't believe that, because in that
          3  case I probably would have seen some weapons.
          4       Q.   How did you think these people were killed?
          5  What did you think at the time?
          6       A.   I believe that they were executed.
          7       Q.   And why do you conclude that?
          8       A.   As part of the piles of the clothing and the
          9  shoes, and because they -- none of the bodies was
         10  wearing any shirts or anything.  And in combat, you
         11  would still be wearing something.
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I
         13  have no further questions of the witness.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         15  Mr. Cayley.
         16            Judge Riad.
         17            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         18  Mr. President.
         19                 Questioned by the Court:
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning, Mr. Stoelinga.
         21  Just to pursue the same question concerning the piles
         22  of bodies in the truck, you mentioned that they were
         23  swollen and blue.  What did you mean by that?  I mean,
         24  swollen, were they fat people, having drunk a lot of
         25  beer or what?

          1       A.   I believe that the bodies had been lying
          2  there for some time, and they were in the heat of the
          3  environment, it was about 30 degrees Celsius, and
          4  that's the reason that I believe that they were a
          5  little bit swollen and turned a little bluish.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  So you just think it was the
          7  result of the climate and so on.
          8       A.   Yes, and also because of the time.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  And the blue colour did not give
         10  you any special impression of torture or anything?
         11       A.   No.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  No, it did not.  What about the
         13  clothes you found regularly distributed on the road?
         14  Were they military clothes, or were they, if you
         15  noticed, just civilian clothes.
         16       A.   They were civilian clothes.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  They were civilian clothes.  And
         18  you mentioned that when you were, I think, sitting by
         19  the river, with your feet in the water, you saw a
         20  number of convoys with women and children.  First with
         21  an escort and then without an escort.  Did you later
         22  know anything about these convoys, whether from the
         23  people who escorted them or without?
         24       A.   Later I heard that they probably were the
         25  people who were deported from Potocari to another

          1  destination.  But I --
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Did they arrive and where did
          3  they go?
          4       A.   That I don't know because we saw them only on
          5  the road for about 50 metres.  So I have no clue about
          6  their destination.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  But from your colleagues who
          8  accompanied them, the first convoys, did they take them
          9  to a safe destination?
         10       A.   At that point we had no radio contact with
         11  our own people, so I don't know if they got to where
         12  they were going.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned that you saw a
         14  body lying on the road.  That was the only body you
         15  said you saw lying on the road.
         16       A.   It was the only body which was lying on the
         17  road.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Was he dressed?
         19       A.   No.  He also was just wearing his trousers.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  And no upper clothes.
         21       A.   No upper clothes and no shoes.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  And no shoes.  Thank you very
         23  much.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         25  very much, Judge Riad.

          1            Judge Wald, do you have any questions?
          2            JUDGE WALD:  Just a few.
          3            As I understand it, when you saw the bodies
          4  and you were returning toward Bratunac, this was July
          5  15th; is that right?  I think you testified to that
          6  effect.
          7       A.   Yes.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  So in other words, this was a
          9  couple of days after you had seen some of the earlier
         10  convoys, when you were at the river.
         11       A.   Yes.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  How were you able -- I'm not
         13  quite sure I understand how you were able to see the
         14  bodies, the seven or eight bodies that you did, if you
         15  couldn't see into the container and your particular
         16  vehicle was trying to pass the other side.  I know it
         17  was on the same side you were on, on the right, but
         18  were the bodies you could see coming out on the top?
         19  How could you see them?
         20       A.   The bodies that I could see, they were coming
         21  out of the top.
         22            JUDGE WALD:  They were, in other words, just
         23  overflowing.
         24       A.   Yes.
         25            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  And you said that the

          1  belongings were still -- or the possessions, shoes,
          2  were still in neat little piles every few hundred
          3  metres; is that right?
          4       A.   Yes.  It was for about 200 or 300 metres, and
          5  then the distance between the piles, they were neatly
          6  formed piles.
          7            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  And it didn't appear that
          8  they had been disturbed by anybody.  They weren't
          9  slopping around.  They were all still in neat piles.
         10       A.   Yes.
         11            JUDGE WALD:  Now, Mr. Petrusic asked you
         12  whether or not, as a former member of the military, you
         13  were familiar with cleaning up operations after you'd
         14  had a combat, and you said you were because it was
         15  customary after there had been a battle to gather up
         16  the dead for burial.  In your experience, when that
         17  happens, do they take -- do they disrobe or in any way
         18  take the clothes off of the dead soldiers who have been
         19  in the combat, or do they generally bury them with
         20  their clothes they had on at the time?
         21       A.   I personally have never been in that
         22  situation, but I don't presume that people would be
         23  stripped of their clothing.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]

          1  Mr. Stoelinga, I have a question.  What time was it,
          2  what time of the day was it when you covered that road
          3  between Kravica and Glogova, more or less?
          4       A.   I believe it was around noon, about 12.00.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Around
          6  noon.  Very well.  So there was plenty of light and you
          7  really could see.
          8       A.   Yes.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Another
         10  question.  You spoke about trucks escorted and other
         11  trucks.  After you learned -- why were there some
         12  trucks that were escorted and why were there some
         13  trucks that didn't have any escort?
         14       A.   As I heard, it was in the beginning, the
         15  people in Potocari, my battalion tried to escort every
         16  group that was going out, but they were -- after a
         17  while they were pulled out of their vehicles, and at
         18  that point they said, "Okay.  We can't accompany them
         19  anymore because we don't have enough vehicles or enough
         20  people to get lost in that direction."
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I believe
         22  that you said that somebody had told you that.  Who
         23  were the persons who explained that to you?
         24       A.   That was after we got back to Holland, and it
         25  was in the first debriefings that I heard that.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          2  Mr. Stoelinga, you have finished giving your evidence
          3  before the International Criminal Tribunal.  Thank you
          4  very much.  You are still young; you're a student.  I
          5  think you lived through all these horrible events, and
          6  independent of who was responsible for them, yet I
          7  believe you are in a very good position to explain to
          8  people that injustice, wherever, is always a threat to
          9  everyone.
         10            Are there, Mr. Cayley, any exhibits that have
         11  to be settled or not?
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  No, there are not,
         13  Mr. President.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I should
         15  nevertheless like to seize this opportunity to make it
         16  quite clear as to the identity of the witness, because
         17  at the beginning of the transcript, I saw another name,
         18  that is Martin Van der Zwan and I see that this is
         19  Mr. Stoelinga -- no.  I believe that this has put right
         20  already.  It is Mr. Stoelinga.
         21            Very well.  Thank you very much.  Thank you,
         22  Mr. Stoelinga, once again.  Thank you for coming to
         23  testify.
         24            Usher, could you please help the witness.
         25                 [The witness withdrew]

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley,
          2  from the point of view of organisation of our work,
          3  merely to know the next witness will be testifying in a
          4  public session?
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  He will, Mr. President, yes.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Right.  In
          7  order not to make a break at a more inconvenient time,
          8  I think we should make a break now and we shall resume
          9  in 20 minutes, in an open session.
         10                 --- Recess taken at 11.55 a.m.
         11                 --- On resuming at 12.20 p.m.
         12                 [The witness entered court]
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         14  afternoon, Witness Van der Zwan.  Could you please read
         15  the solemn declaration that the usher will give you.
         16            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         17  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         18  truth.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Please be
         20  seated.  Let me remind our interpreter once again that
         21  he is still under oath.  Witness, thank you very much
         22  for coming to testify.  You will first answer questions
         23  that will be put to you by Mr. Harmon, as far as I can
         24  see.  He is representing the Prosecution.
         25            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
          1            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          2                 WITNESS:  MARTIN VAN DER ZWAN
          3                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          4       Q.   Sir, could you spell your last name for the
          5  record.
          6       A.   Van der Zwan, Z-w-a-n.
          7       Q.   You are currently in the Royal Dutch army, I
          8  can see; is that correct, sir?
          9       A.   Yes, I am.
         10       Q.   What is your rank?
         11       A.   I'm a Corporal First Class.
         12       Q.   And you joined the Royal Dutch army in 1992;
         13  is that correct?
         14       A.   That's correct.
         15       Q.   You served in the former Yugoslavia as part
         16  of two separate missions; is that correct?
         17       A.   Altogether, three now.
         18       Q.   Altogether three.  Okay.  Let's take the
         19  first two, if we can, Corporal.  When was the first
         20  time you served as part of a UN mission in the former
         21  Yugoslavia, and where was it?
         22       A.   That was in 1993, in the part we called
         23  sector south, the Krajina, in a place called Benkovac.
         24       Q.   Okay.  And how long did you serve at that
         25  location?

          1       A.   I served at that location for approximately
          2  six months.
          3       Q.   Where was your actual physical presence?
          4       A.   It was on the base, the barracks of the
          5  Serbian army, in Benkovac.
          6       Q.   Is that the army of the Krajina Serbs?
          7       A.   That was the Krajina Serbs, yes.
          8       Q.   When was the second time you served in the
          9  former Yugoslavia, as part of a UN mission?  And if you
         10  would just wait for just a moment.
         11       A.   I forgot about that.
         12       Q.   We talked about that last night that it's
         13  important that you pause because we speak the same
         14  language.  So if you pause after my question.  Please
         15  proceed.  When was the second time that you served in
         16  the former Yugoslavia?
         17       A.   That was in 1995, in Srebrenica.
         18       Q.   Did you serve with DutchBat III in
         19  Srebrenica?
         20       A.   Yes, I did.
         21       Q.   What were your duties when you were serving
         22  in the enclave?
         23       A.   I was a long-distance rifleman, and I served
         24  doing patrols or working on an observation post.
         25       Q.   Now, I'd like to take you forward in time to

          1  a time when you were serving at an observation post, OP
          2  Uniform.  Did you serve at that particular observation
          3  post?
          4       A.   Yes, I did.
          5       Q.   Could you take the pointer, there should be a
          6  pointer in front of you, and could you turn to
          7  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E and show the Judges where
          8  observation post Uniform was located?
          9       A.   This point right here [indicates].
         10            MR. HARMON:  Indicating on -- I can't see it
         11  on the monitor, but I can see it in front of me and it
         12  indicates that the dot at the southern part of the
         13  enclave with the letter "U" next to it.
         14       Q.   That's the location of observation post
         15  Uniform; is that correct?
         16       A.   Yes, it is.
         17       Q.   Could you tell me and could you tell the
         18  Judges, was that observation post taken over by members
         19  of the Bosnian Serb army?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Were you present in that observation post
         22  with a number of other soldiers at the time it was
         23  taken over?
         24       A.   Yes, I was.
         25       Q.   How many other Dutch soldiers were present in

          1  the observation post at the time it was taken over?
          2       A.   Six soldiers; one sergeant.
          3       Q.   Before the observation post was taken over by
          4  members of the Bosnian Serb army, was the area around
          5  it, or was the observation post itself, shelled by the
          6  Bosnian Serb army?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   How long -- what kind of shelling took place,
          9  and for what duration did it take place?
         10       A.   Well, it started out with some rockets going
         11  past our observation post.  After a brief pause,
         12  artillery, and then mortars, small mortars, and then
         13  came the infantry.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have
         15  Prosecutor's Exhibit 96 and 93 taken by the usher to
         16  the ELMO.
         17       Q.   Before I show you these exhibits, at some
         18  point in time did infantry soldiers from the Bosnian
         19  Serb army make contact with you and other members of
         20  the DutchBat unit in the observation post?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   Could you describe the first soldiers that
         23  made contact with you?
         24       A.   Yes.  They were well-dressed soldiers.  They
         25  were wearing camouflage uniforms with black chest

          1  webbings or flak jackets.  They were wearing an armlet
          2  with the sign of a -- a round sign with a howling wolf
          3  on it.
          4       Q.   All right.
          5            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if you would place
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 96 on the ELMO, please.
          7       Q.   Now, you've seen this picture in my office
          8  before, have you not, Corporal Van der Zwan?
          9       A.   Yes, I have.
         10       Q.   Do you see the armlet type that you described
         11  in your testimony in this particular image?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Could you point out to the Judges what you're
         14  referring to when you say an armlet with a wolf's head
         15  in it?
         16       A.   This one [indicates].
         17            MR. HARMON:  Indicating the badge and the
         18  insignia that's a circle with a wolf's head in it on
         19  the soldier on the right-hand side of the image --
         20  actually, not the far right-hand side, the second
         21  individual from the right-hand side.
         22       Q.   Now, did all of the soldiers who first
         23  approached the observation post have this insignia on
         24  their arms?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   Now, did you see soldiers who also had a
          2  different type of insignia appear at the observation
          3  post?
          4       A.   Yes.  Later on, after these people went
          5  further into the enclave, there was another group,
          6  together with an officer, who came to our observation
          7  post.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Now, let me have the usher
          9  please place the next exhibit, which is Prosecutor's
         10  Exhibit 93, on the ELMO.  And even though it's not a
         11  very clear image on the monitor, could you describe the
         12  circumstances of, first of all, observing this arm
         13  patch, and tell the Judges whether or not -- what you
         14  did in respect of this particular image that's before
         15  you.
         16       A.   This is the sign that was given to me by one
         17  of the soldiers that arrived at our observation post.
         18  They came through our fence, started talking to us,
         19  gave us some cigarettes, and I asked them -- I asked
         20  that particular guy who gave me the cigarettes about
         21  these emblem, because I'm a collector of signs and
         22  emblems of the army.  And when I asked him about it, he
         23  ripped this one off his sleeve and gave it to me as a
         24  souvenir.
         25       Q.   And this is the photograph of the actual

          1  patch which you received; is that correct?
          2       A.   Yes, it is.
          3       Q.   What happened to you and members of your unit
          4  when this officer came up to make contact with you?
          5  Did you remain at the observation post?
          6       A.   No.
          7       Q.   Tell the Judges what happened next.
          8       A.   After the officer arrived at our post, he
          9  told us that we were given the choice to retreat
         10  through the -- back into the enclave, to our own base,
         11  or to go with them to Bratunac, phone home that same
         12  evening, and fly home the next day.
         13       Q.   Now, in your opinion or in your commanding
         14  officer's opinion, was it a viable option, a good
         15  option, to go back into the enclave?
         16       A.   No, it was no option at all.
         17       Q.   Why was that?
         18       A.   Because at that moment the fighting was still
         19  going on, and the first group wearing the sign with the
         20  wolf on it went further into the enclave.  So the front
         21  line, the places where the fighting was going on, was
         22  at that moment behind us.  So to retreat we had to go
         23  back through the fighting area to get to our post, and
         24  prior to that, one of our soldiers died trying to do
         25  that.  So for us that was no option at all.

          1       Q.   And that was Corporal Renssen, wasn't it?
          2       A.   That was Soldier Van Renssen.  Yes.  Yes.
          3       Q.   And he wasn't part of OP Uniform, he was part
          4  of another outpost?
          5       A.   He was part of OP Foxtrot, the one next to
          6  us.
          7       Q.   Did you accept the offer made by the Bosnian
          8  Serb officer?
          9       A.   Yes, we did.
         10       Q.   I'm getting a little ahead of your testimony,
         11  but were you permitted to make that phone call that
         12  night, and did you fly home the next day?
         13       A.   No.
         14       Q.   Let me ask you this question:  At the point
         15  that you accepted to go with the Bosnian Serb officer,
         16  what happened to your weapons?
         17       A.   The first group that arrived took our
         18  weapons.
         19       Q.   Okay.  What happened to your vests and your
         20  helmets?  Did they remain with you?
         21       A.   Yes.  We refused to give them off.
         22       Q.   Did you then leave the outpost -- the
         23  observation post?  I'm sorry.
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Now, could you take the pointer again,

          1  Corporal Van der Zwan, and will you show the Judges the
          2  direction that you left after departing from OP
          3  Uniform.  Which road did you take?
          4       A.   We took this road.  This is observation post
          5  Uniform [indicates], went into this road.
          6            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, a
          7  road that leads from OP Uniform to the right of the
          8  large Prosecutor's Exhibit 1E, and then proceeding
          9  north in the direction of a town called Pribicevic.
         10       Q.   Now, at some point did you stop, you and your
         11  colleagues stop at a location along that particular
         12  road?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   And what did you observe at the location
         15  where you stopped?
         16       A.   We stopped at a height -- a hill.  There was
         17  a lot of military activity at that place.  On the left
         18  side, behind us, at the side of some bush, there was a
         19  signal vehicle with big antennae on top of it.  There
         20  were some artillery pieces still firing towards the
         21  enclave.  There was a tank, a T-55, some troops,
         22  soldiers, running around.
         23       Q.   When you say a "signals vehicle", are you
         24  talking about a communications vehicle?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   The vehicle looked to you like a mobile
          2  communications centre?
          3       A.   Yes.  It was a military signals centre.
          4       Q.   Now, you said you saw several pieces of
          5  artillery.  In which direction were they firing?
          6       A.   In the direction of the enclave.
          7       Q.   Inside the enclave.
          8       A.   Inside, yes.
          9       Q.   Okay.  How long did you remain at that
         10  location?
         11       A.   For about two hours.
         12       Q.   Can you describe the uniforms that were worn
         13  by the soldiers that you saw at that particular
         14  location?
         15       A.   Yes.  There were several sorts of uniforms,
         16  mostly the camouflage -- the Serbian camouflage
         17  pattern.
         18       Q.   What colour were the uniforms?
         19       A.   Green, with camouflage spots on it.  A lot --
         20  correctly dressed soldiers over there.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Now, let me ask that the next
         22  exhibit, Prosecutor's Exhibit 98, be placed on the
         23  ELMO.
         24       Q.   Before it's placed on the ELMO, I'll wait for
         25  it to be distributed, before we place this item on the

          1  ELMO, Corporal, you told us earlier in discussing your
          2  background that you had served in a UN mission that was
          3  located in sector south in 1993, and you were based on
          4  a Serb military base at the time of that posting.
          5            Now, based on that experience, did you see
          6  something that caught your attention when you were now
          7  sitting near this communications vehicle and this
          8  apparent centre of activity?
          9       A.   Yes, I did.
         10       Q.   What did you see?
         11       A.   I saw a couple of soldiers wearing the badge
         12  of the Krajina Serbs, the same badge as I saw for six
         13  months in 1993 on that base.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, could you kindly
         15  place Prosecutor's Exhibit 98 on the ELMO.
         16       Q.   Does that appear to be the type of insignia
         17  that you saw at this particular location?
         18       A.   That's exactly the one.
         19       Q.   Did you have a conversation with any of those
         20  soldiers who were wearing this particular insignia?
         21       A.   Yes, I did.  They were walking in our
         22  direction when I saw them, and I was really amazed to
         23  see this so I said to one of them, "Is that from
         24  Benkovac?"
         25       Q.   And Benkovac was what?

          1       A.   Benkovac was the place where the barracks
          2  were, where I always saw that sign.
          3       Q.   Was the barracks where you had been housed in
          4  1993, when you were serving in sector south?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Did you get a response?
          7       A.   Yes.  He reacted, he smiled, and he said,
          8  "I'm from Knin."
          9       Q.   How many individuals wearing the patch that's
         10  depicted in Prosecutor's Exhibit 98 did you see at that
         11  particular location?
         12       A.   I saw four.
         13       Q.   Now, you said you remained at that location
         14  for a certain period of time.  At some point in time,
         15  did someone come to fetch you and your colleagues and
         16  take you to Bratunac?
         17       A.   Yes.  When it was getting a bit dark, a white
         18  Lada Niva, an all-terrain car, arrived, and an officer
         19  got out.  He told us to get into our vehicle and follow
         20  his car.
         21       Q.   Now, I've shown you Prosecutor's Exhibit 28.
         22            MR. HARMON:  And if I could have Prosecutor's
         23  28/5.1 placed on the ELMO.
         24       Q.   Were you able to make an identification of
         25  that particular officer when you examined Prosecutor's

          1  28?
          2       A.   That's him.
          3       Q.   So the individual that's now on the ELMO,
          4  depicted in Prosecutor's 28/5.1, is the individual who
          5  came to your location and asked you to follow him to
          6  Bratunac; is that correct?
          7       A.   That's absolutely correct.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. Usher.
          9       Q.   Did you follow that individual?
         10       A.   Yes, we did.
         11       Q.   Where did you go?
         12       A.   We went down the road and we went to a place
         13  called Bratunac, and we arrived at the barracks there.
         14       Q.   Okay.  Did it appear to you to be a military
         15  barracks?
         16       A.   Absolutely.
         17       Q.   After arriving at the barracks, did this
         18  individual, who was in Prosecutor's 28/5.1, remain with
         19  you?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Did you see another individual -- or I should
         22  say -- I withdraw that question.  Were you introduced
         23  to another individual from the Bosnian Serb army at
         24  that location, who you can identify by name?
         25       A.   Yes.  We were brought to a room.  A man was

          1  waiting there for us.  He introduced himself as Major
          2  Nikolic.
          3       Q.   Now, did you see this man in Prosecutor's
          4  28/5.1 and Major Nikolic again during the period of
          5  your captivity?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   Did you see them together?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   How many times did you see the man in
         10  Prosecutor's 28/5.1 and Major Nikolic during the period
         11  of your captivity?
         12       A.   About four times together.
         13       Q.   Corporal Van der Zwan, you told me that
         14  you're not very good at dates, so I'm going to try to
         15  put you at certain locations by certain events, okay?
         16       A.   Okay.
         17       Q.   Let me ask you, how long did you remain,
         18  first of all, at the barracks?
         19       A.   For a couple of hours.
         20       Q.   Where did you go next?
         21       A.   Hotel Fontana.
         22       Q.   Now, to the best of your recollection, how
         23  long did you remain at the Hotel Fontana?
         24       A.   Three, maybe four days.
         25       Q.   How many other of your colleagues were with

          1  you at the Hotel Fontana?
          2       A.   Well, we started out with seven, and after a
          3  while we had, I think, about 25, maybe 30.
          4       Q.   Now, at some point in time during your stay
          5  at the Hotel Fontana, did you see General Mladic at the
          6  Hotel Fontana?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   Did you see your commanding officer, Colonel
          9  Karremans at the Hotel Fontana?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   How soon after you saw General Mladic was it
         12  that you saw your commander, Colonel Karremans, at the
         13  Hotel Fontana?
         14       A.   Just minutes.
         15       Q.   Was Colonel Karremans accompanied by anybody
         16  when you saw him?
         17       A.   Yes.  There was a tall guy, an officer with
         18  him.
         19       Q.   Was there anybody else with Colonel Karremans
         20  and the tall officer?
         21       A.   Yes.  A sergeant major, but he didn't come to
         22  our position so I don't know who he was.
         23       Q.   Did you see him, the sergeant major?
         24       A.   Yes.  We saw him walking by.
         25       Q.   Describe him, please.

          1       A.   A lot smaller than the officer, dark hair, a
          2  bit curly, and I think he had a black moustache.
          3       Q.   All right.
          4            MR. HARMON:  Now, I'd like to next put on the
          5  ELMO, if I could, for your comments, Prosecutor's
          6  Exhibit 95, and Mr. Usher if you could also take with
          7  you Prosecutor's Exhibit 94.
          8       Q.   I take it -- once again, when I show you
          9  these exhibits, you're not exactly certain of the dates
         10  when these particular photographs were taken.  But let
         11  me first of all put Prosecutor's Exhibit 95 on the
         12  ELMO, and ask you, please, Corporal Van der Zwan, can
         13  you tell the Judges about this picture?  The
         14  circumstances under which it was taken and from what
         15  location it was taken?
         16       A.   We were at that moment at the Hotel Fontana.
         17  We were still trying to collect as much information as
         18  possible because that was the job we were doing.  So we
         19  made some photos that we thought maybe would be useful
         20  later on.  This is one of them.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Now, Mr. Usher, if you could
         22  take the next photograph, please, it is Prosecutor's
         23  Exhibit 94, and place that on the ELMO.
         24       Q.   Was this one of the photographs that was
         25  taken by one of your colleagues?

          1       A.   Yes, it's a part of it.
          2       Q.   Were you present when this photograph was
          3  taken?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   What does this photograph depict?
          6       A.   It's one of our vehicles driving on the road
          7  next to the supermarket in town, the town of Bratunac,
          8  and there are Serbian soldiers on it.
          9       Q.   Serbian soldiers wearing what?
         10       A.   Wearing our stuff, our materiel.
         11       Q.   When you say "our stuff," what do you mean,
         12  our stuff?  Can you describe it in colour, for example?
         13       A.   Our blue helmets.  One of them sitting on the
         14  back is wearing the blue tank helmet.
         15       Q.   All right.  Now let me ask you, Corporal Van
         16  der Zwan, did you then leave the Hotel Fontana and go
         17  to yet another location in Bratunac.
         18       A.   Yes.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Could I have Prosecutor's
         20  Exhibit 6/3 placed on the ELMO, please.
         21       Q.   Now, Corporal Van der Zwan, could you take
         22  your pointer and first point to the Hotel Fontana in
         23  Prosecutor's 6/3.
         24       A.   Here [indicates].
         25            MR. HARMON:  For the record, Mr. President

          1  and Your Honours, there is a triangle-shaped image,
          2  bordered by two roads, from the bottom of the picture
          3  going to the top, and in the middle -- at the top of
          4  the triangle formed by those two roads is a building
          5  that the witness has identified as the Hotel Fontana.
          6       Q.   Could you point to the Judges the location
          7  where you were taken after you and your colleagues left
          8  the Hotel Fontana?
          9       A.   Yes.  [Indicates].
         10            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record,
         11  Mr. President and Your Honours, a large structure that
         12  appears on the right side of that same triangle -- I'm
         13  sorry, the left side of that same triangle.
         14       Q.   Thank you very much.  Now, did you remain at
         15  that particular location, Corporal Van der Zwan, until
         16  the time of your release?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   At that particular location where you and
         19  your colleagues were detained, were there Bosnian Serb
         20  soldiers billeted at that location or near that
         21  location?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Could you describe those particular soldiers
         24  and how they were dressed?
         25       A.   Yes.  They were -- some of them were wearing

          1  camouflage trousers, with a black civilian T-shirt on
          2  top of it.  They had a chest webbing.  Two of them were
          3  carrying a small, about 40-centimetre long Samurai
          4  knife on that.  Some bags, also in black, were hanging
          5  on that chest webbing.  One of the soldiers was wearing
          6  a camouflage tank overall, and another one a normal
          7  olive-green overall.
          8       Q.   How many particular -- how many soldiers were
          9  in this particular unit, approximately?
         10       A.   Ten, maybe eleven.
         11       Q.   Did this unit have, as part of its component,
         12  dogs?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   What kind of dogs?
         15       A.   German Shepherds.
         16       Q.   At some point in time while you were detained
         17  at this location, did you have a conversation with one
         18  of the members of that unit?
         19       A.   Yes, I did.
         20       Q.   Could you describe that conversation,
         21  please?
         22       A.   It was the second day.  We were in the school
         23  building, late in the day.  As usual, they came into
         24  the building making a lot of noise.  I was still awake
         25  at that time, so I opened the door to see what was

          1  going on and I saw one of them sitting almost right in
          2  front of their door, at the steps going down in the
          3  school.
          4       Q.   Let me interrupt you there for just a second,
          5  Corporal Van der Zwan.  Was this a unit that, every day
          6  while you were at this particular location, went out
          7  into the field and engaged in some kind of an
          8  operation?
          9       A.   That's what they told me.  Yes.
         10       Q.   I'm sorry to have interrupted you.  If you
         11  would continue with your testimony about the
         12  conversation you had with this particular soldier.
         13       A.   I sat down, next to the person in front of
         14  their door, well, just tried to make a chat with him,
         15  and I saw that he was, well, tense.  So I just started
         16  talking about the dogs a bit, because I've got a dog
         17  myself, and he was the one always feeding and taking
         18  care of the dogs.  So he told me that he was a dog
         19  trainer before the war and his job was to take care of
         20  the dogs now.
         21            And, well, he started telling me about the
         22  dogs, that they used the dogs to -- well, against
         23  people, and he started talking about one event, where
         24  they were at a house in the enclave and they thought
         25  somebody was in the house.  They went in the direction

          1  of that house.
          2            Then an older man, together with a young
          3  girl, came out of a shed behind the house, and they
          4  wanted to stop them, so one of the guys turned loose a
          5  dog.  The dog attacked the older man, bit him.  One of
          6  the guys of that group, the guy who turned loose the
          7  dog, went to the older man, killed him with his knife.
          8  And he already started to become emotional while he was
          9  telling that, he was really tense, and he told me that
         10  he did something sexual with the girl and he killed her
         11  by slitting -- cutting her open with a knife, starting
         12  between her legs and up to her throat.  When he said
         13  that, he started to cry, walked outside the building.
         14  I went after him.
         15            We smoked a cigarette there, and then I went
         16  back to my colleagues and told that story, because I
         17  was -- yeah, well a bit shook up about the story.
         18       Q.   Did this soldier identify which of the
         19  members of his unit had committed those acts?
         20       A.   Yes.  He pointed them out to me.  He was
         21  hanging on the stairs completely drunk, a few metres
         22  away from us.
         23       Q.   Was he identified to you in any way?
         24       A.   Well, he tried to explain to me that either
         25  his name or his nickname was "Butcher" or his

          1  profession was butcher.
          2       Q.   Now, Corporal Van der Zwan, the next day --
          3  I'm sorry.  That evening, did you see any dogs around
          4  the compound?
          5       A.   When we were standing outside, smoking that
          6  cigarette, before I went back in again.
          7       Q.   Describe the dogs that you saw and their
          8  condition.
          9       A.   He was still referring to one of the dogs.
         10  He showed me -- I pointed -- he pointed the dog to me,
         11  the dog that he was talking about in his story, and at
         12  the front side of his left leg, there was a bloodstain,
         13  and he showed me that the dog reacted to the sound of a
         14  gun loading.
         15       Q.   Now, this individual who was identified
         16  either by profession or by name as "Butcher", did you
         17  see him the next day?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   What did you see happen the next day with
         20  "Butcher"?
         21       A.   He came to the school in a sort of a truck,
         22  and there was a calf in the back of the truck.  He took
         23  the calf out, went to the back side of the building,
         24  and one of the guys with him was waving with his hands
         25  to me, like he wanted me to come in that direction.  I

          1  was curious about what they were going to do with the
          2  calf, so I went with him.
          3            I went around the corner, and "Butcher" was
          4  standing there.  He had his arm around the calf,
          5  petting it, and all of a sudden he grabbed it at the
          6  snout, took out his knife, and slit his throat.  Then
          7  it started bleeding and went down on the ground.  Then
          8  he cut it open with his knife, like normal slaughtering
          9  way, and the other guy standing next to him started to
         10  laugh.  And he said to the guy who was slaughtering the
         11  calf that it was like or just like the girl in the
         12  enclave, or in Srebrenica.
         13       Q.   Now, Corporal Van der Zwan, at some time, at
         14  a date unknown to you, you were released and so were
         15  your colleagues; is that correct?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Was the date when you were released before
         18  the whole DutchBat III unit came out of the enclave on
         19  the 21st of July?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   Thank you very much, Corporal Van der Zwan.
         22            MR. HARMON:  I have no additional questions,
         23  Mr. President.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         25  Mr. Harmon.
          1            Corporal, you will now answer questions
          2  which, I see, Mr. Visnjic, counsel for Defence, will be
          3  asking of you.
          4            Yes, Mr. Visnjic.
          5            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          6  Mr. President.
          7                 Cross-examined by Mr. Visnjic:
          8       Q.   Mr. Van der Zwan, you told us at the
          9  beginning of your testimony that the observation post
         10  where you were was shelled.  Could you tell us
         11  something more about that?  Were the Serb troops aiming
         12  directly at the observation post, or was there fire all
         13  around it, or perhaps were they targeting some other
         14  observation post or posts?
         15       A.   They were not shelling at their observation
         16  post, they were shelling around it, so not directly
         17  aimed at their troops.
         18       Q.   Did the Muslim forces hold positions nearby,
         19  in the vicinity of your observation post?  Do you know
         20  anything about that?
         21       A.   Yes, they did.
         22       Q.   And were those Muslim forces resisting the
         23  Serb forces when they tried to enter the enclave?  Was
         24  there any exchange of fire?
         25       A.   Yes, there was an exchange of small-arms

          1  fire.
          2       Q.   Thank you.  Mr. Van der Zwan, I should like
          3  to know, when you left with Serb soldiers from the
          4  observation post, until the last day of your stay in
          5  Bratunac, did you feel threatened personally?  Were you
          6  concerned about your safety?  Did the Serb soldiers
          7  threaten you in any way during that period of time?
          8       A.   There was no direct threat, but there was a
          9  lot of tension.  I didn't feel safe.
         10       Q.   How?  Why?  Was that your impression, or were
         11  there some objective indicators of the lack of safety?
         12       A.   Right outside their room, there were two guys
         13  standing with Kalashnikovs.  We always had cameras
         14  around, asking us questions about military stuff or
         15  propaganda things.  To me, that's an indicator that
         16  we're not a guest of the Serbian army, as they told us,
         17  but more like we were being used for their purposes.
         18       Q.   You described the insignia, the
         19  characteristic patches, that the soldiers who came to
         20  your observation post wore the insignia of soldiers
         21  that you met in Pribicevic.  But during your stay in
         22  the Fontana Hotel, did you happen to see the insignia,
         23  the patches, of the soldiers who were in the same
         24  hotel?  Did they wear any characteristic patches?
         25       A.   Well, I did see some soldiers wearing a round

          1  patch, with the colours white, red, and blue and some
          2  letters around it.
          3       Q.   Mr. Van der Zwan, did you know if any other
          4  Serb units had a similar patch with a similar design as
          5  the one shown on Prosecutor's Exhibit 98?
          6            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could the usher
          7  please put it on the ELMO.
          8       Q.   The eagle with two heads and a crown, were
          9  there any other Serb units using this same coat of
         10  arms, this same insignia, except the units from
         11  Krajina?  Would you know that?
         12       A.   Yes, I know there are several badges with the
         13  eagle on it, or the Cetiris.
         14       Q.   The unit which was -- which provided guard
         15  over you which was in the school, and the members of
         16  which you used to see while you were kept in the school
         17  at Bratunac, could you identify that unit?  Do you know
         18  which unit that was?
         19       A.   No, I can't.
         20       Q.   Did they have any particular patches?
         21       A.   No patches at all.
         22       Q.   And when you talked, did you find out who was
         23  their superior?  Who did they report to?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   And who was that?

          1       A.   I don't know his name, but he was a very big
          2  guy, a lot of muscles.  He was wearing camouflage
          3  trousers, black T-shirt, with a black chest webbing, a
          4  small Samurai knife, and he was wearing a "Zastava 99
          5  pistolj," that's what he said.  It was the newest gun.
          6       Q.   The Zastava 99, that is what he said.
          7            Did he have any rank insignia?
          8       A.   No, but it was very clear to me that he was
          9  the commander by his behaviour towards the rest of the
         10  group.
         11       Q.   Mr. Van der Zwan, did any members of that
         12  group, of that unit, tell you about their previous
         13  missions, about where they had fought before that,
         14  before Srebrenica?
         15       A.   No.
         16       Q.   And on the basis of your experience with Serb
         17  forces that you gained either in Krajina or during your
         18  stay in Srebrenica, could you draw a conclusion that it
         19  was just a usual rank and file unit, or was it perhaps
         20  a special purpose unit, sort of?
         21       A.   The way I saw it, they were absolutely a
         22  special purpose unit.
         23       Q.   Thank you.  Just one question more.  You told
         24  us that you were at observation post "U", if I'm
         25  correct.

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   And that combatants from the Bratunac Brigade
          3  came to that OP.
          4       A.   I can't remember saying here that there were
          5  people of the Bratunac Brigade being there.  I only
          6  pointed out some emblems, but I don't know exactly from
          7  what brigade they were.
          8       Q.   They were men who were wearing insignia,
          9  patches, as the ones shown in Prosecutor's Exhibit 93.
         10       A.   Yes.  I got exactly that one from one of them
         11  at the observation post Uniform.
         12       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Van der Zwan.  I have no
         13  further questions.
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         15  Mr. President.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         17  Mr. Visnjic.
         18            Mr. Harmon, do you have any supplementary
         19  questions?  Yes, please, go on.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Just a few questions,
         21  Mr. President.
         22                 Re-examined by Mr. Harmon:
         23       Q.   You were asked by my colleague, Mr. Visnjic,
         24  which unit was guarding you, and it's unclear to me at
         25  which location Mr. Visnjic was referring to.  In your
          1  direct examination, you testified you first went to a
          2  barracks, you next went to the Hotel Fontana, and you
          3  lastly went to an area, a large complex where this dog
          4  unit was located.
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Your answer to Mr. Visnjic's question, as I
          7  understood it was, that the individuals that were
          8  guarding you were wearing camouflage trousers, a black
          9  T-shirt, a chest webbing, and had a Zastava 99 special
         10  pistol.
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   Were the people who were guarding you who
         13  were wearing those kind of clothes guarding you at the
         14  barracks?
         15       A.   No.
         16       Q.   Were the people who were guarding you wearing
         17  the kind of clothes you described guarding you at the
         18  Hotel Fontana?
         19       A.   No.
         20       Q.   So when you answered Mr. Visnjic's question,
         21  you're referring to the people who guarded you at the
         22  third location where you were detained; is that
         23  correct?
         24       A.   I was referring to the people with the dogs.
         25  They were present during the night and in the evening,
          1  and, well, also sort of guarding us by their presence.
          2       Q.   At the third location you've testified about?
          3       A.   I'm talking about the school behind the Hotel
          4  Fontana now.
          5       Q.   Thank you very much, Corporal.
          6            MR. HARMON:  I have no additional questions.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          8  Mr. Harmon.
          9            Judge Riad.
         10            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         11  Mr. President.
         12                 Questioned by the Court:
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning, Corporal Van der
         14  Zwan.
         15            I would like to ask you some searching
         16  questions concerning this extremely painful story you
         17  mentioned, or which the Serb officer told you and which
         18  you followed almost the next day.  Now, this Serb
         19  soldier, it was an officer, I understood, told you
         20  about the dog attacking the old man and then he killing
         21  the man, or the other one, and then I think the other
         22  man, his colleague, killed a man, and then he raped the
         23  girl, I suppose.  Was that right?
         24       A.   The same man that killed the older man --
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Raped the girl?

          1       A.   -- raped the girl, and it wasn't an officer,
          2  it was this soldier who was telling this story.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  The soldier was not in it at
          4  all.  He was just a spectator, a witness of it.
          5       A.   He was the dog handler.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  He was the dog handler.  Now,
          7  you, after all, were a United Nations representative,
          8  and was it so natural that he would tell you such
          9  horrible stories about what they were doing?  Were they
         10  boasting about it?  Was it something to be proud of?
         11  Was it to frighten you?  How did you understand this?
         12            And then the second day you said you saw the
         13  "butcher" bringing up the calf and then slaughtering
         14  it, cutting its stomach to show how he dealt with the
         15  girl.  They knew you were around.  So were they -- not
         16  only unaware of your presence, but they didn't care
         17  whether you would see it or not.
         18       A.   Well, to start with, when he was telling me
         19  the story, what I saw was, well, a colleague, a
         20  soldier, not being able to cope with the things that he
         21  had to do.  The guy was a dog handler, not a soldier.
         22  He was being made part of a group, not as a volunteer
         23  or not as a professional soldier.  And, well, he just
         24  couldn't take it anymore.  He was talking about it and
         25  crying and, well, yeah, he just couldn't take it

          1  anymore.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Was it under the influence of a
          3  drink or something?
          4       A.   No, he wasn't drinking at that moment.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  He was sober and telling you a
          6  fact.
          7       A.   Yes.  It made a lot of impression on me.  He
          8  wasn't bragging about it or ...
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  But then when this "butcher"
         10  came, this "butcher" was an officer?  What was he
         11  exactly?
         12       A.   I don't know.  He was a part of the group.  I
         13  didn't see him as in command or --
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  But this "butcher" was the man
         15  who raped the girl?
         16       A.   He was the one who was being pointed out to
         17  me, yes.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  And he was boasting about it and
         19  showing how he did it.
         20       A.   No, he was slaughtering a calf, but the guy
         21  standing next to him made a comment about it in the
         22  Serbian language, not addressed to me but addressed to
         23  him, so they were laughing about that.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  As a natural event, which they
         25  would do naturally.

          1       A.   Yes.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  How did you understand it if it
          3  was in Serb?
          4       A.   Because of me being placed on the Serbian
          5  barracks in 1993 and having Serbs around me all of the
          6  time.  At that time I picked up a lot of words and I'm
          7  able to get a lot of a sentence -- I can understand a
          8  lot of a sentence if I can hear it.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  Now, the fact that they
         10  were doing it and talking about it so naturally, did
         11  this mean that they were left free to do whatever they
         12  liked?  The soldiers could do anything without any
         13  restraints or being held responsible?
         14       A.   The way I saw the group working inside the
         15  building, and when they were packing their stuff to go
         16  on a mission, it was a very independent group.  They
         17  didn't get or receive orders from higher rankings.
         18  They worked -- it seemed like they were working on
         19  their own.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean, were they part of the
         21  army, or was it a band of outlaws?
         22       A.   No, they weren't outlaws.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  They were part of the army.
         24       A.   Absolutely a professional branch of an army.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  So they had commanders.

          1       A.   Yes, they must have had, but I didn't see
          2  them receiving orders.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  And in their behaviour, they
          4  showed that they can do anything.  They were not even
          5  trying to hide what they did.
          6       A.   No.  They were making jokes about it, Your
          7  Honour.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  And you said that the unit --
          9  there was a unit where you were detained, I think ten
         10  Serb soldiers, and they used to go every day to the
         11  fields for certain operations.
         12       A.   That's the same unit.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you understand what
         14  operations it was?
         15       A.   No, but they were taking dogs.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  They were taking dogs.
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you understand, more or
         19  less, how they were using the dogs?
         20       A.   That was explained to me by the dog handler.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Which was?
         22       A.   To cleanse houses or to track down people.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  And when you were held by these
         24  ten soldiers, your movement was limited, you were
         25  almost like a prisoner, were you?  Or were you a free

          1  man, going around and watching everything?
          2       A.   We weren't allowed outside the building, not
          3  by the Serbs and also not by their own commander.  But
          4  because of me having a bit of knowledge of the
          5  language, my commander let me free.  So I was allowed
          6  to walk to the main door of the building and to talk to
          7  the people.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you hear anything else,
          9  apart from what you told us?  Other people boasting
         10  about what they did, and so on?
         11       A.   Yes.  At some time I saw an army vehicle, a
         12  TAM-110, driving in the other direction as the convoy
         13  of refugees, and I was asking to one of the guards what
         14  that was, and he told me that those were men that were
         15  being -- that were going to be tried for crimes they
         16  committed to the Serbian -- to the Serb forces or to
         17  the Serbians.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  That's all?
         19       A.   That's all.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         22  very much, Judge Riad.
         23            Judge Wald.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  Corporal, you said that you had
         25  previously served on a Serb -- or around the Serb

          1  soldiers on a Serb barracks, a Serb base, and were
          2  familiar with some words of their dialect.  Were you at
          3  all familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet, in other
          4  words, with the letters that were Serbian?  I mean,
          5  could you read any words in Serbo-Croat?
          6       A.   I cannot read the Cyrillic letters.  I can
          7  only recognise some signs, so I can make out what it
          8  says.
          9            JUDGE WALD:  So when you testified earlier
         10  that after the people with the wolf patches came in,
         11  there were some other soldiers, one of whom gave you
         12  his arm patch because you had an interest in and
         13  collected arm patches.  So there's a lot of writing on
         14  that arm patch, which is Exhibit 93, which appears to
         15  say "Bratunik Brigada", but you were not familiar then
         16  with those letters, or you didn't ask afterwards when
         17  you collected the badge what it said?
         18       A.   No, I didn't.
         19            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  You testified later on
         20  that you saw some other soldiers at a later point with
         21  a patch which appeared to be the same as the one you'd
         22  encountered in your earlier mission from Krajina;
         23  right?  You sounded surprised at that.  What
         24  significance, if any, did it have for you to see that
         25  soldier with the Krajina patch here in this new

          1  environment?  What did you think?
          2       A.   Well, it struck me being very strange.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  Why?
          4       A.   Well, they were far away from home.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  I mean, roughly how far?
          6  Hundreds of miles or fifty miles?  Just roughly.
          7       A.   I cannot make a -- I cannot make up a --
          8            JUDGE WALD:  But you were surprised.  You
          9  wouldn't have expected to see them in this particular
         10  area; is that right?
         11       A.   No, I didn't expect them to be there at all.
         12  I was very surprised.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Now, you testified, in
         14  answering the Defence counsel's question, that you were
         15  pretty confidant that this was a special purpose unit
         16  that was with you in the end when you were being
         17  detained.  I want to make sure I understood that.  Was
         18  that the unit with the dogs, or was it just the unit
         19  that was there in either the school or the hotel or
         20  some place else that was detaining you?  Which unit did
         21  you think was the special purpose unit?
         22       A.   I was referring to the people with the dogs.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  Right.  And was it primarily
         24  that reason that you thought it was a special purpose
         25  unit, the fact that they used dogs, and generally units

          1  that use dogs are special purpose units?
          2       A.   It's not only that.  It's also the materiel
          3  they were using.
          4            JUDGE WALD:  What?
          5       A.   They had very, very new weapons, good
          6  materiel, chest webbings.  That all indicates that --
          7  yeah, they were better equipped than the normal
          8  soldiers.
          9            JUDGE WALD:  And in your conversations with
         10  the former dog trainer, who recounted this sad story to
         11  you, did it ever come up what unit he belonged to?  Did
         12  he mention it at all by name or designation?
         13       A.   Not a name.  He was talking about him coming
         14  from the area of Sarajevo.  That's all I can say about
         15  that.
         16            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Corporal, I
         18  also have a few questions for you.  If I have
         19  understood you correctly, you collect insignia.  You
         20  are almost an expert in military insignia, if I can say
         21  that.
         22       A.   I'm not an expert, but I've got a lot of
         23  captions, signs, of the Serbian army, yes.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] When you
         25  saw the badge that appears on Prosecutor's Exhibit 98,

          1  that is, the insignia from Krajina, were you able to
          2  compare it, to make a connection between the insignia
          3  and the uniform that was worn by those soldiers?  What
          4  kind of uniform did they wear?
          5       A.   They were wearing a new type camouflage
          6  uniform of the Serbian army, so the olive-green uniform
          7  with brown spots on it, stains on it.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          9  Do you recall the date when the observation post "U"
         10  was shelled, or rather taken over?
         11       A.   No, I can't recall any dates at all.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] When an
         13  officer came in a jeep and when he told you to get in
         14  to go to Bratunac, how many were you?
         15       A.   We were with seven people, so six soldiers,
         16  the sergeant, and our own APC, our own vehicle.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So the same
         18  soldiers as the ones who, at the beginning, had arrived
         19  in the Fontana Hotel.
         20       A.   I don't understand that question, Your
         21  Honour.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You told us
         23  that at the beginning, at the Hotel Fontana, that there
         24  had been seven soldiers, and after that between 25 and
         25  30 Dutch soldiers.

          1            When you spoke about the officer who came in
          2  a jeep, you did not say how many you were.  Now what I
          3  wish to know is whether the seven soldiers who were
          4  transported in that jeep were the same as the ones that
          5  you mentioned that were, at the beginning, at the
          6  Fontana Hotel.
          7       A.   Okay.  It's about the seven soldiers that I
          8  was working with on the observation post, and we were
          9  not transported in that jeep, we had to follow the
         10  jeep, driving our own armoured personnel carrier, so
         11  our own APC.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         13  Now I understand.
         14            Another question.  At the third location
         15  where you were, there was a man with a pistol, with a
         16  Zastava 99, and you said that according to his attitude
         17  he was a commander, and that it was judging from his
         18  conduct that you were able to conclude that he was a
         19  commander.  Could you describe his conduct which made
         20  you reach that conclusion?
         21       A.   Yes, he was clearly the commander because he
         22  was giving out the orders to the other people, the
         23  other members of the group.  He was telling them what
         24  to do, when to pack their stuff, when to get ready to
         25  leave, and he was doing that in a very sergeant-like

          1  way.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You were
          3  able to understand a little the Serb language.  Did you
          4  understand, did you hear the orders that he was giving?
          5       A.   I cannot recall that.  Sorry.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You told us
          7  that while you were there at that particular location,
          8  you had seen a truck or a bus passing by with
          9  refugees.  How many buses or trucks did you actually
         10  see?
         11       A.   I saw -- at that moment I saw one, and it was
         12  an army vehicle, a truck, with a container on the back
         13  of it, with a small window in it and some bars in front
         14  of it.  I could clearly see that there were people in
         15  there because the window was gone and there were some
         16  arms sticking out of that window.
         17            When I heard what was in that truck and what
         18  was going to happen with them, I directly went to my
         19  commander to tell that.  So I don't know if that car
         20  was being -- was going to be followed up by several
         21  more.  I don't know.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Did you
         23  know who was on that truck?  Were there women,
         24  children, men on that truck?  Who was there?
         25       A.   The guy that was standing next to me, the

          1  Serbian man, he told me that they were men that were
          2  going to be tried.  I couldn't see that myself.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          4  very much for your contribution, Corporal.  Thank you
          5  for coming here to testify before International
          6  Tribunal.
          7            As far as I can tell, there are certain
          8  exhibits that need to be taken care of, Mr. Harmon.
          9            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  Mr. President, we would
         10  seek admission into evidence of Prosecutor's Exhibits
         11  93 through 96 and 98.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         13  Mr. Visnjic, any objections?
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] No, Your
         15  Honour.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         17  then.  The exhibits shall be admitted into evidence,
         18  and I hope that the registrar will take care of that.
         19            Corporal, you are now free to go.  Thank you
         20  very much.  The usher will help you out of the
         21  courtroom.  Once again, thank you for coming here, and
         22  I hope that you will be able to find peace and joy in
         23  this beautiful country of yours.
         24                 [The witness withdrew]
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
          1  do we have another witness?  A protected one or not?
          2            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, we have gone
          3  through witnesses at a record rate today, so we didn't
          4  anticipate having -- ending the day without a witness.
          5  We have a witness in the next order of presentation who
          6  is an older man who is a survivor of the Branjevo Farm
          7  massacre.  We decided that we would call him tomorrow.
          8  We didn't want to put him through two days of this kind
          9  of testimony.
         10            However, may I propose to the Court, we have,
         11  with the consent of counsel, earlier agreed upon four
         12  testimonies that were presented to a Chamber of the
         13  Tribunal in respect of the Karadzic and Mladic Rule 61
         14  hearing.  We have one tape today we're prepared to play
         15  for approximately 58 minutes, and it is the testimony
         16  of one of a people, a Dutch soldier, who saw an
         17  execution in Potocari.  We could propose, for your
         18  consideration, to play that tape for the remainder of
         19  the afternoon.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         21  Mr. Harmon, I think this is a very good idea, and
         22  congratulations for having heard your witnesses in such
         23  a rapid fashion.  This is starting to look like a
         24  race.
         25            I think that it's a good idea to have a break

          1  now.  You said the video was 55 or 50 minutes long,
          2  more or less, so we will be able to see the video in
          3  its entirety.
          4            We could perhaps ask the interpreters to stay
          5  a bit longer, perhaps ten minutes, because tomorrow
          6  they will be compensated, as I have already announced,
          7  you will be able to sleep in a little bit tomorrow
          8  morning because we are starting at 10.00.
          9            We also have to change a courtroom.  We will
         10  be sitting in Courtroom II, however with the
         11  possibility of following the direct transmission, the
         12  direct broadcast, in the lobby.  So the hearing can be
         13  followed in that way.
         14            I haven't heard the answer by the
         15  interpreters.  Yes.  Thank you very much.
         16            Mr. Harmon, you were about to say something?
         17            MR. HARMON:  I was, Mr. President.  To
         18  accompany the tape, we have French and English
         19  translations of the testimonies as well, which we will
         20  present to Your Honours before the tape is played.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] This is a
         22  very good piece of news.  We have French translations
         23  coming in at the same time, simultaneously.
         24            So we shall have a 15-minute break, and after
         25  that we will resume with the video.

          1            Mr. Harmon told us that the Defence was
          2  agreeable to this proposal; however, I should need to
          3  hear the formal consent.
          4            Mr. Visnjic?  Mr. Petrusic?
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes,
          6  Mr. President.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          8  very much.
          9            Quarter of an hour of break, and then we will
         10  continue with the video.  Can everything be ready so
         11  that we can start right away after the break.
         12                 --- Recess taken at 1.38 p.m.
         13                 --- On resuming at 1.55 p.m.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         15  Mr. Harmon.
         16            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, we propose to
         17  introduce into evidence Prosecutor's Exhibit 32, which
         18  is a cassette of the testimony of Corporal Groenewegen,
         19  taken at the Rule 61 hearing of Karadzic and Mladic, on
         20  the 4th of July, 1996.  We would also submit
         21  Prosecutor's Exhibit 32A, which is the English
         22  transcript of that testimony, 32B, which is the B/C/S
         23  transcript, and 32C, which is the transcript in
         24  French.
         25            The audio booth, I'm told, is prepared to

          1  start the film at the Court's convenience.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
          3            Mr. Petrusic, you haven't said anything
          4  regarding the Exhibits 32B and 32C.  Do you have any
          5  objections to these?
          6            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No,
          7  Mr. President.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
          9  then.  So Madam Registrar, the exhibits will be
         10  admitted into evidence.  Thank you very much.
         11            We can start.  If the technicians are ready,
         12  we are ready too.
         13                 [Videotape played]
         14                 [The accused entered court]
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
         16  the audio booth.  I'm sorry, General Krstic, I actually
         17  didn't realise that you were not here.
         18            Could we start from the beginning, please.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, I would like to
         20  introduce as the Prosecutor's next exhibit a video
         21  cassette of the testimony of Corporal Groenewegen,
         22  which was taken on the 4th of July, 1996, in the Rule
         23  61 hearing involving Karadzic and Mladic.  I would also
         24  tender three transcripts from that hearing;
         25  Prosecutor's Exhibit 32A, which is the English

          1  transcript, 32B, which is the B/C/S transcript, and
          2  32C, which is the French transcript of that hearing.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
          4  I'm somewhat confused.  You've already asked for these
          5  exhibits to be admitted into evidence, 32A, 32B and
          6  32C.
          7            MR. HARMON:  I thought you asked me to repeat
          8  myself, since General Krstic wasn't present, so I
          9  repeated what I said in his absence.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, you're
         11  perfectly right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Harmon.  I
         12  also think that the Defence will state once again their
         13  agreement.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes,
         15  Mr. President.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         17  very much, once again, and my apologies to General
         18  Krstic.
         19            Now I believe that we are ready.
         20                 [Videotape played]
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         22  I believe we have finished too, or haven't we?
         23            MR. HARMON:  Yes, Mr. President.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         25  Having seen this video, we shall adjourn the hearing

          1  until tomorrow morning, at 10, in Courtroom II.  I
          2  hope everyone understands that.  We shall be back again
          3  tomorrow at 10.  Thank you.
          4            The session is adjourned.
          5                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
          6                 2.58 p.m., to be reconvened on Friday,
