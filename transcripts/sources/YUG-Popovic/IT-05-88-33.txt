          3                 --- Upon commencing at 9.39 a.m.
          4                 [The accused entered court]
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          6  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning,
          7  technicians; good morning to our interpreters, our
          8  legal clerks; good morning, counsel for the
          9  Prosecution, counsel for the Defence; good morning,
         10  General Krstic.  We will resume our hearing in the
         11  Krstic case.  The appearances are the same, for the
         12  record.  And if I could have the witness brought into
         13  the courtroom, please.  I believe it's still Witness N.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  He's a protected witness,
         15  and we'll have to draw the blinds.
         16            Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours;
         17  good morning, counsel.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] For the
         19  public, let me just say that the blinds will be pulled
         20  down while the witness is being brought in, and after
         21  that they will be pulled up again.
         22                 [The witness entered court]
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         24  morning, Witness N.  Can you hear me?
         25            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can.  Good morning.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Have you
          2  had a restful night?  Did you sleep well?
          3            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I did.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
          5  seated now.
          6            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Let me just
          8  remind you that you are still under an oath and that
          9  you will continue answering questions that will be put
         10  to you by Mr. Harmon.  Thank you.
         11            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         13                 WITNESS:  WITNESS N [Resumed]
         14                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         15                 Examined by Mr. Harmon: [Cont'd]
         16       Q.   Good morning, Witness N.
         17       A.   Good morning.
         18       Q.   When we concluded your testimony yesterday,
         19  you were describing your journey from a warehouse in
         20  Bratunac to a school somewhere in the area of Zvornik,
         21  and you had left the warehouse sometime on the 13th of
         22  July; is that correct?
         23       A.   Yes, it is.
         24       Q.   Now, approximately what time did you arrive
         25  at the school that was located in the Zvornik area?

          1       A.   It was past midnight.
          2       Q.   So you arrived in the early morning, then, of
          3  the 14th of July?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Had you ever been to that school before?
          6       A.   No, I had not.
          7       Q.   Witness N, would you tell the Judges what
          8  happened once you arrived at the school.
          9       A.   Once we arrived in the schoolyard, the buses
         10  stopped and the Serb soldiers approached the buses.
         11  The buses opened -- the doors of the buses opened and
         12  people started coming out in columns.  They were going
         13  in the direction of a gym, of a gymnasium, and they
         14  were getting into that gym.  At that moment, the doors
         15  of my bus opened as well and we got out, and we passed
         16  by some Serb soldiers and went in the direction of the
         17  gym, and we entered the gym and sat down.
         18       Q.   Now, when you got off the bus, Witness N,
         19  approximately how many Bosnian Serb soldiers did you
         20  see?
         21       A.   Between 15 and 20, 15 to 20 soldiers.
         22       Q.   And do you recall how those soldiers were
         23  dressed?
         24       A.   They were dressed in camouflage uniform.
         25       Q.   Do you remember the colour of the

          1  camouflage?  Was it a police camouflage uniform or was
          2  it an army camouflage uniform?
          3       A.   An army camouflage uniform.
          4       Q.   Now, you said you went into a gym.
          5            MR. HARMON:  If I could have Prosecutor's
          6  Exhibit --
          7       A.   Yes.
          8            MR. HARMON:  -- 19/5 placed on the ELMO.
          9       Q.   Witness N, I'm going to show you a
         10  photograph, an interior photograph of a gymnasium, and
         11  I'm going to ask you if you can identify this
         12  particular photograph.  The usher will place it on the
         13  ELMO and you'll be able to see it on the monitor in
         14  front of you.
         15            MR. HARMON:  It's not very visible on the
         16  monitor.  Perhaps, Mr. Usher, if you could show this
         17  photograph to the witness first and then we can place
         18  it on the monitor.
         19       Q.   Witness N, is this the gymnasium where you
         20  and the other men were brought in that school area?
         21       A.   Yes, it is.
         22       Q.   All right.  Now --
         23            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. Usher.  I've
         24  concluded with that exhibit.
         25       Q.   After you arrived and the people on your bus

          1  and the people in your convoy, did other Muslim men
          2  continue to arrive and continue to enter into the
          3  gymnasium?
          4       A.   Yes, they did, but when it dawned, after it
          5  had dawned, the groups were still being brought in and
          6  they were taken into the gymnasium as well.  This
          7  lasted until I don't remember what time, but after
          8  that, at one point General Mladic appeared at the door,
          9  and because we were very crowded in that gymnasium and
         10  because we were not given any bread or water, we cried
         11  out, all in one voice, "Why are you torturing us
         12  here?"  And then he said, "Well, your government does
         13  not want you, and I have to take care of you."  One
         14  group of you will be taken to Kladusa, to Fikret Abdic,
         15  and one group will be transported to Bijeljina.  You
         16  will also be given water when you get out of the gym.
         17  He left, and then later --
         18       Q.   Let me interrupt you right there for just a
         19  second.  Can you estimate the number of men who were in
         20  the gym with you when the gym was at its fullest
         21  capacity?
         22       A.   About 2.500.
         23       Q.   Now, at any point in time while you were in
         24  that gymnasium, did Bosnian Serb soldiers come into the
         25  gymnasium and shoot their weapons, shoot their guns?

          1       A.   Yes, they did.  We would from time to time
          2  start shouting, because we couldn't take it anymore.
          3  We were suffocating.  There was no air, there was no
          4  water.  And then we would start shouting and they would
          5  then open fire and shoot above our heads.  And then
          6  everything would be silent for a while and they would
          7  say, "Just keep quiet, else you will all be shot."
          8       Q.   Now, Witness N, continue describing what
          9  occurred to you and to the other men at that gymnasium,
         10  please.
         11       A.   Then the Bosnian Serbs who were standing
         12  guard issued some orders.  There was a group of them
         13  standing to the left of the door, of the main door, and
         14  they ordered men to get out of the gymnasium through
         15  that door.  They said that they would be taken
         16  somewhere.  And the Bosnian Serb soldiers then brought
         17  some stripes of cloth with which they blindfolded us,
         18  and they gave some people some water and left
         19  somewhere.  A column would march for a while and then
         20  it would stop, and this would last for a couple of
         21  minutes and then another column would be leaving the
         22  gymnasium after that.
         23            When people starting getting out, we heard
         24  somewhere, coming from the distance, bursts of
         25  gunfire.  Then it would stop, then everything would be

          1  quiet for a while, and after a while we would hear
          2  rifles being fired again, again at the same spot.  And
          3  some elderly people said at that point, "They're taking
          4  everyone.  They're killing everyone."  And in the
          5  evening hours, between 7.00, 7.30 p.m., it was my turn
          6  to leave the gymnasium, together with some other
          7  people.  I drank some water, and I was blindfolded, and
          8  I boarded a small truck which is called tamic.
          9            After it got full, it set out, and a red
         10  vehicle was following the truck and there was one
         11  soldier with an automatic rifle there and he was
         12  threatening us.  He didn't let us speak.  He said, "I
         13  will kill you all."
         14            We did not travel for very long.  At one
         15  point we turned off the road and went into a field,
         16  where we saw a lot of dead people.  The TAM truck
         17  stopped and two Serb soldiers approached the truck.
         18  They opened the backside of the truck and they ordered
         19  us to get out.  And I was the last one in the truck, so
         20  I was taken out first.  And they showed me where I was
         21  supposed to stand, next to some dead bodies.  And
         22  everybody was lined up like that, in several rows, with
         23  their backs facing them.
         24            The tamic left immediately, and immediately
         25  after it had left, we heard automatic rifles being

          1  fired.  Everybody fell down at that point, and those
          2  who were not killed, who were still giving some signs
          3  of life, were shot at individually, were killed
          4  individually.  I didn't dare move.  I was just looking
          5  downwards towards the ground.  And when the TAM truck
          6  left, when it moved, I turned around and I realised
          7  that it was taking people to another location.  It was
          8  the same kind of truck, the same TAM truck, and it was
          9  also followed by a red car.
         10            And after a while the red car came back, and
         11  a little later this same TAM truck came to my location
         12  and it brought people to our location again, some 10 to
         13  15 meters away from me.  Men were again being ordered
         14  out of the truck and taken out.  And the red car also
         15  stopped and Ratko Mladic got out of the car, together
         16  with the soldiers who were accompanying him, and they
         17  were watching people being taken out of the TAM truck
         18  and being lined up and executed.
         19            After they had finished their job, Ratko
         20  Mladic sat down in the same red car and he went back in
         21  the direction of the gymnasium.
         22            They continued bringing people and killing
         23  people and this lasted until dusk.  Behind my back
         24  there was an excavator who was digging a mass grave.
         25       Q.   Now, let me interrupt you right there for a

          1  minute, Witness N.  I want to clarify a couple of
          2  points in your testimony.
          3            You said when you left the school, a
          4  blindfold was put over your eyes, and you testified
          5  when you were in the truck in route to the execution
          6  field, you could see a red car that was following you.
          7  How was it, if you were blindfolded, you could see a
          8  red car that was following you?
          9       A.   When I was blindfolded, immediately when they
         10  had blindfolded me, I moved the blindfold a little bit
         11  upwards so that I could see.  (redacted)
         12  (redacted)
         13  (redacted).  But they weren't paying much
         14  attention to whether people were taking off their
         15  blindfolds or not.  They were simply telling us not to
         16  talk and that was all.
         17       Q.   Now, Witness N, can you describe the soldiers
         18  who were the executioners?  How were they dressed; do
         19  you remember?
         20       A.   Yes, I remember.  They were dressed in dark
         21  green camouflage uniforms.
         22       Q.   All right.  Let's carry on with your account
         23  of the events on the 14th of July.  You said, before I
         24  interrupted you, that you had seen some kind of
         25  mechanical equipment doing something.  Could you tell

          1  the Judges what you saw and what you saw it doing.
          2       A.   I saw an excavator.  It was behind my back.
          3  It had a bucket, a kind of shovel.  And it's a kind of
          4  machine that can both dig into the earth and also
          5  transport various material.
          6       Q.   Now, when you saw that excavator, was it dark
          7  outside or was it light?
          8       A.   It was daylight.
          9       Q.   Okay.  And how long did that excavator work
         10  in your vicinity?
         11       A.   It worked until nightfall.  When it became
         12  dark, another excavator arrived and they switched on
         13  their headlights.
         14            At that point, they were bringing bodies to
         15  one location only, and they were killing people at that
         16  location and the lights of the excavators were on and
         17  they kept killing men.  And this continued until they
         18  finished off everyone.  And when the last TAM truck
         19  arrived, somebody said, "That's it, there's no one
         20  left."  One of the Serb soldiers asked, "Are we going
         21  back with you?"  And this other man replied, "No,
         22  you're not going back with me.  Maybe there will be
         23  another truck coming back to pick you up, and then you
         24  will go back.  If it doesn't show up, then you will
         25  have to stand guard all night."

          1            Then after the truck had left, they remained
          2  standing and smoking next to the excavator.  After
          3  that, a similar truck arrived with its lights on and I
          4  could hear people talk, but I didn't make out what they
          5  were saying.
          6            Then they switched off their lights, and we
          7  could see well, because it was moonlight.  Then
          8  everybody sat down in the excavator and the truck and
          9  they went in the direction of the gymnasium.
         10            After they had left, I stood up and I started
         11  shouting.  I wanted to see if there was anyone alive so
         12  we could leave together.
         13       Q.   Before we get to that part of your testimony,
         14  do I understand your testimony correctly, then, that
         15  while the excavators were working and while it was
         16  dark, additional men, Muslim men were being brought to
         17  the execution site and were being executed in the front
         18  of the lights of these excavators?
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Now, let me show you two exhibits.
         21            MR. HARMON:  And before I show you these
         22  exhibits, Mr. Dubuisson, it will be Prosecutor's
         23  Exhibit 20/5 and 20/8.
         24       Q.   Immediately behind the execution field where
         25  the men had been killed, can you describe the terrain?

          1            MR. HARMON:  Not yet, Mr. Usher.
          2       Q.   Can you describe the terrain, Witness N.  Was
          3  it level, was it -- did it have other types of physical
          4  features?
          5       A.   It was more or less level, flat; not
          6  completely, but almost.  But where the excavator was
          7  digging, there was a slope, a little hill.  There
          8  wasn't much grass on it.  It was a kind of field and it
          9  was not completely flat.
         10       Q.   And behind the grass field, what was there?
         11       A.   There was a small forest above the area where
         12  the excavator was working, up the hill, up the slope, a
         13  small forest.
         14       Q.   Now, while you were at the execution site,
         15  did you notice any unique kind of physical structure
         16  that was in the area?
         17       A.   I noticed a kind of iron fence, iron
         18  railing.  I don't know whether it was part of a bridge
         19  or whether it was just a fence that was there as a kind
         20  of protection.  This is what I noticed.
         21       Q.   Now, I've shown you Prosecutor's Exhibit
         22  20/5.
         23            MR. HARMON:  And if you could put that on the
         24  ELMO, please, Mr. Usher.
         25       Q.   You've had an opportunity to see this; is

          1  that correct, Witness N?
          2       A.   Yes, I have.  I saw the same fence there in
          3  the immediate vicinity of the grave where the execution
          4  site was.
          5            MR. HARMON:  Now could you next place
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 20/8 on the ELMO.  Thank you.
          7       Q.   Do you see that same fence in Prosecutor's
          8  Exhibit 20/8?
          9       A.   Yes, I do.
         10       Q.   Can you point it out, please?
         11       A.   [Indicates].
         12            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, the
         13  small rail above the tunnel leading underneath the
         14  railroad tracks.
         15       Q.   Thank you, Witness N.  Now, therefore, does
         16  this location that's depicted in this photograph appear
         17  to you to be the same location where you were at the
         18  time of the executions?
         19       A.   Yes, I think it's the same location where the
         20  executions took place.
         21       Q.   Now, Witness N, I interrupted you when you
         22  had testified that you had stood up after everybody had
         23  left.  What happened then?
         24       A.   I called out is there anyone alive for us to
         25  go?  And one nearby answered back and said he was

          1  alive.  He got up, and we left that location and
          2  crossed the pastures and turned left uphill into a wood
          3  there.
          4            In the wood, we sat down to have a rest.  And
          5  then we heard shots at the same spot.  The man with me
          6  said, "There they are.  They've come back again."  And
          7  I said "Let them."  Then we saw another shot closer to
          8  us.  And then he said, "They must have seen our traces
          9  through the high grass," because there was moonlight.
         10            As we felt them coming after us, we turned to
         11  the right and entered a thick thicket on our stomachs.
         12  They were following us, they shot into the woods, and
         13  then we wondered where we should go.  And then we
         14  thought let's go to the railway track and retrace our
         15  steps.  The railway track was immediately nearby.
         16            So when they went back to the place where
         17  they started shooting, we got up and went through the
         18  woods towards Tuzla.
         19            So the next day, when it dawned, another man
         20  appeared on the hill who had been there at the
         21  execution site like us.  He joined us and continued
         22  with us and we crossed into free territory at Nezvuk.
         23       Q.   What date was that?
         24       A.   The date was the 19th.  I think it was a
         25  Wednesday.

          1       Q.   Now, one last question:  When you stood up,
          2  were you able to look around the execution field and
          3  were you able to estimate the number of bodies that
          4  were laying in that field?
          5       A.   It seemed to us that there were more than we
          6  had seen in the gym.  That's what it looked like to us.
          7       Q.   All right.  Witness N, I've concluded my
          8  examination of you.
          9            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President --
         10       Q.   Now it's the time for the Defence lawyers to
         11  examine you, Witness N.  Thank you very much.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         13  Mr. Harmon.
         14            Witness N, you are now going to answer
         15  questions put to you by Mr. Petrusic, the Defence
         16  counsel for Mr. Krstic.
         17            Mr. Petrusic, you have the floor
         18                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         19            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]  Thank you,
         20  and good morning Your Honours; my learned friends from
         21  the Prosecution.
         22       Q.   Good morning, Witness.
         23       A.   Good morning, Mr. Lawyer.
         24       Q.   When you reached the warehouse in Bratunac on
         25  the 12th of July, people started to be taken out in the
          1  evening, Muslims started to be taken out?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   They took out Hamdija Efendic?
          4       A.   No, Hamed Efendic.
          5       Q.   Yes, I'm sorry, Hamed.  Hamed Efendic was the
          6  president of the Party of Democratic Action of
          7  Srebrenica?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Did they look for him by name and take him
         10  out because he was the president?
         11       A.   They brought him there separately, and they
         12  called him out specifically to come out, but they
         13  didn't say why he was being taken out, whether it was
         14  because he was the president or not.
         15       Q.   Was it your conclusion that that was the
         16  reason why they took him out?
         17       A.   I don't know.
         18       Q.   Do you know what happened to Hamed?
         19       A.   A rifle shot was heard and one of those, your
         20  Serb soldiers said, "He's killed, he's finished.  Don't
         21  shoot again."
         22       Q.   And the others that were taken out were
         23  called out by their first and last names?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Or were they called out by the village they

          1  came from?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   So they were looking for particular people?
          4       A.   Yes, from particular places.
          5       Q.   They looked for Ibran Mustafic as well,
          6  didn't they?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   Ibran Mustafic was politically very active, I
          9  think.  He was president of the municipality of
         10  Srebrenica?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   In one of your earlier statements, you said
         13  that they killed Ibran Mustafic and that he didn't come
         14  back --
         15       A.   That he didn't come back.  What happened to
         16  him, there was a kind of argument heard between him and
         17  the Serb guards.  He didn't come back into the gym.
         18  What happened, I don't know.
         19       Q.   You also said that you heard from soldiers
         20  who were outside, the words "he's finished"?
         21       A.   Hamed, yes.
         22       Q.   Witness N, I should like to show you the
         23  statement you gave to the State Security Service in
         24  Tuzla on the 25th of July, 1995.
         25            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] It will be

          1  Exhibit D-17.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] For Your
          3  Honours, it is page two which has been highlighted, the
          4  second sentence in the highlighted passage.
          5       Q.   Witness N, this is your statement, isn't it?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   The second sentence in the highlighted part
          8  in the first paragraph says, "After that, they called
          9  out Ibran Mustafic, son of Mujo, former head of
         10  Srebrenica municipality and deputy in the BH
         11  parliament, the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and
         12  killed him with a blunt object.  I did not see them
         13  beat him, but I heard the blows and his cries and a
         14  Chetnik who said, 'He's finished.'"
         15            Did you make that statement to the State
         16  Security Service?
         17       A.   Well, certainly I can't remember, but I'm not
         18  denying that I said that as well, because if that is
         19  what I said, that is what they said; I didn't add or
         20  detract from anything that I personally did not see or
         21  hear.
         22       Q.   But Ibran Mustafic is alive?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Witness N, during those days, you saw General
         25  Mladic on a number of occasions, you even spoke to him;

          1  I could put it that way.
          2       A.   Yes.  Only once I asked him a question.
          3       Q.   One of those questions was on the 13th of
          4  July, 1995, in the warehouse, after you had spent the
          5  night in the warehouse in Bratunac, in the morning,
          6  when you addressed him with the words:  "What are you
          7  doing with us?  Why are you killing people?  Why are
          8  you not taking us to be exchanged?"  This is also from
          9  the same statement that you made, the second paragraph
         10  of the English version.
         11            MR. PETRUSIC [Interpretation] And both Your
         12  Honours and the Prosecutor have this document.
         13       Q.   What was General Mladic's reply to your
         14  statement that people were being killed?
         15       A.   He said, "You will no longer be killed.  It
         16  was not possible to come to an agreement earlier on.
         17  If that agreement had been reached, this wouldn't have
         18  happened.  We have come to an agreement now.  You're
         19  going to Kalisija.  Count yourselves so that I can
         20  designate transportation."
         21       Q.   Did he ask you who was killing men?
         22       A.   No.
         23       Q.   In your further contacts, did you tell him
         24  that this was happening?
         25       A.   No, I did not.

          1       Q.   When they -- I may be wrong, but I think it
          2  was on the 14th of July when they brought you to this
          3  meadow for execution.  You again saw Mladic?
          4       A.   I did.
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I would like
          6  to ask the usher to place on the ELMO Prosecutor's
          7  Exhibit 20/8, for the witness to try to explain to us.
          8       Q.   Can you tell us, on this photograph, where
          9  did that tamic come to a halt, the small truck that
         10  brought you there?
         11       A.   Roughly here, somewhere here [indicates].
         12            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] For the
         13  record, the witness is pointing to the far right side
         14  of the photograph, midway up.
         15       Q.   Where did they take your group?
         16       A.   Here [indicates].
         17       Q.   That is where the truck stopped?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   And where did they take your group?
         20       A.   My group, here [indicates].
         21       Q.   How far was that from the truck?
         22       A.   I don't know which truck, because the truck
         23  didn't come once; as the truck moved away, the next
         24  groups came, because they were killing one after
         25  another.  If the first truck was five to ten meters,

          1  about five meters, then the second came, and the third
          2  was up here [indicates].  And they went on like that,
          3  in a line.
          4       Q.   So in relation to the truck, and you told us
          5  the spot where it was, your group was executed right
          6  next to the truck?
          7       A.   As soon as the truck moved away, the group
          8  was liquidated.
          9       Q.   Please, where was your body, or rather in
         10  what position was it in relation to this small thicket
         11  we see to the left?
         12       A.   My head was turned this way and my legs
         13  towards the thicket.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I think it is
         15  clear for the record, Your Honour.
         16       Q.   And so from that position you saw Mladic
         17  arriving?
         18       A.   I did.
         19       Q.   Were you able to hear him say anything?
         20       A.   I could not, because the truck's engine was
         21  still on while they were unloading the men, so that the
         22  engine was on and I couldn't hear whether he was
         23  talking or not.
         24       Q.   You remained on that spot for several hours,
         25  until the last group that arrived was executed?

          1       A.   That is what somebody said:  When the last
          2  truck arrived, there were no more, that it was all
          3  over.
          4       Q.   So you didn't move from there?
          5       A.   I did.  When night fell and when they turned
          6  on the lights, I took shelter.  It was cloudy and it
          7  started to drizzle, so the lights were not on me, and I
          8  drew myself from under that dead pile and I went to the
          9  left.  And after a couple of meters I was free and I
         10  lay there until they finished it all.
         11       Q.   So you abandoned the spot; you left the spot
         12  where you were originally and moved a couple of meters
         13  away.  From that spot did you notice anything?
         14       A.   I noticed a truck coming, with men, and saw
         15  the dead in front of me.
         16       Q.   And did you see from that spot Ratko Mladic
         17  coming four or five times?
         18       A.   No.  Only once.
         19       Q.   In your statement that you have before you
         20  that you saw four or five times -- just a moment,
         21  please.  Just a moment, please.  We're talking about a
         22  particular time and place, this particular place, where
         23  you say --
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I think in the
         25  English version that is page 3, and the last

          1  highlighted paragraph.
          2       Q.   -- and I quote:
          3            "While I lay there, the blood of the dead was
          4  covering me.  The Chetniks were bringing new groups in
          5  the tamic and killing them.
          6            "When dark fell, about an hour after I had
          7  been brought there, I took advantage of the Chetniks'
          8  carelessness and crawled into some bushes, where I
          9  hid.  From that place I saw them bringing new groups in
         10  a tamic and killing them by the light of the headlights
         11  of the two excavators, as they had also brought a
         12  second excavator to this spot.  While I lay there, I
         13  saw Ratko Mladic, bareheaded, come up behind the tamic
         14  four or five times in a red car and watch the
         15  executions."
         16       A.   The translation is wrong.  A red car escorted
         17  every tamic, and Ratko Mladic appeared only once.  And
         18  I saw Ratko Mladic in all six times, so this must be an
         19  error in the translation.  I never said that Ratko
         20  Mladic came every time.  And there was a red car
         21  escorting each of the tamic trucks.
         22       Q.   Witness N, I wasn't showing you the
         23  translation; I was showing you your statement given to
         24  the State Security Service of the Republic of
         25  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          2  I have no more questions.
          3            Witness N, thank you.
          4            THE WITNESS:  Thank you too.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          6  very much, Mr. Petrusic.
          7            Mr. Harmon, any additional questions,
          8  please?
          9            MR. HARMON:  Just a few, Mr. President.
         10                 Re-examined by Mr. Harmon:
         11       Q.   Witness N, you were asked by my colleague
         12  about the individual named Hamed Efendic, who was the
         13  president of the SDA political party in Srebrenica.
         14  Was Mr. Efendic an influential member of the Srebrenica
         15  Muslim community?
         16       A.   Until the war, he was.  When the war started,
         17  he had no authority; other people were in command of
         18  Srebrenica.
         19       Q.   I understand, but was he an esteemed and
         20  highly regarded member of the community even though he
         21  didn't have a political position?
         22       A.   Nothing in particular.  If he did have a
         23  political position, he didn't have any political
         24  influence.  He wasn't particularly held in high esteem.
         25       Q.   Ibran Mustafic, who was the former head of

          1  the Srebrenica municipality and was a deputy in the
          2  Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament, was he someone who was
          3  influential and esteemed within the Muslim community of
          4  Srebrenica?
          5       A.   He was until the war.  He was more esteemed.
          6  But when the war started, he meant nothing for
          7  Srebrenica either.
          8       Q.   Now, after the -- strike that.  While you
          9  were in the warehouse, you said that the Bosnian Serbs
         10  would come in and they would call out the names of
         11  individuals.  Is that correct?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Did you know all of the individuals whose
         14  names were being called?
         15       A.   I didn't know any one of them, any one of
         16  those men.
         17       Q.   Did it appear to you that, at least in part,
         18  when the Bosnian Serbs were calling out names, that
         19  they were selecting people who they were fully aware of
         20  and who they wanted to identify?
         21       A.   They called out the name of the village and
         22  they would say, "People from that village should get
         23  up."  Whether those people who got up knew one another,
         24  I don't know.  But before that, they would come and
         25  they would know one another, but I didn't know our men,

          1  nor the Serb soldiers.  I didn't know either.  They
          2  spoke to each other as if they were acquaintances:
          3  "Where are you?  Where have you been?  Where's your
          4  family?"  And then this man on our side would ask the
          5  soldier about his family, and that is how they spoke.
          6  But I didn't know anyone among the Serb soldiers or
          7  among the people -- the Bosniaks who were talking to
          8  them.
          9       Q.   Witness N, thank you very much.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         12  very much, Mr. Harmon.
         13            Judge Riad.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes, I have a couple of
         15  questions, Mr. President
         16                 Questioned by the Court:
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning, Witness N.
         18       A.   Good morning, Your Honour.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  I would like to understand
         20  perhaps globally the main features of your testimony;
         21  first, the phases of execution you mentioned.  I'm
         22  trying to follow you.  You said they would be calling
         23  on some important people, prominent people, they would
         24  go out, you would hear cries, they would not come
         25  back.  And you mentioned Hamed Efendic and Ibran
          1  Mustafic, or whatever.  These people, if I understood
          2  rightly, were privileged to have special treatment, to
          3  be tortured or anything, but they were selected.
          4            The second phase were people coming out in
          5  lines, blindfolded, and you were not among them yet.
          6  These people, if I understood rightly, were called upon
          7  from villages, asking each group to come, but not by
          8  names.  And if I understood rightly, they were executed
          9  immediately out, because you heard the fire while you
         10  were inside and they never came back.
         11            Then at 7.30 you --
         12       A.   Yes.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  -- were blindfolded and you went
         14  in a small truck.  I understand this was a third phase,
         15  people taken away to be executed.  And the truck would
         16  go back and bring other people, you mentioned.  They
         17  would be put on rows and so on.  Did I understand you
         18  rightly?  Was that exactly the evolution of the
         19  situation?
         20       A.   As the people were getting out of the gym,
         21  they were being blindfolded.  First they would give the
         22  person some water, and then afterwards he would be
         23  blindfolded and then we would get on a truck.  And this
         24  continued for a while until they finished.  And we were
         25  then taken, still blindfolded, to a field, a pasture,

          1  where we were then being lined up and executed.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  The bottom line is that
          3  everybody in the gym finished by going out, because you
          4  stated 7.30.
          5       A.   Yes, everybody.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Everybody, because you also
          7  mentioned that --
          8       A.   Some people remained in the gym after me, and
          9  people were still being brought in after me.  And at
         10  one point somebody said, "It's all over," when the last
         11  truck full of people came.  And then the man asked the
         12  soldier whether he wanted to go back with him, and he
         13  said he wouldn't, and he said that maybe there would be
         14  another truck coming back and that they would go back;
         15  if not, they would stay there and keep guard all night.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  I understood.  I just want to
         17  know the selection which happened at the beginning,
         18  which included prominent people, was just at the
         19  beginning, taking them out, and then you hear them
         20  suffering and shouting.  But after that there was no
         21  selection; everybody was taken out?
         22       A.   After that everybody was taken out.  There
         23  were people who wanted to go first because they were so
         24  thirsty.  They just wanted to get some water.  They
         25  didn't care whether they would be killed or not.  But

          1  they didn't let us do that.  There was supposed to be a
          2  line; only once you have reached the entrance you could
          3  get some water.  There was a small room there with a
          4  table in it where people were being given water, and at
          5  the same time two soldiers would be blindfolding the
          6  person.  And after that the person was taken to the TAM
          7  truck.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  I understood that.  So they were
          9  all taken.  But then you mentioned that when you looked
         10  at the field after the executions took place, you found
         11  more dead people than there were in the gym, so not
         12  only all the people in the gym were killed, but
         13  apparently other people came from other places.  Is
         14  that right?
         15       A.   No.  This is how it seemed because we were
         16  crowded in the gym while we were in the gym, and the
         17  group appeared to be larger once we were in the field,
         18  but it wasn't.  They were not bringing people from
         19  elsewhere.  But because people were so crammed in the
         20  gymnasium, it didn't seem that they were -- that there
         21  were that many.  But once they were lying dead on the
         22  field, the number seemed greater.  This is only how it
         23  seemed but they were not bringing other people.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  But it was all the people in the
         25  gym in your opinion?

          1       A.   Only the people from the gym, yes.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you said that in the gym
          3  there were some people that could hardly move.  You
          4  said they were over 60, but people over 60 can move.
          5  Were they also executed?
          6       A.   All of those who got out of the gym were
          7  killed, whether they were young or old.  As soon as
          8  they could get up and reach the truck, they were taken
          9  away.  And afterwards, they didn't have to walk.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  So you saw them being taken
         11  away, you saw them being taken away.  They were not
         12  spared; children or old people.
         13       A.   No, there were no children, and the elderly
         14  people were not spared.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you heard the soldiers at a
         16  certain stage introducing themselves to one another.
         17  Do you remember what they said, which divisions they
         18  belonged to?
         19       A.   No, they didn't.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Because I heard you saying that
         21  some of them were saying they belonged to the wolves
         22  and others say, "We belong to Arkanovac."
         23       A.   Well, yes, yes, I did say that.  That is how
         24  they addressed each other.  We didn't call them that
         25  way.  It was the way they were addressing each other.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  What did they say?
          2       A.   They would say, for example, "This one is an
          3  Arkanovac," and then the man would say, "Yes, I am."
          4  And he would ask him then, "Are you from the Drina
          5  Wolves or some other wolves," I don't know, and then he
          6  said, "Yes, I am, and I'm not ashamed of it."  This is
          7  how they were addressing each other, but I didn't know
          8  where they were from.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you remember some of the
         10  names?
         11       A.   No.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  But why did you mention Drina
         13  Wolves then?  Did they mention it?
         14       A.   Yes, amongst themselves.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Among themselves.  Did you
         16  notice any accent?  Were these an accent of Bosnia or
         17  Croatia or Serbia or you don't remember?
         18       A.   I don't remember.  All those accents were the
         19  same for me.  I am not very familiar with different
         20  accents.  I don't know where people come from.  All I
         21  can tell is that they are from the former Yugoslavia.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  I think you served before in the
         23  Bosnian army, you said, so you don't know the accents.
         24       A.   No.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  You were in the Bosnian army or

          1  in the Yugoslav army?
          2       A.   I served in the Yugoslav army, and during the
          3  war before the area became protected, I served with the
          4  Bosnian army.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, just for our knowledge, how
          6  long -- you said that you stayed without moving until
          7  all the soldiers went away.  How long did this last,
          8  staying without moving, do you remember?
          9       A.   No, I couldn't tell you exactly how long, but
         10  it was quite dark, so it must have been around 11.00
         11  p.m. but I cannot be precise.  And after that, I left.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         13       A.   Thank you too, Your Honour.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         15  very much, Judge Riad.
         16            Judge Wald.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Witness N, I would just like to
         18  clear one point in your answer to Judge Riad.
         19            I thought I heard you testify that when the
         20  soldiers were saying, "I am from the Arkan," or "I am
         21  Drina Wolves," that was in the Bratunac warehouse not
         22  in the gym at Zvornik; is that right?  That's -- when I
         23  read over my notes of your testimony yesterday --
         24       A.   In Bratunac.
         25            JUDGE WALD:  -- yes, I just wanted to clear

          1  that up, where that happened, okay.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  The second question I have is:
          4  You said that the soldiers at the execution site wore
          5  dark green camouflage uniforms.  And before that, you
          6  said that the soldiers around the gym guarding you or
          7  transporting you wore green camouflage uniforms.
          8            Was there a difference between those two
          9  kinds of uniforms of those that were performing the
         10  executions and those that were transporting or guarding
         11  you or were they the same kind of green camouflage
         12  uniforms?
         13       A.   There was only one man in the red vehicle
         14  which was following the TAM truck who was wearing a one
         15  colour grey uniform.  Everybody else wore multicoloured
         16  camouflage uniforms and this other man was wearing a
         17  grey uniform.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  But the ones that wore
         19  the green camouflage uniforms, it was the same kind of
         20  uniforms; the men doing the executing and the men
         21  guarding and transporting.  Okay.
         22            Now, when General Mladic came to the gym and
         23  said that the prisoners would be transported -- would
         24  be exchanged, how much time lapsed between then and the
         25  time that they brought in the blindfolds and began to

          1  take the men out blindfolded to the execution field?
          2            It was the same day, you testified, but how
          3  much time would you say between the time Mladic came
          4  and said you were going to go to a prisoner exchange in
          5  the gym, and then when they brought in the blindfolds
          6  and began to get people ready to go to the execution
          7  field?
          8       A.   When we were in the warehouse in Bratunac, he
          9  told us that we would be exchanged and that we should
         10  count ourselves, and that transport would be provided.
         11  But this is not where they brought the blindfolds, not
         12  in Bratunac.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  I understand that.  But you also
         14  testified, you also testified both today, and in your
         15  earlier statement that when you were in the gym, when
         16  you were in the gym in Zvornik, that Mladic came?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  So I'm asking you what was the
         19  time between that time when he came in the gym and
         20  talked about -- you said he talked about saying that
         21  you would be exchanged and the time they began to
         22  blindfold you and take you in the trucks to the
         23  execution field.  Was it an hour, two hours, or what?
         24       A.   In the gym, Mladic did not say that we would
         25  be exchanged.  He said that we would be sent to Kladusa

          1  and Bijeljina and it was only in Bratunac that he said
          2  that we would be exchanged.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  All right.  But the question
          4  remains:  How much time between whatever he said in the
          5  gym and the time when they began to take you out?
          6       A.   Two to three hours.
          7            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.  And my last
          8  question to you is:  At the execution site, you said
          9  that Mladic did come in a red car.  How long did he
         10  stay in your -- how long did you observe him to say at
         11  the execution site?  You testified today one time you
         12  saw him in the red car at the execution site.
         13       A.   He stayed until all men were taken off the
         14  TAM truck and until they were all executed.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  Well, roughly how much time did
         16  that take?
         17       A.   Well, there were 25 to 30 people that had to
         18  be taken off the TAM truck, and then they had to line
         19  them up and execute them.  I don't know how much time
         20  that would be.  You could perhaps judge for yourself.
         21            JUDGE WALD:  Well, I was not there; you
         22  were.  The -- would you say half an hour, an hour?
         23       A.   Well, not more than ten minutes.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  All right, thank you.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Pardon the interruption,

          1  Mr. President, but I was examining the transcript as
          2  Judge Wald was asking questions, and there was no
          3  answer recorded on the transcript to Judge Wald's
          4  question about whether the people who were wearing the
          5  green camouflage uniforms at the execution sites were
          6  wearing the same kind of green camouflage uniforms
          7  guarding and transporting the prisoners.
          8            To that question put by Judge Wald to Witness
          9  N, there was no answer recorded.
         10            JUDGE WALD:  Would you answer that question
         11  now then so we can have a complete record, whether or
         12  not the uniforms of the men performing the execution of
         13  the soldiers at the execution field were the same as
         14  those that were guarding you at the gym, same army
         15  camouflage uniforms.
         16            You're nodding your head; is that yes?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         20  very much, Judge Wald, and thank you, Mr. Harmon, for
         21  your intervention.
         22            Witness N, I also have a few questions for
         23  you.
         24            My first question is the following:  You
         25  arrive at the school, people get off the bus and you

          1  told us that at that point, they were mostly men.  Why
          2  do you say "mostly"?
          3       A.   Because there were no children or women with
          4  us.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [No interpretation]
          6       A.   Yes.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So there
          8  were only men.  My second question is a synthetical
          9  one.  How many times did you see Mladic?
         10       A.   Six times.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Six times.
         12  Could you then tell us where it was?
         13       A.   The first time I saw him was when I was
         14  separated and taken to an unfinished house.  The second
         15  time was when we were being put on the buses in
         16  Potocari, he was standing next to the buses.  The third
         17  time it was when he came to us and he told us that we
         18  would be exchanged in Kalesija.  The fourth time was
         19  when we were boarding the buses; again, he was standing
         20  right next to the buses.  The fifth time was when he
         21  came to the gym and when he told us that some of us
         22  would go to Kladusa and some of us would go to
         23  Bijeljina.  And the sixth time was at the meadow where
         24  we were executed.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,

          1  thank you.  You can still see Prosecutor's Exhibit 20/8
          2  on the monitor.
          3            Mr. Usher, maybe the monitor of the witness
          4  could be switched on.
          5            Witness, could you please have a look at the
          6  photograph.  The one that is on the screen.  And to
          7  tell us the following:  We know exactly where you were
          8  but what I would like to know is where exactly was
          9  General Mladic when you saw him?
         10       A.   He was here at this location [indicates].
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you say
         12  that he was right next to these yellow marks somewhere
         13  midway up the photograph.  You have already told us
         14  that that is exactly the spot where you were as well?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you were
         17  there at the point that you're indicating and where was
         18  Mladic?
         19       A.   Yes, I was lying like this.  My head was here
         20  [indicates] my legs facing the forest, and Mladic was
         21  standing to my right.  And the people who were
         22  unloading the TAM truck were here [indicates], and he
         23  was standing right next to the TAM truck.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well
         25  then.  Could you then tell us how far from you was

          1  General Mladic?
          2       A.   Not more than ten metres away from me.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good.
          4  Thank you very much.
          5            My next question for you is the following:  I
          6  think I have understood you correctly, but I would
          7  like, nevertheless, to have a confirmation.  When
          8  General Mladic arrived here at this location, he was
          9  able to see the results of the execution; is that
         10  correct?
         11       A.   Yes, yes.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         13  Then when he arrived, you told us that the buses were
         14  coming from the right side on the photograph and that a
         15  line was being formed.
         16       A.   You mean the truck?
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, the
         18  truck.  And then after the people, the truck had left,
         19  people would be lined up and executed.  So when General
         20  Mladic arrived here, could you tell us how many rows of
         21  people were there already?
         22       A.   I couldn't count, Your Honour.  I didn't
         23  count.  All I know is that there were quite a few of
         24  them.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But could

          1  you perhaps give us an estimate?  Do you have an idea
          2  as to the number of journeys that the truck made; how
          3  many times the truck arrived to this spot?
          4       A.   After I had been brought to the spot, you
          5  mean?  No, no, I cannot give you a definite answer.  I
          6  was in great fear.  I wasn't counting people.  I
          7  couldn't think about that.  All I know is that it was
          8  on several occasions, maybe even as many as ten times
          9  that they brought people in, but I cannot tell you
         10  exactly.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good.  But
         12  maybe you will be able to answer the following
         13  question:  When you arrived at the execution site, had
         14  there already been corpses there?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         17  Thank you very much, Witness N.  I don't have any other
         18  questions for you.
         19            You have been asked a number of questions by
         20  both parties and by the Judges, and you have answered
         21  all of those questions.  Is there anything else that
         22  you would like to say?  Anything that has not been
         23  brought up, something you haven't had the opportunity
         24  to say?  If you wish to say something, you can do it
         25  now.

          1       A.   Your Honour, I don't have anything else to
          2  say.  I have said everything I wanted to say.  Thank
          3  you.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          5  Witness N, thank you very much.  There is a technical
          6  matter that we have to attend to and after that you
          7  will be free to go.
          8            Mr. Petrusic, I believe that we have one
          9  Defence exhibit, D-17.
         10            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]  Yes, Your
         11  Honour.  The Defence would like to tender D-17 into
         12  evidence.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Subject to a number of
         15  redactions which identify this witness by name and by
         16  other features, we would have no objection.  I have
         17  gone through this in the examination.  I can give a
         18  copy to the registrar of the redactions that are
         19  necessary.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] The exhibit
         21  D-17 there will therefore be admitted into evidence
         22  under seal and there will also be a redacted version
         23  which will be made available to the public.
         24            Mr. Dubuisson, will you take care of that?
         25  Very well, thank you.

          1            Witness N, you have completed your testimony
          2  here before the International Tribunal.  Thank you very
          3  much for coming to testify, and we are so glad you
          4  survived the execution and we hope that you will have a
          5  happy life after this.  At least in order to -- to be
          6  able to tell the world that the things that happened
          7  independently of those who had committed them are
          8  condemnable, are horrible, must not happen again.
          9  Thank you very much, once again.  Please do not move.
         10            Let us see what's happening with our next
         11  witness, Mr. Harmon.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, we have another
         13  witness.  He will be a protected witness, and if we
         14  could take perhaps ten additional minutes during the
         15  break for reasons that are required, we would
         16  appreciate it.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] What kind
         18  of protective measures will be applied, Mr. Harmon?
         19            MR. HARMON:  The same.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] The same.
         21  Mr. Petrusic.
         22            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]  We agree to
         23  that, Your Honour.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Sorry,
         25  Mr. Harmon, you asked for an additional ten minutes.  I

          1  was actually going to have a break.  The break was
          2  supposed to be 15 minutes.  Do you need any additional
          3  time?
          4            MR. HARMON:  We need an additional ten
          5  minutes, Mr. President.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Twenty-five
          7  minutes.  So just for the public, there will be a
          8  25-minute break now and after that we will resume with
          9  the same protective measures for our next witness.
         10  Twenty-five minute break.
         11                 --- Recess taken at 10.58 a.m.
         12                 --- On resuming at 11.28 a.m.
         13                 [The witness entered court]
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         15  morning, Witness.  Can you hear me?
         16            THE WITNESS:  Yes.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You're
         18  going to read the solemn declaration that the usher is
         19  going to hand to you, please.
         20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
         21  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
         22  and nothing but the truth.
         23                 WITNESS:  WITNESS O
         24                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
          1  seated, Witness.  The registrar is going to show you
          2  your name, written on a piece of paper.  You're going
          3  to read that name and say only yes or no whether that
          4  is your name.
          5            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, it is my
          6  name.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          8  Are you comfortable?
          9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, thank
         10  you.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Are you
         12  being treated well here?
         13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, very well,
         14  thank you.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So we shall
         16  continue to do so.  Now, Witness O, you are going to
         17  answer questions which Mr. Cayley is going to put to
         18  you.
         19            Mr. Cayley, you have the floor.
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes.  Good morning,
         21  Mr. President, Your Honours, counsel.  Thank you.
         22                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:
         23       Q.   Now, Witness, I know you're feeling very
         24  nervous at the moment.  Relax as best you can.  Let me
         25  let you into a little secret.  Whenever I stand up in

          1  this courtroom, I feel exactly the same way; the only
          2  difference is that I've learned to hide it over the
          3  years.  This may be the only opportunity that you get
          4  to tell this account.  Don't worry if you can't
          5  remember things.  I'll remind you.  Just relax, speak
          6  slowly, and tell the Judges what happened to you.
          7       A.   I will.  All right.
          8       Q.   Now, you're Bosnian by nationality; is that
          9  right?
         10       A.   Yes, I am.
         11       Q.   And I think you're Muslim by faith; is that
         12  right?
         13       A.   Yes, I am.
         14       Q.   And I think in 1992 the Serbs overran the
         15  town of Nova Kasaba and you and your family had to
         16  move; is that right?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   And that's where you were living with your
         19  family in 1992, in Nova Kasaba?
         20       A.   Yes.
         21       Q.   I think you and your family lived in a number
         22  of places, and then in July of 1995 you found yourself
         23  in the village of Slapovici?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   And I think you were going to school in the

          1  town of Srebrenica; is that right?
          2       A.   Yes, that is right; I did.
          3       Q.   In July of 1995 I think you had just turned
          4  your 17th birthday; is that right?
          5       A.   Yes, on the 15th of April.
          6       Q.   Now, I want you to think back to July of
          7  1995, and specifically to the 11th of July, the 11th of
          8  that month.  Do you recall that on that day the Bosnian
          9  Serb army overran the Srebrenica enclave?
         10       A.   Yes, I remember.
         11       Q.   And I think on that day you and your father
         12  decided to go to the woods with the other able-bodied
         13  men from Srebrenica; is that right?
         14       A.   Yes.  We decided like many others.  I don't
         15  know whether I was able-bodied, but I decided to go
         16  there, because if I had gone to the UN Compound, I
         17  don't know whether I would have been saved.
         18       Q.   So the reason that you went to the woods is
         19  because you feared for your life; is that right?
         20       A.   Yes, that is right.
         21       Q.   Now, in the village of Jaglici, where the
         22  column formed to go through the woods, can you tell the
         23  Judges about the degree of organisation of that column,
         24  as you remember it now?
         25       A.   The degree of organisation was almost

          1  nonexistent.  The BH army -- I don't know whether I can
          2  call it an army, because many were unarmed -- they were
          3  preparing for a breakthrough to form a column and then
          4  civilians followed them.  But it was chaotic, so that
          5  it was only in the morning of the 12th of July, or
          6  rather at 11.00, that I left Jaglici in the group of
          7  the last one or two thousand people.
          8       Q.   Was your father in the Bosnian army at the
          9  time?
         10       A.   Yes, he was a member, but he didn't have a
         11  uniform, he didn't have a rifle.  I don't know whether
         12  I could call him a soldier.  He was just formerly a
         13  member of the BH army.
         14       Q.   Now, I know you've told me that the column
         15  moved through the forests on the 12th of July of 1995,
         16  and I'm not going to ask you questions about that,
         17  although the Defence and the Judges may have some
         18  questions for you.  I want you to think about the 13th
         19  of July of 1995, in the afternoon, when you and some
         20  others gave yourselves up to the Bosnian Serb soldiers
         21  on the road between Bratunac and Konjevic Polje.  Can
         22  you tell the Judges how you gave yourselves up to the
         23  Bosnian Serb soldiers?
         24       A.   On the 13th of July, after heavy shelling
         25  throughout the night, many people were killed.  There

          1  was general confusion.  We didn't know where to go.
          2  There was a big forest, and about 10.00 a loudspeaker
          3  was heard.  Probably, I assume, they were Bosnian Serb
          4  soldiers, saying that we should surrender, otherwise we
          5  would all be killed and the shelling would continue,
          6  and that we would be treated in accordance with all the
          7  Geneva Conventions, they said.
          8            We stayed in the woods until 3.00.  They
          9  repeated the message I don't know how many times over
         10  the loudspeaker, but around 3.00 a sort of column was
         11  formed which went down.  They weren't people with
         12  weapons.  Some people may have had weapons, but as far
         13  as I could see, there was general chaos.  There were
         14  many who were wounded, perhaps more than those who were
         15  not.  And we came out at the village of Kamenica, where
         16  we could hear tanks and APCs moving around the road.
         17  But I didn't see them until we got closer.  This was a
         18  long column.  I didn't see people surrendering.  I
         19  couldn't see the end of the column.  We were carrying
         20  the wounded.  And I didn't yet know that we were
         21  surrendering.  I knew we were going somewhere; I didn't
         22  know where.
         23            When we got closer, I saw that there were
         24  tanks and some other weapons on wheels.  I don't know
         25  what kind.  The column was continuous, and then I

          1  realised that we had surrendered.
          2            When I got close to the bridge, there were
          3  five or six, or maybe four or seven -- I don't know --
          4  soldiers, roughly, there, and they said -- the column
          5  was moving and they were talking, and they were saying,
          6  "Come on."  I had a bag.  One of the soldiers asked
          7  me, "What do you have in your bag?  Do you have any
          8  weapons or German marks or something?"  I said I
          9  didn't.  They told us to put our bags aside, our
         10  weapons, to lay down our weapons and any sharp
         11  objects.  But I didn't see anyone with weapons.  I
         12  think no one had weapons.  And they told us that
         13  everything would be returned to us.
         14            Rows were formed on one side of the road,
         15  along the stream, close to the bridge.  There were five
         16  rows of roughly 100 meters each.  I can't tell you
         17  exactly.  It might have been 90, 100, 110.  The wounded
         18  were there too, and there may have been more of them
         19  than us.
         20       Q.   You mentioned in your testimony that there
         21  were five or six soldiers who were around and about the
         22  Muslim men who had come to the road.  Do you recall now
         23  how those soldiers were dressed?
         24       A.   They had uniforms on, camouflage uniforms.  I
         25  don't know whether they had -- all wore one-piece

          1  uniforms, but they were camouflage.  That's as much as
          2  I can say.
          3       Q.   Was it blue camouflage or green/brown
          4  camouflage?  Do you recall now?
          5       A.   It was more olive-green or brown.  It wasn't
          6  blue.
          7       Q.   Now, after these columns were formed on the
          8  road when you gave to the Judges an estimate of the
          9  size, what happened to you all next?
         10       A.   When all the men had come out -- and there
         11  was no interruption.  There was a column constantly
         12  coming out.  And while they were coming out, the
         13  Bosnian Serb soldiers were, in quotation marks, "good,
         14  decent."  They didn't curse anyone, they didn't
         15  mistreat anyone.  Because otherwise someone might have
         16  escaped.
         17            While I was standing in a line, we had to
         18  raise our arms as soon as we left our bags.  Very close
         19  to me there was a tank, and one or two weapons on
         20  wheels with some sort of machine-guns or something; I
         21  don't know exactly.  And on the tank, in white letters,
         22  the words "queen of death" was written.  I think it was
         23  in Cyrillic, but I can't be a hundred per cent sure.
         24  And next to the river -- again I can't tell you the
         25  exact number of soldiers; ten, maybe fewer, who had

          1  their guns pointed at us.  There were soldiers walking
          2  past us, asking for money, and when everyone handed
          3  everything over, they cursed our balija mothers,
          4  "Balija son, we'll show you," and things like that.
          5            Almost everyone, each one of them, made these
          6  demands.  I remember one in particular who had a
          7  machine-gun and an ammunition belt which was almost
          8  down to the ground.  And then two passenger cars
          9  appeared.  I think they were a Golf, Golfs.  One was a
         10  police car and one was a metallic grey.  Soldiers were
         11  sitting on the roofs and inside.  There were a number
         12  of them -- I don't know -- five, six, or ten.
         13            They got out.  Some of them had camouflage
         14  but police uniforms, so they were camouflage blue.  And
         15  others were like the others, in army uniforms, that is,
         16  olive-green or brownish camouflage.
         17            Some of them may have also asked for things.
         18  I didn't see them beat anyone.  They may have, they may
         19  have not.
         20            In the meantime, I saw buses which had come
         21  up to those lines in the direction of the road
         22  Bratunac-Konjevic Polje, but they probably couldn't
         23  pass because of us.  I don't know the exact number of
         24  buses there were and trucks, because there was a curve
         25  in the road, so we couldn't see them all.  And then we

          1  were ordered to run along the road towards Bratunac.
          2  We didn't know where we were going at the time.
          3            And so we ran and we carried the wounded as
          4  we ran.  We took turns, with our hands up.  And when I
          5  reached the bus, I saw that there were women and
          6  children inside from Potocari, from the UN Compound.  I
          7  recognised them by their clothing and I recognised a
          8  schoolmate of mine in the bus, in the window.
          9            So as we ran, we had to lift three fingers,
         10  and the soldiers were running alongside, with rifles.
         11  And I think the drivers in the bus and the trucks were
         12  armed with weapons, but I'm not sure of that.  I can't
         13  say for sure.  I thought they were.
         14            So we had to show the sign of three fingers
         15  so that -- as we passed the trucks, so that the women
         16  and children would see us.  And so we ran for about one
         17  kilometer.  We passed those buses and trucks.  As I
         18  said, I don't know how many there were.  Maybe ten,
         19  maybe fewer.  I don't know.  And we reached a spot
         20  where we turned left.
         21            Behind me a Bosnian Serb soldier asked the
         22  man behind me -- I couldn't see who he was.  I don't
         23  know what he looks like.  Whether he was young or old,
         24  I don't know.  He asked him, "Which unit were you in in
         25  Srebrenica?"  He was probably referring to the army.

          1  The man said, "I was in an infantry unit."  I don't
          2  know why he said that.  It sounds ironic.  An execution
          3  unit, actually.
          4            Then the blows started.  I don't know whether
          5  he stayed there or continued running.  I don't know.
          6  As we turned to the left, I saw a dead man.  He wasn't
          7  run over, because the cars were only using one lane,
          8  but he must have been killed much earlier, because
          9  there were flies all over him and worms.  He seemed to
         10  me to be like an older man, but I can't say for sure.
         11            Then we turned left, running all the time.
         12  We were carrying the wounded, I, among others.  We took
         13  turns.  I don't know whether we, all of us, left the
         14  place where we had stood, where we had surrendered.
         15  And the place where we turned was on a meadow above the
         16  Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.  The grass was quite
         17  high, but it had been stamped on as if people had been
         18  there before.  I just remember that, that it wasn't
         19  standing up, the grass.
         20       Q.   Witness, if you could wait there one moment.
         21            MR. CAYLEY:  And if the witness could be
         22  shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 1/E/1 which is a small map.
         23       Q.   Witness, you said that you saw a number of
         24  buses travelling on the road full of women and
         25  children.  In which direction were those buses

          1  travelling; can you recall now?
          2       A.   Yes.  They were going along the
          3  Bratunac-Konjevic Polje.  That was the direction.
          4  Bratunac to Konjevic Polje direction, I think that's
          5  what I said.
          6       Q.   Witness, you said that the Bosnian Serb
          7  soldiers made you essentially put your fingers up in
          8  a -- three fingers you had to raise above your head.
          9  Do you know what the significance of that
         10  three-fingered salute was?
         11       A.   I don't really know how to explain.  It's a
         12  sign of theirs.  I can't say.
         13       Q.   If you can look at the map next to you, and
         14  if you could first of all indicate to the Judges -- in
         15  fact if the map could be moved up, please.
         16            If you could indicate approximately where you
         17  came down, where you surrendered to the Serbs.  That's
         18  the first point I'd like you to indicate, just
         19  approximately.
         20       A.   Somewhere here [indicates] near Sandici.  And
         21  then we ran up to Sandici.  I don't know whether we
         22  actually reached Sandici.
         23       Q.   If you could wait there, Witness.  I just
         24  need to read into the record the point that you're
         25  making on the map.  If you could indicate again where

          1  you came down from the forest.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  The witness is indicating on
          3  this exhibit a point approximately halfway between
          4  Sandici and where the road intersects with the Nova
          5  Kasaba-Konjevic Polje road and that is on the
          6  Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.
          7       A.   No, no, not really halfway.  It was up to a
          8  point maybe one kilometre away from Sandici, so not
          9  quite halfway.
         10       Q.   Thank you for correcting me and making the
         11  record more accurate.
         12            Can you indicate to the Judges where the
         13  meadow was as best you can recollect?
         14       A.   I can't show you on the map.  It was in
         15  Sandici somewhere.  There are five or ten houses there,
         16  it's not a proper settlement.  I just know there were
         17  about two or three or maybe five, six houses around me,
         18  I can't tell you exactly.  There was a house on the
         19  lower side of the road.  I saw that later while I was
         20  sat -- while I sat there.  While we were running I
         21  didn't see it, I saw it later.
         22       Q.   So if you were facing Bratunac, the meadow
         23  was on the left-hand side of the road and it was very
         24  close to the settlement of Sandici?
         25       A.   Yes, yes.  On the left-hand side of the road.

          1       Q.   Now, you said that when you arrived in the
          2  meadow, the grass was high but that you could see that
          3  the grass had been flattened.  What did you think at
          4  the time when you saw that the grass had been
          5  flattened?
          6       A.   I thought that perhaps some other people had
          7  been there, maybe a group prior to ours.  That is what
          8  occurred to me.  It wasn't flattened as if trucks had
          9  passed there, but rather as if people had played ball
         10  there.
         11       Q.   Now, Witness, if you could remember while we
         12  are proceeding to try and speak slowly.  I know you do
         13  naturally speak very quickly, but there are
         14  interpreters in between us, and it makes their task
         15  much easier if you and I both speak slowly.
         16       A.   I'm sorry.  I'll slow down.  Sometimes I sort
         17  of get excited, and then I speed up a little.
         18       Q.   You're being very clear.  You're being very
         19  clear, but just if you could speak more slowly that
         20  would be helpful.
         21       A.   I'll do that.
         22       Q.   Now, you went into this meadow.  Can you
         23  remember how many of you there were in the meadow,
         24  approximately?
         25       A.   I can't give you an exact number of people in

          1  the meadow, but where we were standing at the road,
          2  according to my assessment, there was between 1.000 and
          3  2.000.  It was -- I'm sure it was more than 1.000, but
          4  I can't tell you the exact number but there certainly
          5  were very many.  We were right next to one another.
          6       Q.   Now, after you all gathered in the meadow,
          7  what happened to you next?
          8       A.   Soldiers surrounded us, soldiers of the
          9  Bosnian Serbs.  Actually, people first sat down.  I was
         10  somewhere in the middle further to the back, actually.
         11  And here again, there were a large number of people,
         12  but I can't tell you how many.  And I don't know
         13  whether all of us had come in one group from the place
         14  where we were before, where we -- when we ran.
         15            There was a tank in front of us again.  I saw
         16  it when I was sitting.  I don't remember whether it was
         17  there when we ran up.  In front were the wounded.  And
         18  one of the Bosnian Serb soldiers started saying
         19  something.  I didn't register everything because I
         20  wasn't interested.  But something to the effect, "We
         21  are from Serbia."
         22            Actually, he first asked whether there was
         23  anyone who needed bandaging and he bandaged our
         24  wounded; or rather, I'm sorry, whether there was anyone
         25  who could bandage the wounded.  And then a man offered

          1  to do that.  Then he searched him with a pistol in his
          2  hand.  He searched the man.
          3            This soldier had a black bandanna on his head
          4  or a scarf tied at the nape of his neck.  He was a very
          5  heavily-built man, well-built man.  I think he wore a
          6  camouflage uniform as well.  I'm not sure whether it
          7  was in one piece or trousers separate, I can't tell.  I
          8  think he was fair.  I came to that conclusion on the
          9  basis of his beard.  He didn't have a beard but he had
         10  a growth of hair as if he hadn't shaven.
         11            And later he said, "You see what happened to
         12  your comrades.  If you had surrendered, you wouldn't
         13  have had so many wounded."  I can't quote him exactly,
         14  but I'm paraphrasing.
         15            Later he said, "Other soldiers will come
         16  now.  They won't hurt you."  When he said that, he
         17  probably meant another unit.  I don't know.  I can't
         18  tell.  But they were the same soldiers -- not the same,
         19  but they wore the same uniforms.
         20       Q.   Now, Witness, we're still on the 13th of July
         21  of 1995.  Do you remember approximately what time the
         22  events that you're talking about now took place?
         23       A.   Which event do you mean?
         24       Q.   I'm talking about now the Serb soldier
         25  addressing the crowd, the Serb soldier who asked the

          1  man if he could attend to the wounded.  Do you remember
          2  what time of the day that was?
          3       A.   Yes, this was in the afternoon, perhaps 4.00,
          4  5.00 or 6.00 in the afternoon.  I don't know exactly.
          5  I didn't have a watch, and I don't know.  Roughly that
          6  time of day it was.
          7       Q.   Now, the Serb -- the Bosnian Serb soldier who
          8  asked if there was anybody who could attend to the
          9  wounded; do you recall that testimony?  The man who
         10  assisted the wounded was a member of the Muslim men
         11  assembled on the meadow.
         12       A.   He was probably a Muslim, I don't know what
         13  he was, but he volunteered himself.
         14       Q.   Did the Bosnian Serb soldier who had the
         15  bandanna on his head explain to you all what was going
         16  to happen to all of you on the meadow?
         17       A.   Yes.  He said that we would be transferred to
         18  a hangar or rather to hangars in Bratunac where we
         19  would spend the night.  And the next day, we would be
         20  with our families, we would be exchanged and handed
         21  over, probably.
         22       Q.   Now, prior to you actually being transported
         23  to Bratunac.  Can you explain to the Judges what you
         24  remember of the rest of your time that you spent in the
         25  meadow?

          1       A.   Yes, I can.  Somebody said or maybe it was
          2  him that we would not be given any dinner, which was
          3  rather ironical.
          4            After that when other soldiers arrived, we
          5  were ordered or maybe somebody said something, I don't
          6  know whether it was the same soldier or somebody else,
          7  we were told to lie down on our stomachs and to put our
          8  hands behind our necks and to start clapping.  And our
          9  faces were buried in the grass, so we couldn't see
         10  anything.
         11            And this is how we started clapping our
         12  hands.  I couldn't see everyone, but I assumed that
         13  everybody did the same.  And they told us to say, "Long
         14  live the king.  Long live Serbia."
         15            In the meantime, while we were lying on the
         16  meadow in the grass, I don't know whether we were
         17  clapping our hands all the time or not, shooting could
         18  be heard.  I don't know what was happening, but after
         19  we had been told to get up and to have a rest, at that
         20  time it was getting dark.  The visibility was still
         21  good, but it might have been half past seven or 8.00 in
         22  the evening.
         23            At that point, I could see a man shooting
         24  from a window of a house.  He was most probably one of
         25  the Bosnian Serb soldiers.  He had taken his rifle and

          1  opened fire.  I think that he was killing people, but I
          2  didn't see anybody wounded after that.
          3            My uncle who was with me told me that one man
          4  who was sitting in front of us was missing.  And
          5  there's something else that I forgot to tell you.  It
          6  looked as if someone was walking on our backs.  At one
          7  point I felt somebody step on my leg.
          8            Before we laid down, I saw that there were
          9  some soldiers sitting at the balcony of the house below
         10  the road.  I couldn't tell you the number of them, but
         11  I know that they were there sitting on the balcony.
         12            We saw trucks after we had got up going in
         13  the direction of Bratunac, maybe five or six of them;
         14  again, I cannot be more precise.  But I remember the
         15  letters "Tuzla Transport" that were written on one of
         16  the trucks on a canvas of a truck.  It probably
         17  referred to the name of a company.
         18            And people ran up to the trucks.  Those were
         19  very large trucks.  I cannot tell you how big they
         20  were, but they were probably the largest trucks I had
         21  ever seen.  All I know was that there were a number, a
         22  great number of people on those trucks.  And I boarded
         23  one of -- I boarded the last truck.
         24       Q.   Now, Witness, you've said in your testimony
         25  that people ran up to the trucks.  You mean that the

          1  people in the meadow, the Muslim men in the meadow
          2  which included yourself got onto those trucks?
          3       A.   Yes, yes.  That's what I mean.  I was on the
          4  last truck and the trucks were covered with canvas.
          5  And we would step into the back part of the truck, the
          6  rear part of the truck, which was open because the
          7  canvas was up at the back of the truck.
          8            I don't know how I managed to get in.  I just
          9  remember grabbing, taking hold of the back part of the
         10  truck, but I kept falling off and the men helped me
         11  in.  I don't know finally how I managed to get in.  All
         12  I know was that the truck was completely full.
         13            And somebody said that there was no more room
         14  for anybody else but they kept pushing people into the
         15  trucks so they were completely crowded and people were
         16  standing next to one another.
         17            According to my estimate, there was between
         18  100 and 200 people on a truck, I cannot tell you the
         19  exact number, but this is my estimate.  I don't know
         20  whether all of the trucks -- actually, I don't know
         21  whether all of the people had boarded those trucks.
         22            We were told not to try to jump out of the
         23  truck and that we would be followed by a Golf.  I think
         24  it was the police Golf that had arrived previously to
         25  the place where we were.

          1       Q.   Witness, first of all, who told you to get
          2  onto the trucks?
          3       A.   Somebody told us.  I don't know exactly who
          4  it was.  It may have been the same soldier I referred
          5  to.  He may have been there.  Maybe it was him who
          6  spoke, but I wasn't paying any attention.  Maybe it was
          7  him or somebody else.  We were told to do so, and I ran
          8  together with other people with my head bent down, and
          9  I wasn't interested, very much, in what was going on.
         10       Q.   Who told you not to try and escape, not to
         11  try and jump out of the trucks?
         12       A.   Somebody did.  I don't know who it was.
         13       Q.   Now, after the trucks were filled to
         14  capacity, what happened to you next?
         15       A.   The trucks set off in the direction of
         16  Bratunac.  They were driving at a rather high speed.
         17  We were uncomfortable, people kept falling on one
         18  another.  It was chaos.  The rear part of the truck was
         19  open.  The canvas was up, but not the sides of the
         20  truck as it had been when we started.
         21            When we came to Bratunac, at least I assumed
         22  that it was when we arrived in Bratunac because I saw
         23  lights coming from the apartments, so I presume it was
         24  Bratunac, the truck stopped somewhere in the town.
         25            People were asking for water, shouting,

          1  calling out, "Give us some water."  And we were sort of
          2  lying, leaning next to each other and my body was going
          3  numb.  I couldn't feel anything anymore.
          4            When people would ask for water, somebody,
          5  probably one of the soldiers, but it was dark and I
          6  couldn't see, would hit -- would bang on the truck from
          7  the outside, probably with a rifle butt saying, "What
          8  do you want balijas?"  And then they would curse our
          9  balija mother, and I don't know what else.  I didn't
         10  observe everything.
         11            We spent the night on the truck.  I think I
         12  fell asleep at one point.  I cannot remember it now,
         13  whether I actually slept.  I know that people were
         14  pushing one another, that it was very crowded.
         15            And then in the morning, the trucks continued
         16  through the town.  So as I told you, I was on the last
         17  truck and I could see people watching from their flats,
         18  and one could see it from the back side.
         19       Q.   Witness, you said that morning had come.  Can
         20  you tell the Judges, if you remember what date this
         21  was?  You explained to them that you were captured by
         22  the Serbs on the 13th, you got on the trucks on the
         23  13th of July.  This would be the 14th of July  of 1995,
         24  would it?
         25       A.   Yes, it was on the 14th of July around 7.00

          1  in the morning.  The trucks left, I don't know in which
          2  direction, but some of the people who were on the truck
          3  said that they had seen an UNPROFOR personnel carrier.
          4  They said that somebody had passed by, but I didn't see
          5  anything.
          6            They probably talked about the possibility of
          7  them saving us or something to that effect.  The trucks
          8  came to a halt somewhere outside Bratunac, not far from
          9  the town.  But I don't know how long we had been
         10  travelling, but it was in the outskirts of the town.
         11  And we stayed there for a while.
         12            While we were passing through the town, I
         13  could see that there were about five or six trucks, or
         14  maybe it was at one of the turning points that I
         15  managed to see that, but I don't remember that very
         16  clearly.
         17            So when the trucks came to a halt outside
         18  Bratunac, I don't remember exactly, but they may have
         19  said that we would be there until 10.00, that we would
         20  stay there until 10.00.  And maybe this is what
         21  happened.  Maybe we stayed until 10.00 or maybe 11.00.
         22  I don't know.
         23            Again people were asking for water.  I was
         24  asking for water too.  I was thirsty as well.  And I
         25  think that somebody brought some water.  I don't know

          1  who it was.  Maybe a soldier or somebody else.  He
          2  brought a five-litre jerrycan with water, or a bottle
          3  of water.  I don't know exactly what kind of container
          4  it was, but it was water.  And somebody, a man from the
          5  truck, stood up and he would pour a drop or two of
          6  water into everybody's mouth.  I did the same.  I stood
          7  up and opened my mouth to get this drop of water.
          8            At one point I stood up.  I don't know why I
          9  did so, but there was a bus full of people behind the
         10  truck.  I don't know whether the bus was carrying women
         11  or children or some other people, but I know that it
         12  was full of people.  It was completely crowded.  I
         13  don't know why I stood up at that point, but I looked
         14  outside and the driver from the bus motioned to me with
         15  his hand to sit down.  He seemed very angry and he had
         16  a rifle next to him.  I think it was -- the rifle was
         17  placed against the windshield.  I don't know what kind
         18  of rifle it was, but it was a rifle, and I understood
         19  him to mean that I would be killed if I stand up, that
         20  I should not look out.
         21            We were in an inhabited area and I managed to
         22  see, perhaps through the canvas, that there were people
         23  around in the area, that there were children riding
         24  bicycles, that there were women.  And after the truck
         25  had continued its journey, we were told that the back

          1  part of the canvas would be pulled down for our
          2  safety.  And that's what they did.
          3            At that moment I was next to the side of the
          4  truck, and there must have been a hole in the canvas,
          5  so I was able to see where we were going.  I was able
          6  to take a peek from time to time and see where we were
          7  going.  And I could also breathe, thanks to that,
          8  because the atmosphere in the truck was terrible.  It
          9  was unbearable.  It was so hot that there was no oxygen
         10  left.
         11            I remember that the truck was going in the
         12  direction of Konjevic Polje.  This is actually what I
         13  saw, what I realised later on.  And the bus carrying
         14  people must have hit something.  All I could see was
         15  that the front part of the bus, of the bus window, was
         16  broken.  I don't know whether all of them continued
         17  their journey.  I don't know exactly what happened and
         18  why it happened.
         19            So we passed through Konjevic Polje.  I'm
         20  familiar with the area, so I was able to recognise it.
         21  And the truck turned off towards -- turned right, in
         22  the direction of Zvornik.  It travelled through
         23  Drinjaca, through Zvornik, and I saw some people
         24  swimming under the bridge in the Drina River.  There
         25  were people passing by the truck, walking down the

          1  street.  Some of them would curse our balija mothers.
          2  I couldn't see them.  I didn't know what they looked
          3  like, but I would hear them from time to time or see
          4  them when I would be out.
          5            So we passed through Zvornik and reached
          6  Karakaj.  I know that there was a road that went on
          7  towards Bijeljina and Tuzla, and I assumed, and people
          8  talked among themselves, that we would probably be
          9  taken to a camp in Bijeljina or in Batkovic.  Because
         10  if they had wanted to kill people, they wouldn't have
         11  transported them.  This was our assumption and this is
         12  what people were thinking at the time.  It seemed
         13  logical.
         14            But at one point the truck turned towards
         15  Tuzla probably, and people were saying -- people were
         16  talking, and they became "happy" and "excited," in
         17  quotation marks, because they thought that we were
         18  going to Tuzla, that we would be exchanged or
         19  released.  However, at one point the truck slowed down
         20  and it turned right, and I don't know where we were.
         21  It came to a halt at some location.  I wasn't watching
         22  at that point.  I was trying to get some air because it
         23  was so stifling.  We were very thirsty.  Many people
         24  fainted.  Someone may even have died.  I couldn't tell
         25  you anything about that.

          1            But after approximately one hour they opened
          2  the rear side of the truck --
          3       Q.   Witness, if you could just pause there for a
          4  moment.  Now, you explained to the Judges that on the
          5  14th of July the truck eventually left Bratunac and
          6  went north towards Zvornik and Karakaj.  Do you
          7  remember approximately what time the bus left the
          8  outskirts of Bratunac?
          9       A.   I think I have already said.  It was about
         10  10.00 or 11.00, after having been stationed for about
         11  two hours or three hours.
         12       Q.   Can you show the Judges on the map in front
         13  of you the route that you believe you took between
         14  Bratunac and the place, the location that you
         15  eventually ended up in?  And I know towards the end of
         16  your journey you were not aware of where you were.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:  If the map could be moved up.
         18       A.   Could you please spread it open for me?
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  If the map could be moved up.
         20       A.   From Bratunac I believe -- I can show you --
         21  I cannot show you the portion of the road after
         22  Zvornik, because Zvornik is not on the map.  So I think
         23  that we took this road from Bratunac [indicates], and
         24  after Sandici -- I'm sure that we went along this
         25  road.  And this one here, this is where we turned right

          1  [indicates], and then continued up to the Drinjaca
          2  River.  The truck crossed the bridge and continued
          3  along the Drina River, passed through Zvornik, and then
          4  in Karakaj it turned -- I don't know what road it was,
          5  but I think that it was in the direction of Tuzla, most
          6  probably here [indicates], and this is where we turned
          7  again, at this spot [indicates].
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          9  witness indicated that after Karakaj the bus turned
         10  left, and he believes stopped at a location called
         11  Petkovci.
         12       A.   Just a moment, please.  I told you I knew the
         13  road up to Karakaj, and I think that we went along this
         14  road from Karakaj and that we turned right at one point
         15  and we passed by a structure, a building.  I don't know
         16  which building it was.  This is what I can indicate
         17  here.
         18       Q.   Now, after you -- after the truck stopped,
         19  and I know at this point you weren't exactly sure where
         20  you were, because you didn't know the area, how long
         21  did you remain on the truck?
         22       A.   I think that we remained there for about one
         23  hour.  I think it was in the afternoon.  People were
         24  crying out, shouting.  They wanted to get out, get off
         25  the truck.  "Let us outside.  We're thirsty."  They

          1  were saying all kinds of things, but I cannot remember
          2  now.  It was horrible.  People even drank their own
          3  urine from their genitals.
          4            When they opened the truck, there were two or
          5  three soldiers there, probably Bosnian Serb soldiers.
          6  They told us to get out.  One of the soldiers told us
          7  to get out.  And then somebody said, "See, balijas,
          8  we're driving you around, and you, you wouldn't even
          9  give us a lift."
         10       Q.   Witness, what time, approximately, was it
         11  that you got off the truck?
         12       A.   It was in the afternoon hours.  I don't know
         13  exactly what time it was.  Maybe 3.00 or 4.00 in the
         14  afternoon.
         15       Q.   Do you recall how the Bosnian Serb soldiers
         16  were dressed that you saw at the location where you got
         17  off the truck?
         18       A.   They were dressed in the same or similar
         19  uniforms.  They were camouflage uniforms, brown, olive,
         20  drab, green in colour.
         21            MR. CAYLEY:  If we could have Prosecutor's
         22  Exhibit 21/4, please.
         23       Q.   While we're waiting for that exhibit,
         24  Witness, can you explain to the Judges what happened to
         25  you after you got off the truck?

          1       A.   As we were getting off the truck people had
          2  to step on each other.  I saw a relative of mine, an
          3  acquaintance, on whom people had to step.  I don't know
          4  whether he was still conscious, but people were walking
          5  on top of him, because he couldn't stand up.  But later
          6  on I saw him in the classroom.  He was there.  I don't
          7  know whether it was really a classroom.  I don't know
          8  what kind of building it was, actually.
          9            So after we got off the truck, we went up the
         10  stairs and into a school building.  Actually, at that
         11  point I didn't know it was a school.  It was a kind of
         12  structure.
         13       Q.   Witness, this photograph that you see in
         14  front of you, can you explain to the Judges what this
         15  location is?  Is this where the truck stopped?
         16       A.   Yes, this is where the truck stopped.  It
         17  stopped above the stairs, here.  You cannot see it on
         18  the photograph.  A little further than this.
         19            I forgot to tell you:  Through the hole in
         20  the canvas I could see one or two buses and a truck
         21  there that were empty.  This is what I saw.  But I
         22  don't know how many of them there were.  There may have
         23  been more on the other side, but I don't remember,
         24  because after I got out I didn't watch.
         25            And then two or three soldiers were standing

          1  at the back of the truck while we were getting off.
          2  One of them was standing in front of the building, in
          3  front of a school -- I don't know whether it was a
          4  school at that time.  One of them was standing here
          5  [indicates], near the stairs, and we walked in a line.
          6  And at the entrance to the school this soldier took his
          7  rifle by the barrel and he would hit every man with his
          8  rifle butt on his back.  But people were getting in
          9  very fast, so he didn't manage to hit them all.  So the
         10  man who was standing here stopped the people, and he
         11  would send them one by one so that they could be beaten
         12  up later on.  They were hit once or twice or maybe
         13  several times.
         14       Q.   Witness, the truck was parked on an area of
         15  ground that is to the left of this photograph.  It's
         16  outside the photograph, isn't it, the place where the
         17  truck stopped?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   And the rear of the truck was facing the
         20  stairs that are seen in the photograph on the left-hand
         21  side, going down towards the school?
         22       A.   Yes.  The truck was actually parallel with
         23  the school.  The back part was just next to the steps
         24  where we got off.
         25       Q.   And can you recall, if you can, the -- was it

          1  the first step down on which the first Bosnian soldier
          2  was standing, as one looks at the steps going down
          3  towards the school?
          4       A.   The two or three soldiers.  There may have
          5  been more, but in front of the truck there were two or
          6  three soldiers.  I don't know exactly whether they were
          7  right here, but they were anyway on the part that is
          8  flat [indicates].  I don't know whether anyone was
          9  standing here [indicates], but I remember this one well
         10  who stood halfway down the steps.
         11            And when my turn came, when I reached this
         12  man -- actually, there was the man in front of me, a
         13  man who was captured.  I don't know who he was.  And he
         14  was waiting for his turn to come to receive a blow.
         15  And the Bosnian Serb soldier asked him, "Do you know
         16  me?"  And the man said, "Yes, I know you, brother."  He
         17  said "brother."  I don't know why.  And the Serb
         18  soldier answered, "Who do you know?"  He asked the man,
         19  "Who do you know," as if he didn't want him to know
         20  him.  And as he was holding a gun -- I think it was one
         21  with a clip, a large clip.  I don't know whether it was
         22  an automatic rifle, but something like that.  I think
         23  all the soldiers had automatic rifles.  I think so.
         24  Machine-guns or automatic rifles.
         25            And when the man said he knew him, the Serb

          1  soldier hit him with his rifle.  He hit him with the
          2  front part of the rifle, in his ribs, in his stomach.
          3  The man curled up, or rather he screamed, but the man
          4  who was in front of the door, I don't know whether he
          5  approached him, but as he bent down, as this man bent
          6  down, this other one hit him with his rifle butt across
          7  the back, once or twice; I don't know.
          8            But when he saw that there was no point, that
          9  he would continue to be beaten, he sort of stood up and
         10  entered the school.  I don't know whether they broke
         11  him anything.
         12            I got in without a blow.  I don't know why
         13  they didn't hit me.  Perhaps they were confused over
         14  this man who went in front.  He got in, anyway.
         15  Whether the man in front of the door, the one who was
         16  doing the beating, moved away, I don't know.  I just
         17  know that they didn't hit me, perhaps because I looked
         18  very childish.  I was young.  I don't know why.
         19            And when we entered the school, the column
         20  continued; not really a column, but as one was hit, he
         21  would enter.  There was some space between each man.
         22  There were soldiers inside, but I don't know how many.
         23  And one of them asked, "Whose land is this?"  And he
         24  provided the answer himself:  "This is Serb land.  It
         25  always was and will be."  And he said, "Follow me,

          1  balija -- repeat after me," and we had to repeat after
          2  him:  "This is Serb land.  It always was and will be."
          3       Q.   Witness, if you could pause there for a
          4  moment.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I don't know
          6  whether you feel this is an appropriate time for a
          7  break.  I think we've been going for nearly an hour and
          8  a quarter.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         10  Mr. Cayley.  Thank you very much for drawing our
         11  attention to this.  We're going to have a break, not
         12  quite half an hour, but 25 minutes and then we'll
         13  continue.
         14                 --- Recess taken at 12.37 p.m.
         15                 --- On resuming at 1.11 p.m.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I
         17  apologise, Mr. Cayley.  We took a little longer for the
         18  break, but before beginning, perhaps we need to
         19  re-examine our working hours a little.  I don't know
         20  whether you can answer this question.  We have decided
         21  to have a Status Conference at about quarter past two.
         22            Nevertheless, I examined what we could
         23  discuss, and I really think that we would go on until
         24  after 3.00 and this would, of course, cause
         25  inconvenience with the interpreters and also the
          1  meetings that the Judges have in the course of the
          2  afternoon.
          3            So I'd like to ask you, is this the last
          4  witness you have or do you have another witness.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, if your --
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me
          7  for interrupting you.  For this week, I mean.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  No, Mr. President, we do have
          9  two more witnesses which we believe that we could get
         10  through tomorrow.  I cannot guarantee that, but that
         11  certainly is our aim.
         12            I know you expressed the view that you didn't
         13  wish witnesses to be brought here, part heard and then
         14  sent back.  If we were only able to complete one, an
         15  additional one witness, I think we would not call the
         16  third witness, but we can certainly discuss that
         17  tomorrow.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] What I
         19  would suggest, therefore, I think the question of
         20  witnesses is more important than the Status
         21  Conference.  So what we are going to try to do is to
         22  proceed as quickly as possible.  I'm placing this
         23  before you for your consideration, both the Prosecution
         24  and the Defence and my colleague Judges to go directly
         25  to questions and to save time so as to avoid a witness

          1  who is here now having to come back a month and a half
          2  later.
          3            I think we all understand what that can mean
          4  from every possible standpoint.  Therefore, we have
          5  this witness and two more.  Therefore, what we're going
          6  to try to do is to do our very best to finish with the
          7  testimony.
          8            If tomorrow we have a little time left, I
          9  would at least like to ask you a few questions so you
         10  can think about them without going into any analyses
         11  but simply to convey to you the concerns of the Chamber
         12  regarding the status of the case.  And when we resume
         13  our hearings, we will do so after the parties have had
         14  a chance to reflect about them and discuss these
         15  matters.
         16            So what I am suggesting now, and when I
         17  mentioned the small Status Conference tomorrow, I mean
         18  that we must never overstep the deadline of 3.00.
         19            Mr. Dubuisson, can we plan that for tomorrow
         20  to work until 3.00, perhaps.
         21            THE REGISTRAR [Interpretation] No problem,
         22  Your Honour.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         24  case, thank you very much.
         25            So what I'm asking now is to proceed as
          1  quickly as possible to save as much time as possible
          2  and tomorrow, if we have a chance, we will have a very
          3  small Status Conference.  Not the one we wanted to
          4  have, but simply to list the questions that we have to
          5  address.
          6            I think it is important for you before we
          7  adjourn to know the question that you have to think
          8  over.  I think it was important for me to say this in
          9  the interest of management.
         10            Thank you very much, please proceed.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  In respect
         12  of this witness, Witness O, we will certainly finish
         13  him today.
         14            Now, Mr. President, may I proceed with the
         15  witness?
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:
         18       Q.   Now, Witness, prior to the break, you had
         19  explained to the Judges that as you went into this
         20  building, soldiers, Bosnian Serb soldiers cried, "This
         21  is Serbian country; always was and always will be,"
         22  and that you also were required to say this.  And you
         23  were addressed as "balijas" by these Bosnian Serb
         24  soldiers.
         25            If you know, can you explain to the Judges

          1  the meaning of balija?
          2       A.   I think at least I know.  I think it's a
          3  derogatory name for Bosnian Muslims.  For Turks, in
          4  fact, but we're not Turks.  We're a Slavic people of
          5  Muslim faith.  So it's a derogatory term for Muslims.
          6            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
          7  Prosecutor's Exhibit 21/5 and 21/6.  If 21/5 could be
          8  placed on the ELMO.
          9       Q.   Can you explain to the Judges this photograph
         10  that's in front of you?
         11       A.   Yes.  When we entered the school here, we
         12  went this way [indicates], and then we turned right, up
         13  the steps.  Actually, the column went that way, and
         14  that's where we had to shout what we were told.
         15            I forgot to mention also their question was:
         16  "Who does Srebrenica belong to?"  And then the
         17  soldiers themselves said, "Srebrenica was always Serb.
         18  It always was, and always will be Serb."
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         20  witness is indicating on Prosecutor's Exhibit 21/5 that
         21  the column of Muslim men went up the staircase
         22  indicated in that photograph to the first floor?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  And now if the witness could be
         25  shown Exhibit 21/6.

          1       Q.   Witness, can you explain this photograph to
          2  the Judges?
          3       A.   Yes, we went along this corridor.  Actually
          4  this group of men, I don't know whether all of them got
          5  off the truck.  I think it was the last or one but last
          6  classroom, I'm not sure.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley,
          8  excuse me for interrupting you.
          9            Witness, if possible, when you have a pointer
         10  on the ELMO, look at the photograph, not the monitor;
         11  otherwise you can't point it out to us.
         12            If you are speaking without being in touch
         13  with the photograph, and if you have a pointer on the
         14  photograph, we get a bit confused.  So when pointing,
         15  please look at the ELMO.  If you don't need to use the
         16  photograph, remove the pointer.
         17       A.   I apologise, Mr. President.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Sorry,
         19  Mr. Cayley, you may proceed.
         20            MR. CAYLEY:
         21       Q.   Witness, can you indicate to the Judges the
         22  door of the classroom into which you entered?
         23       A.   We were going along this corridor
         24  [indicates], and I'm not quite sure whether we entered
         25  the last or one but last classroom.  There were five or

          1  six doors leading out from this corridor, I don't know
          2  whether there were five or six classrooms.  And we
          3  could hear people talking inside so I went into the
          4  last or one but last.
          5            And once I enter the classroom, I'll be able
          6  to recognise it, but looking at it this way I'm not
          7  sure which one of the two it was.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          9  witness is indicating on Prosecutor's Exhibit 21/6 that
         10  he entered one of the doors which are on the right-hand
         11  side of the photograph, and it's either the one
         12  furthest in the background on the right-hand side or
         13  the next one coming into the foreground from that one.
         14  So it's essentially the last two doors on the
         15  right-hand side of the photograph looking towards the
         16  door at the end of that view.
         17       Q.   Now, Witness, how full of men was the
         18  classroom that you went into?
         19       A.   The classroom was full.  At first, the air
         20  was fresh as opposed to the air in the truck.  I felt
         21  well, as if I was free, compared to the horror in the
         22  truck.  The classroom was full, it was packed full.  In
         23  fact, it was perhaps more crowded than the truck.  I
         24  can't tell you how many people were inside though.
         25            So when the classroom was full, the door was

          1  closed.  People sat on top of one another, some were
          2  lying down.  In any case, there were a lot of people.
          3  I can't tell you the number.
          4       Q.   Now, you said that there was not enough air
          5  in the room.  Did you try to open a window?
          6       A.   Yes.  One of the men tried to open a window,
          7  but what I must mention first is that a Bosnian Serb
          8  soldier came and asked for German marks.  Some men said
          9  they had already given them to others before.  They
         10  said, "You must give them up.  Those of you who do will
         11  be saved."  Some people who hid the money gave it up.
         12  And after that he left the classroom.
         13            And then we ran out of air, so someone tried
         14  to open the window.  But shooting started, so that the
         15  glass was broken.  I think it was probably one of the
         16  soldiers.  So that the window panes were cracked.  Not
         17  all of them; one, two, or three, though.
         18       Q.   Now, if the windows were broken, the soldier
         19  was firing outside in as somebody tried to open the
         20  window; is that right?
         21       A.   Yes.  When someone tried to open the window,
         22  one of the Bosnian Serb soldiers started shooting.  A
         23  man next to me was wounded.  I don't know whether it
         24  was by the glass or by ammunition, but I know he was
         25  wounded in the neck.  I don't know whether there were

          1  other people wounded, but holes could be seen in the
          2  ceiling above the window, as if bullets had hit there.
          3  When I looked, I saw it, so I don't know whether those
          4  holes were there before, but in any case the window
          5  panes did break.
          6       Q.   Were you still thirsty?
          7       A.   Yes, very thirsty.  We asked for water.
          8  Someone communicated with the soldier outside.  I heard
          9  them talking.  I don't know who among the soldiers, nor
         10  who among the men, but probably the Bosnian Serb
         11  soldier said that bread would be brought in, and water,
         12  and after a while somebody did bring it.  I don't know
         13  who brought it.  I know that there was a jerrycan of
         14  water and they gave us a drop each, as they did in the
         15  truck.  I remember opening my mouth and being given a
         16  drop of water.  It hardly meant anything, because I was
         17  so thirsty.
         18            In the meantime, people were making a lot of
         19  noise, and then that same soldier came in again.  I
         20  can't remember what he looked like.  I think he had
         21  dark hair.  And he said that we must not make a noise,
         22  otherwise we'd be killed.  And he pointed his hand at
         23  one of the boys, one of the young men, a young man, and
         24  he said to him, "You are responsible for this.  If they
         25  make a noise, I'll kill you."  When he left, this young

          1  man begged the men to keep quiet, not to make a noise,
          2  but the men were simply thirsty.
          3       Q.   And the young man that the Bosnian Serb
          4  soldier pointed at was part of the group of Muslim men
          5  in the classroom?
          6       A.   Yes.  Yes.
          7       Q.   Did there come a time, Witness, when soldiers
          8  came to ask for Muslim men from certain geographical
          9  locations to come out of the classroom?
         10       A.   Yes.  A soldier came.  I can't remember
         11  whether it was the same one, but he did -- a soldier
         12  did come up and he said:  Is there anyone from this
         13  location?  I'm giving you examples.  Cerska.  I can't
         14  remember the names of all the villages.  He may have
         15  mentioned three or four or five.  But, for instance,
         16  from Cerska, from Glogova.  And at the end, two men
         17  raised their hands and said, "We are from --"  I don't
         18  know; somewhere, whether it was from Cerska, Glogova,
         19  or a third location, because I didn't remember
         20  everything.
         21            And they went outside.  They were taken
         22  outside, and I heard blows and moans.  They didn't come
         23  back.
         24            What I forgot to mention was that again it
         25  became very stuffy.  We couldn't go to the toilet.  The

          1  room was full of urine.  People were drinking urine
          2  from the floor.  I saw that with my own eyes.  They
          3  were so thirsty.
          4            And then, when darkness fell, from the other
          5  classrooms -- I assume it was from the other
          6  classrooms, because as I was entering I heard people
          7  talking in the other classrooms.  Somebody in the
          8  corridor was saying something, probably one of the
          9  soldiers.  He was saying, "Let three balijas come
         10  out."  Was it three or four or five or two, I can't
         11  remember all the numbers.  And while the people got
         12  down in front of the school, bursts of fire could be
         13  heard.  And this was repeated every time.  When he
         14  would say three or four or five men were to come out,
         15  they were taken in front of the school and shots were
         16  heard.  I assume that the shooting was in front of the
         17  school, because it was so loud.  And they went on like
         18  that until perhaps midnight.  Perhaps it was midnight.
         19  I'm not quite sure.  But anyway, it was very late.
         20            And then someone came, one of the soldiers
         21  came, and said that it was our turn now, that we should
         22  come out two by two, allegedly that we would be
         23  searched or checked or registered for exchange.  I
         24  don't know exactly what he said, but something to that
         25  effect.

          1            And I was wet with urine.  I took off my
          2  T-shirt and one of the other men gave me a dry one.  I
          3  put it on.  And I asked my uncle, who was with me,
          4  whether we should go out together.  He said, "No, we
          5  won't go out together."  So I went out before him, with
          6  one of the other men, and after that I never saw him
          7  again.
          8            When I came out with this other man into the
          9  corridor, we were told there were one, two, or three
         10  soldiers, maybe more.  But I think one of them, who was
         11  fair -- he had a camouflage uniform.  I can't tell you
         12  what colour it was exactly, but I know it was some sort
         13  of a camouflage uniform.  He wasn't in civilian
         14  clothes, at least.  He told us to take off -- to strip
         15  to the waist, to take off everything up to the waist
         16  and to take off our shoes.  I didn't have any shoes on;
         17  I only had socks on, because I had lost my shoes
         18  somewhere in the woods.  So I took off my socks as
         19  well.
         20            First he tied up the man who was next to me,
         21  then he tied my hands behind my back.  I don't know
         22  what he used to tie us up with.  It wasn't wire, it
         23  wasn't metal.  It was some kind of string, but very
         24  hard string that was cutting at our skin.  But I was
         25  lucky that it wasn't -- my hands weren't tied too

          1  tight.  Perhaps I feigned trying to pull free, but I
          2  didn't manage anyway.
          3            So he pushed me into another classroom.  I
          4  can't remember which one it was.  But in any case, it
          5  was either the classroom next to the one we were in or
          6  the second from that door.  There were a lot of clothes
          7  on the floor in that classroom.  I could see it under
          8  my feet, even though it was dark.  I could feel those
          9  clothes.  And then roughly, and all this is very
         10  approximate, when they tied up everyone -- I don't know
         11  whether it was everyone -- one of the Bosnian Serb
         12  soldiers said that we should go out, and a column
         13  started.  Actually, men filed past one after another.
         14            I sort of kept to the middle, maybe out of
         15  fear, maybe just spontaneously.  I don't know how.  I
         16  was always somewhere in the middle, though of course we
         17  weren't eager to get out first.
         18            What I forgot to say was while we were in the
         19  classroom, when they were shooting, the men were saying
         20  that we should run out all together and then someone
         21  would have a chance to survive.  But nobody wanted to
         22  get killed.  And others were saying that they weren't
         23  killing people, that there was the Red Cross or
         24  something.
         25            So shall I go back to where I stopped?  We

          1  were getting out.  I was somewhere in the middle, down
          2  the steps.  I don't know how many soldiers were in the
          3  corridor.  When I left the school, it was dark, but I
          4  could still decipher -- if I can show you on the
          5  picture what I saw in front of the school.
          6            MR. CAYLEY:  That's Exhibit 21/4.  Let the
          7  record show the witness is now indicating on
          8  Prosecutor's Exhibit 21/4.
          9       A.   Yes.  It was roughly here [indicates].  I say
         10  "roughly" because I couldn't see clearly.  But I was
         11  barefoot and I felt that there was something sticky
         12  underneath my feet.  I assumed it was blood, but it was
         13  dark.  And there was a very large pile here.  I wasn't
         14  watching closely.  I was walking with my head bent
         15  down.  And we had at that time realised where we were
         16  going.
         17            After that we got on the truck.  I don't know
         18  whether everybody got on the truck, but many people
         19  went on board.
         20       Q.   Witness, if you could wait there one moment,
         21  and can you place your pointer where you said that it
         22  was a very large pile, and keep it there.
         23       A.   Yes.  It was here, but you cannot see it very
         24  clearly on the photograph [indicates].  Not everything
         25  is in the photograph.  It was here [indicates].  I must

          1  have passed by along this way [indicates].  Those are
          2  the moments that I don't remember very clearly, but I
          3  know it was a very large pile.
          4       Q.   Witness, if you could wait there one moment.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          6  witness is indicating on that exhibit a point
          7  immediately in front of the doors into the school,
          8  which are slightly in shadow.
          9       A.   Maybe even -- excuse me.  Maybe further to
         10  the right [indicates], but it cannot be seen on the
         11  photograph.
         12       Q.   What did you think this pile was that you
         13  saw?
         14       A.   I thought that those were killed people,
         15  because throughout that time while we were in the
         16  classroom, there was shooting going on, so I thought
         17  that those must have been the people who had been
         18  killed, people from other classrooms.  I couldn't see
         19  them, but I had heard noise.  I could hear people
         20  talk.  They may have transported them somewhere.  They
         21  may have killed them.  But I assumed that those were
         22  the people, the killed people.
         23       Q.   Remember, Witness, we will finish you today,
         24  but speak slowly so that the interpreters can follow
         25  what you're saying.

          1            Now, immediately you left the school.
          2  Immediately you left the school.  Where did you go
          3  after that?
          4       A.   A truck was stationed there, almost at the
          5  same spot, perhaps a little further left, towards the
          6  flat part of the ground, and it was facing the same
          7  direction where we had come from.  The entrance, the
          8  door, was here, but something, a kind of plank, was put
          9  there, so we used that plank to climb aboard.  I don't
         10  know how large the truck was.  It was a big one.  I
         11  don't know how big it was.  I don't know if it was the
         12  same one.  I couldn't tell you that.
         13            But once the truck was full, the sides of the
         14  truck were closed.  There was no canvas on that part,
         15  at the rear, but it was on the other part of the
         16  truck.  And somebody, probably a Bosnian Serb soldier,
         17  said that we should sit down.  But we simply couldn't
         18  sit down, because we were crowded.  We were standing
         19  next to one another like sardines.
         20            Then a shot could be heard.  I don't know
         21  whether it was a burst of gunfire or a single bullet,
         22  but we heard a shot and somebody screamed on the
         23  truck.  Maybe somebody got wounded.  I don't know who
         24  it was who shouted.  Anyway, there was shooting next to
         25  the truck and somebody on the truck was screaming, as

          1  if he had been wounded.  And at that moment we fell
          2  down on top of one another.
          3            And the situation was chaotic.  We were all
          4  tied up.  We couldn't hold ourselves, and our bodies
          5  kept pushing against the sides of the truck.  I managed
          6  to remain somewhere near the side of the truck, but
          7  towards the mid-part of the truck, and I was on my
          8  knees.  And I was squeezed by other people, and at that
          9  moment the truck started out and it travelled for about
         10  five or ten minutes.  I cannot tell you for how long.
         11  It may have seemed long.
         12            But for a while we travelled along the
         13  asphalt road.  The ride was not bumpy.  And at one
         14  point it turned onto a macadam road and it stopped
         15  after maybe five or ten minutes, approximately.
         16            I recognised a teacher of mine behind me.  I
         17  don't know how I managed to recognise him, because it
         18  was dark, but I just recognised him and I said, "Is
         19  that you, sir?"  And he said, "Yes, it's me."  And he
         20  asked me who I was, but I didn't reply.
         21            This all took place while the truck was
         22  moving, and then it stopped and we could hear shots.
         23  We could hear something hitting, tapping on the truck,
         24  and I think it was -- it sounded like rain, but it may
         25  have been bursts of gunfire.  I don't know.  Later it

          1  turned out that those were gravels that were caused to
          2  fly by gunfire.
          3            And at one point somebody opened one side of
          4  the truck.  I stood up.  I don't know how I managed to
          5  stand up.  I was tied up.  But somehow I stood up.
          6  It's very hard for me to remember all the details from
          7  that time.  And they wanted five balijas to come out,
          8  so some people went out.  At that point I was standing
          9  and I could see that there were maybe two or three
         10  soldiers.  For sure there were more than one, but I
         11  don't know how many.
         12            So when the people got out -- I don't know
         13  where exactly it was, where they stopped and when they
         14  got out -- the firing started, and then they would call
         15  out people in groups of five.  There was a man who was
         16  behind me and whom I knew.  He managed to untie his
         17  hands, and he asked me if I wanted him to untie my
         18  hands.  And I said, "No.  No, I don't want that,
         19  because I'm going to be killed.  I don't want it."
         20            So after the next five had been called out,
         21  he jumped out.  He pushed aside the two soldiers with
         22  his hands and he started to run.  He ran into the dark
         23  and I couldn't see where he was going.  I know that
         24  they were shooting after him.  I don't know whether the
         25  soldiers were shooting or not.  All I know is that the

          1  man is no longer alive.  He didn't make it out.  I know
          2  that he had no place to run, no way to escape.
          3            And after that people stopped getting out.
          4  People didn't -- people no longer wanted to get out.
          5  We were very thirsty.  And one of the captives, one of
          6  the people on the truck, started to shout, started to
          7  yell.  He may have recognised a soldier there, and he
          8  spoke to him and he said, "I took care of you and your
          9  mother, Stana, and now you're killing these innocent
         10  people."  I believe that the name he mentioned was
         11  Stana, but I cannot be a hundred per cent sure.
         12            Some people shouted, "Give us some water
         13  first and then kill us."  I was really sorry that I
         14  would die thirsty, and I was trying to hide amongst the
         15  people as long as I could, like everybody else.  I just
         16  wanted to live for another second or two.  And when it
         17  was my turn, I jumped out with what I believe were four
         18  other people.  I could feel the gravel beneath my
         19  feet.  It hurt.  And we were told to find a place for
         20  us.  We went to the left side of the truck.  Somebody
         21  must have indicated to us the way.  I was walking with
         22  my head bent down and I wasn't feeling anything.  I
         23  know that I didn't feel anything.
         24            I don't think I was afraid.  I had made up my
         25  mind.  I didn't understand why one of the soldiers had

          1  told us to find a place, but when I approached the
          2  area, when we were on the right-hand side of the truck,
          3  I saw rows of killed people.  It looked like they had
          4  been lined up one row after the other.  I couldn't see
          5  the end of it, but I could somehow sense it, although
          6  it was dark.
          7            So when I reached my spot, at that point we
          8  were watching those dead people.  You could tell that
          9  those were dead people there.  There were several Serb
         10  soldiers there.  I don't know how many there were, five
         11  or ten, but they were standing behind our backs.  But
         12  it all happened very quickly, in a matter of seconds.
         13            And then I thought that I would die very
         14  fast, that I would not suffer.  And I just thought that
         15  my mother would never know where I had ended up.  This
         16  is what I was thinking as I was getting out of the
         17  truck.  And when we reached the spot, somebody said,
         18  "Lie down."  And when we started to fall down to the
         19  front, they were behind our backs, the shooting
         20  started.
         21            I fell down, and I don't know what happened
         22  then.  I wasn't thinking.  It wasn't my idea to fall
         23  down first and to survive like this, I just thought it
         24  was the end.
         25            I don't know whether I lost consciousness at

          1  that point, maybe I was still conscious, but I don't
          2  remember that moment precisely.  All I know is that
          3  while I was lying down, I felt pain in the right side
          4  of my chest.  I felt pain on the right side, but I
          5  didn't know where I had been wounded, and I felt pain
          6  in my right arm.  And I suffered.  But I kept lying
          7  like that on my stomach with my head turned to the
          8  right.
          9            There was a man next to me who was moaning a
         10  lot.  I don't know how he had been hit, maybe he was
         11  almost dead.  I don't know who it was.  All I could
         12  hear was his moans.  I suffered too, but I didn't
         13  shout.  I didn't cry out.  I didn't know how seriously
         14  I had been wounded.  I was waiting for another bullet
         15  to come and hit me and I was waiting to die.
         16            And then after they had brought another group
         17  of, again, probably five people, I think that they were
         18  moving from the left to the right, and this is at least
         19  what I could observe at that point.  There were
         20  approximately five people.
         21            And then one of the soldiers said to an
         22  elderly man who had been sitting with me in the
         23  classroom, I assume he was addressing him, he told him
         24  to say, "Allah-u-ekber".  I assumed it was an elderly
         25  man.  I could tell it by his voice.

          1            And the bursts of gunfire continued and the
          2  people fell down.  I don't know how long it took.  They
          3  kept bringing people up.  I remember that elderly man,
          4  I assumed that he was an old man.
          5            And after that finished, I don't know how
          6  long it lasted; maybe one hour, or maybe ten minutes.
          7  But it all, to me, it all looked very long.
          8            The next group who was -- that was probably
          9  taken out after me was also shot at.  And at that
         10  point, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my left leg.  I
         11  thought that a bullet had hit me in my left foot.  And
         12  I thought that bullets were hitting the gravel around
         13  me.  They were firing in bursts of gunfire, and I was
         14  simply expecting the next bullet to come and hit me.
         15  But the gravel kept falling on me.  I don't know how
         16  long it took them.  I don't know how many rows of
         17  people there were left.
         18            But when they had finished, they laughed.
         19  They said, "Well, your government will be exchanging
         20  you even if you're dead."  They would take a look at
         21  someone and they would make jokes, "Look at this guy,
         22  he looks like a cabbage."  I don't know what else they
         23  were saying.
         24            And once they had finished, somebody said
         25  that all the dead should be inspected.  I think that

          1  the name mentioned was Jovo.  It was told that all the
          2  dead should be inspected, and they were told that if
          3  they find a warm body, they should fire one more bullet
          4  into their head.
          5            So this man, I don't know whether it was Jovo
          6  or somebody else, he said, "I think that all the
          7  motherfuckers are dead."
          8            So I was thinking that maybe I wanted to call
          9  them to finish me off because I was suffering a lot.
         10  And I thought maybe if I don't die here, I will survive
         11  and then maybe I will take -- I will be taken away
         12  alive and that my suffering will only be prolonged.
         13            So while I was lying, at one point, and I
         14  kept silent all the time, I could see a military boot
         15  stomping next to my face.  And I kept watching, I
         16  didn't close my eyes.  But the man stepped over me, it
         17  was a soldier, and he fired into the head of a man who
         18  was next to me.
         19            And at that moment, I closed my eyes and I
         20  was hit in my right shoulder.  I don't know what it
         21  was.  I don't know whether it was a kind of
         22  fragmentation bullet or just gravel, but I don't think
         23  so, that it would have been gravel.  Because I still
         24  have metal particles in my right arm, in my right
         25  chest, and also in my foot.

          1            So after I'd been hit in my shoulder, I said
          2  to myself, "I've been wounded all over.  How come I'm
          3  not dying?"
          4            I don't know where the soldier went, but they
          5  kept laughing.  From time to time, a shot would be
          6  heard.  They were killing people.  And they mentioned
          7  something, they said something about Haris Silajdzic
          8  and our government, they said, "You would be exchanged
          9  by your government," and something to that effect.
         10            And after they had finished the job, again I
         11  thought that I should call out for help.  I was still
         12  very thirsty.  But I was sort of between life and
         13  death.  I didn't know whether I wanted to live or to
         14  die anymore.
         15            I decided not to call out for them to shoot
         16  and kill me, but I was sort of praying to God that
         17  they'd come and kill me.  But I decided not to call
         18  them and I was waiting to die.
         19            When they had finished and when the engine of
         20  the truck had started, they left.  I don't know whether
         21  they left a guard behind or someone.  But I kept lying
         22  as I was, and I changed the position of my head.  I
         23  turned left.  When I -- afterwards when I had reached
         24  the Dam, I saw a light.  I don't know actually know
         25  whether it was actually a dam, but it was a kind of a

          1  slope or a hill, but I wasn't aware of what it was,
          2  actually.
          3            So I turned my head, and I wasn't really
          4  afraid.  I didn't know whether there were any soldiers
          5  there or not.  I wasn't really thinking of what I
          6  should do.  I simply stood there, remained there
          7  lying.  I was still tied up.  But it's possible that I
          8  could see a little better at that point.  My eyes must
          9  have become accustomed to the dark after I had got off
         10  the truck.
         11            There were many people killed.  I don't know
         12  how many, but a lot.  At one point I raised my head and
         13  I saw that maybe one or two rows in front of me,
         14  somebody was moving.  He was maybe two or three metres
         15  away from me.  And I could tell he was moving and I
         16  asked, "Are you alive?"  I whispered to him.  And he
         17  said, "I'm alive.  Come here and untie me, please."
         18  And I said, "I cannot.  I'm wounded."
         19            But he kept calling me.  And maybe, maybe one
         20  hour later, maybe 10 minutes later or 15 minutes later
         21  but it seemed rather long to me, I started turning
         22  around a little bit.  This may have given me some
         23  strength, some force, and I realised that I could,
         24  perhaps, leave.  That I could perhaps walk.
         25            And I kept rolling over the bodies.  I did it

          1  several times until I reached the man who was still
          2  alive.  So I managed to roll up to his mouth.  He was
          3  squeezed by the bodies.  I know that he couldn't stand
          4  up.
          5            He didn't actually cut the string, but he was
          6  a very strong man and he cut it with his teeth.  And I
          7  told you that it had been a rather strong, resistant
          8  kind of string which the soldier used to tie up my
          9  hands.
         10       Q.   Witness, I'm sorry to interrupt you at this
         11  point in your testimony.  But can you ensure that you
         12  don't name the man who went up to help.  Can you not
         13  name him?
         14       A.   I won't.
         15       Q.   Please continue, I'm sorry.
         16       A.   So I got on to my knees and I tried to untie
         17  him with my hands.  Even though my hand was very
         18  painful, I could still manage.  So I assumed that I
         19  wasn't hit in the bone.  I kept thinking about all
         20  these things.  And I asked him whether he had been
         21  wounded and he said, "Yes, in the head."
         22            I continued untying him with my teeth, trying
         23  to bite through that string, each strand of the
         24  string.  And this went on for some time.  He was a big
         25  man, a strong man.  Very strong.

          1            And I managed to untie two of the strands or
          2  my -- my hands were cut by this string, and in the
          3  meantime, we saw lights, a vehicle was coming towards
          4  us.  I don't know whether it was going along the same
          5  road, but the lights were turned towards us.
          6            And I said, "A truck is coming."  I assumed
          7  it was a truck, maybe it wasn't.  And he kept insisting
          8  that I should go on untying him because he was afraid I
          9  would leave him, and he wanted to escape because he was
         10  probably only lightly wounded in the head, I saw that
         11  later.  And I continued and the truck really did get
         12  close to us.  It came closer and closer.
         13            I said, "Really, there is a truck
         14  approaching."  And I don't know how I helped him or
         15  whether he did it on his own, but somehow he managed to
         16  get up, though he was still tied up, and he started
         17  walking across the bodies.  I don't know where.
         18            I crawled after him on my hands and knees.  I
         19  couldn't stand up.  My leg was hurting me very badly.
         20  And as we went over the bodies, I couldn't see who it
         21  was, but it was a terrible sight.  Somebody had been
         22  hit in the head, and the inside had spilled over.  I
         23  didn't see anyone alive.
         24            And when I had passed over those bodies, I
         25  don't know for how long I crawled over those bodies,

          1  but when I came to the end of the bodies, I crawled
          2  down some rocks.  If I can show you that.  Can I show
          3  you?
          4       Q.   Witness, if you could pause there for a
          5  moment?
          6            MR. CAYLEY:  And if the witness could be
          7  shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 22/3.
          8       Q.   And in order to finish this today, we'll try
          9  to move through this quite quickly.
         10            Now first of all, if you could answer a
         11  question for me, Witness.  Is this the location where
         12  the execution took place?
         13       A.   Yes, it is.  I recognised it the next day
         14  after the execution that that was 100 per cent that
         15  place.  I am quite convinced of that.
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  And let the record show that the
         17  witness has identified Prosecutor's Exhibit 22/3.
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  Now, if the witness could be
         19  shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 22/5.
         20       Q.   Because, Witness, wait one moment, because
         21  22/5 you will be able to explain to the Judges the
         22  location of where you escaped from.
         23       A.   Roughly from somewhere here [indicates].  We
         24  were shot at at our backs towards the Dam.  Of course I
         25  didn't know it was a dam then.  Then we took this route

          1  and went this way, but it was green then.  And
          2  somewhere down there, we entered a concrete ditch.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          4  witness is indicating on Prosecutor's Exhibit 22/5 that
          5  he and the other individual who escaped moved from the
          6  left hand -- mid left-hand side of this photograph to
          7  the right-hand side of this photograph off the
          8  embankment of the Dam and into some woods that he said
          9  were greener at the time.  It was summer, and they are
         10  on the right-hand side of the photograph.
         11       A.   So about eight or ten metres down the canal
         12  [indicates].  The man who was with me went in front of
         13  me.  I don't know how I got down, but I know that I was
         14  in the ditch.
         15            The man told me his name.  We didn't know
         16  each other.  I told him mine.  We weren't so afraid
         17  because there were bushes but I was in great pain.  I
         18  was suffering very badly.  I was naked to the waist
         19  down and barefooted.  The man had a T-shirt on, a green
         20  one, and a vest, an undervest.  He took it off and tore
         21  it up and bandaged my wounds.
         22            When he bandaged me, I fell asleep on his lap
         23  because I hadn't slept for a long time.  I may have
         24  slept on the truck, but it's not really sleep.
         25       Q.   Witness, if I could ask you one question.

          1  The execution itself, did that take place in the early
          2  hours of the 15th of July of 1995 as far as you can
          3  recall?
          4       A.   Would you repeat the question, please?
          5       Q.   The execution, did it take place in the early
          6  morning hours of the 15th of July of 1995?
          7       A.   I don't know whether it was the 15th of July,
          8  but it was about midnight.  It may have been after
          9  midnight, 1.00 or 2.00, but I don't know exactly.
         10       Q.   Now, the last part of your testimony we'll
         11  move through very quickly so I would just ask you some
         12  questions.
         13            Did there come a time when you moved away
         14  from this location near the Dam and, in fact, you
         15  climbed up some hills so that you had a view of the Dam
         16  beneath you?
         17       A.   Yes, we stayed there until the morning.
         18  Actually, he woke me up and asked me where shall we
         19  go.  I said, "I don't know."  But since there was a
         20  forest to the right of the ditch, we entered the
         21  forest.  He went first.  There were a lot of thorns.  I
         22  crawled after him.  He picked mushrooms and he found a
         23  small apple.  We were very thirsty, but there was no
         24  water in the ditch where we had been.
         25            And walking through the forest, we reached

          1  the top of a hill.  Can I show it to you on the
          2  photograph?  We saw a guard walking along some rocks.
          3  We didn't know it was a dam.  He was walking there and
          4  there was a machine.  I think it was a machine on the
          5  Dam.
          6       Q.   Witness, if you could wait one moment.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
          8  Prosecutor's Exhibit 126.
          9       Q.   The other man that was with you, would you
         10  have survived if it hadn't been for him, Witness?
         11       A.   No, no, I wouldn't have survived.  That's for
         12  sure.
         13       Q.   Now, this is a view looking down.
         14       A.   We went from the ditch over here [indicates]
         15  into the woods and we climbed up here.  And we saw a
         16  guard with a rifle walking along the Dam.  Not here,
         17  but up there [indicates].
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         19  witness is indicating that he and his colleague climbed
         20  a hill which can be seen as a wooded area in the rear
         21  area of the photograph.
         22       Q.   Now, Witness, you shaded in that square for
         23  me last night on another photograph.  It's a square
         24  with hatched markings across it.  Can you explain to
         25  the Judges what that is?

          1       A.   I'm sorry.  So we didn't see this part from
          2  the woods [indicates], but we saw the upper part of the
          3  Dam, I call it a "dam".  I didn't see the water, I just
          4  saw the guard.  And we didn't see the bodies here.  We
          5  decided to go back because we were surrounded by
          6  villages everywhere.
          7            So we came back down the hill into the
          8  ditch.  And the man who was with me, he went to bring
          9  me water.  I don't know where he went.  But I stayed
         10  behind in the wood, and he didn't come back for a long
         11  time.  I thought perhaps he had left.
         12            After a few minutes, perhaps it was minutes,
         13  ten, twenty, I don't know, he came back carrying water
         14  or a broken can of some sort or a shoe or something.
         15            And then we decided to cross over to the
         16  other hill where we could see some burned down houses.
         17  They can't be seen on this photograph.  And we passed
         18  beneath this plateau where the executions took place.
         19  And we passed down there, we took a risk, somebody
         20  could have killed us, but we entered the wood on the
         21  other side, which I can show you.
         22            Can I show you the road we crossed, the
         23  road?  It can't be seen on this photograph.
         24            We went to the woods on another hill.  This
         25  may have lasted hours because we didn't walk normally.

          1  The man who was with me went some 50 metres ahead.  I
          2  crawled, I sometimes hopped on one leg with a stick.
          3  He kept begging me to follow.
          4            I was exhausted and hungry and thirsty, but I
          5  couldn't walk.  I may have been able to live for
          6  sometime lying there but I couldn't walk I was so
          7  exhausted.
          8            And we got to the hill on the other side.  We
          9  emerged from the woods into a meadow.  And then we saw
         10  a river or rather the part of the Dam, not the Dam
         11  itself, but the water behind it, we thought it was a
         12  river.
         13            After a while we heard an engine, and I saw a
         14  loader collecting dead bodies and loading them onto
         15  something.  I don't know whether it was a tractor or a
         16  truck.  But there was a very large pile of bodies.  I
         17  can't remember how many.  I was in great pain.  What I
         18  have drawn is roughly, very roughly.  It may have been
         19  larger or smaller.  When I cast a glance just once,
         20  there may have been so many people.  I don't know
         21  exactly.  There were really a lot.  The man who was
         22  with me may know more, because he was in better shape.
         23  I can't tell you the number.  I don't know.
         24       Q.   Witness, so the shaded area on this
         25  photograph represents the area that you saw, the

          1  approximate area that you saw covered with bodies that
          2  morning?
          3       A.   Yes, approximately.  It may have been
          4  smaller.  It wasn't absolutely all of it covered.  It
          5  wasn't right to the edges.  I really can't say.  It may
          6  be approximately like this, it may have been larger,
          7  maybe smaller, but that is how it looked like to me.
          8       Q.   And that is the same area in which you saw
          9  the excavator loading bodies?
         10       A.   Yes.  Yes, the excavator.  I think that it
         11  was yellow.  I think it was yellow and it was big and
         12  it had wheels.  I think it had wheels.  I'm not quite
         13  sure.
         14       Q.   Now, to complete your testimony -- I'm sorry
         15  to rush you, but time is running out -- I think you
         16  then spent four days in the forest with the other
         17  gentleman and then I think you reached
         18  Bosnian-controlled territory; is that right?
         19       A.   Yes.  Four days we spent there.  We wandered
         20  around.  We didn't know where to go.  First we heard
         21  shells and shooting.  We thought that the front lines
         22  could be nearby.  We simply wandered around not knowing
         23  where we were, where we were going.
         24            On one hill we noticed a TV receiver.  I
         25  think it was Majevica.  We thought we'd go to Tuzla or

          1  somewhere there.  And then we followed the streams.  We
          2  got lost.  We passed through villages.  And we happened
          3  to come out in the territory of the BH army.  But this
          4  was by chance.  We didn't see any BH army soldiers.  We
          5  were going along a stream, a village of Vitinice, and
          6  we saw two soldiers digging trenches, Serb soldiers.
          7  We also came across soldiers in the woods, but we were
          8  lucky that he didn't kill us.
          9            I was all covered in blood, dirty.  It was
         10  raining.  I was cold.  The man with me carried me,
         11  encouraging me, and if we hadn't crossed into that
         12  territory that day, I think I wouldn't have been able
         13  to go forward; I would have been left behind.
         14            We heard a male and female voice talking.  We
         15  didn't know where we were, whether we had crossed the
         16  lines, whether we had entered the BH-army-controlled
         17  territory.  But they were talking about Srebrenica.  I
         18  can't remember what.  I just heard, "Allah will pay
         19  them for this."  They were talking about killings, and
         20  from that we concluded that they were Muslims.
         21       Q.   Witness, if you could just briefly look at
         22  three photographs.  I don't have exhibit numbers on
         23  mine, but these are three photographs that were taken
         24  when you reached --
         25            MR. CAYLEY:  What are the exhibit numbers of

          1  these, Mr. Registrar?
          2            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Exhibit 123,
          3  124, and 125.
          4            MR. CAYLEY:  If you could place these in
          5  front of the witness.  They're not to go on the ELMO,
          6  because they'll identify him.
          7       Q.   Witness, could you just confirm that these
          8  were photographs that were taken of your torso, left
          9  arm, on left foot after you arrived in
         10  Bosnian-controlled territory?  You can just answer yes
         11  or no.
         12       A.   Yes.  Yes, they are.  Yes, they are.  They
         13  are the wounds on my body.  And I assume it was
         14  fragmentation bullets, because I have pieces of metal
         15  in my foot and in my arm and in my right side, but I
         16  can't say for certain.
         17       Q.   Witness, thank you very much indeed.
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no further
         19  questions for the witness.  I can now offer him for
         20  cross-examination.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         22  Mr. Cayley.
         23            Witness, you must be tired, but we have to
         24  come to the end of your testimony, so now you're going
         25  to answer questions which Mr. Visnjic, I see, Defence
          1  attorney, is going to put to you.
          2            Mr. Visnjic, you have the floor.
          3            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          4  Mr. President.
          5                 Cross-examined by Mr. Visnjic:
          6       Q.   Witness O, I should like to go back to the
          7  beginning of your testimony.  You described at one
          8  point the uniform of the men to whom you surrendered
          9  when you left the woods.  You recognised two basic
         10  types of uniforms.  My question is the following:  Did
         11  you notice any particular insignia on those uniforms of
         12  units or anything like that, anything written on them,
         13  any ribbons or the like?
         14       A.   No, I cannot say that I noticed any emblems
         15  or insignia.  No, I can't say that.  I really can't say
         16  what they looked like.
         17       Q.   My second question has to do with the same
         18  time frame.  In your examination-in-chief you described
         19  a combat vehicle of the army of the Bosnian Serbs with
         20  the words "queen of death" written on it.
         21            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could we show
         22  the witness Exhibit 95, with the help of the usher,
         23  please.
         24       Q.   On this photograph that you see, in the
         25  left-hand corner, do you recognise that vehicle, or was

          1  the vehicle you saw similar to this one?
          2       A.   I don't recognise the vehicle, but it was
          3  similar.  I said that on the tank, which was
          4  greyish/greenish, plain colour, and the words "the
          5  queen of death" were written on it.  But a vehicle next
          6  to it was of this type, with wheels.  I don't know what
          7  it had on it, whether it was machine-guns.  Perhaps a
          8  machine-gun or so, but I cannot remember these
          9  barrels.  There may have been another vehicle.  I know
         10  there was one for sure of this type.
         11       Q.   If you don't mind, could you look closer at
         12  this photograph.  Can you see what is written on this
         13  vehicle, on the side?
         14       A.   Yes, I do see it.  It says "queen of death."
         15       Q.   Could you just tell Their Honours what colour
         16  is this vehicle, the main colour that this vehicle is
         17  painted in?
         18       A.   The main colour?  You see white spots on it.
         19  I think it is camouflage colour.  It's not plain.
         20       Q.   Doesn't it look blue?
         21       A.   No, I don't think so.
         22       Q.   Thank you.  Now let us go to the event in the
         23  meadow next to Sandici.  During your
         24  examination-in-chief you said that one of the soldiers
         25  with a bandanna said that they were from Serbia.

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Apart from saying that, could you conclude on
          3  any other basis that he came from Serbia?  Did he use a
          4  different accent or did he have any other insignia or
          5  something characteristic?
          6       A.   I don't know whether he had any insignia.  I
          7  can't say that he was from Serbia, though that is what
          8  he said.  I don't know whether he had another accent.
          9  I don't know anyone from Serbia, so I don't recognise
         10  the accent.
         11       Q.   My next question:  Could you tell us whether
         12  the soldiers that were taking you from Bratunac to the
         13  school, and the guards in the school, and the soldiers
         14  who executed the people, were they members of the same
         15  unit?  Had you seen any one of them in several spots or
         16  did they come from different units?
         17       A.   I don't know whether they were from the same
         18  unit.  I didn't notice the same men.  They may have
         19  been.  But I wasn't really interested.  I didn't look
         20  much, and I can't confirm that, but they wore similar
         21  uniforms.
         22       Q.   Thank you.
         23            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         24  I have no further questions of this witness.  Thank
         25  you.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          2  very much, Mr. Visnjic.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I don't have any
          4  further questions in re-examination for the witness.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          6  very much, Mr. Cayley.
          7            Judge Riad.
          8            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          9  Mr. President.  I have one question, I think.
         10                 Questioned by the Court:
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Good afternoon, Witness O.  You
         12  must be tired by now.
         13       A.   Good afternoon.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  The same question which the
         15  Defence counsel asked you.  You heard the soldiers
         16  saying, "You are from Serbia."  Were they introducing
         17  each other to each other, saying -- one would say, "I'm
         18  from Serbia," the other would say, "I'm from Sarajevo,"
         19  the third one would call him whatever?  Did you notice
         20  this, or what was it exactly?  Why was he saying, "I'm
         21  from Serbia," if you were listening?
         22       A.   He wasn't saying, "I am from Serbia."  He
         23  said, as far as I heard, at least, "We are from
         24  Serbia."  I don't know whether he repeated that several
         25  times.  And I also don't know whether other people

          1  said, "I'm from Sarajevo, I'm from Bratunac," or
          2  something like that.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  He said "we," not "I."  He said,
          4  "We are from Serbia"?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  And that's all you know about
          7  it.
          8            The second thing, which is -- I don't want to
          9  disturb you with this memory, but when the shooting
         10  started, did you lie down before the shooting started?
         11  Because you said, "We lay down and then the shooting
         12  started."  Did they order you to lie down and then they
         13  shot you lying down, or you fell down because of the
         14  shooting?
         15       A.   Maybe it wasn't interpreted correctly.  I
         16  didn't fall.  When they said we should lie down, as I
         17  moved forward, the shooting started.  I didn't throw
         18  myself to the ground not to be killed, because there
         19  was hardly any chance for me to survive.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  So just to see -- to be able to
         21  visualise it.  The order came that you should lie down
         22  first, and then shooting started; is that right?
         23       A.   Yes, yes.  To lie forward.  To fall forward.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  And then they shoot after you
         25  lie down?

          1       A.   No.  While we were falling down, lying down.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  I see it was at the same time;
          3  lying down and shooting were at the same time?  I just
          4  want to understand.
          5       A.   This was a matter of seconds.  This happened
          6  simultaneously.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  And this perhaps allowed some
          8  people not to survive; is that so?  You lay down and
          9  somebody fell on you?
         10       A.   No.  No one fell over me, no.  I don't know
         11  whether anyone even touched me.  Maybe the man next to
         12  me, but I didn't feel him, so I don't know whether he
         13  touched me.  I don't know whether I hit myself when I
         14  fell.  I don't know whether I was conscious.  I know
         15  that while I was lying there, I was in pain.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Because you got a bullet, as you
         17  said.  Was it a machine-gun or was it individual
         18  shooting on each one, if you remember?
         19       A.   Those were seconds, so I really can't
         20  remember.  But they certainly weren't single bullet
         21  shots.  This was the moment of dying, so I don't know
         22  if anyone could remember.  These are terrible moments.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  Well, I'm glad you don't
         24  remember it.  Thank you very much.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness, I

          1  should just like to clarify a minor point.  When you
          2  were in the meadow a soldier told you, "You won't have
          3  dinner tonight," and you said that this was ironic.
          4  What did you mean?
          5       A.   Surely it's ironic.  If we were beaten,
          6  placed into hangars and onto trucks, it would be
          7  strange if they had given us dinner.  One of the
          8  soldiers said that we would be having no dinner.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you
         10  didn't establish a connection between not having dinner
         11  and going to be killed?
         12       A.   You see, at that point in time I still didn't
         13  believe I would be killed, not then.  I wouldn't have
         14  gone there if I had known that I would have been
         15  killed, because, after all, there were a lot of
         16  people.  They could kill one man, two, or ten, but they
         17  can't kill thousands.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In any
         19  event, Witness, did you have the impression that the
         20  soldiers who were there and who said that knew already
         21  what could or would happen to you?
         22       A.   I don't know whether all of them knew, but I
         23  have a feeling that some of them knew, maybe the
         24  majority.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.

          1  We'll stop there.
          2            Witness O, you have answered questions by the
          3  Prosecution, by the Defence, by the Judges.  Is there
          4  anything else that you would like to say and that you
          5  have not had a chance to say?
          6       A.   From all of whatever I have said and what I
          7  saw, I could come to the conclusion that this was
          8  extremely well organised.  It was systematic killing.
          9  And that the organisers of that do not deserve to be at
         10  liberty.  And if I had the right and courage, in the
         11  name of all those innocents and all those victims, I
         12  would forgive the actual perpetrators of the
         13  executions, because they were misled.  That's all.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         15  Witness.  You have finished your testimony.  You have
         16  many years before you to live, and irrespective of the
         17  people responsible for these acts and the ethnic origin
         18  of those people, such acts may not be repeated.  And I
         19  think that you share that feeling, that such things may
         20  not be done to human beings.  You have a whole life
         21  before you to say that, and not only to say it, but to
         22  live along those lines.  And I think you have good
         23  reason to live, even though there were moments when you
         24  wanted to die.  But there are very strong and very good
         25  reasons for you to make the best of this life, to tell

          1  the world and tell people that we must not accept a
          2  repetition of such acts.
          3            Witness O, don't move.  We just have a few
          4  points to deal with with the parties.  I think there
          5  are several exhibits on the part of the Prosecutor.
          6            Mr. Cayley?
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.
          8  If I could apply for admission formally into evidence
          9  of Prosecutor's Exhibit 123, 124, 125, and 126.  123,
         10  124, and 125 are the three photographs of the witness's
         11  injuries, and 126 is the photographic copy of a
         12  photograph of the Dam on which the witness indicated
         13  the area of the Dam that was covered in bodies that he
         14  saw.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley,
         16  I think there is another exhibit, 124, which has to be
         17  under seal, I think.  I'm asking you this because of
         18  the identity of the witness, the three photos of the
         19  witness.  The three should be tendered under seal?
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  You're quite right,
         21  Mr. President.  Certainly one of the photographs
         22  identifies him by his image, so I think it would be
         23  safest if all three are placed under the seal of the
         24  Court.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]

          1  Mr. Visnjic, have you any objections?
          2            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] No,
          3  Mr. President.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You have no
          5  exhibits, I think.  You used those that have already
          6  been tendered, I think.
          7            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Yes, that is
          8  correct, Mr. President.  We used the exhibits of the
          9  Prosecutor.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         11  case, for reasons of caution, I think it would be
         12  better to admit under seal Exhibits 124 and 125,
         13  Mr. Cayley.  Otherwise there may be a risk of
         14  identification, even in the case of Exhibit 125.
         15            So these exhibits will be admitted, 124 and
         16  125, under seal, Mr. Dubuisson.  You have taken note of
         17  that?
         18            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes,
         19  Mr. President.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] There we
         21  are.  We have finished for today.
         22            Witness O, stay seated for a few more
         23  minutes, in the interests of your protection, and we
         24  will resume work tomorrow at 9.30 to try and hear the
         25  two remaining witnesses, to try and avoid them waiting

          1  or having to come back again.  Thank you very much for
          2  your cooperation and your work, and we'll meet again
          3  tomorrow at 9.30.  And there is a possibility of
          4  continuing tomorrow until 3, as I have said.
          5                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
          6                 at 2.40 p.m., to be reconvened on
          7                 Friday, the 14th day of April, 2000, at
