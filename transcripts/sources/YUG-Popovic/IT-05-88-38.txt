          2                 [Open session]
          3                 --- Upon commencing at 9.40 a.m.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning, ladies and
          5  gentlemen in the courtroom and in the visitor's
          6  gallery.
          7                 [The accused entered court]
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  I apologise again today for this
          9  ten-minute delay.  There are more urgent matters which
         10  have to be settled as soon as we come to the Tribunal.
         11            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Good morning, Judge Riad.  Good
         13  morning, colleagues.
         14            This morning, Mr. President, and all day
         15  today, we will not present any live witnesses.  We had
         16  scheduled a witness for today but because of problems
         17  in respect of passport and securing a passport, the
         18  witness was not able to arrive in time for her
         19  testimony.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Is she arriving in the near
         21  future?
         22            MR. HARMON:  She's now arriving today as
         23  opposed to her scheduled time of arrival which was two
         24  days ago.
         25            So in lieu of that, the Prosecutor proposes

          1  to present video testimony film of testimony that had
          2  been given in 1996 at the Rule 61 hearing involving
          3  Karadzic and Mladic.  I have discussed this with my
          4  colleagues from the Defence long before today, and they
          5  have agreed that in lieu of calling the witnesses who
          6  will be shown on the videotape, they would accept the
          7  transcribed testimony and the video testimony of these
          8  same witnesses.
          9            So today we'll be presenting the testimonies
         10  of Colonel Karremans, Lieutenant Koster, and a
         11  gentleman from Bosnia named Pasaga Mesic.  We will play
         12  those videotapes from the previous Rule 61 hearing and
         13  then we'll seek to admit those tapes into evidence.
         14            During the course of the presentation today,
         15  I'm going to ask my colleague, Mr. McCloskey, to remain
         16  in the courtroom as the Prosecutor's representative,
         17  and with the Court's permission I will excuse myself
         18  and return at the end of the day.
         19            So that is the agenda we have proposed for
         20  today.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  But you're on the tape too.
         22            MR. HARMON:  I am on the tapes, yes.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  So we'll have you with us.
         24            Is Defence counsel agreeable?
         25            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,

          1  Mr. President, dear colleagues.
          2            The Defence agrees to the proposal made by
          3  the Prosecution so we concur that the video cassettes
          4  be viewed and admitted into the file.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much,
          6  Mr. Petrusic.
          7            Mr. Fourmy.
          8                 [Trial Chamber and legal officer
          9                 confer]
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Fourmy is asking whether
         11  Colonel Karremans had been here before us in this
         12  trial.  I don't recall that.
         13            MR. HARMON:  He has not been in this trial.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  I know he has not been here.
         15            MR. HARMON:  He has not.  As I said
         16  previously, I discussed this matter with the Defence
         17  and they agree that the testimony that he had given
         18  under oath previously would be --
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Is he coming?  Would he be
         20  coming?
         21            MR. HARMON:  He will not be.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.
         23            MR. HARMON:  The tape will substitute for his
         24  live testimony.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  That answers Mr. Fourmy's
          1  question, perhaps.  [Interpretation] Your
          2  preoccupations have been satisfied, Mr. Fourmy.
          3            [In English] You can proceed, please,
          4  Mr. Harmon.
          5            MR. HARMON:  Thank you very much, Judge
          6  Riad.
          7            If we could put the first video, the
          8  testimony of Colonel Karremans, on the screen.  If I
          9  may be excused, Judge Riad.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  How long do you think it will
         11  take?
         12            MR. HARMON:  The video of Colonel Karremans
         13  is two hours and, I believe, twenty minutes; the video
         14  of Lieutenant Koster is 59 minutes; and the videotape
         15  of Mr. Mesic is 29 minutes.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  So we can have the break after
         17  Karremans.
         18            MR. HARMON:  We, perhaps, may want to have a
         19  break in between Karremans given the fact that it's two
         20  hours and twenty minutes.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  We'll see to that.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Thank you.
         23                 [Videotape of 3 July 1996 played]
         24                 [Court reporter's note:  Transcription
         25                 of videotape is as follows:]

          1            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Prosecutor, the
          2  Tribunal accepts that evidence, all the documents, and
          3  accepts that a photograph of the map, according to the
          4  technical facilities that we have, will be added.
          5            We have now Colonel Karremans before us.  We
          6  have to give him some headsets.  Can you hear me, sir?
          7  Can you read the statement which you have in your
          8  hand?
          9            Can you please give Colonel Karremans some
         10  headsets.  I think that you must give the headsets each
         11  time and that the usher should be told of that.
         12            Please read the statement that you have in
         13  your hand.
         14            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         15  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         16  truth.
         17                 WITNESS:  THOMAS KARREMANS.
         18            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         19  Colonel.  Please be seated.
         20            Can you hear me, Colonel?  Can you hear me?
         21            THE WITNESS:  Yes, Your Honour, I can.
         22            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Colonel
         23  Karremans, the Tribunal, dealing with Mr. Karadzic and
         24  Mladic, wanted to call upon you here so that we can see
         25  what you have to say in light of the indictment.  I

          1  think it is the Office of the Prosecutor who will
          2  introduce you.
          3            You have the floor.
          4            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Your Honour.
          5                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          6       Q.   Colonel Karremans, could you please state
          7  your full name and spell your name for the record.
          8       A.   My last name is Karremans.  I will spell
          9  that.  K-a-r-r-e-m-a-n-s, Karremans.  My first name is
         10  Thomas, T-h-o-m-a-s, and middle name, Jacob.
         11       Q.   Colonel Karremans, what is your occupation?
         12       A.   My occupation now is that I am taking over an
         13  assignment in the United States.
         14       Q.   Are you a member of the Dutch military?
         15       A.   I'm a member of the Dutch military.
         16       Q.   Did you participate in UN peacekeeping
         17  operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina?
         18       A.   Yes, I did, sir.
         19       Q.   Where were you assigned in Bosnia and
         20  Herzegovina?
         21       A.   I was assigned in Bosnia-Herzegovina last
         22  year, from January up to July in Srebrenica.
         23       Q.   What were your duties and responsibilities in
         24  that particular assignment?
         25       A.   My mission was -- I was the battalion

          1  commander of DutchBat in the safe area of Srebrenica.
          2       Q.   What was the UN mandate that you received in
          3  relation to your assignments?
          4       A.   The UN mandate especially for the safe havens
          5  or safe areas like Srebrenica was based on one of the
          6  United Nations resolutions.  I can remember 819.  After
          7  there was a ceasefire agreement between General
          8  Morillon and General Mladic in 1993, after that
          9  agreement, the Canadians went in in the safe area and
         10  we took over the year after that, in 1994.  My
         11  assignment there was commander of the Dutch Battalion.
         12       Q.   Colonel Karremans, did the Bosnian Serb army
         13  interfere or obstruct with your unit's ability to
         14  perform its mandate after you had arrived in
         15  Srebrenica?
         16       A.   I think not at the time that we arrived but
         17  they did during our stay in the enclave during, let's
         18  say, the last five months, as of half February.
         19       Q.   Can you expand on that, please.
         20       A.   I can expand on that but then I have first,
         21  let's say, to explain what the mission was of the
         22  battalion.
         23       Q.   Please.
         24       A.   That was twofold; one was the purely military
         25  side of the mission and the other side was the

          1  humanitarian one.  The military was to look to the
          2  ceasefire agreement between both warring factions, of
          3  both parties, to assist the civil authorities in the
          4  opstina of Srebrenica, to maintain negotiations between
          5  the BSA and the BiH, and of course trying to reject the
          6  BSA from attacking the enclave.
          7            On the other hand, the humanitarian side of
          8  the mission was to support the refugees within the
          9  enclave as much as possible by medical, by food, by,
         10  let's say, the infrastructure within the enclave, to
         11  enhance that, and that was, let's say, the second part
         12  of the mission of the battalion.
         13            When we took over in January 1995, from,
         14  let's say, the second battalion, we were the third
         15  there, we had no problems, let's say, during the
         16  rotation.  We had no problems in the beginning with the
         17  BSA.  There were some problems with the BiH, the
         18  Bosnian forces, in the enclave.
         19       Q.   What problems developed with the Bosnian Serb
         20  military?  Could you describe those, please.
         21       A.   Those problems started actually on the 18th
         22  of February when the last convoy came in with diesel,
         23  gas, which we needed for the performance of the
         24  mission.  I can a little bit expand on that.  Normally
         25  we used 4.000 to 5.000 litres a day for our vehicles

          1  for patrolling, for resupply of the observation posts,
          2  et cetera.  As of the 18th of February, the last diesel
          3  convoy came in and that meant that we had to reorganise
          4  our mission, our work, because you don't -- you need
          5  that amount of fuel for doing a mission.
          6            At the end, during February, March, April, up
          7  to July, the amount of diesel we had became less and
          8  less and that meant that at the end we did all our
          9  patrolling, and this is just one example, by foot.  We
         10  were not able to resupply our observation posts, we
         11  were not able to do the patrolling by cars or combat
         12  vehicles, and that meant we had to do all the
         13  patrolling by foot, with all the possible problems of
         14  the mining around and within the enclave.  That was the
         15  example of diesel.
         16            At the end of April the real convoy terror,
         17  as we called it in those days, started because as of
         18  the 26th of April no convoy came in at all, and that
         19  meant no personnel which was on leave in the
         20  Netherlands came back.  They were stuck in Zagreb and
         21  they never returned.  Under those persons, the military
         22  from our battalion, about 180 at the end were stuck up
         23  in Zagreb.  There were some quite important persons,
         24  for instance, my ops officer, a major, and most of the
         25  deputy company commanders, and some other persons

          1  working in my battalion staff.  That happened as of the
          2  end of April.
          3            That meant also that at the end of April, not
          4  allowing convoys coming in, that I had no resupply of
          5  medicines for the battalion but also for the
          6  population, the refugees within the enclave, no food
          7  supplies, no spare parts for my vehicles, the weaponry,
          8  no engineer equipment to assist the opstina and the
          9  people living in the opstina for repairs of
         10  infrastructure, and no equipment to test my ammunition
         11  vehicles.  That happened, let's say, until the last day
         12  I was there.
         13       Q.   What effect did this have on the civilian --
         14  did the Bosnian Serb blockade have on the civilian
         15  population within the enclave?
         16       A.   Yes, sir, it did, because almost, let's say,
         17  25.000 persons living in the enclave were refugees, as
         18  there used to live about 8.000 in the village of
         19  Srebrenica.  So you can imagine that the civil
         20  authorities had a mighty challenge to bring under all
         21  those refugees in a city with an infrastructure for
         22  only 8.000 persons.  But also the food for all the
         23  people living in the enclave was a problem because the
         24  UNHCR was responsible, or at least was -- they were
         25  responsible for bringing in the food.  Also the UNHCR

          1  had the same problems with getting in their food for
          2  the inhabitants of the enclave.
          3       Q.   Now, were complaints made to the Bosnian Serb
          4  authorities about the blockade and its effects?
          5       A.   Yes, we did, sir.  Every day, at 6.00 in the
          6  night, we sent our information, daily sitreps, to the
          7  higher echelons, and that started in sector north-east
          8  in Tuzla, going up to Sarajevo, the BH command, up to
          9  the force commander in Zagreb.  They were aware of,
         10  let's say, the problems within the enclave; on one side
         11  with the battalion and on the other side with the
         12  population.  We noticed that and we put all the
         13  information, let's say, on a daily basis to the higher
         14  echelons.
         15            On top of that, I have written a lot of
         16  reports during my stay over there, let's say once in
         17  two days, in describing the poor situation of the
         18  people over there.  Also after the meetings we had with
         19  the local authorities, they always mentioned what their
         20  problems were towards the people.  We mentioned that in
         21  our daily reports, and I mentioned that quite some
         22  times in my, let's say, own reports up to the force
         23  commander in Zagreb, and also to the Crisis Staff here
         24  in The Hague.
         25       Q.   Now, Colonel Karremans, did you have contacts

          1  with the Bosnian Serb military officials from Bratunac?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   In your contacts with those officials, did
          4  you complain to them about the effects of the blockade?
          5       A.   Yes.  Every time when we had a meeting with,
          6  let's say, representatives of the Bosnian Serb army --
          7  I think we will come to the persons later -- we made
          8  our complaints given by the civil authorities within
          9  the enclave, what happened with the population, not
         10  only in providing food for them but also on the medical
         11  side of the whole support for the people.  In the
         12  beginning we supported the population as much as we
         13  could, in combination with MSF, Medecins Sans
         14  Frontiers, by ambulances in the area, by giving them
         15  medicines, giving them medical care, picking up wounded
         16  persons or sick persons and bring them to the hospital
         17  in Srebrenica or, if that wasn't possible, to our own
         18  field dressing station.  That was, as of the end of
         19  April, also stopped.  The same applied for, let's say,
         20  the normal, daily living within the enclave.  All those
         21  complaints we told several times when we had meetings
         22  with representatives of the BSA to those
         23  representatives.
         24       Q.   What was their reaction, Colonel Karremans?
         25       A.   None.

          1       Q.   Can you identify some of the persons in the
          2  Bosnian Serb army with whom you had contact and with
          3  whom you liaised on?
          4       A.   Yes, I can, sir.  In the first place, and I
          5  met him in the first week when I arrived in Bosnia, in
          6  Srebrenica, I met Colonel Vukovic.  He was the
          7  so-called liaison officer between the battalion and the
          8  Drina Corps commander or the Drina Corps.  He was also
          9  the commander of one of the brigades, the brigade in
         10  the southern part of the surroundings of Srebrenica.
         11            The second BSA representative which we met
         12  quite often was Major Nikolic.  He was the liaison
         13  officer from the Bratunac Brigade, and the Bratunac
         14  Brigade was the brigade in the northern area, outside
         15  the enclave.  He was the representative of that brigade
         16  and he was also the LSO which we dealt often with.
         17            Those two persons, we met during not daily
         18  meetings but sometimes a couple of times a week,
         19  sometimes even once a month, when they liked to have a
         20  meeting and not when we liked to have a meeting.
         21            A third person I know is Petar.  Petar is an
         22  interpreter who both of the just named officers used
         23  all the time.
         24       Q.   Colonel Karremans, during your contacts with
         25  Major Nikolic, did he ever express an opinion to you

          1  about his attitude toward the Bosnian Muslim population
          2  of Srebrenica?
          3       A.   Yes, sir, he did.  Actually, that was in one
          4  of the meetings, from what I can remember, in
          5  February.  We had always our meetings either on OP
          6  Echo, that's an observation post in the southern part
          7  of the enclave, or OP Papa in the northern part.  This
          8  was on one of the occasions which I can remember in
          9  February in which he told me, you could see it on his
         10  face too, that the hatred of the Muslim people,
         11  especially those who were living in the enclave, and he
         12  said he had a reason for that because half of his
         13  family had been murdered during the Second World War.
         14            Secondly, he told me that, in his opinion,
         15  all the Muslims should leave Bosnia-Herzegovina.
         16            Thirdly, I think looking in those days, at
         17  that moment to his face, that he meant that, and that
         18  there was quite some hatred in his eyes, and also in
         19  the words, I must say.
         20       Q.   Colonel Karremans, you mentioned that a
         21  number of Dutch soldiers were stationed inside the
         22  enclave of Srebrenica.  Let me show you an exhibit
         23  which is a map of the enclave.  It will be presented to
         24  you and then I would like to ask you some questions
         25  about it.

          1            MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, we have copies as
          2  well for Your Honours which I'd ask the usher to please
          3  take up to the bench.
          4       Q.   Colonel Karremans, there should be a monitor
          5  in front of you that -- there should be that particular
          6  exhibit appearing in front of you on the monitor.
          7            Can you please point to the map and identify
          8  the locations where Dutch soldiers were stationed
          9  within the enclave.
         10       A.   Yes, sir, I can.  If, Your Honours, you look
         11  to the map, you can see a dotted line in there, with a
         12  "C" on top and a "B," Bravo, in the south.  What we
         13  did when we took that over from the previous battalion
         14  was that we divided the area in two parts; the northern
         15  area was the responsibility of our C Company and the
         16  southern part of the area was the responsibility of the
         17  B Coy, the Bravo Company.
         18            We started off in January with eight
         19  observation posts from which we could see a great part
         20  of the area.  In the beginning, in January and
         21  February, both companies had some observation posts.  I
         22  start with the one here on top, OP Papa, that was the
         23  observation post I just was referring to when we had
         24  our meetings with BSA representatives.  We have here OP
         25  Quebec and OP Romeo on the east side.  We have OP

          1  November on the north.  Those four, November, Papa,
          2  Quebec, and Romeo, belonged to the C Coy, including the
          3  Alpha observation post, so that means five observation
          4  posts when we started off.  In the southern part of the
          5  enclave, OP Charlie in the west, OP Echo here in the
          6  south, and OP Foxtrot also in the south.  That meant
          7  eight observation posts when I took it over.
          8            What I explained before, Your Honours, is due
          9  to the convoy terror, if I may say so, and lack of
         10  gasoline, diesel, we changed our mission, let's say,
         11  daily by daily, but especially our main mission,
         12  working from observation posts and patrolling between
         13  observation posts within the enclave to more
         14  observation posts and less patrolling by cars, and
         15  later on only patrolling by foot.  We decided to build
         16  more observation posts.  We did that in contact with
         17  the BiH forces inside the enclave and we also discussed
         18  that with the BSA representatives, and they all agreed
         19  to that except observation post Kilo over here, but I'd
         20  like to come to that one later on, if I may.
         21            During our stay there, we made OP Mike, OP
         22  Delta, and OP Hotel, that's the old one, and at the end
         23  of our stay, OP Hotel in the direct vicinity of the
         24  village of Srebrenica.
         25            There have been a lot of problems about OP

          1  Kilo, that was our last one, and Delta, because OP Kilo
          2  and Delta, we projected those observation posts on
          3  smuggle routes, if I may say so.  During our stay, and
          4  also during the stays of both previous battalions, we
          5  noticed that there was a lot of smuggling between the
          6  safe area of Srebrenica and the safe area of Zepa, and
          7  they used a couple of routes from the southern part of
          8  the enclave, in the southern direction to Zepa.  That's
          9  why we put Delta and Kilo on those routes.
         10            From the Bosnian military side, they had,
         11  let's say, quite some problems that we established
         12  those two observation posts.  At the end we did.
         13       Q.   Let me ask you, Colonel Karremans, how many
         14  soldiers were stationed in each of those observation
         15  posts?
         16       A.   We started in January with, let's say, ten
         17  soldiers per observation post.  But after the end of
         18  April, when the left convoys didn't return to
         19  Srebrenica, and we made more observation posts and we
         20  did less patrolling, or let's say it in another way,
         21  another kind of patrolling, we changed a little bit the
         22  manning of the observation posts and went to six in
         23  some cases and ten in other cases.  We had some
         24  observation posts with ten persons just for observation
         25  and doing the patrols and we had some observation posts

          1  with only six persons on it just for observation.  In
          2  total, at the end of our stay, on 12 observation posts
          3  I had about 90 to 100 soldiers working day by day on
          4  the posts.
          5       Q.   Colonel Karremans, had the Bosnian Serb
          6  blockade not taken place, what was the normal number of
          7  soldiers you would have had in Srebrenica?
          8       A.   The battalion consisted of 780 persons,
          9  soldiers; 180 were situated in the Tuzla area, one
         10  company, a large company, I must say, and I had 600
         11  soldiers, including 50 of the field dressing station,
         12  at my disposal within the enclave, 600.  But at the
         13  end, let's say in April, about 150 to 180 didn't
         14  return, so I had about 400, 420 soldiers at my disposal
         15  as of the end of April till the end of July.
         16       Q.   Of those 420 soldiers, how many of those
         17  soldiers were infantry men?
         18       A.   About half; 100 on the observation posts,
         19  about 100 for doing the patrols, special patrolling in
         20  the enclave along the borders of the enclave, for the
         21  guarding of both compounds in Srebrenica itself and in
         22  Potocari, and the other 200 soldiers were all for
         23  manning the three company staffs, the battalion staff,
         24  for all the logistics and the field dressing station.
         25       Q.   So by the time the invasion started in July,

          1  less than half of your available military personnel
          2  were infantry soldiers; is that correct?
          3       A.   That's correct, sir.
          4       Q.   Can you describe to the Court what type of
          5  weaponry was available to your troops at the time the
          6  invasion started?
          7       A.   Yes, I can.  Our government has chosen for a
          8  so-called light option and the weaponry we had in those
          9  days were small arms.  Every soldier had his own arm,
         10  either a pistol or a light machine-gun or a rifle.
         11  Then we had light machine-guns, guns on the observation
         12  posts and also on both compounds.  We had the heavy
         13  machine-guns on our armoured personnel carriers.
         14  Besides that we had six mortars, 81-millimetre.  They
         15  were on the observation posts, let's say on some of the
         16  observation posts.  I had at my disposal anti-tank
         17  weapons, medium range and long range, amongst them, for
         18  instance, the tow wide anti-tank systems, and some
         19  small anti-tank weapons as well.  I think that is what
         20  the main armament was of the battalion.
         21       Q.   Did the Bosnian Serb army blockade of
         22  Srebrenica that started in April have any effect on the
         23  amount of ammunition or the quality of weaponry that
         24  you had at your disposal?
         25       A.   Not really.  That had already happened when

          1  we entered -- let's say the first battalion entered the
          2  enclave, because we had to work -- I gave you that
          3  example with small arms, our personal arms, which we
          4  took over from the previous battalion and they took it
          5  over from the first battalion.  Those weapons, small
          6  arms, they were -- although they were maintained daily,
          7  they were used a lot.  The same applied for the
          8  anti-tank systems I had.  Every half a year, for
          9  instance, a tow rocket should be in a test bed.  You
         10  have to test it if it works well.  I didn't have that
         11  test equipment so I couldn't rely on my anti-tank
         12  weapons.
         13            Another thing is when the battalion came in,
         14  the first one, is that I had only 16 per cent of the
         15  ammunition I normally should have, and that ammunition
         16  was, after more than a year, in bad circumstances as
         17  well.
         18       Q.   Colonel Karremans, did General Mladic have
         19  good intelligence about what was happening in the
         20  enclave?
         21       A.   Yes, sir, he did.  In the first place he
         22  could notice, by all the troops that he had around the
         23  enclave, what was going on within the enclave.  He
         24  could say what we were doing, when we were patrolling,
         25  when we are leaving compounds with vehicles, or by

          1  patrols, when we were resupplying the observation
          2  posts.  He knew everything that we did internally.
          3            Secondly, he was well aware of our supplies
          4  in the battalion because he was the person, or let's
          5  say his staff were persons who refused, especially
          6  after the end of April, refused all our convoys.  And
          7  those convoys which came in, we used so-called loading
          8  papers on which you have to describe what you will have
          9  or receive.  So they know exactly what was on supply in
         10  the enclave for our battalion: food, medicines, spare
         11  parts, engineering equipment, et cetera.
         12            In the third place, he was well aware of what
         13  was going on in the enclave on both sides of the
         14  battalion and also on the population and civil
         15  authorities because -- and he mentioned that to me in
         16  one of the meetings that I had with him, that he was
         17  well aware of what was going on in the enclave every
         18  day, every minute, by persons he had posted in the
         19  enclave.
         20       Q.   Okay.  Now, when the Bosnian Serb invasion of
         21  the enclave started, did the Bosnian Serb army attack
         22  the outposts that you've described?
         23       A.   Can you repeat the question, please.
         24       Q.   When the invasion started in July 1995, did
         25  the BSA attack your observation posts?

          1       A.   That already started in June, the 3rd of
          2  June.  I'd like to recall or go back to the end of May
          3  when the air strikes were executed in the Pale area,
          4  with the result that I think over more than 300 UN
          5  soldiers were hijacked in those days.  After that the
          6  problems in the safe areas of Gorazde and Zepa, with
          7  all the British and Ukrainian observation posts, and
          8  that happened also in the beginning of June.
          9            On the 1st of June, I had to come to OP Echo,
         10  that is, just at the southern part of the enclave.
         11  There was a telephone call.  We had a land line between
         12  the observation post Echo and one of the posts or --
         13  yes, one of the posts of the BSA, and it was a land
         14  line which we could use for making telephone calls when
         15  we'd like to have a meeting with them or they'd like to
         16  have a meeting with us.  I used the telephone and I got
         17  the interpreter on the other end, Petar, I referred to
         18  him, and he, in the name of Vukovic, asked me to
         19  consider leaving OP Echo.  I asked him for a reason
         20  which he didn't give me, and that was it.  I stated
         21  that I won't leave OP Echo at all.
         22            Two days later, and that was on the 3rd of
         23  June, in the early morning, I think it was about 9.00,
         24  all of a sudden, after a warning of a couple of
         25  minutes, the BSA attacked OP Echo with about 60

          1  soldiers heavily armed with mortars, hand grenades,
          2  with anti-tank weapons, and the manning of the
          3  observation post were ordered, under fire, to leave OP
          4  Echo.  They happily succeeded in that without leaving
          5  persons behind, but they left behind a lot of
          6  equipment.  What they took with them was the vehicles,
          7  the communications systems, some personal stuff, and
          8  weaponry.  The rest was left on OP Echo.  That was the
          9  first observation post we lost in the beginning of
         10  June.
         11       Q.   Colonel Karremans, how many Dutch soldiers
         12  were manning OP Echo at the time of the attack?
         13       A.   In those days?
         14       Q.   At the time of the attack.
         15       A.   I think ten persons, ten soldiers.
         16       Q.   Please continue describing the attacks on the
         17  observation posts.
         18       A.   After that attack, executed, what I stated
         19  before, by about 60 persons, leaving with the APC the
         20  OP Echo, we did two things, actually three:  In the
         21  first place, we made an immediate report for the higher
         22  echelons what happened, what was going on.  Secondly,
         23  we asked for a meeting with Colonel Vukovic or Nikolic
         24  to ask them what was going on, the purpose of that
         25  attack, that we'd like to have back the observation

          1  post and that we'd like to have back the equipment left
          2  behind on that observation post.  The second thing that
          3  we did immediately after losing that observation post
          4  was establishing OP Sierra and OP Uniform, that is to
          5  say, 200, 300 metres north of OP Echo.  That gave a
          6  remarkable reaction on the BSA because they, I think,
          7  didn't expect that reaction.  So also we lost OP Echo.
          8  We had two observation posts nearby.
          9       Q.   What was the reaction of your Bosnian Serb
         10  liaison officer when you asked for the observation post
         11  back and for your equipment back?
         12       A.   It took quite a while when we had a first
         13  meeting after the loss of OP Echo.  I cannot remember
         14  when we had the first meeting after, let's say, the 3rd
         15  of June.  But the reaction was that we couldn't get
         16  back the equipment and we couldn't get back the
         17  observation post at all.
         18       Q.   Were there additional attacks on the
         19  observation posts prior to or during the invasion of
         20  Srebrenica?
         21       A.   No, sir.
         22       Q.   Okay.  As a result of the attacks on the
         23  observation posts, were Dutch soldiers taken prisoners
         24  by the Bosnian Serb army?
         25       A.   Not on that occasion.

          1       Q.   Okay.  Can you tell us on which occasions
          2  they were taken prisoners?
          3       A.   Yes, I can.  That happened, Your Honours, on
          4  the start of -- let's say on the 6th of July, and that
          5  was already a month later.  In the period between the
          6  3rd of June, OP Echo, and the 6th of July, it was
          7  rather quiet in the area.  Also there was a tense
          8  situation, I must say, but it was really quiet, except
          9  one occasion somewhere in the middle of June, what
         10  happened in the vicinity of Srebrenica itself.
         11            On the 6th of July, in the morning, about
         12  3.00, the war started over there.  It started in our
         13  area, the compound of Potocari, by shooting over the
         14  compound with some rockets.  The attacks started in the
         15  southern part of the enclave, in the area of OP
         16  Foxtrot.  That was on the Thursday, Thursday, the 6th
         17  of July, and those attacks were carried out, let's say,
         18  during six days.
         19            The first OP which had been attacked really
         20  by small arms, by mortars, and by tanks was OP Foxtrot;
         21  that one on Thursday, on Friday, and on Saturday.  And
         22  it was on Saturday, I think by noonish or 1.00, that I
         23  ordered to retreat the manning of the OP and leave it
         24  during a pause of shootings.
         25       Q.   How many men were stationed in OP Foxtrot?

          1       A.   Just a moment.  Seven men.  Seven.
          2       Q.   Thank you.  Please continue, Colonel
          3  Karremans.
          4       A.   On Saturday, in the afternoon, when OP
          5  Foxtrot had been attacked for a third day, and I asked,
          6  I can remember, for a second time for close air
          7  support, things were going on rather quickly, because
          8  on Saturday and Sunday I lost quite some observation
          9  posts in the southern part of the enclave here.
         10            There were two possibilities for the soldiers
         11  on the observation posts -- actually, there were three
         12  possibilities:  Just leave the observation post and go
         13  back to the compound; secondly, stay as long as they
         14  could, making use of defence walls, making use of the
         15  shelters within the observation post; thirdly, retreat
         16  from the observation post knowing that the BiH should
         17  make problems because they, not ordered us, but they
         18  thought that we should stay on the observation post and
         19  not retreat it or not leave them.  There was another
         20  possibility: just to end up, let's say, taken away by
         21  BSA forces.  In most of the cases, leaving the
         22  observation post, the last thing happened.  The
         23  observation posts were attacked by BSA forces, they
         24  were encircled by forces, and the only thing soldiers
         25  could do is hand over equipment, use their vehicles,

          1  and they were sent, let's say, to Simici, or later on
          2  to Bratunac.
          3       Q.   As a result of those actions by the BSA
          4  against the observation post, how many Dutch soldiers
          5  were taken into custody by the BSA and detained?
          6       A.   At the end there were 55 soldiers taken in
          7  custody and detained from seven or eight different
          8  observation posts.
          9       Q.   Now, those 55 soldiers were all infantry
         10  soldiers; is that correct?
         11       A.   Yes, sir, they were all infantry soldiers.
         12       Q.   If my mathematics are correct, that
         13  represented about 25 per cent of your infantrymen
         14  available in the compound at the time of the invasion?
         15       A.   That's correct.
         16       Q.   Okay.  Now, do you know how many Bosnian Serb
         17  army soldiers participated in the invasion of
         18  Srebrenica?
         19       A.   Not at the moment.
         20       Q.   Did you subsequently find out?
         21       A.   Yes, because Mladic told me, General Mladic
         22  told me, at the end that he had quite some troops
         23  around the enclave of Srebrenica.  Those were not the
         24  original troops around the enclave but, let's say,
         25  fresh troops, fresh brigades.  He used one brigade for

          1  the attack in the southern -- from the southern
          2  direction, from south to north; he had another brigade
          3  from east to the west; and he had one brigade in
          4  reserve north of Bratunac.  Bratunac is the city
          5  somewhere over here.  Actually, what he told me, he had
          6  three brigades or brigade-sized units of which he used
          7  two.
          8       Q.   How many men are in a brigade?
          9       A.   I don't know, but I think that in every
         10  brigade there were between 1.000 and 1.500 soldiers
         11  with this heavy weaponry and other weaponry than we had
         12  in those days.
         13       Q.   Now I want to ask you specifically that
         14  question:  Colonel Karremans, what type of weapons were
         15  available to the invading Bosnian Serb forces?
         16       A.   They had all the equipment from the former
         17  Yugoslavian army, at least that was left out of it.
         18  They had quite some artillery pieces.  We had noticed
         19  those pieces already around the enclave during our stay
         20  over there.  Sometimes they changed the position of
         21  those artillery pieces; sometimes they changed the
         22  positions of mortars they had, heavy mortars, light
         23  mortars.  Quite a lot, I must say.
         24            They had some main bell tanks, the old T-55s,
         25  and even some new types which we had noticed and which

          1  they had used; some anti-aircraft vehicles which they
          2  didn't use for anti-aircraft but for the attacks on the
          3  villages in the southern part of the enclave, I mean,
          4  in direct line, and a lot of anti-tank weapons.
          5       Q.   Did they also have multiple rocket systems?
          6       A.   They had a couple of multiple rocket systems,
          7  small ones, all on wheels, of which we had noticed at
          8  least three north of the compound of Potocari, around
          9  the hills.  And he had, let's say, a larger multiple
         10  rocket system in the city of Bratunac which he used as
         11  well, shelling the city of Srebrenica.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, I am looking at the
         13  clock.  Perhaps this is an appropriate time to recess
         14  for the day.
         15            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] I share your
         16  view.  This is a good moment to have a recess.  We will
         17  stop the hearing for today, and the Tribunal will
         18  resume tomorrow at 10.00.

         22                 of videotape is as follows:]
         23            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] First
         24  question:  Can everyone hear me?  Mr. Harmon, can you
         25  hear me?  Can you hear me, counsel for the

          1  Prosecution?
          2            MR. HARMON:  Yes.
          3            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Great.  Can the
          4  registry hear me?  Interpreters can hear me?  Everybody
          5  can hear what's going on?  The visitors' gallery,
          6  everyone can hear all right?  No technical problem.
          7  Fellow Judges hear me?  Terrific.
          8            Now, Mr. Harmon, we can proceed with Colonel
          9  Karremans' testimony, and I would ask the usher to
         10  bring him in.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Your Honour.
         12                 [The witness entered court]
         13            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Colonel
         14  Karremans, good morning.  You can hear me?
         15            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can, Your Honour.
         16            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Fine.  So we
         17  shall resume with your testimony.  You've been called
         18  by the Prosecution in the case of the Prosecution
         19  against Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
         20            Please proceed.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Your Honour.
         22                 WITNESS:  THOMAS KARREMANS [Resumed]
         23                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:  [Cont'd]
         24       Q.   Colonel Karremans, yesterday you described
         25  the Bosnian Serb army blockade that slowly strangled

          1  the enclave as a convoy of terror.  What effect did
          2  this have on the occupants of the enclave?
          3       A.   I'd like to stipulate some things which I
          4  have said yesterday concerning the circumstances, I
          5  must say, the miserable circumstances for the
          6  inhabitants of the enclave, but also for my own
          7  battalion.  That could explain something on the
          8  circumstances up to the 6th of July.
          9            All those, let's say, miserable circumstances
         10  in April, May, and June were caused, what I said
         11  yesterday, by refusing the incoming convoys either for
         12  the battalion or by UNHCR for the refugees.  Thus, we
         13  had to do with a strangulation of the enclave or, so to
         14  call, an isolation, a total blockade.
         15            That meant for the population, for instance,
         16  that their situation was poorer than poor.  There was
         17  starvation for the refugees.  Some died by starvation.
         18  There was no medical treatment at all for the
         19  population; no doctors, no dentists, no medicines.  The
         20  Medecins Sans Frontiers, MSF, was not able to fulfil
         21  its job in the local hospital.  We couldn't do anything
         22  about the infrastructure to support the local
         23  authorities, like housing, like generators, power and
         24  electricity, water supply for the population.
         25            It ended up, for instance, that hundreds of

          1  inhabitants of the enclave lived literally on the
          2  garbage collection point.  There was no travel allowed
          3  both for the population and for the battalion.  What
          4  was agreed in the beginning, in 1993, the so-called
          5  freedom of movement, there was no freedom of movement
          6  at all.
          7            Our conclusion for the inhabitants, the
          8  population of the enclave, was that the situation was
          9  hopeless, inhuman and a lot of suffering for the
         10  people.
         11            On the other side, for the battalion, I'd
         12  like to describe that a little bit too, if I may, and
         13  I'll use a couple of parameters which I also put in my
         14  reports for the higher echelons, and also for my
         15  national authorities.  In the first place, the
         16  logistics, I have told you, Your Honours, a little bit
         17  about that yesterday on the diesel, the lack of diesel
         18  which implied that we have to live in the dark with my
         19  battalion for a couple of months.  We had no
         20  electricity for water, for heating, and the weather
         21  conditions in those days, until the end of May, were
         22  extreme, a lot of rain day after day.  So we couldn't
         23  use our vehicles, one side, because of lack of fuel,
         24  but the other side, the roads we had in the enclave, we
         25  couldn't use them.

          1            Because of the lack of diesel we had to
          2  patrol by foot, with all the consequences of the mines
          3  all over the area.  There was no possibility of
          4  resupplying my observation posts, and that's why we
          5  used horses from the locals.  What I said before, there
          6  was no heating especially under those extreme weather
          7  conditions.  We had no medicines, we had no spare
          8  parts, we had no engineering equipment and no food,
          9  except our combat rations, and we lived on combat
         10  rations a long time.  We called that in the end a
         11  logistical regime.
         12            Then of my own personnel, the soldiers, I had
         13  a lack of personnel because they couldn't enter the
         14  enclave as of the 26th of April.  They got no mail from
         15  home.  There was no freedom of movement.  We couldn't
         16  leave the enclave; we couldn't enter the enclave.
         17            The third parameter were the operations.  We
         18  had adjusted the orders for the battalion several
         19  times, and I explained that yesterday, from eight
         20  observation posts to 12, and even 13 at the end,
         21  patrolling by foot instead of using armoured personnel
         22  carriers.  We made contingency plans as of, let's say,
         23  the air strikes in Pale, the end of May.  Contingency
         24  plans were for the observation post one-hour notice,
         25  and one-hour notice meant that the soldiers on an

          1  observation post, after an order, should leave the
          2  observation post within an hour, and that was 24 hours
          3  a day, the time we have been there.
          4            Humanitarian support, I just explained that
          5  to you, we were not able to support the population
          6  within the enclave.
          7            One of the other parameters was the
          8  psychological effect on the soldiers, but also on the
          9  population; the morale of the battalion, but also from
         10  the population.  The terrain conditions were bad and
         11  the weather conditions were even worse.
         12            That ended up on the 25th of May where I
         13  informed, in a long report to all the higher echelons
         14  and to the national authorities, that I was not able to
         15  fulfil my mission any longer.  That meant end of the
         16  mission, period.
         17            Then we started with making all
         18  improvisations.  Using those improvisations, we could
         19  handle the mission more or less until the 6th of July.
         20  That was it.
         21       Q.   Colonel Karremans, based on the Bosnian Serb
         22  blockade and its effects, as well as the capture of 55
         23  of your soldiers by the Bosnian Serb army, did you feel
         24  that you had the means to fulfil your mission?
         25       A.   Not at the end.  In the beginning, when we

          1  started in January, I could fulfil the mission based on
          2  the mandate, based on what I had, personnel, equipment,
          3  the incoming convoys.  But at the end of my stay over
          4  there, the answer is no.
          5       Q.   Now I'd like to turn your attention to the
          6  actual invasion itself.  What was the effect on the
          7  civilian population once the invasion started?
          8       A.   As you know, Your Honours, the invasion
          9  started on the 6th of July.  It started with heavy
         10  fighting in the southern part of the enclave, in the
         11  direct vicinity of OP Foxtrot, and by shelling the city
         12  of Srebrenica itself, the compounds and some other
         13  observation posts.  But actually it started in the
         14  south.
         15            In the southern part of the enclave, there
         16  was the so-called Swedish shelter project, a lot of
         17  housing built under Swedish authorities.  In that
         18  Swedish shelter project there used to live about 3.000
         19  refugees.  As soon as the attacks started in the
         20  southern part, all those refugees fled in the northern
         21  direction, towards the city of Srebrenica.  You can
         22  imagine there was panic, chaos, in those days, what I
         23  explained before, no food, and there was no way to give
         24  them houses in Srebrenica itself.  Panic, I must say.
         25       Q.   Where did the people flee to?

          1       A.   They fled to Srebrenica.
          2       Q.   Did they flee to the UN compound in
          3  Srebrenica?
          4       A.   Not in the beginning.  That was, I think, on
          5  the 10th, on the Monday, and of course at the last day,
          6  on Tuesday, the 11th.
          7       Q.   How many refugees were in and around the UN
          8  compound in Srebrenica?
          9       A.   I don't know exactly, but there must be
         10  hundreds at the compound and maybe thousands around
         11  it.  They were all gathered together.
         12       Q.   What happened to those refugees in the
         13  compound around Srebrenica?
         14       A.   Do I have to refer to the 11th, the last
         15  day?
         16       Q.   Please.
         17       A.   Because at that day and the days before,
         18  Srebrenica itself was already shelled quite some
         19  times.  At the 11th, well, while all those refugees
         20  were gathered together, at least most of them, the BSA
         21  started shelling the city, it started shelling the
         22  compound of Srebrenica itself, and that ended up with a
         23  lot of wounded persons, death.  Also in the morning
         24  and -- on the morning of the 11th, we already evacuated
         25  the local hospital and we brought all the wounded

          1  persons to the compound of Potocari.
          2            As soon as the shelling started in the
          3  afternoon of the 11th, just before the air strikes, or
          4  during the air attacks, all the refugees fled in the
          5  direction of Potocari, in the northern direction, to
          6  the compound of the battalion staff and staff company.
          7       Q.   So, Colonel Karremans, some of the BSA
          8  artillery shells landed in and around the UN compound
          9  itself in Srebrenica; is that correct?
         10       A.   That's correct, sir.
         11       Q.   Did that cause civilian casualties?
         12       A.   That caused civilian casualties.
         13       Q.   Now, you mentioned as a result of the attacks
         14  on the city of Srebrenica itself there was a large
         15  exodus of civilians that fled to Potocari; is that
         16  correct?
         17       A.   That's correct.
         18       Q.   Did those people who fled from Potocari come
         19  to the UN compound in -- I'm sorry.  Did the refugees
         20  who fled from the UN compound in Srebrenica flee to the
         21  UN compound in Potocari?
         22       A.   Yes, they did.
         23       Q.   Approximately how many people gathered in and
         24  around the UN compound in Potocari?
         25       A.   It's just an estimation, of course, but we

          1  were forced to split up the group of refugees because
          2  there were so many thousands.  We put, let's put it
          3  that way, or invited, that's a better word, we invited
          4  about 4.000 to 5.000 refugees within our own compound
          5  of Potocari, and then it was completely full, filled
          6  up, with refugees and our own personnel.  Then we had
          7  another 15.000 to 20.000 persons still outside of the
          8  compound of Potocari and we used two or three shelled
          9  factories just in the vicinity of the compound of
         10  Potocari.
         11       Q.   What was the percentage of women to men in
         12  the 25.000 refugees that you say congregated in and
         13  around the compound?
         14       A.   Of those 25.000 refugees, most of them were
         15  women, children, and elderly people.  I think, and
         16  that's what I stated before, there were about two to
         17  three per cent men between 16 and 60.
         18       Q.   Could you please describe the general
         19  conditions that were present in and around the
         20  compound.
         21       A.   Yes, I can.  The general conditions from the
         22  people, the refugees, it's what I explained before, was
         23  poorer than poor.  They hadn't had food and water
         24  supplies during the six days of war over there.  They
         25  were in very bad condition.  We had no means to supply

          1  them, only by the water we had left into our own
          2  compound and some food and some medicines left.  But
          3  the general condition of the people was miserable, more
          4  than miserable.
          5       Q.   Amongst those 25.000 refugees, were there
          6  some pregnant women who were delivering their babies?
          7       A.   Yes, there were.  What I heard later on,
          8  there were five pregnant women with their little
          9  babies.  What I heard was that one man hung himself
         10  during the stay over there.  And life was, let's say,
         11  going on during the two days that we had all those
         12  refugees around us.
         13       Q.   Okay.  Now I'd like to turn your attention to
         14  air strikes.  Can you please describe those air strikes
         15  to the Court.
         16       A.   Yes, I can.  As everybody knows, I asked
         17  several times for air strikes, looking to the mandate,
         18  the mandate which asked in the beginning of the
         19  establishment of the safe areas of Srebrenica, Zepa,
         20  and Gorazde, that one needed about 40.000 soldiers for
         21  that, and that was diminished after negotiations to
         22  about 8.000; that they changed the mandate in that
         23  sense, that they combined it with air strikes or, let's
         24  say, close air support, air support in general.
         25            That was one of the parts of the mandate and

          1  that was what I am referring to, that as soon as the
          2  attacks started on the 6th, I asked for close air
          3  support because one of the OPs was attacked, UN troops
          4  were attacked, the city of Srebrenica had been
          5  shelled.  There was no close air support available on
          6  the days that I asked for that, except at the last day,
          7  on the 11th, on Tuesday.  I asked that in the very
          8  early morning, I expected that at 6.00.
          9            I had a meeting during the night, from Monday
         10  to Tuesday, with the local authorities and the military
         11  authorities.  We discussed that even, and I told them
         12  that we expected air strikes or close air support in
         13  the very early morning, on the 11th.  That didn't come,
         14  didn't show up.
         15            After noon, about 2.00, the air strikes
         16  started.  It had no effect on the population; it had no
         17  effect on the mission of the battalion because
         18  everybody knows that the air strikes or close air
         19  support was too late and too little.  It had an effect
         20  on the way General Mladic reacted.
         21       Q.   Before I get to that point, let me just
         22  clarify one point with you, Colonel Karremans.  It was
         23  your understanding when you were the commanding officer
         24  of the DutchBat unit in Srebrenica that air support was
         25  supposed to be a significant part of the protection

          1  measures available to you and to the population of
          2  Srebrenica; is that correct?
          3       A.   That's correct, it was.
          4       Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned that there were air
          5  strikes and that they were too little, too late; is
          6  that your testimony?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   What effect did those air strikes have on
          9  General Mladic?
         10       A.   The effect was that through the hijacked
         11  soldiers, about 30 in Bratunac, on one of the
         12  BSA kazernes over there, Mladic or one of his officers
         13  used the communications equipment of the vehicles over
         14  there and ordered me to stop immediately using air
         15  support.  And if that was not the case, if I wasn't
         16  able to stop that immediately, he should use all his
         17  weaponry, that's what he said, to shell the compound of
         18  Potocari, to shell the refugees within and around the
         19  compound, and kill the 30 hijacked soldiers.
         20       Q.   Did General Mladic have the ability to
         21  deliver on those threats?
         22       A.   He could.  He had the ability because he had
         23  gathered a lot of weaponry around the compound, on top
         24  of the hills, like mortars, two main bell tanks,
         25  artillery and, what I explained already yesterday,

          1  multiple rocket launch system from different types, all
          2  in direct sight or direct direction of the compound,
          3  and he could use that.
          4       Q.   In fact, he had already used that on the UN
          5  compound in Srebrenica.
          6       A.   Yes, he did.
          7       Q.   I'd like to turn to another topic now,
          8  Colonel Karremans, and that is the meetings that you
          9  had with General Mladic.
         10            Can you explain the circumstances of your
         11  first meeting with General Mladic, and explain when it
         12  occurred and where is occurred.
         13       A.   Yes, sir.  The first meeting I had with
         14  General Mladic was on Tuesday night, at half past
         15  eight.  I was notified by my ops room, they got a
         16  message, again through the same communications systems,
         17  that I had to show up in Bratunac for a meeting.  I
         18  didn't know what kind of meeting that should be but I
         19  expected with somebody from the BSA, maybe Colonel
         20  Vukovic or Nikolic, or whatsoever.
         21            I wasn't before in Bratunac but my LO,
         22  liaison officers, had a couple of times been there
         23  talking about trade, about military options with the
         24  BSA, so they came with me, two liaison officers, and we
         25  went to the hotel in Bratunac.  There was a crowd of

          1  military persons, all in combat wear, gear, and
          2  clothes.  There I met for the first time General
          3  Mladic.  I didn't know that he was there.  I had not
          4  met him before, not in life.  There was also General
          5  Zivanovic, the corps commander of the Drina Corps.  We
          6  were all standing there at half past eight.
          7            There were a lot of press around, television,
          8  and General Mladic started accusing me of all things
          9  that happened in the last six days; that I was
         10  responsible for the air strikes or the air support,
         11  killed some of his people, soldiers; that my soldiers
         12  had tried to kill him because of shooting at him; that
         13  we were not able to disarm the BiH forces within the
         14  enclave, and so on and so forth.
         15       Q.   When he was addressing you, was he speaking
         16  calmly?
         17       A.   No, he was shouting more or less.
         18       Q.   Then what happened?
         19       A.   Then we got our famous glass in our hands,
         20  water --
         21       Q.   Would you describe how that occurred?
         22       A.   Yes.  We just got a glass of something in our
         23  hand and didn't toast with that, but the circumstances
         24  were, if you can imagine, bad at that time because we
         25  too didn't sleep for five nights and had hardly no

          1  food, no water, lived in shelters and bunkers, so we
          2  were all, let's say, not well for a meeting like that.
          3       Q.   Was there a camera crew present at the
          4  meeting?
          5       A.   There was a camera group present, and they
          6  put everything on tape.
          7       Q.   After the glass was put in your hand, were
          8  pictures taken of you and other Dutch officers?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   How long did that meeting last, Colonel
         11  Karremans?
         12       A.   Not too long.  I think three-quarters of an
         13  hour.  I was able to explain the poor situation of the
         14  refugees, which I did.  I asked him for a supply of
         15  food, water, medicines, and then he said to me, "You
         16  will have to -- you should return for a second meeting
         17  at half past eleven, just before midnight," that I
         18  should take with me a representative of the refugees,
         19  if it was possible, one of the civil authorities of the
         20  opstina.  That was it.
         21       Q.   What did you then do?
         22       A.   Then we went back to -- we left the hotel in
         23  Bratunac and drove back to the compound.  The first
         24  thing I did there, I had a quick talk with my deputy
         25  battalion commander and we were desperately looking for

          1  a representative of the refugees.  One of my officers
          2  knew, and he saw him, that the head or the director of
          3  the secondary school of Srebrenica was amongst the
          4  refugees, was in the compound of Potocari.  We found
          5  him and we explained the situation, that I had had a
          6  meeting with General Mladic and that he ordered, more
          7  or less, me to bring with me to a second meeting one of
          8  the representatives -- a representative of the
          9  refugees.  I asked him if he was willing to go with me
         10  to that meeting, and he was.
         11       Q.   Did you then return to Bratunac that evening?
         12       A.   I returned to Bratunac that evening, just
         13  before midnight, with my same two liaison officers and
         14  with Mr. Mandzic.  Mr. Mandzic was the representative.
         15       Q.   Who were the representatives of the Bosnian
         16  Serb army at that meeting?
         17       A.   The second meeting?
         18       Q.   Yes.
         19       A.   More or less the same which I met in the
         20  first meeting:  General Mladic, General Zivanovic;
         21  there was an interpreter which I referred already to
         22  yesterday, Mr. Petar, a couple of BSA officers, and one
         23  or two civilians who I didn't know.
         24       Q.   At that second meeting --
         25                 [Videotape of 4 July 1996 paused]

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Can we stop here at this point
          2  for a break?  There has to be something where you can
          3  end a phase.  Is this a good end here now?
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Your Honour, I think
          5  it's fine.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.  We'll
          7  resume in half an hour, at 11.30.
          8                 --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
          9                 --- On resuming at 11.35 a.m.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. McCloskey, you can proceed.
         11            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes.  We're ready just to
         12  continue playing the tape of Colonel Karremans.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.
         14                 [Videotape of 4 July 1996 continued]
         15            [MR. HARMON:]
         16       Q.   At that second meeting did you request
         17  permission for convoys to pass through and to ask
         18  permission for some form of relief of the refugees who
         19  were in and around your compound?
         20       A.   Yes, I did.
         21       Q.   Would you please describe that second
         22  meeting.
         23       A.   The second meeting was a little bit more
         24  friendlier than the first one, I must say, and I was
         25  able to explain again the very bad circumstances and

          1  the situation in and around the compound concerning the
          2  refugees.  Again I asked for support on medicines,
          3  water supplies, food, the wounded.  I had about 100
          4  wounded persons in the field dressing station, all in
          5  shelters.  He made note of my requests without saying
          6  if he could do something about it.
          7            Then he started with his demands in, let's
          8  say, a kind of monologue.  He asked me, and also the
          9  representative of the refugees, Mr. Mandzic, that all
         10  Bosnian soldiers should lay down their weapons and
         11  deliver those weapons into the hands of the BSA.  He
         12  said that he had a clear attitude towards the BiH
         13  soldiers: survive or disappear.
         14            He asked me and the representative to come
         15  back the next morning at 10.00 to have a third
         16  meeting.  He promised that there would be a ceasefire,
         17  which I had asked for, until 10.00 the next morning,
         18  Wednesday, and if there won't be any support of the BiH
         19  in delivering their weapons, action should be taken by
         20  him by again shelling, what he stated before, of the
         21  compound and the refugees.
         22            He said something about Mr. Izetbegovic, the
         23  President of the Muslim people in Sarajevo, that he
         24  killed more Serb people during the last years than the
         25  Bosnian Serb army did.  He stated that he was not

          1  willing to use power against women and children.
          2            He asked me if Naser Oric -- Naser Oric was,
          3  let's say, the commanding officer of the BiH forces --
          4  if he could show up, I mean, if I could take him with
          5  me to the next meeting.  I explained to him that we
          6  hadn't seen Naser Oric since April, he hadn't been back
          7  in the enclave since April.
          8            He stated that he was prepared to take over
          9  the about 100 or 110 wounded persons, and he guaranteed
         10  that if he had taken over -- should have taken over the
         11  wounded, he guaranteed that they would have the same
         12  treatment as what is normal for treating the wounded,
         13  according to the Conventions of Geneva, the Geneva
         14  Conventions.
         15            Again he stated or said or demanded that we
         16  should come back the next morning with a delegation of
         17  the people -- a delegation of the refugees, and if it
         18  was possible, these civilian and military authorities
         19  from the enclave.
         20            Again he stated that the handing over of the
         21  weapons by BiH soldiers would mean the survival of
         22  them.  "If they should keep their weapons," he said,
         23  "that will be their death."  He stated that if the BiH
         24  soldiers should hand over their weapons that they will
         25  be treated according to the Geneva Conventions.  And he

          1  stated at the end that the destiny of the Muslim people
          2  was in his hands.
          3       Q.   Did he also make any statement with regard to
          4  whether NATO or the UN were capable of guaranteeing the
          5  existence of the safe area?
          6       A.   Yes.  He quoted some words on that subject,
          7  but that he already did in the first meeting.  I'd like
          8  to say a "meeting," between brackets.  He stated that
          9  the UN forces in general were not able to fulfil, let's
         10  say, the arrangements made by the ceasefire agreement
         11  and the UN resolutions as of 1993.
         12            I refer to the demilitarisation of the
         13  enclave.  He said that in the first meeting and also in
         14  the second meeting, that "Your United Nations forces
         15  were not able to fulfil their mission."
         16       Q.   Now, after that second meeting did you return
         17  to the UN compound in Potocari?
         18       A.   Yes, sir.  We did return in the middle of the
         19  night.  I think that meeting lasted one and a half
         20  hours in total.  We went back to the compound of
         21  Potocari.  I had a telephone call with sector
         22  north-east, told them what happened that day, what
         23  happened during those two meetings, what was demanded
         24  by General Mladic.  Then we started looking for more
         25  representatives, to have them prepared for the meeting

          1  of the next morning.
          2            I had a long talk again with my deputy, with
          3  some officers of the battalion staff, how to find those
          4  specific persons, and at the end we found them.  We
          5  found a woman and one other person.  So I had, the next
          6  morning, three persons for the committee of refugees.
          7       Q.   So the next morning there was a third
          8  meeting, is that correct, Colonel Karremans?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   Where did that take place?
         11       A.   The third meeting took place again in
         12  Bratunac, in the same hotel.
         13       Q.   Approximately what time did that meeting take
         14  place?
         15       A.   10.30.
         16       Q.   Can you describe the circumstances of that
         17  meeting.
         18       A.   Yes.  It was more or less as the second one.
         19  The same persons, at least most of them that I met in
         20  the second meeting, and there were some civilians as
         21  well who attended that meeting.  I didn't know them.
         22  They were introduced but I can't remember which jobs
         23  they had.  They were all from Bratunac and Zvornik.
         24            He started welcoming myself and the liaison
         25  officers, and also the committee of three persons --

          1       Q.   When you say "he," are you referring to
          2  General Mladic?
          3       A.   General Mladic, yes.  Then the two other,
          4  let's say, the new representatives were able to
          5  introduce themselves shortly, starting with the woman.
          6  She made some statements, very clear statements,
          7  towards General Mladic about the very poor, bad,
          8  miserable circumstances of all the refugees, and that
          9  the refugees were not responsible for what happened in
         10  the enclave during the last two, three years, and that
         11  women and children were not responsible for those
         12  things which had been happening.  She was the
         13  representative of all women and children.  They were
         14  all civilians, and no military and no politicians.
         15            Also the man introduced himself and he asked
         16  for help, and he said, stated, not blaming the
         17  refugees, and that they need a lot of things which I
         18  have already stated -- had already stated before, like
         19  medicines, food, water, and other supplies.  He said
         20  that neither he nor my battalion staff or myself were
         21  able to make contact with the Bosnian government during
         22  that night to ask for specific points for that third
         23  meeting, which meant that he wasn't able to lean on
         24  mandates or on other things to explain to General
         25  Mladic.

          1            After those statements of the two other
          2  representatives, and Mr. Mandzic was already invited to
          3  tell something about himself during the second meeting,
          4  the day before, General Mladic started his monologue.
          5       Q.   Will you describe that monologue, please.
          6       A.   It was a very long monologue.  He started
          7  with a piece of history, in 1992, that the Bosnian
          8  army, the Bosnian soldiers -- and he blamed Oric
          9  specially for that -- that they killed a lot of Bosnian
         10  Serb families, soldiers, civilians, that they attacked
         11  a lot of villages in the surroundings of the city of
         12  Srebrenica, devastated a lot of villages, and that
         13  according to that, what happened in 1993, as soon as
         14  those safe havens or safe areas had been established,
         15  that the destiny of poor people was in the hands of the
         16  Bosnian Serbs.  That was one of his other statements,
         17  he said it was too late for help, help either by the
         18  Bosnian government or by the UN troops.
         19            He said that there was a lot of misery in the
         20  last years, that the BiH forces within the enclave had
         21  murdered a lot around the enclave by raids looking for
         22  food, revenge, looking for revenge, terror.
         23            He stated that he was willing to assist the
         24  refugees, those 25.000 refugees, but that he needed
         25  assistance, assistance by the local civilian and

          1  military authorities, from which I already explained
          2  that they were not available at the moment, not within
          3  that group of 25.000 refugees.
          4            He again said regarding the BiH forces, the
          5  same expression as the day before, survive or
          6  disappear.  He again requested to the BiH forces to
          7  hand over their weapons.  Even criminals amongst them
          8  could hand over their weapons.
          9            The second subject he stated was that the
         10  gathered population in and around the compound had the
         11  choice either to stay in Srebrenica or to be evacuated,
         12  to be evacuated to Serbia, toward the Bosnian territory
         13  around Tuzla, or even to foreign countries.  He said
         14  that the whole former -- at that moment, former safe
         15  area had been encircled by his forces and that fighting
         16  should stop.  We could hear that during the night
         17  before, and the day, that there were still fights and
         18  attacks going on.  He stated that he was not able to
         19  assist the refugees as long as fighting was going on.
         20            He stated that the BiH forces could hand over
         21  their weapons in the presence of UN forces; UNPROFOR,
         22  he stated in general.  I think he meant DutchBat.
         23            He stated that he was willing to assist with
         24  the evacuation.  That was the first time, in the third
         25  meeting, that he used the word "evacuation."

          1            Then he stated that there used to be a good
          2  life in and around Srebrenica and in around the
          3  vicinity of Srebrenica, and that he liked to have the
          4  same situation, that good life before 1992, and that
          5  he'd like to have that situation back.
          6            He said that looking back, or referring to
          7  that lecture in history, that he didn't like to kill,
          8  what happened in 1992 and 1993, and he, as a
          9  professional soldier, had no joy in killing either
         10  civilians or military.  Again he offered his help, and
         11  the committee of refugees should think that over, think
         12  about how they could assist in the evacuation.
         13            He asked for basic needs, I mean, what did we
         14  use -- what did the refugees use concerning food,
         15  water, medicines, medical support, and so forth.  He
         16  asked again how many refugees there were and we
         17  answered again 25.000, around 25.000.
         18            The committee stated that most of the
         19  refugees liked to go to their family and be gathered
         20  together with their husbands, and he stated that nobody
         21  should be forced to be evacuated.  On the other hand,
         22  he said that if NATO air strikes or air support should
         23  be the case in other areas in Bosnia, that he should
         24  use his weaponry again and taking sanctions.
         25       Q.   Can you explain what he meant by that.

          1       A.   The same what he said or stated in the first
          2  meeting, before the first meeting, that if air strikes
          3  should occur again, that he should shell, let's say,
          4  the compound and the refugees in and around the
          5  compound.
          6            He said that he would like to see all the men
          7  between 17 and 60, and I asked him, and also both men
          8  in the delegation, "What for?" and his answer was that
          9  he'd like to see all those persons because he said, he
         10  stated, that there were a lot of war criminals amongst
         11  them and he would like to speak with them.
         12            Again he asked if we were able to come in
         13  contact with soldiers whom Mladic knew.  He was
         14  referring, of course, to Naser Oric, which I explained
         15  to him before that he was not available, and some other
         16  persons, let's say, the commanding officers of the BiH
         17  within the enclave.  Again I told him that there were
         18  no BiH soldiers available at the moment.  So there was
         19  no possibility to look for them because we were
         20  gathered together with all the refugees in a very, very
         21  small area, I mean, the compound and the two or three
         22  factories just in the vicinity of it.  And we lost our
         23  eyes and ears in the rest of the enclave so we were not
         24  able to pick up those military representatives.
         25            Then he stated in his monologue that the BiH

          1  soldiers had only 24 hours to hand over all the
          2  weapons.  After that statement, he asked some very
          3  specific conditions of the refugees, and he stated that
          4  if he was able to assist, he preferred in a kind of
          5  priority to look for the weak persons first, for the
          6  wounded persons, and later on the rest of the refugees,
          7  women and children.  He said that nobody should be hurt
          8  and that coordination and cooperation with UNPROFOR,
          9  DutchBat in particular, was one of his priorities.
         10            What I just stated, that he mentioned
         11  "evacuation" during his monologue for the first time,
         12  he asked for diesel for the evacuation.  You can
         13  imagine that I started laughing a little bit because he
         14  was exactly aware of what I had for diesel, that there
         15  was none, nothing, nil, and that I was not able to
         16  support him by giving him diesel.  He said that his
         17  forces, BSA forces, will give escort during the
         18  evacuation.  I said, "No.  If there should be an
         19  evacuation anyway, that my own battalion should escort
         20  the evacuation."  Then I explained to him in which way
         21  I should execute that.
         22       Q.   What was your proposal to General Mladic?
         23       A.   My proposal was to put on every vehicle one
         24  soldier, not knowing how many vehicles there were.  As
         25  soon as the evacuation started the same day, at 3.00, I

          1  think we'll come to that --
          2       Q.   We'll come to that a little later in your
          3  testimony.
          4       A.   Yes.  I was unable to do that, I was unable
          5  to put on each vehicle one soldier.
          6            Then he said, and it was quite a remarkable
          7  expression, that Allah won't help, was not able to
          8  help, and Mladic could.  He gave his word.  He said to
          9  the commission not to be in panic, not to be afraid,
         10  and asked them to send that message to the refugees.
         11            I asked again when that was possible what
         12  happened or what should happen with the men between 17
         13  and 60, and he again said or stated that there were
         14  quite some war criminals amongst them and that he liked
         15  to investigate, person by person, what they have done
         16  and what kind of persons those were.
         17            At the end of that meeting, all of a sudden
         18  he started to tell something about the evacuation
         19  again, and he proposed, let's say it in that way,
         20  "proposed," that Kladanj should be the point for
         21  evacuation.  Kladanj is a small village just on the
         22  border between Bosnian Serb territory and the Bosnian
         23  territory around Tuzla.  In fact, Kladanj is the first
         24  Muslim city in that area.
         25            He repeated that within 24 hours all soldiers

          1  of the BiH, even in uniform or not in uniform, even war
          2  criminals amongst the BiH forces, could hand over and
          3  should hand over the weapons.  He said, "It's better to
          4  live than to die."
          5            Then he referred to something, what I said
          6  already yesterday or explained yesterday, that he knew
          7  everything that was going on in the enclave, what
          8  happened in the enclave day by day, and that he had
          9  persons in the enclave who informed him every day.  So
         10  he was well aware of what was going on.
         11            Then he showed to us at the end of the
         12  meeting a book, that was a book of the opstina, a book
         13  in which marriages were assigned by people, marriage,
         14  and that the last marriage was on the 29th of June.  He
         15  had as a piece of remembrance, I presume, a thing from,
         16  let's say, the entry of the opstina.
         17            He ended with something to say to the woman
         18  of the committee, that she was a fine woman, that she
         19  was open, or had been open in the way of statements
         20  towards Mladic, and he didn't say anything to both male
         21  representatives.
         22            Last but not least, he asked us, urged us, in
         23  finding a contact with the BiH forces and to convince
         24  them to hand over their weapons within 24 hours.  That
         25  was, I think, the whole meeting.

          1       Q.   What time did the meeting end, Colonel
          2  Karremans?
          3       A.   I think about noonish, about 12.00, because
          4  at 12.30 I had a meeting in the compound with the
          5  committee.
          6       Q.   What time did the first transports arrive to
          7  take the refugees away from the compound?
          8       A.   He said during the third meeting, I forgot to
          9  say that, that the evacuation should start about 1.00.
         10  But it wasn't well-organised in the beginning, or
         11  efficiently organised, so the evacuation started at
         12  3.00.
         13       Q.   So three hours from the conclusion of your
         14  meeting with General Mladic transport arrived in and
         15  around Potocari to start taking the refugees away.
         16       A.   That's correct.
         17       Q.   What type of transport arrived?
         18       A.   A lot of buses, I think 20 or 30, vans, big
         19  lorries, and small military vehicles.  I think the
         20  first evacuation was about between 40 and 50 vehicles,
         21  and that was also, let's say, one of my decision points
         22  to change from one soldier at every vehicle to what we
         23  had done later on, put two vehicles with officers to
         24  escort the evacuations.
         25       Q.   So as a result of the number of vehicles, you

          1  realised that you did not have enough troops to put on
          2  one soldier per vehicle to accompany the convoy; is
          3  that correct?
          4       A.   That's correct, sir.
          5       Q.   Okay.  So did you formulate another solution?
          6       A.   We formulated, indeed, another solution.
          7       Q.   Describe that solution, please.
          8       A.   That solution was that we should escort each
          9  convoy by two vehicles, two jeeps, Mercedes jeeps; in
         10  every jeep, one officer or non-commissioned officer and
         11  a driver with communications, up to Kladanj, and then
         12  they should return and pick up, let's say, the next
         13  evacuation.
         14       Q.   What happened to those escort vehicles?
         15       A.   In the first escort or in the first
         16  evacuation, I put my personnel officer, a captain, and
         17  one of the liaison officers, and they managed to go
         18  with all the persons in that convoy to cross the border
         19  in the area of Kladanj.  The vehicles that left in the
         20  convoy returning to Srebrenica disappeared, and that
         21  happened with the other vehicles during the next
         22  evacuations too.  And totally, or in total, 14, they
         23  were just picked up en route by -- either by BSA forces
         24  or irregular forces.
         25       Q.   So I understand clearly, the first escort

          1  vehicle made it to Kladanj, is that correct, or made it
          2  to a point shortly --
          3       A.   Six kilometres --
          4       Q.   From Kladanj.
          5       A.   -- from Kladanj, because there was a
          6  barricade between the two borders and that meant that
          7  all the refugees, and later on also wounded persons,
          8  were forced to walk, struggle, I must say, the last six
          9  kilometres to the border of Kladanj.
         10       Q.   Did any other of your escort vehicles make it
         11  to Kladanj?
         12       A.   Some of them in the beginning --
         13       Q.   Okay.
         14       A.   -- but they didn't return.
         15       Q.   Okay.  So what happened to those vehicles?
         16       A.   They were hijacked, stolen.
         17       Q.   What happened to the equipment that was used
         18  by the soldiers who participated in those escorts?
         19       A.   The same.  Weaponry, their personal weapons
         20  were stolen.  Helmets, flak jackets, private belongings
         21  were stolen.
         22       Q.   What was the consequence of losing those
         23  vehicles in relation to the convoys that left your
         24  compound?
         25       A.   The consequences were, I think, threefold.

          1  In the first place, again we changed the way of
          2  escorting those convoys by putting en route, and the
          3  route was about 50 kilometres, four different points,
          4  let's say, contact points, so that the vehicles
          5  standing there on fixed points could see convoys
          6  passing, counting the amount of vehicles.
          7            What we did in the beginning, as soon as a
          8  convoy left, let's say, the road in front of the
          9  compound, we counted the amount of vehicles and gave
         10  that to the first fixed post so that they could have a
         11  look and control if the same amount of vehicles were
         12  still in that convoy.
         13            The second thing we did is that I ordered
         14  troops just outside the compound to work either in
         15  groups, armed, with their helmets and flak jackets, or
         16  if they work individually, like the soldiers, the
         17  doctors, et cetera, that they should work just in a
         18  T-shirt, without a helmet, without a flak jacket, and
         19  without a weapon.
         20       Q.   Why did you do that?
         21       A.   Because in the beginning, especially for
         22  individuals working between the refugees, they have
         23  been stolen from the BSA soldiers around, there were
         24  not so many.  They stole the helmets, personal weapons,
         25  and flak jackets just by pointing a weapon on the head

          1  of the soldier and said, "I'd like to have it.  Give it
          2  to me."  They didn't do that when groups were working
          3  outside, then they didn't do it.
          4       Q.   Did you again see General Mladic on the 12th
          5  of July?
          6       A.   That was on Wednesday, yes.  At the moment
          7  that the first convoy arrived, let's say, the empty
          8  vehicles, and turned around in front of the compound
          9  and the first refugees were escorted to all those
         10  buses, vans, and military vehicles, General Mladic
         11  appeared with his own vehicle and all his officers
         12  around him, and some bodyguards of course.  And the
         13  press was there available too; they made nice pictures
         14  of him and what was going on over there.  A lot of
         15  publicity.
         16       Q.   Did you have any conversations with General
         17  Mladic on this fourth meeting with him?
         18       A.   I had a short conversation with him about the
         19  evacuation, about what he stated in the morning, that
         20  first priority should be the wounded persons, which he
         21  stated, "Yes, that's correct, we should do something
         22  about it.  Bring them over to the hospital in
         23  Bratunac."  Then I said, "No, we won't do that.  They
         24  will stay here in the compound, in our own hands, or
         25  they should be sent or brought to NorMed Corps," that's

          1  the Norwegian Medical Company in Tuzla, "escorted by
          2  either the Norwegian Company or by the International
          3  Red Cross."
          4       Q.   What was his reaction?
          5       A.   None.
          6       Q.   Please continue your description of the
          7  fourth meeting with General Mladic.
          8       A.   He was so busy during his stay there with the
          9  press and impressing his soldiers and the officers
         10  around him, and talking to some refugees, that I had
         11  hardly any chance to talk with him longer than, I
         12  think, those five minutes, and that was it.
         13       Q.   When was your next contact with General
         14  Mladic?
         15       A.   The next contact was the next morning, on
         16  Thursday, Thursday morning.
         17       Q.   Where did that take place?
         18       A.   Again in front of the compound, just opposite
         19  the gate, the main gate.  Again, a short meeting.
         20  There was no press available, or present, I must say.
         21  He had only Colonel Jankovic with him and Major
         22  Nikolic, both officers of the BSA, and of course his
         23  interpreter, Petar, and some bodyguards.
         24            He offered me, that was on that Thursday
         25  morning, he offered me that we could go or leave the

          1  compound with vehicles after or during the evacuation
          2  of all the refugees.
          3       Q.   In other words, that the Dutch Battalion
          4  could evacuate --
          5       A.   Itself.
          6       Q.   Is that correct?
          7       A.   Yes, that's correct.
          8       Q.   What was your response?
          9       A.   I told him that I didn't like the idea of
         10  leaving the compound because of a couple of subjects.
         11  One of the subjects was that I still had some military
         12  on OP Alpha, one of the observation posts that was
         13  still occupied.  The officers and the soldiers from the
         14  day before, escorting the convoys that were still under
         15  way, I missed them.
         16       Q.   In other words, they were still missing.
         17       A.   They were still missing.  I was faced at that
         18  moment with 55 wounded civilians within the compound,
         19  and I referred to the talk we had before, that I'd like
         20  to bring them over either by NorMed Coy or by the
         21  International Red Cross; that I had my Bosnian local
         22  workers on the compound, I mean, interpreters from the
         23  battalion, interpreters from the United Nations
         24  Military Observers which I had on the compound; that I
         25  had all the people of the MSF, Medecins Sans Frontiers,

          1  with me on the compound, and that if we leave, we leave
          2  all together but after some arrangements concerning the
          3  wounded persons had been made.  That was my answer.  He
          4  agreed with that and that's why I stayed in the
          5  compound.
          6       Q.   Was there any other significant matters
          7  discussed at that meeting, or did that conclude the
          8  meeting?
          9       A.   That concluded the meeting.
         10       Q.   By the end of the 13th of July, had all the
         11  refugees been deported from the Potocari compound area?
         12       A.   Yes, sir.  I will look at my notebook.  At
         13  1600, on Thursday, the last refugee was gone outside
         14  the compound, and then one started with the evacuation
         15  of the 4.000 to 5.000 refugees which were able to stay
         16  within the compound.  It started at 1600 and it
         17  finished about 7.00.  That was in three hours.
         18       Q.   At the end of that -- at 7.00, then, there
         19  were no further refugees in and around Potocari; is
         20  that right?
         21       A.   There were no further refugees in and around
         22  Srebrenica -- I mean the compound at Potocari.
         23       Q.   When was the next time you saw General
         24  Mladic?
         25       A.   The next time that I saw General Mladic was

          1  on the day of our departure, on the 21st of July.  It
          2  was on a Friday morning.  We had eight days to prepare
          3  our own, let's say, departure, to rest.  On Friday, the
          4  day after the evacuation, all of a sudden a convoy with
          5  food, a lot of food, a lot of diesel, was accepted and
          6  came to the Potocari area.  So then we had -- from that
          7  day we had enough food, enough diesel, medicines, and
          8  we had eight days to recover from what happened in the
          9  weeks before.  I saw General Mladic on a Friday.  He
         10  invited me through, I think it was, Colonel Jankovic
         11  who came to the compound that morning, on Friday
         12  morning, or Petar, the interpreter, he said that I was
         13  invited with my liaison officers to that same hotel in
         14  Bratunac where I had my three meetings.
         15       Q.   What happened?
         16       A.   We drove to that hotel in one vehicle with my
         17  liaison officers.  There was General Mladic with a
         18  crowd of officers; most of them I knew already from the
         19  meetings.
         20            My own -- well, that's not the right
         21  expression.  The chief of staff of the BH command,
         22  General Nicolae, was there, a Dutch General, and his
         23  military assistant and they offered us breakfast, and
         24  we had some talks over a couple of things, about
         25  weaponry.  I asked him again what happened with my

          1  weaponry and that I'd like to have it back.
          2            I knew already that we should leave at noon
          3  towards the Serbian territory, and then the way up to
          4  Zagreb.  Again I asked, "Where are all my vehicles?
          5  I'd like to have them back with me."  Then he said,
          6  after some general things but I have forgotten those,
          7  that he'd like to visit the compound, look to our own
          8  convoys, how we did that, the vehicles.  He asked me to
          9  have a talk with the soldiers and that that should
         10  occur at 11.00, whether that was possible in the time
         11  frame.  It was not possible.
         12            So I told General Mladic that it wasn't such
         13  a good idea, talking to soldiers, not such a good idea,
         14  visiting the compound, but he insisted on visiting the
         15  compound.  He said, "Okay.  I won't be there at 11.00.
         16  I will be there, escorted by the chief of staff of the
         17  BH command, at 11.30."
         18            I left the hotel.  We went back to the
         19  compound of Potocari.  I had a quick talk with my
         20  deputy, seeing that everything was arranged for our own
         21  travel with everything which had been left.  That was
         22  the case.  I asked my deputy, "Are we able to start at
         23  noon?"  He said yes, he could.  I told him that General
         24  Mladic would come.  He said okay.
         25            We went back to the gate and he was already

          1  there before half past eleven.  He was held up by the
          2  commander of the guard, a very broad sergeant.  He
          3  couldn't go around that Sergeant.  He was held up.
          4  General Mladic had a quick talk with him, and then it
          5  was half past eleven.
          6            I took him with me to my own briefing room
          7  within the compound, had a quick talk -- I think 20
          8  minutes -- about some general things.  Then I asked him
          9  two specific questions.  One question was, "What will
         10  happen with my equipment?"  I told him what equipment I
         11  lost during the last two weeks: all my field vehicles,
         12  the armoured personnel carriers, a lot of personal
         13  arms, machine-guns, the equipment of most of the
         14  observation posts.  That was the first question.
         15       Q.   What was his response?
         16       A.   His response was that he should sort that
         17  out.  He was in contact with his Ministry of Internal
         18  Affairs, and they should do that in close combination
         19  or coordination, I must say, with the BH command.  He
         20  referred to the presence of the chief of staff of BH
         21  command.
         22            My second question which I can remember
         23  asking him was just a general one.  I asked him what
         24  should happen or should have happened if, during the
         25  stay of the United Nations troops in the safe areas of

          1  Gorazde, Zepa, and especially, of course, Srebrenica,
          2  what would happen if BH soldiers were disarmed totally,
          3  completely demilitarised, if they shouldn't have
          4  executed raids outside the compound -- outside the
          5  enclave, if both civilian and military authorities
          6  should live according to the 1993 regulations,
          7  arrangements, and ceasefire regulations, then he
          8  answered that he -- at least that was his answer --
          9  would not have thought about attacking the enclave.
         10            He said it with a smile more or less, and
         11  that was also more or less the end of our discussion
         12  there in the briefing room.  Then we went outside to
         13  the entry of the compound, gate, main gate of the
         14  compound.  The guards were changed.  My guards went
         15  back to their company.  Everybody in their vehicles,
         16  and exactly at noon we started leaving the compound.
         17            MR. HARMON:  Colonel Karremans, thank you
         18  very much.  I have no further questions.
         19            Your Honours, I have concluded my examination
         20  of Colonel Karremans.
         21            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you very
         22  much, Mr. Harmon.
         23            Let me look at fellow Judges.  Judge
         24  Odio-Benito, I do believe you have some questions.
         25  Please proceed.
          1                 Questioned by the Court:
          2            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Colonel Karremans, after
          3  leaving Srebrenica and Potocari, where did the refugees
          4  go in these convoys, buses and trucks, you have
          5  explained?
          6       A.   Your Honour, all refugees, which I explained,
          7  left the safe area of Srebrenica within an amazingly
          8  short time -- that was Wednesday afternoon and
          9  Thursday, the whole day -- and they had been evacuated
         10  to the Kladanj area, the one -- the first, let's say,
         11  Muslim city in the Tuzla area.
         12            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  To the confrontation
         13  line.
         14       A.   To the confrontation line, exactly.
         15            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Do you know what happened
         16  to them during the travel?
         17       A.   No, because they stayed in vehicles.  That
         18  was one of the things that I'd like to do in the
         19  beginning, to put a soldier per vehicle to have a look
         20  what was going on in buses or trucks.  They didn't
         21  inform me what was going on in the buses because we
         22  didn't have eyes and ears for that.  The only thing we
         23  could do, and that was the second option, was just
         24  escorting those big groups of vehicles, convoys, by two
         25  cars, in the beginning.

          1            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  But your vehicles and
          2  cars were stolen by the Bosnian Serb army.
          3       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          4            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  What did your soldiers do
          5  after that?
          6       A.   You mean the soldiers --
          7            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Yes, because you had
          8  soldiers in those vehicles and they lost the vehicles,
          9  the helmets, everything.  But what did they do?
         10       A.   They were gathered together during that
         11  night, the night of Wednesday and Thursday, by the
         12  Bosnian Serb army, or the irregular part of it, I don't
         13  know exactly.  They were gathered together, I think 12
         14  in total, or 14 officers and soldiers.  They stayed
         15  overnight two times.  Somewhere along that route, the
         16  route from Bratunac to Kladanj, they were fed by the
         17  Bosnian Serb army.  They could have shelter for their
         18  own protection, they said.  On Friday they returned,
         19  through Bratunac, to my compound.
         20            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Did you or any of your
         21  soldiers see Bosnian Serb soldiers beating, killing,
         22  raping the refugees in or around Potocari, in those
         23  factories that you mentioned?
         24       A.   Yes, Your Honour, they did.  In some cases
         25  refugees had been beaten, and as soon as one of my

          1  soldiers noticed that, they stopped with it.  I got two
          2  reports from my soldiers on Thursday, after I met
          3  General Mladic; one report referring to an execution of
          4  one man and a second report about an execution of nine
          5  men of which they found the bodies.
          6            MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, we will be
          7  presenting evidence in regard to both of those
          8  incidents described by Colonel Karremans.
          9            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Thank you.
         10            Did you ever ask General Mladic during your
         11  meetings what happened to the people, the refugees?
         12       A.   No, because the last meeting I had with him
         13  was on the 21st, that was eight days later on, and we
         14  were not aware of what happened with the refugees.  I
         15  mean, in general, I know -- I knew that they were all
         16  evacuated to the Kladanj area and afterwards picked up
         17  by the Pakistani Battalion and by the International Red
         18  Cross, by the Norwegian Medical Company.  They built
         19  tents, shelters, supply points for the refugees.  A
         20  part of them had been transported to the air base of
         21  Tuzla and other parts of the amount of refugees were
         22  transported to other facilities.  That's the only thing
         23  I knew, and I didn't discuss that with General Mladic
         24  at all.
         25            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Would you say, Colonel,

          1  that you received adequate support you asked for from
          2  your superiors?
          3       A.   Again --
          4            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  During those difficult
          5  days before the fall of Srebrenica, you told us that
          6  you asked for support.
          7       A.   Yes.
          8            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Did you receive that
          9  support?
         10       A.   Your Honour, I can expand on that for days
         11  and days, of course.  That's why I was lucky that I
         12  could explain yesterday and at the beginning of the
         13  morning what happened with the inhabitants in the
         14  enclave, the refugees, and with my soldiers.
         15            We had our daily sitreps, our daily situation
         16  reports, in which we wrote everything that happened
         17  that day, what we needed for supplies.  Besides that, I
         18  reported at different times, several times, I must say,
         19  on the level of north-east command in Tuzla and the BH
         20  command in Sarajevo, what I needed to fulfil my
         21  mission.  I was very specific in that, exactly what we
         22  needed, medicines, food, diesel, et cetera.  I asked
         23  for support many, many times during our stay over
         24  there.
         25            I know that there have been many discussions

          1  on all levels, above the level of the battalion,
          2  sitting there with the population, isolated in an
          3  enclave like Srebrenica, but we didn't get any support
          4  at all.
          5            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  I'm going to ask you a
          6  last question and ask for your personal opinion,
          7  Colonel.
          8            Looking back, would you say that the United
          9  Nations and NATO did its best to help people, to save
         10  their lives?
         11       A.   On the one hand, yes.  If we should have had
         12  our freedom of movement, which was one of the points of
         13  the NATO -- United Nations resolutions of 1993, and we
         14  could travel back and forth to the safe areas in
         15  general, and to Srebrenica in particular, for my
         16  battalion but also for the International Red Cross, the
         17  other non-governmental organisations like the MSF, the
         18  UNHCR, and we were able to assist, help, the refugees,
         19  I think the answer is yes.  But because of the
         20  strangulation and because of the isolation and not
         21  having had support at all, then the answer is no.
         22            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Strangulation and
         23  isolation ordered by General Mladic.
         24       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         25            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Thank you, Colonel.  No

          1  further questions.
          2            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          3            I now ask my other fellow Judge if he has any
          4  questions.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Colonel Karremans, throughout
          6  these, perhaps, five meetings that you had with General
          7  Mladic, did he ever take into consideration your
          8  demands, or was it always, as you said, a monologue and
          9  he did not respond to any of your objections or claims?
         10       A.   I have had, let's say, three major meetings
         11  with him, but "meetings" between brackets, because in
         12  my opinion, a meeting is two directions and a monologue
         13  is not a meeting.  Indeed, those were monologues.
         14            In the second meeting I was able to explain
         15  the bad situation, and he made even notes of that, and
         16  that was it.
         17            The third meeting, on Wednesday morning, the
         18  woman and the other men of the committee could make
         19  their statements.  They made note of it and that was
         20  it.
         21            So the conclusion, only monologues, no
         22  two-way negotiations.  He did listen to my requests, if
         23  I may say so, but didn't support them at all.  He had
         24  his own line in negotiating or in telling what he would
         25  like to tell and what he'd like to do.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you express any disapproval
          2  of his method of separating men, as you said, between
          3  16 and, I think, 60 or 65 from women and children?  Did
          4  you object to that?
          5       A.   Yes, I did, Your Honour.  I objected to that
          6  already in the meeting when he said that by asking,
          7  "What is the meaning of that?"  His explanation was
          8  what I stated before, that he'd like to have the men
          9  between 16 and 60, to look if there were war criminals
         10  amongst them.  Maybe he thought that all the Bosnian
         11  soldiers were war criminals.  He didn't explain what
         12  he'd like to do with them except that he wants to speak
         13  with them all.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Did he ask you for information
         15  about these people, to give him any kind of indication
         16  of where they are and who they are?
         17       A.   No, Your Honour, he didn't.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  So there was absolutely no way
         19  of knowing about them through your battalion.
         20       A.   No, Your Honour.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  In your last meeting with him,
         22  you said it was on Friday morning, by that time it
         23  seems that you had already known about the executions
         24  you mentioned.  Were you aware of everything that had
         25  happened and the way the refugees fleeing away were

          1  treated?
          2       A.   No, I think not at all.  The information in
          3  those days confirmed the information about, let's say,
          4  the military side of what was going on in the
          5  battalion, resupplying, what had to be done before our
          6  own evacuation, if I may say so, and lastly, what
          7  happened during our week that we stayed there, and
          8  negotiations between some of the officers of my
          9  battalion staff and some of the BSA soldiers on wounded
         10  persons.  I had still one of the colonel surgeons in
         11  Bratunac in hospital to see what was going on with the
         12  wounded persons over there.  We had discussions about
         13  the diesel because on that Friday after the evacuations
         14  I got a lot of diesel; what we should do with medicines
         15  and food.
         16            Those were more or less the subjects we
         17  discussed in a couple of, let's say, small meetings,
         18  not with General Mladic, because I haven't seen him
         19  after the evacuation, but with his officers.  I think
         20  that was it.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  But did you include any mention,
         22  not to say protest, against the executions or the
         23  things you heard about in this last meeting you had
         24  with him, and what was his response, if you did?
         25       A.   I haven't protested in the last meeting

          1  because I even didn't expect that meeting.  I was not
          2  aware of that because we came -- we had a message
          3  through our communications systems, the ops room, then
          4  had to show up, let's put it that way, again in the
          5  Bratunac Hotel.  Sitting with his whole crowd over
          6  there, we had -- he was again a lit bit monologueing
          7  and asking me how the battalion was, how they were
          8  doing, and if we were prepared to move and ready to go,
          9  and there was hardly any opportunity to evaluate, let's
         10  put it that way, what happened in all the weeks and
         11  days before.  To be frank, I hadn't thought about the
         12  idea of asking him what happened with the refugees.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  According to you, he was present
         14  all the time and he was aware of all that was
         15  happening.
         16       A.   He was present during the six days there of
         17  the attack and invasion of the enclave, at least I
         18  presume.  He was present during the evacuation.  He had
         19  been there two times, which I explained, and if he
         20  wasn't there, he was at the hotel in Bratunac which he
         21  used as a command post, and a kazerne in Bratunac which
         22  he used as a command post for, let's say, the other
         23  things he had to do concerning Gorazde, Zepa, and I
         24  don't know what.
         25            After my last meeting with him, a short,

          1  short meeting on that Thursday morning, I hadn't seen
          2  him before -- I hadn't seen him afterwards, except that
          3  I got some orders from the higher echelons about our
          4  own travel to either the Kladanj/Tuzla area or to
          5  Zagreb -- that was still a point of discussion on the
          6  higher echelons -- and one asked me if I could, let's
          7  say, come in contact with General Mladic to discuss
          8  that, because nobody had contact with him since the
          9  evacuation, nobody from the higher commands.
         10            So I got, let's say, some notes by fax, made
         11  a small letter about it and sent that to his
         12  interpreter, Petar, who lived in Bratunac, with the
         13  request to hand it over to General Mladic and ask for a
         14  response.  I got a response, I think, on Friday, the
         15  same Friday when the first convoys with food and diesel
         16  came in.  That was the only contact on paper I had with
         17  him.
         18            In his reply, or his answer, he said, "Yes, I
         19  will take your requests concerning your leave, whenever
         20  that should occur, and your requests on the lost
         21  equipment," he said "lost equipment," not "stolen
         22  equipment," he will take that into consideration and
         23  asked me to have patience.  He should have a meeting
         24  with General Smith on Sunday, and I think that occurred
         25  on the 19th, and in that meeting he should discuss the

          1  leave of DutchBat, and then he should come back to,
          2  let's say, make all the arrangements for our leave.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  You speak of evacuation, and you
          4  mentioned that several times he asked you to assist in
          5  this evacuation; that means, really, that the
          6  deportation of the people of Srebrenica to the Bosniak
          7  side.  This deportation, although you did not assist,
          8  was very highly organised, and you said that buses came
          9  and that everything was very minutely organised.  So
         10  this was the headquarters of Mladic who did it.
         11       A.   Yes, Your Honour.  It was -- I think he
         12  ordered that himself.  What I stated before during many
         13  briefings, also open that everything was prepared --
         14  preplanned in advance.  And also the massive crowd of
         15  buses and vehicles, and I always use the example, in
         16  modern Western countries, if you like to have 30 or 40
         17  buses, then you have a challenge, but in a country like
         18  the former Yugoslavia or Bosnia-Herzegovina, to gather
         19  there 30 or 40 buses, you are not able to do that in
         20  one day, that must be preplanned a long time before.
         21  So he had a plan and he executed that plan more or less
         22  minute by minute or day by day.  He ordered for the
         23  evacuation.  He asked for assistance of the battalion
         24  but not more than -- and you will hear that from the
         25  next, I think, witnesses -- assist the people to go to

          1  the bus, prevail -- prevent, I must say, panic, chaos,
          2  and supplying the refugees, as much as I could, with
          3  water, food, and medicines, at least what I have left
          4  over.  That was the only assistance I could give.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned that 55 soldiers
          6  were taken into custody by the Serbs.  I think it was
          7  on the 6th of July.  How were they treated and how long
          8  did they stay?
          9       A.   Your Honour, that was not on the 6th of
         10  July.  On the 6th of July, on the Thursday, let's say,
         11  the invasions started, the attacks or -- yes, the
         12  attacks started, the fighting between both parties in
         13  the southern part of the enclave, also by shelling
         14  compounds and the city of Srebrenica itself.  It ended
         15  up on Saturday, two and a half days later, on the
         16  retreat of OP Foxtrot that one of my soldiers died.
         17            After that, let's say, Saturday afternoon and
         18  Sunday and Monday, he picked -- or he attacked a lot of
         19  observation posts by using force, weapons and soldiers,
         20  encircled them -- circled them and took the soldiers
         21  hostage and took them with him.  He gathered at the end
         22  55 of my soldiers at two points; one in Bratunac, in
         23  the northern part of -- let's say north of the enclave,
         24  and one in Simici, south of the enclave.  At the end,
         25  after the evacuation, they were gathered together, all

          1  55.
          2            I had a talk with them, not with all 55 but
          3  with 30 persons staying in Bratunac, and I asked, in
          4  the first meeting I had with General Mladic, if I was
          5  able or allowed to speak with them.  "Yes," he said,
          6  "you are able to do that, you are allowed to do
          7  that."  I had a small talk with the soldiers, asked
          8  them if they were treated well.  They said yes, they
          9  were treated reasonably well.  And that same applied,
         10  which I heard later on already being back in the
         11  Netherlands, to the other 25 soldiers from Simici.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned several times that
         13  you raised the matter to the higher echelons, to your
         14  higher echelons.  Was there a prompt response, or did
         15  they leave you just to your fate?
         16       A.   Looking at the circumstances at that time and
         17  knowing that both commanding officers of the north-east
         18  command and the BH command were not available, I had to
         19  deal with both chiefs of staff.  My direct superior
         20  was, of course, the commanding officer of north-east
         21  command in Tuzla.  What I did was every time I thought
         22  it was necessary, in shelters and in my own offices or
         23  in the communication centre of the battalion staff, I
         24  had direct communications with either the north-east
         25  command or BH command.

          1            We did report -- we did make our reports
          2  verbally, at least I did it -- it was one of my
          3  responsibilities to the higher echelons -- and we did
          4  it every day at 6.00 by the daily situation reports, on
          5  paper, by fax.
          6            In conclusion, my direct superior in Tuzla,
          7  but also the command in Sarajevo, were well aware of
          8  what was going on and what happened minute by minute in
          9  the enclave, every day of our stay over there.  Again,
         10  asking for support, logistical support, in the weeks
         11  before, or even, which I stated before, close air
         12  support, no.  The support was words.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  I'd like to ask you also, in one
         14  of the meetings where you mentioned Major Nikolic, he
         15  stated that all Muslims should leave Bosnia.
         16       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  That was at an official meeting?
         18       A.   That was -- no.  We had a sequence of
         19  meetings with both parties, not together.  We tried to
         20  have them together around the negotiation table.  My
         21  predecessor did.  He wasn't able to do that one or two
         22  times.  We weren't because of the quarrels, because of
         23  the fights over and over.  So we had, every week, a
         24  fixed meeting with the civil authorities, with the
         25  military authorities, within the enclave, and also

          1  with, let's say, the commanding officer of the chief of
          2  staff of the BiH forces.
          3            We should have a meeting, a fixed meeting,
          4  every two weeks with the BSA outside, either on OP Echo
          5  or OP Papa, but that was not the case.  Meetings with
          6  the BSA were always when we liked to have that or when
          7  they liked to have it, very irregularly.
          8            It was at one of those irregular meetings
          9  where I was involved, somewhere in the middle of
         10  February, if I can remember, that I met Major Nikolic,
         11  and it was at that meeting that he stated what I said
         12  yesterday, about the Muslims killed half the Assembly
         13  during the Second World War, et cetera, and that he
         14  hated Muslims and, in his opinion, the Muslims should
         15  leave the complete territory of Bosnia.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much, Colonel.
         17       A.   You're welcome.
         18            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] I have some
         19  very short questions I would like to put to you.
         20            The troops you talked about, where did they
         21  come from?  What was their composition?  You talked
         22  about the fresh troops that arrived.
         23       A.   Yes, Your Honour.  We were -- no.  Around the
         24  safe area of Srebrenica there were three brigades: the
         25  so-called Skelani Brigade in the south, the Bratunac

          1  Brigade in the north, and a third brigade in the west.
          2  Those brigades belonged to the regular army of the BSA,
          3  the regular Drina Corps.  But those three brigades
          4  consisted of elderly soldiers, soldiers from that area,
          5  an area where they belonged.
          6            As soon as -- on the 6th of July the invasion
          7  started or, let's say, the attack of the enclave
          8  started, which General Mladic stated later on he used
          9  three new brigades, one in the south, one in the east,
         10  and he had one in reserve in the north.  That means
         11  that he didn't use the regular forces around the safe
         12  area of Srebrenica.  He especially used other forces,
         13  which we had noticed two days before the 6th of July.
         14            In Bratunac there was a lot of battle noise,
         15  there was a lot of noise in moving tanks, artillery,
         16  military vehicles, all those moves which we had
         17  reported on on a regular basis and in our daily
         18  sitreps.
         19            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you.  Did
         20  you think there were any militia, fresh people, fresh
         21  militia, in these forces?
         22       A.   Yes.  Your Honour, what I had heard, I hadn't
         23  noticed that myself, was that the so-called Arkan's
         24  Brigade was involved as well.  That was a brigade with,
         25  let's say, special forces from the BSA.  But personally

          1  I didn't see them during those six days and during,
          2  let's say, the evacuation of refugees.  That could be
          3  possible.
          4            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] The evacuation
          5  with the Dutch Battalion, was it possibly in the plan
          6  with your superior?  Was the Dutch Battalion asked to
          7  provide that assistance?
          8       A.   Do you mean the assistance, Your Honour, for
          9  the evacuation of the refugees?
         10            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] I'm talking
         11  about the evacuation.  You've talked about a meeting
         12  with General Mladic, I think it was the second or the
         13  third, I can't remember, where all of a sudden he said
         14  that you had to proceed with the evacuation.  It seems
         15  that it wasn't tackled during your first or second
         16  meeting in Bratunac.  So I had the impression that you
         17  weren't surprised, that you knew that there might be an
         18  evacuation, or did you decide, as the superior, did you
         19  decide that the evacuation would take place?
         20       A.   During the first two meetings I didn't have a
         21  clue about what was going on about the destiny of the
         22  refugees.  Knowing that we had about 25.000 refugees in
         23  and around the compound, one of my major points was to
         24  ask support, as much as I could get, from the BSA; what
         25  I stated before, food, water medicines, a good

          1  arrangement for my wounded -- for the wounded refugees,
          2  about 100 or 110, and that is what I asked for during
          3  the meetings -- the first meetings with General
          4  Mladic.
          5            In his third meeting he started to talk about
          6  evacuation, and that was a surprise for me as well.  We
          7  arranged a committee of the refugees to cooperate with
          8  them about what should be done, or what should we do on
          9  the circumstances under which those refugees were there
         10  in and around our compound, what could we do, as much
         11  as possible, and we needed a committee for that, to
         12  talk about it.
         13            I used that committee -- and I mean in a nice
         14  sense of using it -- I asked them if they could assist
         15  me as much as possible, at least to respond to the
         16  questions, and they, that committee, went with me to
         17  the third meeting.  That was the meeting where General
         18  Mladic stated or told about the evacuation.
         19            I was as surprised as everybody was, because
         20  the meeting was at the end of Wednesday morning and at
         21  3.00 Wednesday afternoon the evacuation started
         22  already.  So I was confronted with something new, an
         23  evacuation of 25.000 persons, and then I have to think
         24  quickly --
         25            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Colonel, I'm

          1  sorry.  I heard what you said but what I'm trying to
          2  find out is:  Faced with that surprise -- you were
          3  surprised, you said; the refugee committee was
          4  surprised -- did you have adequate time to ask your
          5  hierarchial structure to see whether you can proceed in
          6  such a way, or did you have sufficient freedom to
          7  decide?
          8       A.   I had no time to -- I had time to inform my
          9  higher echelons, which I did.  I asked several times
         10  what could I do, how could you assist me, what should I
         11  do.  No answer on that.  There was no policy in that
         12  either.  So I could, let's say, do what was the best
         13  thing to do at the moment.  And knowing what time was
         14  left between that third meeting and 1.00, which was
         15  mentioned by Mladic when the evacuation should start --
         16  we were completely surprised, everybody, that such a
         17  thing could happen and that he already had organised
         18  such an evacuation -- I wasn't able to do anything
         19  about it.  That's why we decided -- I decided in the
         20  beginning to put on every bus, or whatsoever, a
         21  soldier, that was the least I could do, and assist the
         22  refugees as much as possible in going to the buses,
         23  giving them food, water, and medical care, and look for
         24  them during the evacuation.
         25            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you.  My

          1  final question.  If you talk about the list -- we
          2  talked yesterday to the investigator from the
          3  Prosecution, and it seems that there was a list of men
          4  in an age range which I did not quite understand.  Can
          5  you very quickly tell us what happened with this list
          6  of men?  What was their age and what happened?
          7       A.   We had, as you know, Your Honour, 25.000
          8  persons in and around the enclave, almost all women,
          9  children, and elderly people.  We estimated about two
         10  to three per cent men, men between 16 and 60 more or
         11  less, and we didn't know how many men there were -- in
         12  general we knew -- how many men there were outside the
         13  compound.  We had asked through the interpreters and
         14  through the committee if it was possible to note or,
         15  yes, set on a piece of paper all the names of those
         16  persons, male persons, between 16 and 60 within the
         17  compound.  There was no time left to do that for all
         18  the other persons.
         19            There was one person who asked me in the
         20  past, "Why didn't you put the names of all the refugees
         21  on a piece of paper?"  You can imagine, Your Honours,
         22  that that's impossible.  What we did was we put the
         23  names of men within the compound on a list, what I can
         24  remember, 239.  There were about 70 who didn't like
         25  that and they didn't do that.  We have done that on

          1  purpose because we would like to know what could have
          2  happened with those persons.  What happened with the
          3  list, the lists have been faxed to Tuzla and to
          4  Zagreb.
          5            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Fine.  Colonel,
          6  the Tribunal would like to thank you for your
          7  testimony.
          8            Last question.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Colonel, did by any chance
         10  General Mladic's office get hold of this list?
         11       A.   I'm not sure about the answer I should give
         12  now, because there are two possible answers and maybe
         13  one of the witnesses after me could answer that
         14  question.  There are two possible answers.  One said,
         15  or it has been stated that one of my officers offered
         16  or handed over that list to one of the BSA officers at
         17  the gate.  Some others said, no, that was not the
         18  case.  I am still at this moment not aware of what was
         19  going on with the list towards the BSA.  I don't know.
         20  I can't answer the question, do or does the BSA -- did
         21  the BSA receive that list of persons.  I don't know.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you ask the officer?
         23       A.   No.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         25            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Prosecutor,

          1  based on the numerous questions we put -- once again,
          2  thank you, Colonel Karremans, to have spent so much
          3  time with us -- but do you have any wish to add any
          4  supplementary questions or not?
          5            MR. HARMON:  I do not, Your Honour.
          6            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Fine.  Colonel,
          7  in this Mladic/Karadzic case, we have finished with
          8  your testimony, and we will now finish until 2.30.
          9                 [Videotape of 4 July 1996 stopped]
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  I think it's time for us to have
         11  a break.
         12                 [Trial Chamber and legal officer
         13                 confer]
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Olivier Fourmy has something
         15  to say.
         16            MR. FOURMY: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         17  Mr. President.
         18            I think I would like to make a general remark
         19  at this point with regard to the French transcript of
         20  the testimony of Colonel Karremans and with regard to
         21  the Rule 61 hearing.  I think that it contains a
         22  certain number of mistakes with regard to the substance
         23  that was stated, at least in the French version.  I
         24  think that when Colonel Karremans speaks about BH
         25  command in English, he was talking about the one in

          1  Sarajevo not the Bosnian army which changes the sense
          2  of what he was saying.
          3            Perhaps the Prosecutor could confirm this,
          4  what I have just put forward.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  [Interpretation] I think that
          6  Mr. Mark Harmon ought to respond to that, perhaps.
          7            [In English] What do you think, Mr.
          8  McCloskey?
          9            MR. McCLOSKEY:  As we saw, he was there and
         10  would probably be in a good position to respond.  But I
         11  don't doubt Mr. Fourmy's statement.  I'm sure there are
         12  some errors that might change things a little bit; that
         13  just seems to be a natural part of the process.  But we
         14  can discuss that with Mr. Harmon and see if we need to
         15  make a change or try to add an addendum or something.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  We'll trust you with this
         17  mission.
         18            [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. Fourmy, for
         19  that important correction.
         20            [In English] I suggest we have a break for
         21  half an hour, and then we'll try to finish with your
         22  videos today, Mr. McCloskey.
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  We have another video of
         24  Mr. Koster that lasts for 59 minutes so ...
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  All right.  If we start at 1.35,

          1  1.40, will we finish by 2.40?
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes.  We'll be a little
          3  over.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  I'll request our interpreters
          5  and our staff to give us ten minutes more.  Thank you.
          6            The hearing is adjourned for half an hour.
          7            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] If I may.  I
         10  do apologise.  But in this case, if we were to continue
         11  working late, we're going to have the same problem we
         12  had yesterday with the medical intervention for General
         13  Krstic, medical treatment, so we have the same
         14  problem.  We should like to propose -- the Defence
         15  proposes, if you permit, that General Krstic could
         16  leave the courtroom earlier, like he did yesterday.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  The same solution would apply
         18  today too.  He can either leave now or he can leave at
         19  2.15, it's up to him.  But you agree that we should
         20  finish with the videos today.
         21            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
         22  Honour.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you
         25  too.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  The trial is adjourned for half
          2  an hour.
          3                 --- Recess taken at 1.13 p.m.
          4                 --- On resuming at 1.50 p.m.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Please proceed,
          6  Mr. McCloskey.
          7            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes.  We're ready to go with
          8  the testimony of Mr. Koster, which is 59 minutes.  We
          9  have another tape which we'll save for another time of
         10  Pasaga Mesic, which is about half an hour.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Which means that we have another
         12  hour and a half to go?
         13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, for two witnesses.  One
         14  witness is an hour and then the other witness is 30
         15  minutes, but we can save that for a time -- if there's
         16  ever a time we don't have enough witnesses in the
         17  trial, we can put in that tape.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  I'm ready for both options, so
         19  what do you prefer?  What does the Defence counsel
         20  prefer, and the registrar?
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  We've talked about it and the
         22  one-hour tape appears to be, with Mr. Harmon's input,
         23  the decision that we've made.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  So one hour will take us
         25  to ten to three.

          1            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, approximately.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  That will be enough, I think.
          3  We'll stop at ten to three, with the permission of the
          4  interpreters.  If there is any objection, I'm ready to
          5  hear it, if anybody has a commitment which he cannot
          6  avoid.  So everybody agrees.
          7            Of course, General Krstic will be allowed to
          8  leave at any time.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         10  I should just like to ask you so as not to lose time
         11  whether, without your permission at that stage, General
         12  Krstic can leave at 2.15, in the presence of the
         13  security officers, of course.  May he leave the
         14  courtroom at that time, without me having to ask you
         15  again?
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  You don't need to ask me.  Thank
         17  you.  The permission is granted.  Thank you.
         18            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         19  Mr. President.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Please proceed, Mr. McCloskey.
         21                 [Videotape of 4 July 1996 played]
         22            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Prosecutor, you
         23  have the floor.
         24            MR. OSTBERG:  Thank you very much.  We would
         25  like to call our next witness, Lieutenant Koster.
          1                 [The witness entered court]
          2            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Lieutenant
          3  Koster, do you hear me?  Do you hear me?  Please take
          4  the statement which has been given to you and read it
          5  out.
          6            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
          7  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
          8  truth.
          9                 WITNESS:  LIEUTENANT KOSTER
         10            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         11  Lieutenant.  Please be seated.
         12            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
         13            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] I think my
         14  first question would go to the Prosecutor, and he will
         15  introduce you to us.
         16            MR. OSTBERG:  Thank you, Your Honour.
         17                 Examined by Mr. Ostberg:
         18       Q.   Lieutenant Koster, would you please state
         19  your full name and spell it for the record.
         20       A.   My last name is Koster.  I'll spell it.
         21  K-o-s-t-e-r.
         22       Q.   Thank you.  What is your present occupation?
         23       A.   I'm a logistics officer and an infantry
         24  soldier.
         25       Q.   In the Dutch army?

          1       A.   In the Dutch army, that's correct.
          2       Q.   Have you been serving with the United
          3  Nations?
          4       A.   Yes, I did.
          5       Q.   Would you please tell the Court where and
          6  when?
          7       A.   I served in Srebrenica, and that was January
          8  1995 till July 1995.
          9       Q.   When did you start, did you say?
         10       A.   In January.
         11       Q.   In January.  Was Colonel Karremans your
         12  commanding officer?
         13       A.   Yes, he was.
         14       Q.   What was your position with the Dutch
         15  Battalion?
         16       A.   My position was to be the logistics officer
         17  of the battalion.
         18       Q.   Just give us the outline of your duties in
         19  that position.
         20       A.   Well, I had to manage all logistic affairs,
         21  although we had few means, and, well, that meant very
         22  strict planning and distributing our logistic affairs.
         23       Q.   Where in the chain of command were you placed
         24  in that position?
         25       A.   I was a staff officer, and my direct

          1  commander, my logistic commander, was Major Franken.
          2       Q.   Thank you.  Were you on duty in the beginning
          3  of July 1995?
          4       A.   Yes, I was.
          5       Q.   Where?
          6       A.   I was on duty in Potocari, inside the
          7  compound.
          8       Q.   Inside the compound.
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   So your working place was inside the compound
         11  mostly.
         12       A.   Most of the time, yes.
         13       Q.   Okay.  You were there even on the 11th of
         14  July, 1995?
         15       A.   Yes, I was also outside the compound then,
         16  yes.
         17       Q.   Will you tell us about what happened after
         18  the fall of Srebrenica when refugees started to arrive
         19  in Potocari?
         20       A.   Yes, that was on the 12th -- sorry, that was
         21  on the 11th of July.  We were ordered to go outside and
         22  to form a unit to receive the refugees.  So we went
         23  outside and made a hole in the fence from where we
         24  could guide the refugees towards the compound.
         25            When we were posted outside, approximately at

          1  1500 hours, the refugees arrived in a few and small
          2  groups at first, and, well, most of them were women and
          3  children and older women and older men.  They were
          4  terrified, they were afraid, looking for help, and when
          5  we were there, well, we couldn't tell them what to do
          6  at that point.
          7       Q.   You said that you formed a unit to take care
          8  of the incoming refugees.  How big was that unit?
          9       A.   Well, approximately 30 men at first.
         10       Q.   Were you in command of these 30 men?
         11       A.   Yes, I was.
         12       Q.   You said you opened a hole in the fence.
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   Is that the way you led them into the
         15  compound?
         16       A.   Yes.  We were not allowed to let them in by
         17  the main gate.
         18       Q.   Why?
         19       A.   Because the road which led from Srebrenica to
         20  Potocari was constantly under the direct sight and
         21  direct fire from the Serbs.  For example, in the days
         22  before when we left the compound by vehicle, we were
         23  fired upon with mortar fire, that kind of thing.  So it
         24  was better for people to take another route and another
         25  way to the compound which was more covered by trees and

          1  buildings.  So that was --
          2       Q.   And you opened that hole in the fence.
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   When the people started to arrive, the first
          5  ones who arrived, did you show them all into the
          6  compound?
          7       A.   No, we were not allowed at first.  We first
          8  showed them the way to the large buildings of a former
          9  bus station, where bus repair and bus maintenance was
         10  done, and we told them to take cover inside of these
         11  buildings.
         12       Q.   When you are saying that you were not
         13  allowed, allowed by whom?
         14       A.   By my commander.
         15       Q.   By your commander.
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   What was the kind of shelter you gave them?
         18       A.   Sorry?
         19       Q.   What kind of shelter did you give them?
         20       A.   The big buildings of the former bus station.
         21       Q.   Outside the compound.
         22       A.   It was outside the compound, yes.
         23       Q.   Then when did they start entering the
         24  compound?
         25       A.   Well, that was later on that day.  When the

          1  total amount of people was going to be a big crowd, we
          2  were ordered to let the people into the compound in
          3  small groups of 25 persons, and send them through the
          4  hole in the fence to the compound.
          5       Q.   How did these people arrive?
          6       A.   Well, like I said before, first in small
          7  groups.  Later on they -- there was one big mass of
          8  people coming down the road from Srebrenica to
          9  Potocari.  Well, they came with a big, big noise, women
         10  crying, children screaming, children also crying, well,
         11  people in terror.  They came down the road towards our
         12  position.
         13       Q.   On foot?
         14       A.   On foot, yes.  When we could receive them, we
         15  just only could tell them to wait and to stay at our
         16  position.  We couldn't tell them what to do, and they
         17  kept asking these questions, "What are we going to do?
         18  What are the plans for now?"  They were very much
         19  afraid of what was going on with them, what was going
         20  to happen with them, but we couldn't tell them so --
         21  and they were -- sorry?
         22       Q.   Had they walked the way from the city of
         23  Srebrenica?
         24       A.   Most of them, yes.  Most of them.  There were
         25  several vehicles from the compound in Srebrenica to the

          1  compound in Potocari carrying some wounded.  But when
          2  they started to move, people who were not wounded
          3  picked their places; also on every spot of the vehicle
          4  where they could hang on, they got a place.
          5       Q.   When you're talking about these vehicles,
          6  were they UN vehicles?
          7       A.   Yes, they were our UN vehicles.
          8       Q.   No other means of transportation, like buses
          9  or trucks for these fleeing people?
         10       A.   Well, some APCs for medical aid.  Those APCs
         11  were also carrying some wounded people and some healthy
         12  people towards our position, and the wounded people
         13  toward the compound, yes.
         14       Q.   They started coming in small groups and then
         15  they grew more and more.
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Can you make some estimations, looking at
         18  what time they started and then how they slowly
         19  encompassed a big crowd of people?
         20       A.   Yes.  Well, I was ordered to make a rough
         21  counting of the people constantly.  Well, it started
         22  with ten people, then hundreds of people, and then even
         23  more, thousands of people.  Well, it started
         24  approximately -- they started coming around about 1500
         25  hours, and, well, until late in the evening it

          1  stopped.  So, for example, the road had a diameter of
          2  six metres and was fully crowded with people, most of
          3  them women, children, and older men.
          4       Q.   When you said you started to count them, did
          5  you do that yourself?
          6       A.   Yes.  Later on that day I compared with my
          7  colleagues to make a rough counting of the total number
          8  of people, and we came to a number of approximately
          9  15.000 people.
         10       Q.   15.000 people.
         11       A.   15.000 people, yes.
         12       Q.   How many of them were led into or brought
         13  into the compound?
         14       A.   Well, on top of the 15.000, there were 4.000
         15  to 5.000 people let into the compound.  So at the end
         16  of the day there were 15.000 outside the compound and
         17  4.000 to 5.000 inside the compound.
         18       Q.   We're talking now about the 11th of July.
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Did they stop coming in the evening?
         21       A.   Yes, they stopped.  There were -- the crowds
         22  stopped.  There were a few people coming down the road
         23  still, but the big mass, the big mass of people, the
         24  big crowd, stopped coming towards our position, yes.
         25  It was fully filled with these people.

          1       Q.   What did 30 soldiers do to care for these
          2  people?
          3       A.   Well, during the day I ordered for some
          4  reinforcements because we couldn't stand any longer to
          5  hold the people.  We had some interpreters to make it
          6  clear for them what to do.  Well, what we were doing
          7  down there was the best we could, giving them some
          8  medical help, telling them that we would guide them and
          9  escort them and protect them as best we could.  Well,
         10  whether it was help -- any help needed, we were there.
         11       Q.   And that with 30 persons?
         12       A.   Well, I ordered some reinforcements.  Later
         13  on that day, I guess it would be 50 to 60 men outside.
         14       Q.   What kind of medical support could you give
         15  them?
         16       A.   Mainly first aid.
         17       Q.   Like bandages and things like that?
         18       A.   If we had some, yes, some bandages.  There
         19  were several wounded men and women, also women giving
         20  birth to children at our place.  We also had some
         21  assistance from MSF.
         22       Q.   "MSF" is?
         23       A.   Medecins Sans Frontiers.  So the wounded, we
         24  could give them only the first aid because we didn't
         25  have more means outside, also inside the compound.

          1       Q.   What about giving them food and drink then?
          2       A.   Well, outside it was impossible for us to do
          3  because we had so scarce means of food rations and all
          4  that, so we couldn't give them any food outside the
          5  compound.  What I learned later on is that we made a
          6  soup of food rations, mixed, mingled, with water for
          7  people inside the compound.  Outside the compound, some
          8  people were carrying jerrycans and bottles of water,
          9  carrying water with them, and nearby our position there
         10  was a small well where people could get some water, so
         11  that was -- it was needed because it was tremendously
         12  hot that day, so water was a very needed factor over
         13  there.
         14       Q.   The people inside could get some soup to eat
         15  or drink, but outside, could you give them anything at
         16  all apart from the water from the well?
         17       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         18       Q.   Could you paint the picture, what it looked
         19  like when nightfall came.  What did it look like in and
         20  around the compound then?
         21       A.   Well, it was like being on a scene.  It was a
         22  little bit surrealistic.  Being outside, these people,
         23  I slept outside, also my men slept outside.  We did
         24  some patrolling that night and we had some posts to
         25  protect them.  Well, the big noise stopped, all the

          1  screaming, et cetera, and all the shouting and crying
          2  stopped during the night, although little children kept
          3  crying on.  The noise decreased so -- but it was very
          4  surrealistic being there.
          5       Q.   Were there any attacks from the Bosnian Serb
          6  army, or any soldiers or units attacking this amount of
          7  people?
          8       A.   Well, not in person but we were fired upon
          9  with mortar fire during the day.  Well, the shelling
         10  wasn't among the people.  It was very close, close
         11  firing, approximately 50 metres from our position.
         12  Among the houses nearby our position, the explosions of
         13  the grenades, of the mortar grenades, came down, yes.
         14  That's true.
         15       Q.   But these crowds of people were not shelled
         16  or fired at directly.
         17       A.   Not directly, no.  No.
         18       Q.   Then you said you had some 30 people and some
         19  reinforcements.  What about the rest of the personnel
         20  of the Dutch Battalion?  Where were they deployed
         21  during this time?  What I want to know is:  How many
         22  persons, how many soldiers, of the battalion in total
         23  were present in Potocari when this flood of refugees
         24  arrived?
         25       A.   Well, it should be approximately 200 men, I

          1  guess.
          2       Q.   Two-hundred men.
          3       A.   Yes, I guess.
          4       Q.   Where were the rest of the battalion
          5  deployed?
          6       A.   They were assigned to the OPs.
          7       Q.   And "OPs" are?
          8       A.   Observation posts.
          9       Q.   Observation posts.
         10       A.   Yes.  Also part of them were located in the
         11  compound of Srebrenica.  But most of these men and
         12  women were supply forces so they were not fighter men,
         13  they were not infantrymen.
         14       Q.   But the ones you're talking about in
         15  Potocari, those were fighting men, infantry soldiers?
         16       A.   A few of them, yes, but most of them were
         17  supply forces.
         18       Q.   Most of them were supply forces.  Were any of
         19  your personnel taken hostage or assaulted during this
         20  day, the 11th?
         21       A.   No, not on the 11th.
         22       Q.   Okay.  Could any of you have any rest the
         23  night between the 11th and the 12th of July last year?
         24       A.   Well, for me personally, no.  For most of
         25  them, I guess not, because we were busy helping people,

          1  doing some patrolling outside the compound among the
          2  people.  Well, maybe you could get an hour or two of
          3  sleep but it wasn't such a rest.  You couldn't rest
          4  very well.
          5       Q.   Will you then turn your attention to the
          6  following day and give us an account of what happened
          7  on the 12th of July, 1995.
          8       A.   Well, in the morning it was relatively
          9  quiet.  The people, well, they woke up and started
         10  asking questions about what was going on and what we
         11  were planning to do and what the Serbs were planning to
         12  do, so we couldn't tell.
         13            We carried on giving them medical aid.  Still
         14  wounded people came down to our position asking for
         15  doctors, asking for medical help.  Still women were
         16  looking for their children like the day before, because
         17  they lost their children in the big crowd of people.
         18  And also children looking for their families, those
         19  kinds of things.  That carried on all morning.  Also
         20  the sun appeared again so it became tremendously hot
         21  again that day.
         22            Later on that day, approximately at 1300
         23  hours --
         24       Q.   What time?
         25       A.   1300 hours.

          1       Q.   1300, yes.
          2       A.   We heard the noise of tanks and APCs, and I
          3  heard by radio that there was a tank and an APC coming
          4  down the road toward the compound.  So the people --
          5  well, there was panic and the people were scared, and
          6  they ran down to the south of our location.  So we had
          7  to wait for what was going on then and wait for the
          8  Serbs to make a move.
          9       Q.   Okay.
         10       A.   When they did, they came to our position, and
         11  also to the compound.
         12       Q.   You're now talking about the army, the
         13  Bosnian Serb army.
         14       A.   That's correct.
         15       Q.   Yes.
         16       A.   Yes.  They came to our position.  We made a
         17  demarcation line of some red and white tape over the
         18  road and, well, they stayed behind the tape.  Some of
         19  them asked for the commanding officer at my location,
         20  so that was me, and he introduced himself and so do I.
         21  I can't remember his name.
         22            I asked him what he was planning to do and he
         23  didn't tell me.  Well, after that he turned his back on
         24  me and went down to his forces.  At that time there
         25  were, well, approximately 20 to 30 Serbian soldiers at

          1  our position at the road.  Well, their action was just
          2  walking around, looking at the people, also shouting at
          3  the people, asking questions.  I had an interpreter
          4  next to me so he could translate what they were
          5  saying.
          6       Q.   Could you give us an example of what they
          7  said to the people?
          8       A.   Well, most of the times they were mocking at
          9  them, and doing that, it was a very odd situation
         10  because they sat down on the ground and started
         11  singing.  They also -- they actually didn't make a
         12  move.  They were just saying over there at their
         13  location, behind the red and white tape, probably -- I
         14  don't know what they were doing.  So we just could stay
         15  there and wait for what they were going to do.
         16       Q.   Then what happened?
         17       A.   Later on that day, Major Nikolic came down
         18  also to my position and he introduced himself.
         19       Q.   Did you know him beforehand?
         20       A.   Yes, I recognised him from photos in the
         21  operations room.
         22       Q.   Yes.
         23       A.   Well, he wanted to have a look among the
         24  people and he wanted to walk through to the other end
         25  of our location.  At that time it was reported from my

          1  southern post, which was the last units of the Bravo
          2  Company, that also at their location some Serbian
          3  soldiers arrived.  Well, we escorted Major Nikolic with
          4  our liaison officer and an observer, and he walked down
          5  through the people.
          6            After that he returned, and also the
          7  situation stayed the same for a couple of hours
          8  probably.  Then one of the commanders came to my
          9  position and told me that he would bring a vehicle
         10  loaded with bread for the people and that we should
         11  make way for this vehicle.  It really appeared, and
         12  then they started to give bread to the people.  They
         13  also had a camera team accompanying them and the camera
         14  team, well, they were filming while they were giving
         15  bread to the people.
         16       Q.   How many people did get some bread?  Did they
         17  have something for everybody?
         18       A.   No, not at all.  It was a very small truck
         19  and, well, they were throwing the bread and giving the
         20  bread to the people.  My interpreter told me that while
         21  we were doing that they were shouting at the people
         22  again and mocking them and calling them names.
         23            Well, the vehicle returned one more time also
         24  loaded with bread, and also a fire truck came down to
         25  our position to give the people some water.  Well, one

          1  by one, women were allowed to leave the crowd and to
          2  fill up their bottles with water.  Everything was
          3  filmed by the Serbs.  Then the fire truck disappeared
          4  again.
          5            Later on that day, it should be approximately
          6  at 1600 hours, more troops came down to our position,
          7  more vehicles, more jeeps, more civilian vehicles.  At
          8  one time my interpreter told me that he thought he had
          9  seen General Mladic, and General Mladic came to my
         10  position.  He introduced himself, and so did I, and he
         11  asked me who was the commander in charge.  I asked him
         12  what he was planning to do.  Well, at first he didn't
         13  tell me anything and he walked right through our line
         14  of tape and towards the people.  At that time, of
         15  course, I reported to my commanding officer and I was
         16  told that I should send Mladic to the compound, to
         17  Colonel Karremans, so he could talk to him.  But he
         18  wouldn't do so --
         19       Q.   He wouldn't?
         20       A.   No.
         21       Q.   Who wouldn't, Mladic?
         22       A.   General Mladic.
         23       Q.   So you asked him to go and talk to the
         24  commanding officer.
         25       A.   Yes, several times.

          1       Q.   But he said no.
          2       A.   He said, "No, I am doing what I please to do,
          3  and I am in charge here and Mate Boban tells me what to
          4  do.  I am outside here and you will see what's going to
          5  happen."  He told us to cooperate or else there would
          6  be -- we were, you know, told to cooperate with him, we
          7  would be best off by cooperating.
          8       Q.   You said "or else."  Did he --
          9       A.   No.  We would be best off by cooperating,
         10  those were the words said.
         11       Q.   Yes.  Go on with the story, please.
         12       A.   Then he went to the people and he spoke to
         13  the people not to be afraid, that he should -- he would
         14  take care of them.  He was talking to little children
         15  accompanied by a filming team, a camera team.  I was
         16  constantly protesting that he should go to the
         17  compound.  While doing that, some buses arrived and I
         18  reported that.  Then I asked him again what he was
         19  going to do.  He was irritated and he told me that he
         20  would evacuate the people to another place.  At once
         21  some of the Serbian soldiers pulled down several of my
         22  men.
         23       Q.   What did they do?
         24       A.   They pulled down and pulled away several of
         25  my men who were holding the civilians, and, well, the

          1  Serbs told the civilians to go to the buses, to get
          2  inside the buses.  Well, at that time the situation was
          3  taken out of our hands and we could only escort the
          4  people and provide any harm [sic] of the people.  They
          5  were fully in charge at that time.
          6       Q.   How many Bosnian Serb troops were present
          7  then, in your estimation?
          8       A.   Well, I estimated approximately 40, 50 men
          9  and, well, they were still coming up, more men, men
         10  with dogs, all that kind of thing.
         11       Q.   You were outnumbered.
         12       A.   Yes, we were severely outnumbered.  Yes,
         13  that's true.
         14       Q.   Okay.  Please go on.
         15       A.   Then I was told to escort the people and to
         16  provide any harming [sic] of the people, and we could
         17  not do anything else other than just escorting them.
         18  The Serbs took over and they pushed the people to go to
         19  the buses, and they kept on doing that till the buses
         20  were fully stuffed with people.  They were putting far
         21  more people inside the bus than normally is usual.  The
         22  buses drove away.  Then we had to stop the people again
         23  and we had to wait till other transport arrived at our
         24  location.
         25       Q.   Did you in any way convoy or send somebody

          1  with the buses when they went away?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Tell us about that.
          4       A.   I learned later that we escorted the buses
          5  and the trucks by sending some of our men with a jeep
          6  driving in front or with the buses.  Well, the first
          7  transport, they succeeded escorting them, and the other
          8  transports, well, the jeeps were taken away from us so
          9  we couldn't escort them any more.
         10       Q.   By the Serbian soldiers.
         11       A.   By the soldiers, yes.
         12       Q.   Bosnian Serb soldiers, yes.  Was any
         13  separation of sexes taking place before they were
         14  loaded on buses?
         15       A.   Yes.  Well, they were looking for men, older
         16  men -- well, men of fighting age, potential fighting
         17  men, and they were separating them from their families
         18  and from the rest of the people.  Well, they kept on
         19  doing that the whole time.
         20       Q.   What happened to these men who were separated
         21  from their families?  Where did they go?
         22       A.   They put them inside a house, and from what I
         23  have seen they were just sitting there and waiting.
         24  Their personal belongings were taken away and put
         25  outside of the house, and I only saw these men

          1  waiting.  As far as we could, we were protesting
          2  against it, but we were, as you said before,
          3  outnumbered so we couldn't be at all places.
          4       Q.   Of course.  What about General Mladic?  Was
          5  he present while these things went on?
          6       A.   Well, I lost sight of him.  When the first
          7  buses started to drive away, I lost sight of him.
          8       Q.   This transportation of people started, as I
          9  remember you said, at about 1600 or --
         10       A.   That was the time when General Mladic
         11  arrived --
         12       Q.   When he arrived.
         13       A.   -- and, well, it shouldn't be more than a
         14  half hour, an hour later, when the buses arrived and
         15  drove away.
         16       Q.   How many busloads of people left Potocari
         17  this day, the 12th?
         18       A.   I didn't count them all but, well, they
         19  started -- I'm sorry, they ended up when night fell.
         20       Q.   With nightfall, they stopped.
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   Do you have an idea of how many busloads that
         23  was?  Do you have any idea how many people left on the
         24  first day?
         25       A.   No.

          1       Q.   Half, a third?  No idea?
          2       A.   No, I have no estimation.
          3       Q.   You can make no estimation.  They stopped at
          4  nightfall, you said.
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Still then, people were inside and outside
          7  the compound.
          8       A.   Yes, that's correct.
          9       Q.   Was anybody taken out of the compound on this
         10  first day and put on the buses, or was that people from
         11  outside?
         12       A.   From what I know, there were people from
         13  outside the compound because I was there.  I don't know
         14  if people from inside the compound were taken outside
         15  because I couldn't see it from my position.
         16       Q.   You couldn't see it.
         17       A.   I don't know that.
         18       Q.   You don't know that.  Then night came, and
         19  can you tell us something about what happened during
         20  the night?
         21       A.   Yes.  We were told by the Serbs that we had
         22  to clear the road and to join the people on the terrain
         23  in front of the former bus station.
         24       Q.   Clear the road of refugees.
         25       A.   Yes.  The road should stay open because they

          1  told us there could be some transport moving to
          2  Srebrenica, and from Srebrenica to Potocari.  Well, we
          3  collected the people at the point and we stayed there,
          4  patrolling during the night.  The Serbs, they left.
          5  Some of them came back during the night and they were
          6  taking our arms and also our vests and helmets.
          7       Q.   Can you describe in what way they did that.
          8       A.   Well, they joined -- they formed groups of
          9  three or four men, and they walked up to a UN soldier
         10  and told him to give away his weapon, his bulletproof
         11  vest, his helmet, and his equipment, and when he
         12  refused that, he was forced to do so.
         13       Q.   At gunpoint?
         14       A.   Me personally at gunpoint, yes.
         15       Q.   How many of your soldiers did lose their
         16  equipment in this way?
         17       A.   I don't know.  Many of them.
         18       Q.   Many out of these 30, 40 soldiers.
         19       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         20       Q.   The majority?
         21       A.   The majority, yes.
         22       Q.   That went on during the night.
         23       A.   Yes, in the beginning of the night.  Later on
         24  that night they disappeared, and I didn't know where
         25  they went.  We were alone with these people and then

          1  they were very, very quiet.  Well, we kept on
          2  patrolling during the night -- well, helping some sick
          3  people, also again wounded people who still asked for
          4  doctors, for medical help, and we had a doctor outside
          5  our position -- well, till morning came.
          6       Q.   Okay.  Then we arrive at the 13th of July.  I
          7  will now ask you to tell the Court what happened on
          8  that day.
          9       A.   On the 13th, well, we put down four APCs on
         10  the road to make some of the --
         11       Q.   "APCs" stands for?
         12       A.   Armoured personnel carriers.
         13       Q.   Armoured personnel carriers.
         14       A.   Armoured, yes.  Sorry.  To make some of them
         15  an artificial gate so we could guide the people in a
         16  better way.  Then at approximately 700 hours the buses
         17  arrived, and half an hour later the Serbs arrived.
         18  Then there were more and more troops coming down to our
         19  position, and when --
         20       Q.   Again, an estimation, if you can.  How many
         21  troops?
         22       A.   At least 50, 60 of them.  Then they started
         23  again to pull away my men and to put the people inside
         24  of the buses and the trucks, and that carried on during
         25  the day.

          1       Q.   Any attacks on you or your personnel during
          2  the day?
          3       A.   No.
          4       Q.   Shooting?
          5       A.   No.
          6       Q.   Nothing?
          7       A.   We heard some shooting on the west side of
          8  the compound coming from houses and that kind of
          9  thing.  But not on my position, there was no shooting.
         10       Q.   Did this separation type of handling, this
         11  thing, did that go on even this day?  Did they separate
         12  men from the rest of their families, or was that done
         13  only on the first day?
         14       A.   No, it still went on that day.  For example,
         15  we saw a 19-year-old boy being separated from his
         16  family and, well, we protested against it, and the
         17  Serbian soldier, he was impressed and let the boy go to
         18  the buses.  But they carried on separating the men,
         19  yes.
         20       Q.   That went on on the 13th of July, all day?
         21       A.   From what I've seen, yes.
         22       Q.   When was the place emptied of refugees or
         23  everybody evacuated?  When was that?
         24       A.   I will have to look it up.  One moment,
         25  please.  It was on the 13th of July.

          1       Q.   The 13th of July.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   What time of the day; can you recall that?
          4       A.   Well, it would be approximately at 1800
          5  hours.  I had to do my report at the compound and get
          6  some food and a few hours of sleep, two hours, and that
          7  was at 1600 hours.  When I reported to duty in the
          8  operations room, that was at 1830, I was told that it
          9  wasn't necessary any more because all the people had
         10  gone.
         11       Q.   All of them?
         12       A.   All of them had gone.
         13       Q.   Even the people who were in the compound?
         14       A.   Yes, except the wounded people.
         15       Q.   Except the wounded people?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   They left the wounded people.  What about the
         18  men who were separated?  Were they still around or were
         19  they gone also?
         20       A.   They were also gone.
         21       Q.   Did you see them go?
         22       A.   No, because I was in the compound sleeping.
         23       Q.   Did you see when the people were taken from
         24  that compound into the buses?
         25       A.   No, I didn't see that.

          1       Q.   You didn't see that.  Did you see or hear any
          2  violence during the 13th?  Was there any shooting then
          3  or other kinds of violence?
          4       A.   No, not in person.  We heard several single
          5  shots, like I told you before.  We did hear some
          6  rumours; that was on the 12th of July, while I was
          7  reporting at the compound.  We heard some rumours from
          8  people inside the compound that there was a place where
          9  they had seen eight or nine bodies laying down on the
         10  ground.  On the 13th of July, two colleagues of mine
         11  and I investigated that place.
         12       Q.   Was that in the vicinity of the compound --
         13  outside the compound?
         14       A.   Well, it was approximately -- well, 500
         15  metres away from the compound.
         16       Q.   What did you find?
         17       A.   When we came down to that place, we saw nine
         18  bodies laying in a field, near to a river.  We went up
         19  to that location and we took pictures.  We didn't
         20  actually investigate the bodies, but we saw seven of
         21  them lying down on the ground, with their face down to
         22  the ground.  Two of them were lying on their sides,
         23  their backs.  They had -- well, the seven of them had a
         24  shot in the back, in the middle of the back.  We took
         25  pictures, and we also found some papers.  But the

          1  bodies, they were just in civilian clothes, and from
          2  what I could see and make of it, they were men.
          3       Q.   You did these findings on the 13th of July.
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Did you hear some shooting you could relate
          6  to that incident, to these people's death?
          7       A.   Well, I only heard the several single shots
          8  during the day.  That's only what I have heard.
          9       Q.   Did you see other killed people around?
         10       A.   Yes, that was in the morning.  One man hanged
         11  himself on the ceiling of a small building, and he was
         12  already dead when we released him from the rope.
         13       Q.   Any other incidents of that kind?
         14       A.   No.
         15       Q.   So by the evening of the 13th, the place was
         16  empty, there were no refugees any more.
         17       A.   Outside of the compound, no.  Inside also,
         18  no, except the wounded people.
         19       Q.   The wounded people.  Did you see General
         20  Mladic more than these times on the 12th that you
         21  talked about?
         22       A.   Yes.  During the night on the 12th and on the
         23  13th, during that night I saw him passing by our
         24  position, sitting in a jeep.  He moved up to
         25  Srebrenica, and later on that night he moved back

          1  towards Potocari.
          2       Q.   So you saw him twice during that night.
          3       A.   Sorry?
          4       Q.   You saw him twice during that night?
          5       A.   Yes, that's correct.
          6       Q.   But he didn't stop?
          7       A.   No.
          8       Q.   You didn't talk to him?
          9       A.   He just drove on.
         10       Q.   Okay.  Then when only the wounded people were
         11  left, what happened then?  What did you do in the
         12  coming days?
         13       A.   Well, for me personally, I picked up my job
         14  again as a logistics officers, doing the things
         15  requested and waiting for us to leave the enclave.  We
         16  were making preparations for leaving the enclave
         17  because we didn't know if we could leave with all our
         18  equipment or just by taking our personal belongings and
         19  then leave the compound.  So I took up my old job.
         20       Q.   As a logistics officer, you can certainly
         21  tell us, how much equipment did you lose during these
         22  days?
         23       A.   Well, I don't know the exact numbers and
         24  figures.  We lost weapons; we did lose some jeeps.
         25       Q.   How many jeeps?
          1       A.   I don't know the exact figures.
          2       Q.   Can you make an estimation?
          3       A.   No.
          4       Q.   You can't.
          5       A.   APCs, we lost APCs, and we lost, well,
          6  equipment, soldiers' equipment, bulletproof vests, and
          7  helmets.
          8       Q.   When did you leave?  When did the battalion
          9  leave Srebrenica?
         10       A.   It was on the 21st, on Friday, July.
         11       Q.   The week after.
         12       A.   The week after that, yes.
         13            MR. OSTBERG:  Thank you very much.  Your
         14  Honours, I have concluded my examination.
         15            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         16  Mr. Ostberg.
         17            Fellow Judges, you have questions.  Please
         18  proceed.
         19            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Thank you.
         20                 Questioned by the Court:
         21            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Lieutenant Koster, you
         22  talk of 15.000 people coming from Srebrenica to
         23  Potocari looking for help.  Mostly, you said, they were
         24  women and children and elderly people.  Is that
         25  correct?

          1       A.   That's correct.
          2            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Were you expecting this
          3  exodus from Srebrenica?
          4       A.   I'm sorry.  Can you repeat the question?
          5            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Were you in Potocari, you
          6  and your team, expecting this exodus from Srebrenica?
          7       A.   Yes.  We were outside there to receive the
          8  refugees, yes, and we could expect that refugees should
          9  come to our position.  That's why we were posted
         10  outside.
         11            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Were you prepared for
         12  receiving them?
         13       A.   No.  Just being there, being posted there,
         14  and doing the best we can.  We didn't have the
         15  equipment, medical equipment, or even enough food to
         16  receive them.
         17            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Had you, your team, asked
         18  for help to your superiors or to the superior command
         19  of NATO or UNPROFOR to face this emergency?
         20       A.   I do not know.
         21            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Did you receive any
         22  additional support for help before or after the 11th of
         23  July?
         24       A.   No.
         25            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  What happened with these

          1  people, women, children, elderly, wounded people, when
          2  the Bosnian Serb soldiers arrived?
          3       A.   Sorry.  You're only talking now about the
          4  wounded people?
          5            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  About the women,
          6  children, elderly people in Potocari, coming from
          7  Srebrenica, when the Serb soldiers arrived.
          8       A.   Well, they were afraid and they were not
          9  harmed or anything by the Serbian people, from what I
         10  could see, outside the compound.  Well, later on,
         11  during the periods we were outside, they were put
         12  inside the buses and evacuated from my position.
         13            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Did you hear about
         14  massacres committed by Serb soldiers against Muslims in
         15  and around Srebrenica, Potocari, Bratunac at that time?
         16       A.   No.  I only learned on the Wednesday that
         17  there was a position -- there was a rumour about eight
         18  or nine bodies.
         19            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  After those days, had you
         20  heard about massacres committed?
         21       A.   No, only when I returned, in the news.
         22            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  Did Colonel Karremans, or
         23  anyone else, say no to General Mladic when he ordered
         24  the evacuation of the refugees?
         25       A.   I do not know that because they already

          1  started it when I was reporting it.  So the situation
          2  was completely taken out of our hands outside.
          3            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  But the refugees were
          4  under your support, under the UN support, under
          5  protection.
          6       A.   That's correct.
          7            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  So did you or your
          8  superior try to avoid that the refugees were taken out?
          9       A.   It was impossible to do because we were
         10  outnumbered.  We were pulled away, and then the Serbs,
         11  they pushed the people and shouted at the people to go
         12  to the buses now, to get inside these buses.  So being
         13  outnumbered, we couldn't do anything at that time.
         14            JUDGE ODIO-BENITO:  I see.  Thank you.  No
         15  further questions.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Lieutenant Koster, you just said
         17  that you were outnumbered, completely outnumbered.  In
         18  fact, you were in a state of helplessness, completely.
         19       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Were you at any moment
         21  threatened?
         22       A.   In person?
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  No, the whole group, in your
         24  capacity, you and your colleagues.
         25       A.   No.  We were just told to cooperate, that

          1  that would be the best for us.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes, "best for us" means that
          3  something could be worst; if there is something best,
          4  then something can be worst.
          5            You mentioned that Mladic himself told you,
          6  he told you you'd better cooperate, you are right, and
          7  then he told you, "You will see what is going to
          8  happen."  Is that right?
          9       A.   I'm sorry.  I don't understand the question.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Mladic, among his statements, he
         11  told you, "You are going to see what will happen."  You
         12  mentioned that from your notes.
         13       A.   I still don't understand your question.  I'm
         14  sorry.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  What did Mladic tell you?
         16       A.   Okay.  Yes, he told me that, and later on he
         17  told me that he was going to evacuate the people of
         18  Srebrenica.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.
         20       A.   Yes.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Then you mentioned that you saw
         22  them separate men of fighting age from the others.
         23       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you protest or anything?
         25       A.   Yes, we did.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  You did.  What was the reaction
          2  to your protest?
          3       A.   Well, sometimes they let the men go with
          4  their families and their wives.  Well, at the places we
          5  were -- we couldn't protest where we were not located,
          6  so we couldn't do a thing.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Did they pick them just at
          8  random, or did they have a list in their hands?
          9       A.   No, just at random.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Because there was a list of
         11  200-and-something people which nobody knew if it was
         12  given to them or not.  Do you have any idea about that?
         13       A.   I know about that list, yes, and that was on
         14  the compound -- at the compound.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  I beg your pardon?
         16       A.   That list was made just to make sure and to
         17  inform the Serbs that we were watching them and keeping
         18  things under control about what they were going to do
         19  with the men, and by that list we were also protecting
         20  them.  So we were checking them --
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  This list was made by your men,
         22  by the officers?
         23       A.   No, it was not.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  No.
         25       A.   It was made by a committee of the refugees

          1  inside the compound.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  And given to you?
          3       A.   No, not to me.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean to your --
          5       A.   My commanding officer.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.
          7       A.   From what I know, it was not given to the
          8  Serbs.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  You don't know if it was given
         10  to the Serbs or not.
         11       A.   From what I know, it was not given to the
         12  Serbs.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  It was not.  Thank you very
         14  much.
         15            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Lieutenant, on
         16  the basis of what we've heard, apparently there's some
         17  vehicles from the battalion that escorted the jeeps --
         18  some jeeps that escorted the vehicles, so you did have
         19  some jeeps that went along with the convoys.
         20            Now, I take it that those jeeps came back, at
         21  least some of them came back, so you had a chance to
         22  see some of your men before you left the compound.
         23  What did your men tell you about what happened, and
         24  were they aware of the events?
         25       A.   I only learnt about that when we left the

          1  enclave.  Before that I was constantly being outside,
          2  until the 13th, and I didn't know what was going on
          3  during these escorts.
          4            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Because the
          5  jeeps that were doing the escorting did not leave
          6  Potocari?
          7       A.   Some of them were already taken away at our
          8  main gate, and, well, that's what they told me while I
          9  was doing my reports.  Well, at least one of them made
         10  it through, and that was the first transport.  But that
         11  is something I learned later, when I left the enclave.
         12            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] When soldiers
         13  came back, because there was a gathering before you
         14  left the enclave, what did people say to one another?
         15  What did the soldiers say there?  Did anybody tell you
         16  anything?  Did they know anything?
         17       A.   No.
         18            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Nothing was
         19  said?
         20       A.   No.
         21            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] They didn't say
         22  anything about what they might have seen?  They didn't
         23  see anything?
         24       A.   No, because I wasn't speaking to them.  I was
         25  too busy at that time doing my job as a logistics

          1  officer so I don't know anything about that.  I'm
          2  sorry.
          3            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Fine.  You got
          4  together on a regular basis with the reports about the
          5  meetings with General Mladic, or was there a
          6  compartmentalisation between the different levels of
          7  command?
          8       A.   Can the interpreter repeat the question,
          9  please.
         10            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Did you have
         11  any input about the meetings with General Mladic, or
         12  was there no information trickling down at the various
         13  levels?
         14       A.   No, I didn't know what was going on.  I
         15  didn't know the exact details of the meetings with
         16  General Mladic.
         17            JUDGE JORDA: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         18            Mr. Ostberg, we have no further questions for
         19  the witness so we could have the usher show the witness
         20  out.
         21            Lieutenant, the Tribunal would like to thank
         22  you for your testimony which you provided on behalf of
         23  the Prosecution.  Then the Prosecution can show in the
         24  next witness.
         25                 [Videotape of 4 July 1996 completed]

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. McCloskey.
          2  That's all you have to offer us today, I hope.
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Your Honour.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  So we'll adjourn till tomorrow,
          5  at 9.30.  Thank you.
          6                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
