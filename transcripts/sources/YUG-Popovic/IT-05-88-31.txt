          9       A.   H-a-j-d-a-r-e-v-i-c.
         10            THE INTERPRETER:  The first letter is "H".
         11  I'm sorry.
         12            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         13       Q.   How old are you?
         14       A.   I'm 53.
         15       Q.   Are you Muslim by faith?
         16       A.   I am.
         17       Q.   Where are you from?
         18       A.   From Srebrenica.
         19       Q.   Did you spend most of your life in the
         20  Srebrenica area?
         21       A.   I did.
         22       Q.   Were you living there on July 11th, 1995?
         23       A.   I was.
         24       Q.   Where in Srebrenica were you living?
         25       A.   I was living at the exit from the town,

          1  towards Potocari, towards Bratunac.
          2       Q.   Who were you living with then?
          3       A.   I had two sons, a daughter-in-law, and a
          4  two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter.  Then my mother
          5  came to stay.  My brothers and sisters-in-law, they
          6  were living with me.
          7       Q.   Where was your husband at the time?
          8       A.   My husband was captured, and in 1994 he was
          9  exchanged and then he was in Tuzla.
         10       Q.   So he wasn't in Srebrenica in July of 1995.
         11       A.   He wasn't in Srebrenica, no.
         12       Q.   What happened on July 11th that caused you to
         13  make a decision?
         14       A.   I had to leave the house because the Serb
         15  army entered the town from up there.
         16       Q.   Why did the presence of the Serb army make
         17  you have to leave?
         18       A.   Because they would have killed me, I wouldn't
         19  exist now.
         20       Q.   Where did you decide to go, and who went with
         21  you?
         22       A.   I decided to go to UNPROFOR to seek their
         23  protection, and from there to go to Tuzla, and my whole
         24  family went with me.
         25       Q.   Can you tell us who was in your family that

          1  went with you to UNPROFOR?
          2       A.   With me were a daughter-in-law and a
          3  sister-in-law, my brother's two children, my
          4  granddaughter, and my mother.  And the other
          5  sister-in-law and brother were living in town and they
          6  also went to Potocari.
          7       Q.   Were your two sons adult age at that time?
          8       A.   They were.
          9       Q.   What did they do?
         10       A.   They went through the woods.  We parted
         11  there, with my brothers and sons, and we went to
         12  Potocari.
         13       Q.   You have three brothers; is that right?
         14       A.   I now have one and two of them are gone.
         15       Q.   So you haven't seen two of your brothers and
         16  your two sons since they left to go through the woods;
         17  is that right?
         18       A.   That is right.  I never saw them again.
         19       Q.   When you say you went to UNPROFOR, was that
         20  in Potocari?
         21       A.   Yes.  Yes, in Potocari.
         22       Q.   Where did you stay when you got to Potocari?
         23       A.   It was the afternoon, on the 11th.  We wanted
         24  to go to UNPROFOR.  The UNPROFOR wouldn't let us go any
         25  further, there was a ribbon across the road, so we

          1  stayed behind where the hangars are and the Zinc
          2  Factory and the garages.  And we asked to be put up
          3  somewhere, and I spent the night next to the zinc
          4  plant.
          5       Q.   The next day, did Serb soldiers arrive some
          6  day to Potocari, the next day, on the 12th?
          7       A.   Yes, they did.
          8       Q.   About what time did you first notice Serb
          9  soldiers arriving?
         10       A.   I really can't remember exactly now.  I think
         11  it was about noon.
         12       Q.   Can you tell us about what you saw?
         13       A.   I saw some of them coming from the woods,
         14  towards Pecista.  They were coming downhill; they were
         15  burning things and shooting.  And another group were
         16  coming from Bratunac, together with Mladic.
         17       Q.   Could you tell what things were burning?
         18       A.   Mostly the old houses and haystacks, so as to
         19  intimidate us.  And we were watching all that because
         20  there was a hillside and we were down in the valley and
         21  we could see what was happening on the slopes.
         22       Q.   Did you see General Mladic arrive?
         23       A.   I did.  I saw him.
         24       Q.   What did you see happen after he arrived?
         25       A.   UNPROFOR had those ribbons across the road,

          1  and he came up there and they probably didn't let him
          2  enter.  So he returned towards Bratunac, from where his
          3  group was coming, and then he joined the group and they
          4  walked in among the people.
          5       Q.   What happened?
          6       A.   What happened?  I went back to my mother and
          7  daughter-in-law and sister-in-law.  The children
          8  started crying.  There was panic.  We were, indeed,
          9  afraid.
         10       Q.   Did you see anything else that day?
         11       A.   I saw -- this was later, I had spent the
         12  night by the zinc plant.  Then I took my family and we
         13  entered the factory to spend the night inside.  Since
         14  the soldiers started walking around among the people,
         15  then they started taking out our young men and taking
         16  them away.
         17       Q.   What were these soldiers dressed like?
         18       A.   They were dressed in military camouflage
         19  uniforms.
         20       Q.   These were Serb soldiers?
         21       A.   I suppose so.  How do I know?  They had black
         22  gloves with their fingers showing.
         23       Q.   They weren't Dutch soldiers.
         24       A.   No.  No, not then, no.  The first night we
         25  were safe.  The Dutch soldiers were protecting us.  We

          1  were okay that first night.
          2       Q.   That was the night of the 11th that you were
          3  safe; is that right?
          4       A.   Yes.  Yes.
          5       Q.   Now, when the soldiers started taking men
          6  away, what did you do with your family?
          7       A.   When I saw four soldiers bringing ten young
          8  men and taking them away, then I became scared and I
          9  realised what would happen.  And then I took my family
         10  and we went along the road and spent the night inside
         11  an old bus, to be as close as possible to UNPROFOR.
         12       Q.   Did you ever see any Serbs that you were able
         13  to recognise from before the war?
         14       A.   I only saw my neighbour, Slavoljub.  Towards
         15  nightfall, he was going towards the garages.  He had a
         16  black uniform on him.
         17       Q.   What was his last name?
         18       A.   Grujicic.
         19       Q.   About how old was he?
         20       A.   Slavoljub, he's an older man.  Maybe 60 or
         21  something.  I don't know.
         22       Q.   All right.  Did he have any sons that you
         23  knew from before the war?
         24       A.   He had five sons.  We were all living in one
         25  neighbourhood.  We were friends.

          1       Q.   Can you name some of the sons of Slavoljub?
          2       A.   One was Cvijetin, Dzole, Mile, Vitomir, and
          3  the youngest one I can't remember.  He was the
          4  youngest.
          5       Q.   When you saw Slavoljub, was he armed?
          6       A.   I didn't really see what he had on him.  I
          7  hid from him so he wouldn't see me, because they did
          8  approach us and ask us about our men.  They would ask
          9  the women about the men and he would have recognised
         10  me.
         11       Q.   Did you see the group that Slavoljub was
         12  with, the group of soldiers?
         13       A.   Yes, they were five or six of them all in
         14  black clothing.
         15       Q.   And before you hid from them, could you see
         16  what they were doing?
         17       A.   No, no.
         18       Q.   About what time was this that you saw these
         19  soldiers in black including Slavoljub Grujicic?
         20       A.   It was at nightfall, it was already dark.  He
         21  was moving in the direction of the garages down there.
         22       Q.   And about where did you see him, about where
         23  was he when you saw him in relation to the various
         24  factories and the main road?
         25       A.   There's a small bridge and there used to be a

          1  kind of reception hut there and then you go towards the
          2  garages, and that is where I saw him.
          3       Q.   So was he near the -- near the various
          4  factories around the base?
          5       A.   He was below the road, the other side of the
          6  road below the factories.
          7       Q.   And where did you spend the night that night?
          8       A.   I spent the night there, close to this bus.
          9       Q.   You said in around or in one of the old
         10  derelict buses that was in and around the bus factory?
         11       A.   It was a bus.  There was a path leading to
         12  the garages.  The buses of Strela Company used to be
         13  parked there.  And then to the left, there was an old
         14  bus.  And there was an outpatient's clinic at Potocari
         15  and next to it was this old bus and we spent the night
         16  next to this bus.  I think there are pictures of those
         17  buses.
         18       Q.   And can you describe what you heard or saw
         19  that night, this would be the night of the 12th?
         20       A.   I heard the worst.  I heard people screaming,
         21  crying and Ohran was calling out the name of his
         22  cousin, "Ahmed, have they killed you, have they
         23  slaughtered you?"  They were wailing.  It was a
         24  terrible night.
         25       Q.   And were there screams going on throughout

          1  most of the night?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Did you see anything that was happening
          4  around you that night?
          5       A.   That is all I heard.  And then you could see
          6  the people sleeping on the ground next to the garages
          7  and then UNPROFOR, it looked like UNPROFOR walking
          8  amongst those people.  What they were doing, I didn't
          9  see.
         10       Q.   The next morning, what did you do the next
         11  morning with your family on the 13th?
         12       A.   The next morning, I got up.  I told my family
         13  to hurry up and go towards the personnel carrier.  And
         14  I saw this Ohran who had been calling his sisters on
         15  the previous night, his head was all covered in blood.
         16       Q.   And then what did you do?
         17       A.   Then we went as quickly as we could towards
         18  the buses where they were parked.  They all were from
         19  Serbia, 7th of July, Raketa, Vagevo; these are the
         20  names of the bus companies.  They had taken away our
         21  men.  We got on to a bus; I think it belonged to the
         22  7th of July Company.
         23       Q.   Before you got on the bus, did you see a
         24  Dutch soldier on top of a vehicle at some point?
         25       A.   This was when the Serb soldiers entered.

          1  This might have been towards darkfall when you are
          2  going towards Srebrenica.  There was a vehicle, an
          3  UNPROFOR vehicle, and on it there was a soldier lying
          4  on his back.  Why and how, I don't know.  It was so
          5  hot, why would he have been lying like that if he
          6  hadn't been captured or something?
          7       Q.   Did you actually see him tied down or did you
          8  just see him lying on this vehicle in this heat?
          9       A.   I just saw him lying on his back.
         10       Q.   So he might have just been lying in the sun
         11  for all you know?
         12       A.   I don't know.
         13       Q.   You can't imagine why a person would lie in
         14  the hot sun like that.
         15       A.   That's what I think too.  Why would he be
         16  lying like that facing the sun in that heat?
         17       Q.   After you got on the bus, where did you go
         18  and your family?
         19       A.   We went towards Kladanj.  We passed through
         20  Bratunac.  We passed by Kravica.
         21       Q.   Did you see anything on the way towards
         22  Kladanj?
         23       A.   On a meadow, I saw our men, four rows of
         24  them.  I don't know how many.  I saw a man dressed in a
         25  white coat, and he was doing something to a man's head

          1  right next to the road.  And the others were watching,
          2  those four rows of men.  And then we went along the
          3  road and we came across our men with their hands like
          4  this [indicates], and soldiers pushing them along,
          5  that's what we saw.
          6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, the witness
          7  indicated that her hands were on the top of her head,
          8  she saw her soldiers with their hands on top of their
          9  heads.
         10       Q.   Do you know what villages you were near when
         11  you saw these men in the meadow, and then later on you
         12  saw men with their hands on their head?
         13       A.   This was Sandici, Kravica, as far as Kasaba,
         14  that is the route we took; Sandici, Kravica.
         15       Q.   Now, going back just briefly to when you saw
         16  Slavoljub.  In one of your old statements, it also says
         17  that you saw his son, Cvijetin.  Did you actually see
         18  his son Cvijetin?
         19       A.   One of my neighbours, they were all there,
         20  but I left early in the morning, about 9.00.  And all
         21  the others were there, Grujicics and Stevos, and they
         22  were all there.  And a neighbour of mine asked him to
         23  save him but he left and he didn't do anything.
         24       Q.   So did you see Cvijetin or did one of your
         25  neighbours tell you that she had seen him?

          1       A.   She told me.
          2       Q.   Did you actually see Slavoljub or did someone
          3  tell you that he was there?
          4       A.   I saw him towards nightfall on the Wednesday,
          5  on that Wednesday.
          6       Q.   Were you eventually let off the bus near
          7  Tisca where you had to walk a distance to Kladanj?
          8       A.   Yes, we got off there.  We had two kilometres
          9  to cover to reach our territory.
         10       Q.   And did you make that or did you eventually
         11  meet up with your husband?
         12       A.   When I reached Tuzla, my husband had already
         13  left for Germany a month or two before that, I think,
         14  in January or February.
         15       Q.   But you have since been able to be reunited
         16  with your husband; is that right?
         17       A.   I was reunited when he came two months later
         18  to Tuzla.
         19       Q.   I'm sorry to ask you this question, but I
         20  think the Court and, perhaps, the world would like to
         21  know.  How is it living without your two sons and
         22  without your three brothers in the wake of the tragedy
         23  of Srebrenica?
         24       A.   How?  You have children of your own.  Only I
         25  know how I feel.  I had two sons, now I don't have any,

          1  and I lost my brothers too.
          2       Q.   Okay.  Thank you, very much.
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, I don't have
          4  any further questions.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          6  Mrs. Hajdarevic, please have some rest.  Take your
          7  time.  If you need a break, we'll have a break.  We
          8  understand how painful this must be for you.
          9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation]  I thank you
         10  too, Your Honour.  We could perhaps have a little break
         11  if you want.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         13            So for the purpose of organising our work,
         14  Mr. Petrusic or Mr. Visnjic, how long do you think that
         15  the cross-examination will take?
         16            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Not more than
         17  five minutes, Mr. President.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         19  then, we will still have a 15-minute break.  I hope
         20  that you will be able to get some rest so that you can
         21  come back and continue with your testimony.  A
         22  15-minute break.
         23                 --- Break taken at 10.08 a.m.
         24                 --- On resuming at 10.25 a.m.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          1  Mrs. Hajdarevic, are you feeling any better now?
          2            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  I'm fine
          3  now.  Thank you.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          5  Now you're going to answer questions that will be put
          6  to you by Mr. Visnjic, who is representing General
          7  Krstic in this case.
          8            Mr. Visnjic, you have the floor.
          9            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         10  Mr. President.
         11                 Cross-examined by Mr. Visnjic:
         12       Q.   Good morning, Mrs. Hajdarevic.
         13       A.   Good morning.
         14       Q.   Mrs. Hajdarevic, I should like to ask you a
         15  question regarding your neighbour Slavoljub Grujicic,
         16  the one you recognised in Potocari.  Could you tell us
         17  whether you had had any argument with him before the
         18  war?  Did you have any problems with him?
         19       A.   No.  No, I didn't.
         20       Q.   So you were in good relations before the
         21  war.
         22       A.   Yes, we were.
         23       Q.   Thank you very much, Mrs. Hajdarevic.
         24            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour,
         25  this concludes my cross-examination.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          2  Mr. Visnjic.
          3            Any additional questions for the witness,
          4  Mr. McCloskey?
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  No, Mr. President.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Judge
          7  Riad.
          8            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          9  Mr. President.
         10                 Questioned by the Court:
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Mrs. Hajdarevic, good morning.
         12       A.   Good morning.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  I'm sorry to bring these
         14  memories back to you.  You have lost two sons, you have
         15  lost three brothers.  Did you get any information after
         16  they went away what happened to them or where they
         17  were?
         18       A.   I learned about my sons, that they had
         19  reached Baljkovica, the crossing point, and that's all
         20  I know about them.  As regards my brother, he was in
         21  Potocari and he was left there.  My cousins, my
         22  relatives, they were among those who went to the woods,
         23  and I haven't heard of them ever since.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  "Ever since" means since July
         25  1995?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you know many people in your
          3  family, in your acquaintance, who also passed through
          4  the same sad experiences, where their sons and brothers
          5  disappeared and they have no news?
          6       A.   Yes, I do.  There are so many such cases.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  The cases of people returning,
          8  were there cases of sons and brothers coming back?
          9       A.   Yes, that happened as well.  Azim Begic, he
         10  had six sons, and all of them managed to cross over.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Were they in the woods?
         12       A.   Yes, they were.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Did they tell you what happened?
         14       A.   Yes, they told us various stories.  There
         15  were lots of stories.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  You mentioned that the
         17  UNPROFOR was walking among you with the Serbs, if I
         18  remember, and you were hearing screams at the same
         19  time.  What were the UNPROFOR soldiers doing exactly?
         20       A.   No, they were not UNPROFOR soldiers, they
         21  were Serb soldiers.  They had taken their clothes and
         22  put them on.  They were not members of UNPROFOR.
         23  UNPROFOR soldiers wouldn't do anything to us.  They
         24  would have helped us, like they did on the first
         25  night.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  You mean they were dressed as
          2  UNPROFOR, they had the UNPROFOR dress?
          3       A.   Yes, because they had captured both UNPROFOR
          4  members and us, and they did as they pleased with
          5  them.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  I'll ask you again about Azim's
          7  sons; he had six sons.  The six sons came out of the
          8  woods, were able to come back?
          9       A.   Yes.  Yes, all of them, they reached Tuzla.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  They said that many other people
         11  were able to get away from the woods, or were they
         12  exceptional?
         13       A.   Well, they know how it was.  People kept
         14  coming out for months.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  All right.  Thank you very
         16  much.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         18  very much, Judge Riad.
         19            Judge Wald.
         20            JUDGE WALD:  I have no questions except to
         21  thank you for sharing your sad memories with us.  I
         22  hope they will do the search for truth well.  Thank
         23  you.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         25  Mrs. Hajdarevic, I have only one question to ask of

          1  you.  I should like to know something about the
          2  soldiers who arrived on the 12th of July.  You are not
          3  sure that they were Serbs; you just know that they were
          4  not Dutch.  So my question is the following:  Did you
          5  hear them speak?
          6       A.   Yes.  I was near them.  They were taking away
          7  our young men, they were taking them to the Zinc
          8  Factory.  Our mothers were crying, pulling them by
          9  their sleeves, telling them to let their sons go.  Four
         10  of them were taken away, and then another ten, they
         11  were taken in the direction of Budak.  But they were
         12  speaking our language; they were our people.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you're
         14  saying that they were speaking your language.
         15       A.   Yes.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Were they
         17  Muslims?
         18       A.   In the army?  No.  No.  They were all Serbs.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So those
         20  soldiers were Serbs.
         21       A.   Yes.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] When you
         23  heard them speak, what were they saying?
         24       A.   Well, they were addressing the mothers who
         25  were there.  They would, for example, tell her that

          1  they would only take her son for questioning and then
          2  that they would let him go.  That's what they were
          3  saying.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          5  very much, Mrs. Hajdarevic, for coming here to the
          6  Tribunal.  I should like to thank you once again, as my
          7  colleagues have done, for sharing with us your
          8  suffering.  I hope that you will always be able to find
          9  reason to live, meaning in life, at least to tell us
         10  about the terrible things that have happened.
         11            Is there anything else that you should like
         12  to say, something you haven't had the opportunity to
         13  say?
         14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I should just
         15  like to ask one question of these gentlemen from
         16  Belgrade.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I'm sorry,
         18  Mrs. Hajdarevic, you cannot speak directly to these
         19  gentlemen, but perhaps you could ask a general
         20  question.
         21            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Just a
         22  question.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         24  please.
         25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] The gentleman

          1  from Belgrade, does he have children?
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Well, I
          3  suppose he does.
          4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Then how could
          5  they have come here to defend a man like Krstic?  This
          6  is all.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          8  very much.  I hope that the world will be able to
          9  answer a question like this, and I hope that this will
         10  be an example of how people should be treated.  Thank
         11  you very much once again, Mrs. Hajdarevic.
         12            I should like the usher to accompany
         13  Mrs. Hajdarevic out of the courtroom.
         14                 [The witness withdrew]
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         16  Mr. McCloskey.
         17            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Before I turn the podium over
         18  to Mr. Harmon, who has the next witness, I just wanted
         19  you to know that in the future we will be providing
         20  evidence on the identities and the units of some of
         21  these people that these witnesses have identified.  For
         22  example, Slavoljub Grujicic was a member of the
         23  Bratunac Brigade of the Drina Corps at the time, and
         24  you will see those records and witnesses will explain
         25  those records.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
          2  case, I give the floor to Mr. Harmon.
          3            MR. HARMON:  Good morning, Mr. President and
          4  Your Honours; good morning to my colleagues for the
          5  Defence.
          6            Our next witness will be a young man named
          7  Enver Husic, and he's going to testify without
          8  protection.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We shall
         10  wait for him then.
         11                 [The witness entered court]
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Can you
         13  hear me, Mr. Husic?
         14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         16  morning.  You are going to read the solemn declaration
         17  that the usher will give you, please.
         18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
         19  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
         20  and nothing but the truth.
         21                 WITNESS:  ENVER HUSIC
         22                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
         24  seated.  Are you comfortable?
         25            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          2  very much for coming.  For the moment you will be
          3  answering questions put to you by Mr. Harmon, who is
          4  standing to your right.
          5            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
          6            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          7                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          8       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Husic.
          9       A.   Good morning.
         10       Q.   Now, I'd like to you relax.  I'm going to ask
         11  you a number of questions about your experiences.  Get
         12  comfortable.
         13            First of all, can you spell your last name
         14  for the record, please.
         15       A.   My name is H-u-s-i-c, and my first name is
         16  E-n-v-e-r.
         17       Q.   How old are you, Mr. Husic?
         18       A.   I am 22.
         19       Q.   Before the fall of the enclave in 1995, were
         20  you living in Srebrenica?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   With whom were you living?
         23       A.   I was living with my mother and father, two
         24  brothers and a sister.
         25       Q.   Now, at the time of the fall of the enclave,

          1  was your father in active duty in the Bosnian army?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Was he registered as a soldier or did he
          4  actually go to the front line?
          5       A.   He was just registered as a soldier.
          6       Q.   Now, you had two brothers.  One brother was
          7  named Ramiz; is that correct?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   How old was Ramiz at the time of the fall of
         10  the enclave?
         11       A.   Nineteen.
         12       Q.   Was he a member of the army?
         13       A.   No.
         14       Q.   How old were you at the time of the fall of
         15  the enclave?
         16       A.   Seventeen.
         17       Q.   Were you a member of the army?
         18       A.   No.
         19       Q.   Now, you had one other brother; is that
         20  correct?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   As I understand it, your other brother passed
         23  away before the fall of the enclave; am I right on
         24  that?
         25       A.   Yes, yes.

          1       Q.   Now, when the enclave was attacked by the
          2  Bosnian Serb army, where did your mother and your
          3  sister go?
          4       A.   They went to a place called Potocari.
          5       Q.   Where did you, Ramiz, your brother, and your
          6  father go?
          7       A.   We went to a place called Kazani where there
          8  were many other people and we headed through the woods.
          9            MR. HARMON:  If I could have Prosecutor's
         10  Exhibit 7A placed on the ELMO.  I'm going to show you a
         11  map and I'm going to ask you to identify certain places
         12  on Prosecutor's Exhibit 7A.
         13       Q.   While we're waiting for the map, can you tell
         14  the Judges why was it that you and your father and your
         15  brother went through the woods?
         16       A.   We went because the Serbs were shelling,
         17  shooting and we feared we would share the fate of many
         18  other people who had, during the war, been killed and
         19  slaughtered.  And we went to the woods hoping we could
         20  reach free territory from Tuzla.
         21       Q.   Now, could you take a look at Prosecutor's
         22  Exhibit 7A which is on the ELMO.  Could you point to
         23  some of the locations in your journey where you went
         24  through the woods and before you actually surrendered.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if you could show the

          1  witness the map and then place it back on the ELMO;
          2  he's going to need to see it.
          3       Q.   Take a look at that for just a second,
          4  Mr. Husic, and then we'll put it back on the ELMO and
          5  then I'd like you to indicate with the pointer your
          6  direction of flight.
          7       A.   Yes.  This is it.
          8            MR. HARMON:   Could you just place that back
          9  on the ELMO.
         10       Q.   Using the pointer, Mr. Husic, could you point
         11  for the Judges' benefit the direction of your flight
         12  from the time you left Kazani to the point of your
         13  surrender, and please point to the ELMO.
         14       A.   We passed through a place called Susnjari,
         15  Buljim, Kamenica, and then Sandici.
         16       Q.   I notice two of the maps -- two of the --
         17  three of the areas are indicated on the map, Buljim is
         18  not indicated on the map.  Could you point to the area
         19  of Buljim on this map since you mentioned it in your
         20  testimony?
         21       A.   Yes, I think this is the location
         22  [indicates].
         23            MR. HARMON:  Indicating the circle in the
         24  middle, indicating there's a town in there called Bare,
         25  I believe.

          1       Q.   Now, how many people were gathered --
          2            MR. HARMON:  I'm finished with the exhibit,
          3  Mr. Usher, thank you.
          4       Q.   Can you estimate how many people were
          5  gathered at Kazani before people left the enclave and
          6  went in the direction of Tuzla?
          7       A.   I can't tell you the exact number, but there
          8  were a lot of people there.
          9       Q.   Were there women amongst the people gathered
         10  at Kazani?
         11       A.   Yes, there were.  I saw about ten women
         12  there.
         13       Q.   Were there children?
         14       A.   I didn't see any.
         15       Q.   Now, can you describe the manner in which you
         16  left the enclave?
         17       A.   First, we went along a wider road, a group of
         18  people.  There were a lot of people.  It wasn't a
         19  proper column across the fields to Buljim.  We didn't
         20  go along roads, but across the fields a lot of the
         21  time.  But from a distance, it looked like a column.
         22       Q.   Okay.  Can you tell the Judges approximately
         23  your position in the column; were you in the front of
         24  the column, in the middle of the column, in the rear of
         25  the column?

          1       A.   We were in the rear, not quite at the very
          2  end, but in the last half.
          3       Q.   Do you remember the date when you left the
          4  enclave?
          5       A.   Yes, it was the 11th.
          6       Q.   Now, accompanying you in the column, were
          7  there men with rifles?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   And in your part of the column, approximately
         10  how many men had rifles?
         11       A.   I could see about 50.
         12       Q.   Do you know the purpose of the men with the
         13  rifles in your part of the column?
         14       A.   Their purpose was to protect the rear part of
         15  the column.
         16       Q.   Now, briefly, could you tell the Judges what
         17  happened once you left Srebrenica and before you
         18  surrendered?
         19       A.   We reached Buljim from Kazani, that is
         20  Srebrenica.  I fell asleep from fatigue.  I woke up in
         21  the morning, it had dawned, and my father and brother
         22  were not there.  They had left before me.
         23            So there were only a few people left in
         24  Buljim, and I was among them.  There were about 50
         25  armed Muslims there, soldiers, and I went down hill

          1  from Buljim towards Kamenica.
          2            The column was two by two.  We went down
          3  hill, I saw four dead men.  Then we went on.  The path
          4  was marked with pieces of papers, because they told us
          5  that it was mined so we couldn't move away from those
          6  markings.
          7            The Serbs were shooting.  I think they used
          8  mortars and infantry weapons and rifle grenades.  A lot
          9  of people lost their lives there.
         10            Then, however, I found my father who was hit
         11  by an explosion of a rifle grenade.  He wasn't feeling
         12  well.  He wasn't really hit, but it was the detonation
         13  that had affected him.
         14            Then we went on, a place called Strane, the
         15  shooting stopped, we couldn't hear anything.  We just
         16  heard the Serbs calling out to one another.  At the
         17  same time, we suddenly heard something that sounded
         18  like the wind blowing and suddenly, the fire came from
         19  all sides.
         20            My father got up.  I helped him go down
         21  towards a stream.  I saw people falling.  A lot of
         22  people were hit.  And we managed to pull out somehow.
         23  We went along the stream and uphill.  There weren't
         24  many people who had pulled out.  We could hear screams
         25  and moans and shooting.  And my father and I went on.

          1  We found my brother and we stopped there.
          2            Night fell.  We stayed there throughout the
          3  night.  I fell asleep again.  The next day, when it
          4  dawned, I saw a lot of dead people around me, they had
          5  been killed.  Some had been mutilated.
          6            After that, my brother wasn't there.  I was
          7  alone there.  I suppose when I fell asleep and the
          8  shooting started, they disappeared again.  So I went on
          9  and found them.
         10            There were a lot of people there on a
         11  hillside.  And what happened then, it was about midday,
         12  the sun was out, it was warm and we heard the Serbs
         13  from the asphalt road calling out to us to surrender.
         14  They were saying, "Surrender, the UNPROFOR is here."  I
         15  saw a white personnel carrier with a blue helmets.  And
         16  they said, "Surrender, the UNPROFOR will transport you
         17  safely to Tuzla."
         18            I had the feeling that if I surrender, I
         19  would survive.  And I said to my father, let's go and
         20  surrender.  In fact, I was begging him to.  That was
         21  the feeling I had.  And about 2.00 in the afternoon, we
         22  headed downhill towards the asphalt road.  Again, we
         23  saw UN personnel carriers and blue helmets.
         24            As we were coming down, before we reached the
         25  road itself, there was a slight climb.  There were two

          1  Serb soldiers, one on each side standing there.
          2       Q.   Mr. Husic, let me interrupt you there for
          3  just a minute and let me ask you first of all, do you
          4  remember the date it was when you surrendered?
          5       A.   Yes, I do.  It was the 13th.
          6       Q.   Now, I want to show you a film; you've seen
          7  this before in my office.  It's a film of your actual
          8  surrender.
          9            MR. HARMON:  And if I could, Mr. President,
         10  have transcripts of the film that I'm going to show
         11  disseminated, that would be Prosecutor's Exhibit 103A.
         12  Unfortunately, the transcripts are only in English.
         13  Then once they are disseminated, I'll ask that the film
         14  itself be played.
         15            And if the interpreters could please
         16  translate as the film is being played.  The translation
         17  booth has been provided with an English language
         18  transcript.
         19            Now, if the lights could be dimmed, please,
         20  and we could play Prosecutor's Exhibit 103, please.
         21                 [Videotape played]
         22            THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover].
         23            I don't know, from some desrt.
         24            How long have you been there?
         25            We were there two days and two nights.

          1            Completely surrounded.  What.  Where are your
          2  rifles?
          3            I didn't have a rifle, I am a civilian.
          4            A civilian?  All right, then have no fear.
          5  Were you afraid?
          6            Who wouldn't be afraid?
          7            Hey, hey, you journalist.
          8            How come he already arrived, before they
          9  did?
         10            Hey, take off that shirt.
         11            This one?
         12            Yes.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, not all of the
         14  film and all of the language on the film was
         15  translated.  I know it's difficult for the interpreters
         16  to do it following the film, but the translation that
         17  has been provided to the Chamber is a complete
         18  translation that has been provided to us by the
         19  language service section.
         20            Now, if I could have Prosecutor's Exhibit 104
         21  placed on the ELMO, please.
         22       Q.   Mr. Husic, I've placed on the ELMO a still
         23  image taken from that film we just saw, Prosecutor's
         24  Exhibit 103.  Is that you in this still image?
         25       A.   Yes, that's me.

          1       Q.   That's you at the time of your surrender; is
          2  that correct?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   Now, Mr. Husic, you described in part of your
          5  answer that you surrendered because you could hear
          6  Bosnian Serbs calling you down to surrender; is that
          7  correct?
          8       A.   Not only because we heard them calling out to
          9  us to surrender but also because we saw UNPROFOR there,
         10  because we thought that they couldn't simply kill us in
         11  the presence of UNPROFOR.  We hoped that UNPROFOR would
         12  transport us to Tuzla, as the Serbs themselves had
         13  said.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Now, Mr. President and Your
         15  Honours, I'm going to play another film, and I'd ask
         16  that Prosecutor's Exhibit 102A, a transcript from that
         17  film, also be distributed to Your Honours before we
         18  play the film.
         19            Again, if the language booths could try to
         20  follow this and translate this film as well.
         21            I direct Your Honours' attention just to
         22  significant parts of this film.  I'll describe it
         23  initially.  It's Bosnian Serb soldiers calling into the
         24  woods for people to surrender, and at the end of film
         25  you'll notice an individual wearing a blue UN helmet.

          1            So if we could dim the lights, please, and
          2  play Prosecutor's Exhibit 102.  This is a short film;
          3  it only lasts 44 seconds.
          4                 [Videotape played]
          5            THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover]
          6            How many of them got out already?
          7            About three or four thousands.
          8            And they all surrendered to you here?
          9            Yes.
         10            When we give such a figure, people in
         11  Belgrade usually say it is exaggerated.
         12            Well, it is exaggerated, of course it is.
         13            But that is really how many of them.
         14            Yes.  So much.  So much.
         15            There they are, look there.
         16            See how he disappeared.  There, on the left.
         17            Come on, boys, get out freely, boys.
         18            He was the one who aimed?
         19            Five or six passed.
         20            Get out, hey.
         21            You see them now, do you see them?
         22            There is a whole file of them.
         23            Two, that's how it goes, one after the other,
         24  three.
         25            About fifteen passed now.

          1            So they are coming down like that all day?
          2            Surrender, boys.
          3            From this morning.
          4            All day they are coming out like that.
          5            The last group that passed was 400 of them,
          6  they came out down there.
          7            Uniforms they leave up there, they dress in
          8  civilian clothes and ...
          9            You down there, come out.
         10            Let's go.
         11            Hurry up.
         12            Hurry up.  Faster.
         13            MR. HARMON:
         14       Q.   Now, Mr. Husic, does that film accurately
         15  depict the events as you recall them?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Now, you testified in your direct examination
         18  that you saw white APCs, armoured personnel carriers,
         19  belonging to the UN; you saw Bosnian Serbs in blue
         20  helmets.  Did you also see Bosnian Serb soldiers in UN
         21  camouflage flak jackets?
         22       A.   Yes, I did.
         23       Q.   Having lived in the enclave and having seen
         24  the UN Dutch Battalion soldiers patrolling through the
         25  enclave, were you familiar with the UN type of

          1  camouflage?
          2       A.   Yes, I was, 100 per cent.
          3       Q.   Were there a lot of Bosnian Serb soldiers
          4  wearing UN camouflage flak jackets, as well as the UN
          5  blue helmets?
          6       A.   Not that many.  I saw between eight and ten
          7  of them.
          8            MR. HARMON:  If I could have Prosecutor's
          9  Exhibits 105, 106, and 107 distributed, first of all,
         10  and then placed on the ELMO.
         11            These, Mr. President and Your Honours, are, I
         12  would say, poor quality still images taken from
         13  Prosecutor's Exhibit 103, the film.  They are intended
         14  to show Your Honours and assist Your Honours, if and
         15  when you review the film, with the types of UN flak
         16  jackets that are worn by Bosnian Serb soldiers.
         17            If you could start, Mr. Usher, by placing
         18  Prosecutor's 105 on the ELMO.
         19       Q.   Mr. Husic, these are still images taken from
         20  the film of your surrender.  Can you tell us what the
         21  soldier who is to the left of the man in the blue shirt
         22  is wearing?
         23       A.   I can recognise here a UN flak jacket.  It is
         24  black.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Now, could we have the next

          1  exhibit, Prosecutor's 106, placed on the ELMO.
          2       Q.   Can you identify what the man, the soldier,
          3  on the left-hand side of this image is wearing?
          4       A.   He's wearing a UN flak jacket.
          5       Q.   Can you point that out with the pointer,
          6  please.
          7       A.   Yes, I can.  [Indicates].
          8       Q.   Thank you very much.
          9            MR. HARMON:  Now could we turn to the next
         10  image, which is Prosecutor's Exhibit's 107, and place
         11  that on the ELMO.
         12       Q.   You've seen this from the film.  Could you
         13  tell the Judges what the soldier on the right side of
         14  this image is wearing?
         15       A.   He's also wearing a UN flak jacket.
         16       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much.
         17            Now, you also had an opportunity to review
         18  other film in my office, and I'd like to show you --
         19            MR. HARMON:  I'd like to first of all
         20  distribute for the Judges and counsel Prosecutor's
         21  Exhibit 101A, which is a transcript in English of the
         22  next piece of film footage we're going to show.
         23            If we could lower the lights, please, and
         24  play Prosecutor's Exhibit 101, please.
         25                 [Videotape played]

          1            THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover]
          2            Boro, shall we swap our pistols.
          3            Let me see.
          4            Do you have a spare one?
          5            I do.
          6            All right.  Want to swap?
          7            MR. HARMON:
          8       Q.   Do you recognise those two soldiers who were
          9  in a reclining position, Mr. Husic?
         10       A.   Yes, I do.
         11       Q.   Tell the Judges who those individuals are and
         12  what they did to you and to other people who were
         13  surrendering.
         14       A.   These are two Serb soldiers, whom we have
         15  just seen on the screen, that were present there.  They
         16  were asking people for money, German marks, gold, and
         17  everything they had on them.  They were searching
         18  people.
         19       Q.   Now, at the end of this film, you could see a
         20  meadow in the film.  Is that the location where, after
         21  you surrendered, you eventually ended up, on that
         22  particular meadow?
         23       A.   Yes, that is the location.
         24       Q.   What happened to the bags that were being
         25  carried by the men who were surrendering?

          1       A.   Whoever had a bag or a backpack had to leave
          2  it before coming out to the meadow.
          3       Q.   Where did they have to leave it?
          4       A.   They had to leave it by the road, by the
          5  asphalt road, on both sides of the road.  They were not
          6  allowed to take it up to the meadow.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have the next
          8  series of exhibits taken to the ELMO, they would be
          9  Prosecutor's Exhibits 7/2, 7/5, 7/6, and 7/9.
         10            Mr. Usher, we'll start with Prosecutor's
         11  Exhibit 7/2.
         12       Q.   Mr. Husic, have you seen Prosecutor's Exhibit
         13  7/2 in my office?
         14       A.   Yes, I have.
         15       Q.   Do you see the dotted yellow line that starts
         16  at the top left-hand side of the image, comes down past
         17  a house and ends in an oval that is on the left-hand
         18  side of the image?  Do you see that dotted line?
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Does that dotted line represent your route
         21  when you descended from the hills and eventually ended
         22  up on the meadow?
         23       A.   Yes, it does.
         24       Q.   Now, let me show you the next exhibit, which
         25  is Prosecutor's Exhibit 7/5.  Do you recognise what's

          1  in this photograph, Mr. Husic?
          2       A.   Yes, I do.  I can recognise the meadow and
          3  the house I passed on the way.
          4       Q.   Could you use the pointer, please, and first
          5  of all point to the house that you passed on the way
          6  down from the mountains.
          7       A.   [Indicates]
          8            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record,
          9  Mr. President and Your Honours, the largest house, a
         10  little bit off the centre of the picture, on the top
         11  side of the road.
         12       Q.   Where is the meadow that you ended up on?
         13       A.   [Indicates]
         14            MR. HARMON:  Indicating directly below the
         15  house on the other side of the road, an area directly
         16  off the road.
         17            Could we then have Prosecutor's Exhibit 7/6
         18  placed on the ELMO.
         19       Q.   Mr. Husic, do you recognise what's in this
         20  image, Prosecutor's 7/6?
         21       A.   Yes, I can recognise the rear side of the
         22  house, the back part of the house.
         23       Q.   Could you point to the Judges on which side
         24  of the house you passed by when you surrendered?
         25       A.   [Indicates].  On this side of the house, next

          1  to these stairs here [indicates].
          2            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, the
          3  left-hand side of the image.
          4            Lastly, Mr. Usher, if you could place the
          5  next exhibit, Prosecutor's 7/9, on the ELMO.
          6       Q.   This is a panorama, Mr. Husic.  You've had an
          7  opportunity to see this in my office.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if you could place it
          9  a little more to the left, please, so we could show the
         10  house.
         11       Q.   Do you recognise that building, Mr. Husic?
         12       A.   Yes, I do.
         13       Q.   What is that building?
         14       A.   It was next to this house [indicates] that I
         15  passed on my way, on this side of the house
         16  [indicates].
         17            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if you could keep
         18  moving that image to the left.
         19       Q.   Do you see the meadow on which you
         20  surrendered, Mr. Husic, on this particular panorama?
         21       A.   Yes, I can see it.
         22       Q.   Could you point it out?
         23       A.   [Indicates]
         24            MR. HARMON:  Indicating a green area to the
         25  right of the house, below the road.

          1       Q.   Now, could you tell the Judges what you saw
          2  after you passed the house and after you arrived at the
          3  meadow?
          4       A.   I was told to sit down with a group of
          5  people, and I went to the left side of the group and I
          6  sat down.  There were lots of Serb soldiers around us,
          7  and to my left was a tank -- I'm sorry, to my right.  I
          8  could see Serb soldiers coming to the group, asking
          9  people for money.
         10            They were also taking people away to a nearby
         11  cornfield, behind the tank, and they took people away
         12  as they pleased.  They cursed at them, they cursed at
         13  their balija mothers, telling them, "Where is your
         14  Alija to help you now?  Wait until Ratko Mladic comes
         15  here."
         16       Q.   Can you tell us, Mr. Husic, how were those
         17  soldiers dressed who were surrounding you in the
         18  meadow?
         19       A.   Black camouflage uniform -- green.
         20       Q.   I'm sorry.  Would you repeat your answer,
         21  please.
         22       A.   They were dressed in camouflage uniforms but
         23  they were different, not all of them were the same.
         24       Q.   Could you describe the uniforms as best you
         25  can recall them, each of the different types of

          1  uniforms.
          2       A.   I can remember that there was a blue police
          3  uniform, which was also a camouflage uniform, and a
          4  military uniform that was used by the Serbian army.  I
          5  also remember a multicoloured open uniform, light
          6  coloured.
          7       Q.   How many blue police camouflage uniforms did
          8  you see while you were at the meadow?
          9       A.   I didn't see a single one, but I could
         10  recognise the pattern of the uniform.  It was a green
         11  camouflage uniform.
         12       Q.   Now, we have seen in both the films that
         13  we've played and the still images, we've seen people in
         14  green camouflage uniforms.  Is that the type of uniform
         15  that you saw, generally speaking?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Now, can you estimate approximately how many
         18  people were on the meadow when you arrived in the
         19  group?
         20       A.   Between 900 and 1.000.
         21       Q.   Did you see anybody, any family member that
         22  you knew amongst those people on the meadow?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Who did you see?
         25       A.   I saw two brothers from the village of Osmac,

          1  from the municipality of Srebrenica.  And I recognised
          2  also Ramo who was calling out to people, the man who
          3  was wearing a blue shirt.
          4       Q.   Did you see your father?
          5       A.   No.
          6       Q.   Did you see your brother?
          7       A.   No.
          8       Q.   So you were alone on the meadow in so far as
          9  your direct family relations?
         10       A.   No, I'm referring only to the video.  But I
         11  did see my brother and my father in the meadow.
         12       Q.   Now, can you describe for the Judges what you
         13  saw the soldiers doing to the people, the Muslim men
         14  who were sitting on the meadow?
         15       A.   The worst.  They were cursing at people, they
         16  were kicking them, taking them away to the house.
         17  There was a relative of mine, Husic Safet, who was
         18  taken away in this fashion, and he never came back.  I
         19  remember a man who was sitting in front of me, he gave
         20  20 German marks to a Serbian soldier wearing glasses.
         21            They were taking people away to the cornfield
         22  which was behind the tank to the right side.  And many
         23  of them would come to the group and hit the people.
         24       Q.   You said you saw some men being taken to a
         25  cornfield.  Were they Muslim men being taken to the

          1  cornfield?
          2       A.   Yes.  Yes, they were.
          3       Q.   Did you see those -- the -- did Bosnian Serb
          4  soldiers take the Muslim men to the cornfields?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Did you see those Bosnian Serb soldiers
          7  return from the cornfields without the Muslim men who
          8  had been escorted in that direction?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   Now, continue telling the Judges what
         11  happened while you were at this particular meadow.
         12  What did you do?  What were you asked to do?
         13       A.   While I was sitting there, a soldier who was
         14  on the tank, on my right-hand side, he cursed my balija
         15  mother and told me to get up.  But the man who was
         16  sitting next to me stood up because he was confused.
         17  He didn't know whom the soldier had in mind.  But then
         18  he pointed at me.
         19            So I stood up and I went to the tank and they
         20  gave me two jerrycans, and I was told to go to the
         21  asphalt road and to continue along the road, and to my
         22  left, that there would be some water.
         23            So I took those two jerrycans and I went to
         24  the left, down the road, and I filled them with water.
         25  I returned to the meadow, and the Serb soldier ordered

          1  me to distribute the water around, but not to give too
          2  much to each of the men.  This is what I did.
          3            After I was coming back the second time, I
          4  saw a number of Serb soldiers next to the asphalt
          5  road.  There was a man of my age there, Samir Krdzic
          6  and he had been assigned the same task.  He had to
          7  bring water to the meadow.
          8            While I was standing there, a Serb soldier
          9  approached me with an automatic rifle and he cursed my
         10  mother, and he asked me why I was laughing.  And I told
         11  him I was not laughing, and he told me not to speak.
         12  But then another soldier came to us and he told him not
         13  to touch me.  And then he left.
         14            So while these young men were standing there,
         15  a bus arrived from the direction of Potocari carrying
         16  women, and it stopped there near the water.
         17            The door of the bus opened, and the driver
         18  who was driving the bus, he also probably wanted to
         19  take some water.  He went to the Serb soldiers and he
         20  spoke to them.
         21            I had been thinking about escaping, I wanted
         22  to try something.  And then this opportunity presented
         23  itself, and I decided to board the bus and then see
         24  what happened.  So I threw away the jerrycans and I
         25  entered the bus.

          1            Meanwhile, the driver was talking to the Serb
          2  soldiers who were standing nearby.  I got on the bus
          3  and I hid amongst the women who covered me with some
          4  bags.
          5            So when the driver came back, he started the
          6  engine, he didn't notice me, and he set off.  And
          7  during our journey, I heard at one point that the bus
          8  was being hit with rocks.  Local women were probably
          9  throwing stones at the bus.
         10            So nothing happened, and the bus stopped in
         11  Tisca.  I got out of the bus.  There were some elderly
         12  people who could not walk, and I mixed with the women
         13  there and I helped them carry an old woman.  And this
         14  is how I managed to reach the free territory.
         15       Q.   Can you describe the soldiers, Bosnian Serb
         16  soldiers who were in Tisca?  What were they wearing?
         17       A.   They were wearing those same uniforms as
         18  those down there, only they looked a little newer to
         19  me.
         20       Q.   Describe the uniforms, were they camouflage
         21  uniforms?
         22       A.   Camouflage, yes, camouflage, green and a sort
         23  of off white.  It's not really white.  I don't know how
         24  I can describe that colour.  Anyway, they were new
         25  camouflage uniforms.

          1       Q.   I'd like to return to the meadow for one last
          2  observation of yours, please.
          3            MR. HARMON:  If I could have Prosecutor's
          4  Exhibit 7/4 placed on the ELMO.
          5       Q.   And you testified, Mr. Husic, that there was
          6  a tank that was on the meadow near the prisoners who
          7  were sitting?
          8       A.   Yes, yes.
          9       Q.   I'd like to show you Prosecutor's Exhibit 7/4
         10  which is now on the ELMO, and do you see the -- could
         11  you point out for the Judges the location of the tank
         12  that you remember?
         13       A.   Yes, I can, here [indicates].
         14            MR. HARMON:  Indicating for the record the
         15  unidentified vehicle on the right side of the image.
         16       Q.   Now, lastly, Mr. Husic, I'm going to show you
         17  some additional exhibits?
         18            MR. HARMON:  If I could have Prosecutor's
         19  Exhibits 108, 109, 110, and 111 disseminated.  These,
         20  Mr. President, Your Honours, and counsel are still
         21  images taken from Prosecutor's Exhibit 103.
         22            If we could start, Mr. Usher, with
         23  Prosecutor's Exhibit 108.
         24       Q.   Mr. Husic, this is an image from the film of
         25  your surrender.  Can you please tell the Judges who

          1  these two men are?
          2       A.   They are the brothers that I mentioned when I
          3  was telling you about it, Osman.
          4       Q.   Now, these two brothers, to your knowledge,
          5  Mr. Husic, did they survive?
          6       A.   No, they didn't survive.
          7       Q.   Did their father survive?
          8       A.   No.  He was taken to the cornfield behind the
          9  tank.
         10       Q.   Let me show you another picture of a man who
         11  surrendered to the Bosnian Serb army, again taken from
         12  your film of your surrender, Prosecutor's Exhibit 109.
         13            Do you see the man in the blue shirt in the
         14  middle of that image and he's flanked by two Bosnian
         15  Serb soldiers?  Can you tell us his name?
         16       A.   Ramo is his name.
         17       Q.   Did Ramo survive?
         18       A.   No.
         19       Q.   Let me go to the next image which is
         20  Prosecutor's Exhibit 110.  Again, an image showing a
         21  number of men who were surrendering today Bosnian Serb
         22  soldiers.  Can you identify any specific individual in
         23  this exhibit?
         24       A.   On the right, his name is Juso, and did he
         25  not survive.

          1       Q.   Point out Juso on the exhibit, please.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Indicating, for the record, a
          3  man who appears to be in a brown-coloured coat or
          4  jacket and he's on the right.
          5       Q.   Lastly, in this series of exhibits, let me
          6  show you Prosecutor's Exhibit 111.
          7            First of all, Mr. Husic, do you see yourself
          8  in that exhibit?
          9       A.   Yes, I do.
         10       Q.   Could you point out where you are in this
         11  image?
         12            MR. HARMON:  Indicating the individual who is
         13  the second individual from the left-hand side.
         14       Q.   Now, do you see the man in the camouflage
         15  T-shirt directly in front of you?
         16       A.   Yes, I do.
         17       Q.   Could you tell the judges what happened to
         18  that man?
         19       A.   They ordered him to take off his T-shirt, and
         20  they took him to the cornfield and he also did not
         21  survive.
         22       Q.   Now, in addition, Mr. Husic, to these
         23  individuals who were shown surrendering to the Bosnian
         24  Serb army, were there a number of other individuals you
         25  can identify by name who did not survive?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Could you please identify those individuals,
          3  who you saw alive on the meadow who not survive?
          4       A.   I know my neighbours, Husic Mehemed, Husic
          5  Mehmedalija, Husic Safet, and another man named called
          6  Sead Krdzic.  They also did not survive.
          7       Q.   Do you know an individual named Sajdin Husic?
          8       A.   Yes.  That is my father who also did not
          9  survive.  He stayed behind there.
         10       Q.   My last question, Mr. Husic, all of these
         11  individuals you've seen in the images and who you have
         12  named who did not survive, were they Bosnian Muslims?
         13       A.   Yes, they were.
         14       Q.   Mr. Husic, thank you, very much.
         15            MR. HARMON:  I've concluded my examination,
         16  Mr. President.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         18  very much, Mr. Harmon.
         19            I think this is a good time for a break
         20  before the cross-examination.  So we'll have a
         21  20-minute break now.
         22                 --- Recess taken at 11.37 a.m.
         23                 --- On resuming at 11.56 a.m.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Husic,
         25  have you had some rest during the break?
          1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, I have,
          2  Your Honour.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now you
          4  will answer questions that will be put to you by
          5  Mr. Visnjic, who is counsel for the Defence here.
          6            Mr. Visnjic, you have the floor.
          7            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          8  Mr. President.
          9                 Cross-examined by Mr. Visnjic:
         10       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Husic.
         11       A.   Good morning.
         12       Q.   Mr. Husic, in your statement, or rather
         13  during your direct testimony, you said that while you
         14  were going to the woods, and prior to your surrender,
         15  that there had been a group of soldiers with you who
         16  were armed; is that correct?
         17       A.   Yes, it is.
         18       Q.   That there were 50 of them.
         19       A.   Yes, there were.
         20       Q.   Let's try to have short breaks between
         21  questions and answers.
         22            Could you tell me, Mr. Husic, something about
         23  those soldiers?  Did any of them surrender, of those
         24  who had weapons?
         25       A.   No, I didn't see that.

          1       Q.   Before you surrendered -- strike that.  Could
          2  you tell us, please, whether you know where those
          3  soldiers with weapons had gone.
          4       A.   I couldn't tell you anything about that
          5  because I didn't see anything.
          6       Q.   While you were on the hill, could you see the
          7  Serb soldiers calling out to you from the asphalt road?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   How far were you from them at that moment?
         10  Could you give us an estimate?
         11       A.   I couldn't.
         12       Q.   Did you see them before you decided to
         13  surrender or afterwards?
         14       A.   Could you please be more precise in your
         15  questions, sir.
         16       Q.   At one point you saw Serb soldiers there.
         17  Was it before or after you reached the decision to
         18  surrender?
         19       A.   We had seen them prior to that.
         20       Q.   You mean before you reached the decision to
         21  surrender.
         22       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         23       Q.   Thank you.  Mr. Husic, how many soldiers,
         24  Serb soldiers, approximately, were there at the meadow?
         25       A.   There were a lot of them.  I couldn't tell

          1  how many exactly, I couldn't give you the exact number,
          2  but they were all over the place.
          3       Q.   You were living in Srebrenica before 1995,
          4  the last three years preceding 1995.
          5       A.   No.  Two years.
          6       Q.   During those two years, did you leave
          7  Srebrenica?  Did you get out of Srebrenica?
          8       A.   No, I didn't.
          9       Q.   During those two years, did you ever see Serb
         10  soldiers?
         11       A.   [No audible response]
         12       Q.   Was there any --
         13            MR. HARMON:  Excuse me.  There was no answer,
         14  at least translated, to that question of Mr. Visnjic's,
         15  and in order to make the record complete, I think we
         16  need an answer to that last question.
         17            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
         18       Q.   During those two years, for the record,
         19  Witness, did you see Serb soldiers?
         20       A.   No, I didn't.
         21       Q.   The Muslim army that was in Srebrenica, did
         22  they have any special uniform?
         23       A.   No, I didn't see that but I don't think so.
         24       Q.   You testified in direct about a difference
         25  between three kinds of uniforms, that there was a blue

          1  police uniform and two other types of uniform; is that
          2  correct?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   Those were all uniforms of the Serb army.
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Could you explain, then, to me, you didn't
          7  leave Srebrenica and you didn't see Serb soldiers
          8  during that time, so how do you know that they used to
          9  have different kinds of uniforms?
         10       A.   Well, at the moment I surrendered, I could
         11  observe that, and I also saw that later on on TV and I
         12  learned that those were Serb uniforms.
         13       Q.   Could you give us an estimate of the number
         14  of people who were on the meadow where you were?
         15       A.   Between 900 and 1.000.
         16       Q.   You testified during the examination-in-chief
         17  about a video film, which has been shown by the
         18  Prosecutor, where we could see two Serb soldiers who
         19  were identified by you as the soldiers who were
         20  searching people for money.
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   Could you observe on their uniforms, on their
         23  right sleeve, a sign in three colours, with the
         24  lettering "Policija" on it?
         25       A.   No, I didn't.

          1       Q.   In the vicinity of the location where you
          2  surrendered and near the meadow where you were sitting,
          3  did you notice a police vehicle of blue and white
          4  colours?
          5       A.   No, I didn't.
          6       Q.   According to your impression, the Serb
          7  soldiers who were moving in the area, were they members
          8  of one unit or members of various units?  Were they
          9  just individuals coming in and out?  Were those units
         10  outside any control?  Was there any command?
         11       A.   I could see three different kinds of
         12  uniforms, so I don't think that they were members of
         13  one and the same unit.
         14       Q.   You mentioned the TV, the watching of TV
         15  after you had crossed over to the free territory.
         16  Could you tell us whether you had seen Muslim soldiers
         17  on TV, those who had managed to break through to the
         18  free territory?
         19       A.   I didn't see any soldiers; I only saw
         20  civilians.
         21       Q.   But you did watch TV.
         22       A.   No, I didn't watch.
         23       Q.   When you reached Tisca, you got off the bus.
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   And you continued on foot.

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Did anyone approach you, anyone from amongst
          3  the Serb civilians or the military?  Was there anything
          4  special that you could observe at that moment?
          5       A.   Nobody approached me personally.
          6       Q.   Does the name "Ejub Golic" tell you
          7  something?
          8       A.   Ejub Golic?  Yes.
          9       Q.   Was he a commander of a Muslim unit?
         10       A.   According to what I have heard, yes.
         11       Q.   Did he also take part in the breakthrough?
         12       A.   Yes, I heard that he did so.
         13       Q.   But you don't know anything else about that.
         14       A.   No, I don't.
         15       Q.   Have you heard of a unit called the Mountain
         16  Battalion of the Muslim army?
         17       A.   Yes, I have.
         18       Q.   The soldiers who were protecting you, who
         19  were with your group, were they members of that
         20  Mountain Battalion?
         21       A.   Yes, they were.
         22       Q.   Thank you.
         23            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I
         24  have no other questions to ask of this witness.
         25            Thank you, Mr. Husic.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          2  Mr. Visnjic.
          3            Will there be any redirect, Mr. Harmon?
          4            MR. HARMON:  There will be none,
          5  Mr. President.  Thank you.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          7  very much, Mr. Harmon.
          8            Judge Riad.
          9            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         10  Mr. President.
         11                 Questioned by the Court:
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Husic, good morning.
         13       A.   Good morning, Your Honour.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  I understood you said that your
         15  father did not survive.
         16       A.   Yes.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  You also mentioned that many
         18  people did not survive, thousands or whatever.  How do
         19  you know they did not survive?  Do you have any news?
         20  Or perhaps they are somewhere.
         21       A.   I don't think that they have survived.  They
         22  have been missing for five years, and I think that they
         23  were executed like everybody else, that they were
         24  killed.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, speaking of execution, you

          1  mentioned that the soldiers would take the Muslim
          2  prisoners behind the tank and they would come back
          3  without them.  But did you hear shots, or were they
          4  slaughtered by knife?  How did you understand the
          5  situation?
          6       A.   No shooting could be heard, so I think they
          7  did it with a knife or something else.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  But no evidence was there.  You
          9  did not see blood around; you didn't hear shouts,
         10  cries.  When people are slaughtered, they can react.
         11  Did you feel anything?  What was the atmosphere like?
         12  Of course, they did not disappear by enchantment, but
         13  how was it?  How did it happen?
         14       A.   It happened in a simple way.  They would come
         15  and take men away and the person would never come
         16  back.  And we didn't hear anything.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  You were all in the same --
         18       A.   They would come -- yes, on the meadow, near
         19  the tank.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  On the meadow, near the tank.
         21  If they were killed, how could they hide them?  Where
         22  did they hide them?
         23       A.   I couldn't tell you anything about that.  I
         24  didn't see it.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Was it in the woods that they

          1  could hide them, or you could see the corpses?  Was it
          2  an open air place where you could see people or a place
          3  in the woods so that nobody could see the other?
          4       A.   It was a cornfield, maize field, not a
          5  forest, where they took people.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  And the maize was high, it could
          7  hide a person.
          8       A.   Yes.  Yes.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Then, concerning your
         10  father, you are sure he did not survive?  Did they find
         11  his corpse, or did some people inform you that he did
         12  not survive?  Can we still hope that he is alive?
         13       A.   I can always hope, but judging by the kind of
         14  people who were there, I very much doubt that he would
         15  have survived.  I didn't hear anything and he has not
         16  been identified as one of the killed.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you mentioned something
         18  rather important.  You said that some of the soldiers
         19  were in the Serbian military uniform.  Do you mean the
         20  military uniform of the Serbian army or of the Bosnian
         21  Serb army?  Because there is a difference.  Do you know
         22  the difference?
         23       A.   Well, I think that they were members of the
         24  Serb army, that is, the army of the Bosnian Serbs.  But
         25  I couldn't tell you the difference.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you see any badge on them to
          2  indicate which division they were from?  Or this was
          3  something too difficult at that time.
          4       A.   It was difficult.  I could only see some kind
          5  of black ribbons on their shoulders.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  And they were, I think, as you
          7  said, in camouflage, black and green; is that right?
          8       A.   Yes, that's right.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Was this indicative of a certain
         10  group of military people, of a certain division which
         11  you knew about?
         12       A.   Well, it was indicative of one particular
         13  group because there was a group of people who were
         14  wearing the same uniforms and those black ribbons.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you know the name of the
         16  group?
         17       A.   No.  No.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, in one of the exhibits
         19  which we saw, the pictures or the movie, there was a
         20  very interesting answer of a soldier to another
         21  soldier, when one of them was saying, "3.000 have
         22  surrendered and the people in Belgrade think we
         23  exaggerate."
         24            Now, what is the people of Belgrade's
         25  business with Srebrenica?  Do you have an idea?

          1       A.   Well, I think they had direct influence on
          2  all that, that they were allies of the Bosnian Serbs.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  So the soldiers were speaking
          4  about Belgrade as if they come from there or what?
          5       A.   In a different sense, I think, that they --
          6  that they were informed about the media.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, the last question:  When
          8  you said that the soldiers were taking people behind
          9  the tank and they disappeared after that, whom did --
         10  was there any kind of preference or priorities?  Whom
         11  did they take?  Would they take -- did they choose just
         12  something like guessing or taking people, a certain
         13  kind of people?  For instance, people who prove to be
         14  military or that sort of thing or young.  Was there any
         15  indication whom they were looking for?
         16       A.   They took people at random as they pleased.
         17  I know that this young man in a T-shirt was taken away
         18  probably because they thought he was a soldier.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  And they took other people who
         20  were not soldiers, who could not be soldiers?
         21       A.   Yes.  They couldn't be soldiers.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  You mean old or children or boys
         23  or what?
         24       A.   Also elderly people and young people.  People
         25  who were dressed in civilian clothes who were not

          1  soldiers and whom I knew.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. Husic.  Thank
          3  you.  I hope your father will come back.  Thank you.
          4       A.   Thank you.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          6  Judge Riad.
          7            Judge Wald.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  Mr. Husic, when you started out
          9  from Srebrenica with the -- or near Srebrenica with the
         10  column of men that were going to go through the woods,
         11  did you know the reason why it had been decided that
         12  the men who would go through the woods on their own to
         13  try to reach Tuzla, and the women and children would be
         14  helped to get along to the UN Compound in Potocari?
         15            I mean what -- did anybody say out loud what
         16  was the basis for that decision since everybody,
         17  obviously, wanted to get out and get into the free
         18  territory?
         19            Do you know why it was decided to have a
         20  column of men go through the woods and have the women
         21  and children go ahead and the elderly go ahead to the
         22  UN Compound?
         23       A.   I don't know why a decision like that had
         24  been reached.  I simply followed those men together
         25  with my brother and my father.  And the main objective

          1  of our breakthrough through the woods was to save
          2  ourselves because it was believed that the women and
          3  children would not be harmed in Potocari.  And we knew
          4  that they would be transported to Tuzla.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  But there was, I gather, from
          6  your answer, a fear that if the men went with the women
          7  and the children up to Potocari, that harm would befall
          8  them as opposed to the women and children; is that
          9  right?
         10       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         11            JUDGE WALD:  When Judge Riad asked you about
         12  how you knew that many of the people you talked about
         13  or identified did not survive, could you tell us
         14  approximately or about how many people you saw the
         15  soldiers pull out of the crowd or the column, take away
         16  behind the cornfields or in the cornfields behind the
         17  tank, you saw something actually done to them to the
         18  extent they were taken away, as opposed to people that
         19  you just have no idea what happened to them, they just
         20  disappeared?
         21       A.   You mean from the meadow, concerning the
         22  people who were taken away?
         23            JUDGE WALD:  Yes.
         24       A.   I don't know what happened to them after I
         25  left the meadow.  I don't know what was their fate.

          1            JUDGE WALD:  My question would be how many
          2  people did you actually see Serb soldiers take out of
          3  the meadow or take out of the column that was going
          4  along, take them away and then you never saw them
          5  again?
          6       A.   Several of them would take them away.  One of
          7  the men was taken away by two people, two men.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  Well, let me just ask you one
          9  final question about that.
         10            Would you say that you saw that happen, you
         11  saw a Muslim man taken either out of the meadow or away
         12  from the column by soldiers, singled out and taken
         13  away?  Would you say six, twelve, I don't know, how
         14  many, about?
         15       A.   No, I saw between four and six of such cases
         16  that I saw personally.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  And the rest of the people that
         18  you say did not survive, it means that they were either
         19  in the meadow or in the column and then they were just
         20  never seen again, that you know about.  Right?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         24  very much, Judge Wald.
         25            Mr. Husic, I have two questions for you.

          1  While you were still in the woods, at one point in time
          2  you heard soldiers speaking about a surrender, that you
          3  should surrender because the UNPROFOR soldiers would
          4  protect you; is that correct?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So before
          7  you surrendered, did you have an opportunity to see the
          8  soldiers or at least the individuals whom you believed
          9  to be UN soldiers?
         10       A.   Yes.  They were walking up and down the road.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So could
         12  you then tell us what tilted the balance in favour of
         13  the decision to surrender, because you were
         14  insisting -- the fact that you saw them, did you insist
         15  because of that?
         16       A.   Well, if we hadn't seen the UN soldiers and
         17  the UN personnel carrier, we probably wouldn't
         18  surrender.  But there was some hope because of the
         19  presence of UNPROFOR, and we thought that they would
         20  not dare kill us all in their presence.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] What was
         22  your reaction when you finally realised that they were
         23  not UNPROFOR soldiers?
         24       A.   Well, I knew what was in store for us.  I
         25  realised that we had been lured down to the asphalt

          1  road.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          3  Witness.
          4            My second question is the following:  A
          5  soldier told you at one point that Alija was not there
          6  to protect you but that you will wait and that you will
          7  see Ratko Mladic, who would arrive to the meadow.
          8            What was your reaction to those words?  Did
          9  you believe that Ratko Mladic would come or not?
         10       A.   We believed.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Why?  Why
         12  did you believe that?
         13       A.   Because whatever they said, they did.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But when
         15  were the threats made?
         16       A.   At the moment we came down to the meadow, a
         17  Serb soldier at one point said, "Wait until General
         18  Mladic comes here."
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Did you see
         20  Ratko Mladic?
         21       A.   No, I didn't.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Do you
         23  remember what language the soldiers spoke?
         24       A.   You mean -- yeah, they were speaking
         25  Serbo-Croatian.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But was
          2  there a distant accent by which you could tell where
          3  they were from?
          4       A.   No.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          6  very much, Witness.  I don't have any other questions.
          7            We are aware of the fact that you have lived
          8  through some terrible events.  You have answered
          9  questions that were put to you by the Prosecutor, by
         10  the Defence, and by the Judges.
         11            Is there anything else, Witness, that you
         12  wish to say?  Is there anything that have you not had
         13  opportunity to say so far?
         14       A.   I believe I have said everything that I had
         15  to say.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         17  Thank you, very much.  I believe that there are some
         18  exhibits to be taken care of.  Witness, could you
         19  please stay here a while.
         20            Mr. Harmon.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, there are a
         22  number of exhibits.  There are three film clips which
         23  are Prosecutor's Exhibit 101, 102, and 103 and
         24  companion transcripts, 101, 102, and 103A.
         25            Then there is Prosecutor's Exhibit 104 which

          1  is a still photograph taken from the Prosecutor's
          2  Exhibit 103 showing the witness, himself.
          3            There is Prosecutor's Exhibits 105, 106, and
          4  107, a series of still images showing Bosnian Serb
          5  soldiers in stolen Dutch UN flak jackets.
          6            Prosecutor's Exhibits 108, 109, 110, 111,
          7  pictures of people who surrendered alive to the Bosnian
          8  Serb army and who have not been heard of since, and who
          9  are known to this witness by name.
         10            We would move into evidence each of those
         11  exhibits, Mr. President.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         13  Mr. Visnjic, any objections.
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  No, Your
         15  Honour.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well
         17  then.  Mr. Dubuisson, the exhibits mentioned by the
         18  Prosecutor, will be admitted into evidence.  Will you
         19  please take note of that.  Thank you.
         20            Mr. Husic, you're still a very young man and
         21  you will probably live a very long life.  We would like
         22  to congratulate you that you have survived, and I
         23  know -- hope that you are aware of the importance of
         24  the role that you have to tell the story that you have
         25  been through.  All these events should be condemned.

          1  They cannot be tolerated by humanity.
          2            We would just like to thank you once again
          3  for coming here to testify and wish you a safe journey
          4  home.  The usher will show you out of the courtroom.
          5  Thank you, very much.
          6       A.   Thank you, Your Honour.
          7                 [The witness withdrew]
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I see
          9  that -- I hope you have another witness, Mr. Harmon.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Yes, we have another witness,
         11  Mr. President, a protected witness.  Mr. McCloskey will
         12  lead the evidence with the next witness.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We have
         14  worked for 40 minutes.  Perhaps we should begin with
         15  that testimony and then after that, we will have a
         16  longer break so as to manage the time available to us
         17  in the best possible manner.
         18            Can we have the witness brought in, please?
         19            I should like us first to specify the
         20  protective measures that are requested.
         21            MR. HARMON:  The witness will require a
         22  pseudonym and face distortion, so the courtroom will
         23  have to be prepared for the witness to arrive.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         25  case, Mr. Petrusic.
          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]  Yes, we are
          2  aware of the proposal of the prosecution and we have no
          3  objection.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
          5  case, it would perhaps be better to have a 20-minute
          6  break and when we resume, the Judges will already have
          7  the witness in the courtroom.  So a 20-minute break,
          8  please.
          9                 --- Recess taken at 12.33 p.m.
         10                 --- On resuming at 12.54 p.m.
         11                 [The witness entered court]
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         13  afternoon, Witness L.  Do you hear me?
         14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I do.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You're
         16  going to read the solemn declaration that the usher
         17  will give you, please.
         18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
         19  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
         20  and nothing but the truth.
         21                 WITNESS:  WITNESS L
         22                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Please be
         24  seated.  The registrar is going to show you a piece of
         25  paper with your name written on it.  Please tell us

          1  only whether that is your name by saying yes or no.
          2            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Therefore,
          4  that is, indeed, your name.  Is that your name,
          5  Witness L?
          6            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now you
          8  will be answering questions put to you by
          9  Mr. McCloskey, the Prosecutor, who is standing to your
         10  right.
         11            Mr. McCloskey, I give you the floor, please.
         12            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         13            Before I get to the witness, one small piece
         14  of business from yesterday.  We apparently discovered
         15  some French translations of yesterday's protective
         16  witness' medical records, which I offer as evidence
         17  under seal, Exhibit 118A and 117B, which I believe have
         18  been provided to the Registry.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         20  Mr. Dubuisson, do you have the exhibits?
         21            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes, I do.
         22  I'm going to distribute them to the parties.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         24  Thank you.
         25            Are you in a position to start,

          1  Mr. McCloskey?
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, we are.  Mr. President,
          3  is there a particular time you think you might want to
          4  break so that I can try to anticipate that, or do you
          5  want to just see how it goes?
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  A
          7  very good question, and thank you.  Perhaps halfway
          8  along we'll have a 15-minute break.  We've already, I
          9  think, have three breaks today, so we'll have a
         10  fourth.  Today is going to be an exception.  We'll make
         11  a break about halfway along of about 15 minutes, so you
         12  can control your time.  Thank you.
         13                 Examined by Mr. McCloskey:
         14       Q.   Witness L, none of that involved you, but
         15  it's now time to ask you some questions, to have your
         16  testimony.
         17            First of all, can you tell us where you're
         18  from.
         19       A.   I'm from the municipality of Zvornik, the
         20  village of [redacted].
         21       Q.   What's your birth date?
         22       A.   I was born on the [redacted].
         23       Q.   Are you a Muslim by faith?
         24       A.   I am.
         25       Q.   Prior to the war breaking out, you were

          1  living in the Zvornik area.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Where were you working?
          4       A.   I was working in Belgrade.
          5       Q.   What was the name of the company?
          6       A.   Ratko Mitrovic ^.
          7       Q.   How long had you worked for that company
          8  prior to the breaking out of the war?
          9       A.   I worked there for 18 years and several
         10  months.
         11       Q.   What kind of work was that?
         12       A.   I was a construction worker.  I was a skilled
         13  worker for reinforced concrete.
         14       Q.   After the war started, when did you move to
         15  Srebrenica?
         16       A.   I moved to Srebrenica on the 14th of March,
         17  1993.
         18       Q.   Where were you living on July 11th, 1995?
         19       A.   On the 11th of July, 1995, I was living in
         20  Srebrenica.
         21       Q.   Who were you living with?
         22       A.   I was living with two brothers.
         23       Q.   What was your occupation?  How did you keep
         24  yourself alive?
         25       A.   We lived off the land, we farmed the land,

          1  and we also received some humanitarian aid.
          2       Q.   Were any of the three brothers in your family
          3  in the military?
          4       A.   Yes, one of my brothers, but he was a cook.
          5       Q.   What did the three brothers decide to do on
          6  July 11th when the town was falling to the Bosnian Serb
          7  army?
          8       A.   One of my brothers was disabled.  He was not
          9  disabled during the war; he had a bad leg.  He went to
         10  Potocari, surrendered to UNPROFOR.  And the other
         11  brother headed, together with me, into the woods.
         12       Q.   Did any of your brothers make it?
         13       A.   Yes.  This one who was disabled, he was
         14  allowed to cross into our territory.
         15       Q.   How about your other brother, the brother
         16  that was a cook in the army?
         17       A.   The other brother was with me.  He was
         18  captured together with me, and I don't know anything as
         19  to what happened to him.
         20       Q.   What did you decide to do on July 11th?
         21       A.   On July the 11th, when Srebrenica fell, we
         22  decided to travel towards the free territory of Tuzla,
         23  through the woods.
         24       Q.   So where did you first go?
         25       A.   We first went to a rally in the village of

          1  Susnjari, municipality of Srebrenica.
          2       Q.   Do you have any knowledge about the
          3  decision-making process that the men took to decide to
          4  rally there around Susnjari?
          5       A.   I don't know, because the commanders must
          6  have known.  I'm not familiar with that.
          7       Q.   When you got to Susnjari, about what time did
          8  you get there?
          9       A.   We got there in the evening, perhaps it was
         10  around 10.00.
         11       Q.   So that evening of July 11th, when you got to
         12  this area --
         13       A.   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
         14       Q.   -- are you able to give any kind of an
         15  estimate of how many people were gathered in that area?
         16       A.   According to an estimate, there were between
         17  10.000 and 15.000 people.
         18       Q.   Is that an estimate someone's told you, or is
         19  that your personal estimate from actually looking at
         20  the crowd?
         21       A.   No, it was our personal estimate.
         22       Q.   When you say "our", who do you mean?
         23       A.   I mean myself, I mean mine.
         24       Q.   Were there any women or children in that
         25  crowd, or was it mostly men?

          1       A.   There were only men, as far as I could see.
          2       Q.   Could you tell how many men were armed with
          3  weapons?
          4       A.   There were some with weapons but I don't know
          5  the number.  Maybe 200, 300.  I don't know exactly.
          6       Q.   These are the ones that were within your area
          7  of vision; is that right?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   So there could have been many more than 200.
         10       A.   I don't know.  I couldn't even see them all.
         11       Q.   Did you hear any commanders make any
         12  decisions or announce anything to the group while you
         13  were there in Susnjari?
         14       A.   No, I didn't hear anything.
         15       Q.   What happened after you got there?
         16       A.   What happened was that when we arrived, that
         17  evening columns were formed, I heard from this other
         18  men, that they started leaving around midnight.  My
         19  column left in the afternoon.
         20       Q.   Do you know roughly how many people were in
         21  that first column or group of men that left at
         22  midnight?
         23       A.   I don't know because the column went
         24  continuously.
         25       Q.   So you didn't leave the Susnjari area until

          1  the afternoon of the following day.  That would be July
          2  12th.
          3       A.   Yes.  It was a Wednesday.
          4       Q.   Do you know roughly how many people were in
          5  your group?
          6       A.   I don't know because as one group left,
          7  another went after it.  So it would be difficult to
          8  tell how many men were in each group.
          9       Q.   Do you know why the men decided to go through
         10  the woods the way they did?
         11       A.   Because we didn't dare go to Potocari,
         12  because we saw the situation, that they had threatened
         13  us that if Srebrenica fell, that they would settle
         14  accounts with the able-bodied men, and that is, anyway,
         15  what they did.
         16       Q.   When you finally got started in your group,
         17  on the 12th, can you describe the journey through the
         18  woods until you surrendered?
         19       A.   When we started from Susnjari, we were going
         20  for about 300 metres and then we entered the woods
         21  called Buljim.  Shortly after that the column stopped.
         22  When we stopped, men asked that the few remaining
         23  people with weapons should go in front.  And those
         24  people who were going in front of me saw some dead
         25  bodies and they became afraid.

          1            Then those under arms went off and we didn't
          2  see them again.  I don't know whether they abandoned us
          3  or what; we don't know.  We continued for along as we
          4  could see, while the daylight lasted.  And then when
          5  darkness fell, I spent the night under an oak tree, and
          6  then the next day I found a group of people, among whom
          7  was my brother.
          8            Then shortly after that, Serb soldiers
          9  started calling out over the loudspeakers for us to
         10  surrender.  As we didn't have any loudspeakers, our men
         11  would tell them aloud that we would surrender if
         12  UNPROFOR or the Red Cross were there.  They didn't
         13  respond.  They gave us an ultimatum, a deadline, until
         14  10.00; then they postponed it to 1500 hours.
         15            As we thought that the situation was
         16  hopeless, the men decided to surrender.  As we were
         17  coming down, Serb soldiers came onto the road.  They
         18  were all in uniform, camouflage uniform, and first they
         19  asked us to give them any money we had, German marks or
         20  dollars or any other foreign currency.  Those who had
         21  anything gave it up; those who didn't, they didn't.
         22  Then they threatened, "If we find money on someone who
         23  didn't surrender it," they would suffer the same fate
         24  as those before them.
         25            Then women and children were passing by the

          1  road, as we were standing by the road.  And then they
          2  ordered us to raise our hands up.
          3            After a while, they gave us orders to run for
          4  some 50 metres and then go uphill, where we found a
          5  large group of people sitting there.  So they ordered
          6  us to sit down and form lines and rows, and once we
          7  did, a Serb soldier, with a scarf on his head -- he was
          8  somewhere between 20 and 22 -- he told me that the
          9  governments were negotiating an exchange on the
         10  principle "all for all".
         11            When all of the people had gathered there --
         12  according to my estimate, it was about 2.000 to 2.500
         13  people -- then this Serb soldier again told us, and on
         14  his sleeve it said "The army of Republika Srpska."
         15            When those soldiers were changing shifts --
         16       Q.   I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Let me take you
         17  back and ask you a couple of clarifying questions, if I
         18  can.  How many people in your group decided to finally
         19  surrender?
         20       A.   I don't know the numbers, but it was a very
         21  large column.  It was about 200 metres long, and it
         22  went two by two in most cases.
         23       Q.   When you first came to the area where you
         24  were able to see Serb soldiers, can you give us any
         25  kind of an estimate of how many Serb soldiers you were

          1  able to see when you turned yourself in?
          2       A.   According to an estimate, there were at least
          3  50 Serb soldiers.  There was a personnel carrier that
          4  was parked there, and there were some artillery weapons
          5  too, but we didn't dare look at them because we didn't
          6  have time.  We were running to the place where we had
          7  to sit.
          8       Q.   You said the first group of Serb soldiers was
          9  about 50.  Do you know what kind of outfits they were
         10  wearing?
         11       A.   Camouflage uniforms, as worn by the army of
         12  the Republika Srpska.
         13       Q.   You said this group tried to take your
         14  money.  What about personal belongings?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   What about personal belongings that people
         17  had with them?
         18       A.   They seized our personal belongings as well,
         19  and if anyone had a hat on his head, they took that off
         20  too.
         21       Q.   Do you know roughly where this area was that
         22  you were finally placed, among of rows of people, near
         23  the asphalt road?
         24       A.   This was between Sandici and Kravica,
         25  according to my judgement, because I was coming from

          1  the other side.  But I think it was somewhere between
          2  Sandici and Kravica.
          3       Q.   What happened once you got there and were put
          4  among those rows of other Muslim men?
          5       A.   When we got there, we had to form rows, and
          6  then there was a change of shift and they told us some
          7  other troops had arrived also wearing camouflage
          8  uniforms.  Then they said, "These are Arkan's men."  I
          9  didn't notice any badges on them or not with the words
         10  "Arkanovci" on it because we didn't dare look.  There
         11  were two soldiers to each row.
         12            Then one of those soldiers who was on the
         13  personnel carrier said, "Don't let me kill you all, and
         14  then I could go to The Hague."  He knew what "The
         15  Hague" meant even then.  He was a young man of 25, not
         16  more.
         17            Then when those soldiers came, they said that
         18  they were Arkanovci.  They forced us to lie down on our
         19  stomachs and then shout, "Long live the King," and we
         20  did.  Then again they told us to sit up.  When we sat
         21  up normally, then it was about an hour or an hour and a
         22  half before nightfall.  I didn't have a watch.
         23            Then the gentleman, General Mladic, arrived.
         24       Q.   Excuse me for interrupting you, but the
         25  interpreters have to interpret everything you're saying

          1  in English and French and you're going a little
          2  quickly.  So if you could try and slow down and give
          3  some breaks so I might be able to ask some questions in
          4  between.
          5       A.   Yes.  Yes, I'll do that.
          6       Q.   So this second group of soldiers that
          7  arrived, the second shift as you've called it --
          8       A.   Yes, yes.
          9       Q.   -- how many was in that second shift?
         10       A.   I don't know the number, but I think, again,
         11  there were at least 50, because there were two soldiers
         12  to each row and there were more than 20 rows, maybe
         13  25.  That's why my estimate was about 50.
         14       Q.   Were those soldiers armed?
         15       A.   Yes, with automatic rifles.
         16       Q.   About the time that you said Mladic arrived,
         17  do you have an estimate of how many Muslim men were
         18  sitting in this area where you were?
         19       A.   At least 2.000, maybe as many as 2.500.
         20       Q.   What time did Mladic arrive?
         21       A.   I didn't have a watch, but it was an hour and
         22  a half prior to nightfall, I think.
         23       Q.   And that time in Bosnia would be roughly what
         24  time?
         25       A.   It would be about 7.30 because it was

          1  summertime.
          2       Q.   How were you able to recognise Mladic?
          3       A.   I hadn't known Mladic from before, but people
          4  who watched television knew him, and I recognised
          5  Mladic when I reached free territory.
          6       Q.   What happened when Mladic got there?
          7       A.   When Mladic came, he said, "Good evening,
          8  neighbours."  We replied, "Good evening."  And then he
          9  said, "The governments are negotiating, and tomorrow
         10  you will all be exchanged for all."  We will go to
         11  hangars.  We won't have any supper, but we will have
         12  water ^.
         13       Q.   I'll just ask you to slow down a little bit
         14  if you could.  Anything else that you remember him
         15  saying?
         16       A.   He said that we would be exchanged the next
         17  day, all for all, and he said that we would be given
         18  water, that we would go to some hangars.  But he didn't
         19  say that we would be given any supper, though the
         20  previous -- his predecessor said we would be given
         21  supper.
         22            We thanked him and we applauded him when he
         23  promised that he would exchange us the next day.
         24       Q.   Okay.  Can you tell us how long you --
         25  between the time that Mladic had spoke to you and the

          1  time that you first arrived at the meadow, how long had
          2  that been?  What period of time did you spend on that
          3  meadow?
          4       A.   Five or ten minutes, perhaps.
          5       Q.   How long were you at that meadow for the
          6  whole day?
          7       A.   We were there for about three or four hours.
          8       Q.   Did you notice any of the Muslim men being
          9  abused in any way during those three or four hours?
         10       A.   No.  No one was abused.
         11       Q.   Did you see anyone transported, any of the
         12  Muslim men transported away in any direction by any
         13  vehicles or marched away by foot?
         14       A.   No, they let a woman go and a child, and two
         15  young girls, and they let go eight to ten boys between
         16  12 and 14.  These were released by one of the Serb
         17  soldiers.
         18       Q.   Did you hear any announcement about young men
         19  or how did you know that they picked out boys 12 to 14?
         20       A.   They didn't make any announcements, but the
         21  boys of that age would get up.
         22            A rather large boy that got up, they told him
         23  to sit down because he was big enough to carry a
         24  machine-gun.
         25       Q.   Do you have any idea what happened to those

          1  young boys that they picked out of the crowd?
          2       A.   Those children were immediately sent by
          3  vehicle and they were released.  The vehicle went to
          4  free territory to Tuzla.
          5       Q.   How do you know they were released?
          6       A.   Because I came across that boy and I asked
          7  him and he said yes.
          8       Q.   So after all this, you ran across one of the
          9  boys you saw released in the field in the free
         10  territory?
         11       A.   No, I hadn't seen him, but I spoke to people
         12  I had known, and I met him while I was living in
         13  Srebrenica.
         14       Q.   Okay.  And what happened after Mladic's
         15  little speech was over?
         16       A.   When Mladic finished, he left after some 10
         17  or 15 minutes.  The vehicles that had taken the women
         18  and children to free territory returned.
         19            Then we were ordered for the first row to get
         20  up and to board the vehicle.  Then the first row got
         21  up, then the second row, and row by row, I don't
         22  remember which row I was in, my turn came.  I boarded a
         23  trailer of a truck.  Then I saw a Serb soldier with a
         24  cockade entering and saying that he would board the
         25  truck with the driver.  He didn't mistreat us, he

          1  didn't sit with us.  And they drove us --
          2       Q.   I'm sorry, you said you saw a Serb soldier
          3  with a something, I didn't quite understand what it was
          4  that you saw this Serb soldier have.
          5       A.   Cockade, it's a Chetnik badge on a hat that
          6  used to be worn by Chetniks.
          7       Q.   Did this person have a weapon?
          8       A.   I cannot recollect whether he had a weapon
          9  inside the vehicle or not.
         10       Q.   And the vehicle that you got into, can you
         11  describe what kind of vehicle that was?
         12       A.   It was a truck with a trailer, and I was in
         13  the trailer.  You know what a truck is and a trailer.
         14       Q.   Can you tell me what normally is carried in
         15  the trailer that you and other men were in?
         16       A.   One usually transports coal because the sides
         17  were rather high, the kind used for coal or
         18  agricultural produce that is light so to avoid it
         19  spilling over.
         20       Q.   Can you describe the size of this trailer and
         21  the height of the sides?
         22       A.   The trailer was at least 10 metres long and
         23  the sides may have been 1.20 metres, 1.40 metres.
         24       Q.   About how wide was it?
         25       A.   Probably two and a half to three metres, I

          1  don't know exactly.  But that would be my estimate that
          2  is how wide it should be.
          3       Q.   And do you know roughly how many men were put
          4  in the back of this trailer?
          5       A.   I don't know.  Between 25 and 30 at least
          6  could fit, but I don't remember.  I didn't count.
          7       Q.   Were the men standing or sitting or a
          8  combination of both?
          9       A.   They were sitting.  All of them were sitting.
         10       Q.   So while you were sitting in there, the
         11  height of the sides of the trailer must have been well
         12  over your heads so it would be difficult to see out; is
         13  that right?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   And could you tell before you actually sat in
         16  the trailer how many other vehicles were on either side
         17  of the trailer you got into?
         18       A.   I don't know.  There were some vehicles, but
         19  how many, I don't know.
         20       Q.   Do you have any way to give us any kind of an
         21  estimate?  More than three?
         22       A.   More, of course.  There may have been 10 or
         23  15 vehicles.
         24       Q.   And what kind of vehicles were they?
         25       A.   There were trucks, trailers, buses, trucks

          1  with trailers, because they were driving women and
          2  children in all kinds of vehicles.
          3       Q.   That day while you were in that meadow lined
          4  up with the men, did you see vehicles go by you on the
          5  asphalt road?
          6       A.   We only saw those vehicles taking the women
          7  and children.  There were no other vehicles on the road
          8  at the time.
          9       Q.   And what direction were the women and
         10  children being taken into in vehicles when you were
         11  sitting on the meadow?
         12       A.   They were driving them in the direction of
         13  Kladanj towards the free territory of the Tuzla region.
         14       Q.   And when you were put in the back of this
         15  trailer, how long were you in the back of the trailer
         16  until the truck moved off?
         17       A.   It moved off soon after that.
         18       Q.   And which direction did it go in?
         19       A.   In the direction of Bratunac.
         20       Q.   And where did it go?
         21       A.   We were taken to Bratunac and once we got
         22  there, they took us to a man who was a driver, and he
         23  said that the buses belonged to the Vihor Transport
         24  Company and that the garages that were there were also
         25  part of the Vihor Company.  But I didn't know the man,

          1  I just realised he was a driver.
          2       Q.   Was this the man that was in the back of the
          3  trailer with you or someone else?
          4       A.   He was in the back of the trailer with me, he
          5  was in the same trailer.
          6       Q.   When you got into the town of Bratunac, how
          7  did you know you were in the town if you were down low
          8  in the bed of this trailer?
          9       A.   Well, we could see on our left-hand side,
         10  because the buildings were three to four floors high.
         11  And on the right side, there seemed to have been no
         12  buildings at all.
         13       Q.   And do you know roughly what time of day or
         14  evening it was when you arrived in Bratunac?
         15       A.   It was in the evening at about half past
         16  nine.  It was already dark.
         17       Q.   And as you were sitting in the back of this
         18  trailer, could you tell how many other vehicles were
         19  around your vehicle?
         20       A.   The vehicles were parked, one after the
         21  other.  According to my estimate, I know that there
         22  were many of them both ahead and behind, and I know
         23  that Serb soldiers were looking for men who were on
         24  those buses.
         25       Q.   How do you know Serb soldiers were looking

          1  for the men on the buses both in front of you and
          2  behind you?  Could you hear it or could you see it?
          3       A.   We could hear them.  We could hear them ask
          4  about the vehicle, because we didn't know that, we just
          5  realised that when they came to our vehicle.  First
          6  they asked about a village of Pusmulici, near
          7  Srebrenica.
          8       Q.   Now, who were they asking about this
          9  village?  Were these people in your vehicle or one of
         10  the other vehicles?
         11       A.   In one of the other vehicles that were near
         12  us.
         13       Q.   You were just able to hear this from where
         14  you were sitting.
         15       A.   Yes.  Yes, I could hear them.  They were
         16  talking in loud voices.
         17       Q.   Why didn't you stand up and look out?
         18       A.   Well, I didn't dare do it.  There were Serb
         19  soldiers standing guard around the vehicles.  Somebody,
         20  I remembered, stuck up his hand and was hit on his hand
         21  by a rifle butt by someone.
         22       Q.   From the sound of the people outside the
         23  vehicles, could you get a rough idea of the number of
         24  Serb soldiers outside the vehicles?
         25       A.   No, we couldn't tell the number of those

          1  soldiers.  We couldn't see them.  One of them peeped
          2  across the side of the trailer and we could see him.
          3  But we couldn't tell how many of them there were around
          4  the trucks.
          5       Q.   Let me go back to what you were telling us
          6  earlier.  You heard Serb soldiers asking at one of your
          7  neighbouring trucks if there was anyone from a
          8  particular village.  Can you tell us about that?
          9       A.   Well, they said, "If so and so appears," they
         10  would ask for the man's name, surname, and father's
         11  name, and then they would take the man to a garage, on
         12  which the door was open.  At that moment we would hear
         13  thuds and people screaming.  The man would start to
         14  scream, to cry, and then they would shout at him, they
         15  would yell at him, and then we could hear fire from an
         16  automatic weapon, and then everything would go quiet.
         17  This went on throughout the night.
         18       Q.   Again, I know this is very difficult to
         19  estimate, but can you give us any idea of how many
         20  different Muslim men you heard that were put in a
         21  situation where they were taken out to this area nearby
         22  you and where you could hear these sounds?
         23       A.   We were some 30 metres away from the garage
         24  and we were able to observe more during the night.  But
         25  I couldn't tell you the number because they kept taking

          1  people away all night.  They also hit people near the
          2  trucks with their rifle butts, so we could see that as
          3  they were taking them, going past our truck.
          4       Q.   How was it that you were able to see more
          5  during the night?
          6       A.   Well, it was because, for example, those who
          7  were in the middle could raise, a bit, their heads,
          8  they could observe things, but those who were next to
          9  the sides of the trailer couldn't.
         10       Q.   Were you able to raise your head at all and
         11  look out?
         12       A.   No, I couldn't.  I just had a quick look.  I
         13  would stick out my head like this [indicates] because
         14  the area in the front was a little elevated, and that's
         15  how I was able to see what was happening.  But I didn't
         16  dare to stand up completely.
         17       Q.   Did any soldiers come to your truck that
         18  evening, that night?
         19       A.   Yes, on two occasions.  First, when a soldier
         20  came, he asked for a man and a man replied.  He was
         21  from the municipality of Srebrenica; he was not from
         22  the village they were asking about, so they told him to
         23  sit down.
         24            Then two other men were taken off our
         25  trailer, most probably because they had been

          1  recognised.  One of them was between 30 and 35 years of
          2  age; the other one was a bit younger.  Most probably he
          3  was immediately recognised, because they asked him
          4  about his name -- I don't know whether his name was
          5  Omer or whether it was his father's name -- but he was
          6  taken on the following morning, and we haven't heard
          7  anything about what happened to him.
          8       Q.   Your brother wasn't in the back of the
          9  vehicle with you.
         10       A.   No, he wasn't there at all.
         11       Q.   Where did you lose track of your brother?
         12       A.   At the spot where we had gathered while we
         13  were sitting on the meadow, and I haven't heard of him
         14  ever since.
         15       Q.   Did you know any of the men that were in the
         16  back of the trailer with you, that spent the night in
         17  Bratunac?
         18       A.   I knew only one of them by name.  He was also
         19  from the Srebrenica municipality.  There was nobody
         20  from my area, actually.
         21       Q.   Can you tell us his name?
         22       A.   Yes, I know his name.  He was Mehmed, Mehmed
         23  Began.
         24       Q.   When the morning came, what happened?
         25       A.   When it dawned, we heard them yelling and

          1  shouting, saying, "Now you take them to Alija and
          2  exchange them."
          3       Q.   What else happened?
          4       A.   At that point the trucks started to move, and
          5  they were stopped in the outskirts of Bratunac.
          6       Q.   I'm going to take you briefly back to the
          7  meadow.  Did they give you any food while you were in
          8  that meadow on July 13th?
          9       A.   No, they didn't give us any food.  They only
         10  brought water, but it was our people who actually went
         11  to get water.  But we were not given any food at all.
         12       Q.   When you were put in the back of this coal
         13  truck, were you given any water back there?
         14       A.   Yes.  On the following day, the driver who
         15  was driving us gave us something, and also a young boy
         16  from Bratunac.
         17       Q.   Had you been given any food before they gave
         18  you water in Bratunac?
         19       A.   No.  No.
         20       Q.   Was the date you surrendered on the meadow
         21  July 13th, or do you know the dates?
         22       A.   The 12th.  I think -- the 11th, the 12th.
         23  Yes, it was on the 13th, that was the date.  It was a
         24  Thursday.
         25       Q.   What happened when you were stopped outside

          1  Bratunac?  They brought you some water.  What else
          2  happened?
          3       A.   They told us that they were waiting for
          4  UNPROFOR.  So we waited for at least two hours there,
          5  on that spot, and a group of Serbian elderly men passed
          6  by.  Some of them were wearing uniforms; some didn't.
          7  They saw some people and they said, "Well, these guys
          8  are ours."  They probably wanted to take it out on us.
          9       Q.   How were you able to see these elderly men?
         10       A.   Well, they were standing on a truck, which
         11  was an open kind of truck.  It was a FAP truck.  It
         12  used to be a Yugoslav-produced car.
         13       Q.   What finally happened?
         14       A.   Well, finally after that, after we had been
         15  there for about two hours, the column continued in the
         16  direction of Konjevic Polje, Drinjaca, and Zvornik, and
         17  further on in the direction of Tuzla.
         18       Q.   Did your vehicle turn off as it was driving
         19  on the road towards Tuzla?
         20       A.   When we got to Zvornik -- let me stop a
         21  little.  After we had left Divic, after we had come out
         22  of a tunnel, we were told that an UNPROFOR personnel
         23  carrier had joined us.  It was near the village of
         24  Divic.
         25       Q.   Divic is just south of Zvornik.

          1       A.   Yes.  Yes, in the outskirts of Zvornik, maybe
          2  some 800 metres away from the town.
          3       Q.   Who told you this?
          4       A.   The soldiers who saw it.  At that moment I
          5  didn't see the APC.
          6       Q.   Were there any soldiers in the back of the
          7  vehicle with you at any time during this trek from the
          8  meadow up, now, to Divic?
          9       A.   No, there were no soldiers.
         10       Q.   So where were these soldiers that actually
         11  talked to you and told you about the APC?
         12       A.   Not the soldiers but people who were with
         13  us.  People talked amongst themselves.
         14       Q.   So somebody saw an APC and you were talking
         15  amongst yourselves.
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   When you went on the road towards Tuzla, can
         18  you tell us where you went?
         19       A.   When we went towards Tuzla, we drove for a
         20  short while, and then at one point the truck turned
         21  right.  I was a little bit familiar with the area, I
         22  knew it somewhat better, and I realised that it was
         23  moving in the direction of the village of Grbovci.  The
         24  vehicles were travelling at a very slow place.  One by
         25  one they reached a schoolyard.

          1       Q.   Prior to getting to the schoolyard, did you
          2  ever take a look out of the back of this truck to tell
          3  how many vehicles were travelling along with you, if
          4  any?
          5       A.   Yes.  When we left Bratunac, we reached a
          6  location which is called Avdagina Njive.  We climbed a
          7  hill, and then when we were on top of the hill, we
          8  could actually see how long the column of the vehicles
          9  was.
         10       Q.   Were you able to make out how many vehicles
         11  were there or how long the column was?
         12       A.   The column was a longish one, but I cannot
         13  tell you exactly how many vehicles there were.
         14       Q.   Can you give us a rough estimate or a rough
         15  estimate of how many --
         16       A.   Well, I cannot tell you how long it was, but
         17  there were at least 30 vehicles, large vehicles.  At
         18  least 30 of them.
         19       Q.   What sort of vehicles?
         20       A.   There were trucks, trailer trucks, buses.
         21  Most of them were really large vehicles.  The idea was
         22  to transport as many people as possible.
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, we're at the
         24  school.  It may be a good time to take a break.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, this

          1  is really a convenient time.
          2            We will have a 15-minute break.
          3                 --- Recess taken at 1.43 p.m.
          4                 --- On resuming at 2.00 p.m.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We will
          6  resume with our hearing.
          7            Mr. McCloskey, you may go on.
          8            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          9       Q.   Witness L, your vehicle had just arrived at a
         10  schoolyard in a place you were familiar with, you
         11  called it Grbovci.  What happened when your vehicle
         12  came to a stop at the schoolyard?
         13       A.   When we reached the schoolyard, I noticed the
         14  UN APC.  The letter that was written on it was either
         15  "C" or "S".  It was something else instead of
         16  UNPROFOR.  There was only one sign on the APC and there
         17  were two soldiers wearing UNPROFOR uniforms.
         18            There was also a civilian of 50 to 55 years
         19  of age who was walking around with them like an
         20  interpreter.  These soldiers didn't address us.  They
         21  were carrying automatic rifles in their hands.
         22            So we entered the compound, the yard, and
         23  some 30 Serb soldiers were standing there and they
         24  ordered us off the trucks.  They told us to raise our
         25  hands up and to run towards the entrance of the

          1  school.
          2            When we were outside the entrance, I was
          3  ordered by one of their soldiers to take off my leather
          4  jacket.  There was a large pile of clothes there.  So
          5  when I got to the hall, I realised that more than half
          6  of the people had already been there.
          7            Some elderly people were also there who had
          8  been brought from Potocari.  There were people as old
          9  as 70 years of age, maybe more.
         10            At that point, we were ordered to sit down.
         11  We were crowded; we were pressed against each other.
         12  After everybody had got in, we realised that there were
         13  four boys there and they were separated and taken to a
         14  corner of the hall.
         15            The Serb soldiers who were there --
         16       Q.   Let me interrupt you a second.
         17       A.   Yes, please.
         18       Q.   Do you know about what time your vehicle
         19  reached the schoolyard?
         20       A.   It was in the early hours of the afternoon.
         21  I didn't have a watch, but it could have been around
         22  1.00, in view of the time when we left Bratunac.
         23       Q.   These soldiers that were outside the school,
         24  you said there were about 30 of them, what were they
         25  wearing?

          1       A.   Yes.  They were wearing camouflage uniforms
          2  as well.  There may have been Serb policemen amongst
          3  them here and there, because Serb policemen had grey
          4  camouflage uniforms.
          5       Q.   You said when you -- what part of the
          6  building did you go into when you got into the school
          7  building?
          8       A.   I sat down in the part of the building which
          9  was to the left side of one of the entrances.
         10       Q.   What sort of room was this?
         11       A.   It was a gymnasium.
         12       Q.   You say when you arrived it was half full.
         13  Could you give us a rough estimate of how many people
         14  "half full" was?
         15       A.   Well, it was full.  At least 700 or 800
         16  people must have been there.
         17       Q.   When you first got into the gym, did you see
         18  any Serb soldiers inside of the gym?  No?
         19       A.   No, they were not there.  They were only
         20  standing at the entrance.
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness --
         22  we have four exhibits, 19/3, 19/2, 19/5, and 19/8.  If
         23  we could show him those four exhibits in that order,
         24  19/3 first.
         25       Q.   You've had a chance to look at some

          1  photographs of a school before coming to testify today;
          2  is that right?
          3       A.   Yes, that's right.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If we could start with 19/3
          5  on the ELMO.
          6       Q.   If you could take a look at this picture.
          7  It's a wintertime picture so it's a little different.
          8  But do you recognise the building that's depicted in
          9  that picture?
         10       A.   Yes, I do.
         11       Q.   With the pointer, can you point out, if you
         12  see it, the area where you entered the building.
         13       A.   I think it was roughly here [indicates].
         14  This is the gym [indicates], and this is an additional
         15  adjacent building, and this is where we entered.  We
         16  got to this smaller building.
         17            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Okay.  For the record, when
         18  he pointed to the gym, it was the large building in the
         19  back.  And there is a smaller building in front that he
         20  also made reference to and he said they entered in the
         21  area where there appears to be a circle.
         22       Q.   If you could now look at 19/2.  Do you
         23  recognise this photo?
         24       A.   Yes, I do.  This is also the gym.  This is
         25  the small building with the door in it [indicates].

          1       Q.   Do you see the area where you exited from the
          2  school?
          3       A.   It's here [indicates].
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Indicating the circle on the
          5  photo.
          6       Q.   All right.  Could you now look at 19/5.  Do
          7  you recognise this picture?
          8       A.   Yes, I do.  This is the inside of the gym
          9  [indicates].  This is one of the walls with windows on
         10  it [indicates], and pillars.
         11       Q.   What, in particular, about this photo do you
         12  recognise from your experience that day in the gym?
         13       A.   I recognise the place by these windows and by
         14  the way the inside of the gym looks, because the
         15  picture was taken inside.
         16            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If we could hold off on that
         17  last photo for a minute.
         18       Q.   Now, when you arrived inside the gymnasium,
         19  where did you go?  Actually, let me stop there and ask
         20  you a question before that.  I'm sorry.
         21            You said that prior to going inside the
         22  gymnasium, they made you take off your coat and put it
         23  in a pile of clothes.  Did you see the soldiers
         24  requiring anybody else to take off coats or clothes and
         25  put it in this pile?

          1       A.   I didn't see it.  I didn't have time to
          2  wait.
          3       Q.   How big of a pile of clothes was it where you
          4  put your jacket?
          5       A.   It was quite big, maybe enough for a
          6  passenger vehicle trailer roughly.
          7       Q.   When you got inside the gymnasium, where did
          8  they put you?
          9       A.   I sat left to the entrance, near the opening
         10  where they took us out of the hall later on.
         11       Q.   What happened when you were put in this gym
         12  with all these other people?
         13       A.   When we all entered the hall and no one else
         14  was coming in, we sat there for about two or three
         15  hours, perhaps, and then some soldiers came and we were
         16  ordered to keep silent.  So we stopped talking.
         17            Then one of those men at the door, I don't
         18  know who it was, he ordered four rows at the end of the
         19  hall to get up.  These were mostly elderly men.  Then
         20  they ordered them to turn around to the right and face
         21  the wall.  This went on roughly until they reached my
         22  part, and they told us to turn our backs to the exit
         23  and to face the wall next to us.  Then one of the
         24  soldiers said, "These people must not be killed."  Then
         25  this other Serb soldier said, "And who says so?"  And

          1  then this soldier --
          2       Q.   I'm sorry, let me interrupt you one second.
          3  Who said "These people must not be killed"?
          4       A.   One of us prisoners.
          5       Q.   Okay.  Then what happened after he said that?
          6       A.   Then the Serb soldier said, "And who said
          7  so?"  Then this man repeated what he said.  He said,
          8  "We'll see," and he told him to get out.  The man went
          9  out.  We heard a shot.  The man started screaming.
         10  Another shot was heard, and the man fell quiet.
         11            Then they took out another man from the other
         12  end of the gym.  Again, we heard shots and that was
         13  all.
         14       Q.   Do you know why they took out the second man?
         15       A.   I don't know.
         16       Q.   Okay.  Let me go back to the time that you
         17  were first put inside the gymnasium with the other
         18  people.  Your truckload of men, were they put in the
         19  gym with you, the people that you arrived to the school
         20  with?
         21       A.   Yes, they were.
         22       Q.   So did people continue to arrive inside the
         23  gymnasium after your group was put in the group or was
         24  your group the last group?
         25       A.   Our group wasn't the last group.  There were

          1  others coming in, but when they had all come in, then
          2  this, what I just told you, happened.
          3       Q.   How long after you first arrived did Muslim
          4  men continue to be brought into the school, into the
          5  gym?
          6       A.   This may have lasted five or ten or fifteen
          7  minutes.  The vehicles came one after another.  It
          8  didn't take hours.
          9       Q.   How full did the gym get when the process of
         10  bringing Muslim men in finally finished?
         11       A.   It was full.  Maybe there would have been two
         12  metres that were empty where the four boys were
         13  sitting.
         14       Q.   Can you give us an estimate of about how many
         15  Muslim men were crowded inside this gym that day?
         16       A.   According to my estimate, about 2.000.
         17       Q.   How were you arranged?  Were you sitting or
         18  standing or lying down?
         19       A.   We were sitting, but our knees were touching
         20  and so were our shoulders, next to one another.
         21       Q.   During this process that they were bringing
         22  in more Muslim men into the gym, could you see any Serb
         23  soldiers inside the gym?
         24       A.   They didn't enter the gym; they only stood at
         25  the door.  And sometimes they would shoot into the wall

          1  or the ceiling of the gym.
          2       Q.   Do you know why they would sometimes shoot
          3  into the wall or the ceiling?
          4       A.   Because it was very warm, people were
          5  demanding water.  They couldn't bring in a lot of
          6  water; they brought us only a little.  So people were
          7  making noises.
          8       Q.   Did you get any food while you were inside
          9  this gym?
         10       A.   No, we didn't.  Only water.
         11       Q.   Did you get enough water?
         12       A.   No.
         13       Q.   Was there any place to use the toilet?
         14       A.   Yes, there was a bucket that was used as a
         15  toilet in the right-hand corner.
         16       Q.   You've told us about the man that made the
         17  comment about don't kill people, and that he was taken
         18  out.  What happened after that?
         19       A.   After that they stopped bringing us water.
         20  And then the same thing continued, the same situation.
         21  The Serb soldiers were at the door.  People were
         22  addressing them "Soldiers", but they would answer,
         23  "We're not soldiers; we are Karadzic's young
         24  Chetniks," because they were very young.
         25       Q.   Could you make out anything from their

          1  uniforms, anything special about them or anything
          2  different, the Serb soldiers?
          3       A.   No.  Most of them were bareheaded.  They had
          4  camouflage uniforms like the other Serb soldiers.
          5       Q.   Then what happened?
          6       A.   After that, at the opening to the left, there
          7  were two Serb soldiers standing there and a Serb woman
          8  in uniform.  They brought a pile of rags with which
          9  they tied our eyes.
         10       Q.   Can you tell me, do you recall about what
         11  time they first brought this pile of rags?
         12       A.   I don't remember, but I think it was shortly
         13  after these Serb officers, or whatever, had arrived, I
         14  don't know, those who had ordered those
         15  rearrangements.  There were these pieces of cloth; they
         16  were about 60 centimetres long, five or six centimetres
         17  wide; they were mostly patterned so you couldn't see
         18  through them.
         19       Q.   How many were there, or how big a pile of
         20  rags were there?
         21       A.   Like a sack full, shall we say, if you were
         22  to pour the contents out of a sack on the ground.
         23       Q.   Did it look like it would be enough to
         24  blindfold everybody in the gym?
         25       A.   Probably.  Most probably.

          1            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness
          2  Exhibit 19/8.
          3       Q.   Could you take a look at that photograph and
          4  tell us if you recognise anything in there.
          5       A.   I recognise it.  This is the exit
          6  [indicates]; this is the hall [indicates].
          7            MR. McCLOSKEY:  When he said "This is the
          8  exit," he pointed to the doorway where number 2 is
          9  marked with an arrow.
         10       Q.   Now, when you say "That's the exit" --
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   -- is that where the Serb soldiers were
         13  standing, and the woman you mentioned earlier?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   What occurred when these soldiers and the
         16  woman soldier were standing by that exit and they
         17  brought in all these strips of cloth?
         18       A.   Then they assigned one to blindfold the
         19  people.
         20       Q.   Assigned one.  Who?  A Serb or a Muslim?
         21       A.   A Muslim.
         22       Q.   Then what happened?
         23       A.   Then what happened was that once we were
         24  blindfolded we had to leave this room and form a letter
         25  "L".  This woman of Serb ethnicity, in a camouflage

          1  uniform like any other soldier, would give us each a
          2  glass or a cupful of water while we were there
          3  blindfolded.
          4       Q.   Did you see people get blindfolded in front
          5  of you that left through this exit?
          6       A.   I did.
          7       Q.   Did they come back?
          8       A.   No.
          9       Q.   Could you tell where they were going?
         10       A.   People asked, "Where are you taking these
         11  people?" and they said, "We're taking them to the
         12  Bijeljina Logor, to Bijeljina, to a camp," but it
         13  wasn't a camp.
         14       Q.   How long did it take until it was your turn
         15  to get blindfolded and go out this exit?
         16       A.   At least three hours, if not more.
         17       Q.   After you were blindfolded and given the
         18  water, what happened to you?
         19       A.   We got into a Tamic brand truck, with signs
         20  either of the police or the army.  I could see through
         21  the blindfold.  They were Cyrillic registration plates;
         22  they were not civilian registration plates.
         23       Q.   How well were you able to see through the
         24  blindfold?
         25       A.   One could see about 50 per cent and more,

          1  because they weren't so strict about us moving the
          2  blindfold off our eyes for a while.
          3       Q.   Can you describe to the Court what a TAM
          4  truck is and what this TAM truck looked like?
          5       A.   It's a small truck, of two and a half tonnes
          6  carrying capacity, manufactured in Slovenia, during the
          7  former Yugoslavia.
          8       Q.   What does the back of the truck look like?
          9       A.   It has sides of some 40 to 50 centimetres
         10  which can be closed, and there was canvas over it.
         11       Q.   Was there any place to sit?
         12       A.   There were two benches.  When the benches
         13  were full, then people sat in between the two benches.
         14       Q.   Where was this truck parked in relation to
         15  where the school exit was?
         16       A.   Next to the room where they were blindfolding
         17  us.  There was a kind of obstacle in front of the
         18  truck.
         19       Q.   Were you taken directly from the room onto
         20  the truck?
         21       A.   Yes, directly.
         22       Q.   Could you tell how many other Muslim men were
         23  put in the back of this truck with you?
         24       A.   There were up to 30, maybe more, because
         25  eight to ten men could sit on the benches and the space

          1  in between is broader than the benches themselves
          2  so ...
          3       Q.   So did they put men in the spaces in between
          4  the benches?
          5       A.   Yes.  Yes.
          6       Q.   How could you tell that if you were
          7  blindfolded?
          8       A.   When we were in the truck, we took off the
          9  blindfolds because we believed we were going to
         10  Bijeljina.  We thought they wouldn't mistreat us.  And
         11  when the engine got started again, we put back our
         12  blindfolds.
         13       Q.   Were there any Serb soldiers in the back of
         14  this truck with you, crowded full of Muslim men?
         15       A.   I didn't see any.
         16       Q.   Can you tell us where the truck went, as far
         17  as you could make out?
         18       A.   The truck drove for a very short while.
         19  According to my judgement, it took a left turn to
         20  a macadam road, because we could tell by the shaking in
         21  the truck.
         22       Q.   It took a left turn from the macadam road
         23  onto a bumpier road?
         24       A.   No, from the asphalt road onto the macadam
         25  road.

          1       Q.   The macadam road is bumpier than the asphalt
          2  road.
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   What happened when you got on the macadam
          5  road?
          6       A.   When we got there the truck stopped, and we
          7  immediately heard people talking behind our backs.  We
          8  noticed some dead people as we were looking down
          9  towards the ground.  Through the cloth we could see
         10  some dead people.
         11       Q.   Could you just tell us what you yourself were
         12  able to see, looking down through your blindfold, as
         13  you were getting off the truck.
         14       A.   I personally saw a dead man.  I'm only
         15  talking about myself; I'm not saying what other people
         16  saw.  I saw this dead man in front of me.
         17       Q.   What happened next?
         18       A.   Then they lined us up and they started with
         19  bursts of fire from my right-hand side, and then men
         20  were falling to the left.  Men brought me down, so that
         21  a man covered this part of my face [indicates], and he
         22  fell before me and my arm was over his chest.  That was
         23  probably the last shot fired in a standing position.
         24       Q.   Were you hit?
         25       A.   No.

          1       Q.   Was there anybody on top of you or near you?
          2       A.   Yes, this one who was on top of me, because
          3  on my back there was a bloodstain from this man who was
          4  on top of me, and the blood was dripping from him onto
          5  me.
          6       Q.   Did you feel him die, or did he die
          7  instantly?
          8       A.   I didn't.  But one man, I don't know whether
          9  he was in my group or a group after me, he said,
         10  "Finish me off," and then this Serb soldier said,
         11  "Slowly.  Slowly."
         12       Q.   What else happened as you were lying there
         13  amongst this carnage?
         14       A.   When we had all fallen to the ground, then
         15  one of them came and fired single shots at the people
         16  who were probably moving.  Then a stone injured me
         17  slightly that probably jumped off of the road.  It was
         18  a small injury and it didn't hurt.  If it had been a
         19  bullet, it would have been more painful.
         20       Q.   Then what happened?
         21       A.   Then those Serb soldiers were shouting,
         22  "Let's take their watches off their hands so we can
         23  get beer instead," but another one said, "Don't," and
         24  they didn't.  And I didn't have a watch anyway.
         25       Q.   Then what happened?

          1       A.   Then another truck came, and again you only
          2  heard shots, and people were probably falling but there
          3  weren't many cries or screams.  So we come to almost
          4  nightfall.
          5       Q.   Were you able to see the arrival of other
          6  trucks or were you still blindfolded at this point?
          7       A.   No, I still had the blindfold, and I was
          8  lying on my stomach.
          9       Q.   Did you look up at all at this point, when
         10  the other trucks started arriving?
         11       A.   I didn't.  I didn't dare because I didn't
         12  know what was behind my back.  I didn't dare move.
         13       Q.   Do you know how long this process, where
         14  trucks arrived and you could hear gunfire, how long
         15  that kept going?
         16       A.   It went on late into the night, but the exact
         17  hour I'm not able to tell.  But it went on into the
         18  night.
         19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, the story, of
         20  course, goes on a little further.  Do you wish to
         21  continue the story tomorrow or try to go further
         22  today?
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] How much
         24  more time do you need, roughly, Mr. McCloskey, to
         25  finish with this witness?

          1            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Fifteen minutes, maybe
          2  thirty.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          4  In that case, we will finish for today and we'll resume
          5  tomorrow at 9.30.
          6            I think the parties already have a proposed
          7  timetable for our Status Conference for Thursday.
          8  Therefore, I'd like you to look at that proposal
          9  closely.
         10            I'm telling the Defence that we have
         11  considered your motion.  We're going to have a month
         12  and a half now, and then after that we will have more
         13  time.  And I think that will correspond to the amount
         14  of time you have requested.  But in any case we will
         15  reconsider that at the Status Conference on Thursday,
         16  and all I'm asking is that you look at that proposal
         17  closely.
         18            Therefore, Witness, you are going to stay
         19  tomorrow, when we will resume.
         20            So we will resume the hearing tomorrow at
         21  9.30.
         22                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
         23                 2.34 p.m., to be reconvened on
         24                 Wednesday, the 12th day of April, 2000,
         25                 the 9.30 a.m.
