          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 9.35 a.m.
          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning to our
          8  sound engineers -- Can the interpreters hear me?  Yes,
          9  they can -- counsel for the Prosecution, the Defence,
         10  General Krstic.  We shall today be resuming the case.
         11            For the record, we have the same situation
         12  today as yesterday; that is, the witness, who is right
         13  in the courtroom, will continue his testimony.
         14            Good morning, Witness H [sic].  You will now
         15  continue to answer questions put to you by the
         16  Prosecution.  Thank you.
         17                 WITNESS:  LEENDERT VAN DUIJN [Resumed]
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  Good morning, Mr. President,
         19  Judge Riad, my learned friends for the Defence.
         20                 Examined by Mr. Cayley: [Cont'd]
         21       Q.   Captain van Duijn, just to remind you that
         22  you are under the solemn oath that you were under
         23  yesterday to speak the truth.
         24            I'll quickly refresh your memory as to where
         25  you were yesterday.  You had spoken about

          1  General Mladic arriving in Potocari and essentially, in
          2  your words, mounting a propaganda exercise.  We were
          3  then just about to move to General Mladic's second
          4  visit that you recalled, and I'd like you to explain to
          5  the Judges what happened on that occasion.
          6       A.   He came up to me and wanted to speak to the
          7  UN commander at that time at that position, and that
          8  was me, of course.  And he spoke to me through my
          9  interpreter, the Muslim interpreter that was originally
         10  based with Bravo Company, and we spoke about a lot of
         11  things that had nothing to do with what happened that
         12  day, about soccer and other cases.
         13            At one point, he mentioned about the
         14  multiracial composition of my unit that was there.
         15  There were a few soldiers that were Negroes that were
         16  on that position, and he stated, through my Muslim
         17  interpreter, that in ten years, the Bosnian Serb army
         18  would be in Holland to protect the Dutch from the
         19  Muslims.  And I said I didn't agree with him, also
         20  through the Muslim interpreter, of course.
         21            Later on, he started to intimidate the Muslim
         22  interpreter, because he asked me who he was and why he
         23  was there.  I explained to General Mladic that he was
         24  an interpreter and he had a UN pass, and at that point
         25  he started to intimidate the Muslim interpreter.

          1       Q.   Do you remember approximately what time this
          2  was?
          3       A.   It must have been about 2.00 or 3.00 in the
          4  afternoon.
          5       Q.   And this was on the 12th of July, 1995?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   Now, you mentioned that he started to
          8  intimidate the Muslim interpreter.  Can you tell the
          9  Judges what happened to the Muslim interpreter?
         10       A.   General Mladic put his arm around him and he
         11  started to speak to me through the interpreter, telling
         12  that -- he played a sort of role-play, saying that the
         13  interpreter was a Serb, that he was a good guy, and
         14  that General Mladic was a Muslim, and he said, "Well,
         15  I'm a Muslim.  I only think about making babies, but
         16  this guy, this interpreter is a Serb, he's a good
         17  fellow and I like him."  And he put his arm around him
         18  and he practically crushed him into his own body.
         19            Later on, the UN pass that was given to the
         20  interpreter was taken away by the bodyguards of
         21  General Mladic, and I had to speak to the bodyguards to
         22  get it back.  The interpreter was very scared, of
         23  course, because that was his only pass that he had that
         24  would practically ensure him of not being taken away
         25  like the other men but could stay with the UN forces.

          1       Q.   How long did General Mladic spend at your
          2  position in Potocari, do you recall?
          3       A.   He must have been there for about an hour, I
          4  think.  The conversation I had with him was maybe 15
          5  minutes, 20 minutes, but he stayed there more in the
          6  background, speaking to Serb soldiers.
          7       Q.   Now, whilst General Mladic was there, the
          8  transportation process was continuing; is that correct?
          9       A.   That's correct.
         10       Q.   Do you recall any particular incident, while
         11  General Mladic was present, in connection with the
         12  transportation of the Muslims out of Potocari?
         13       A.   At one point, there was a woman that was
         14  panicking, and she was really almost in a state of
         15  hysteria.  So we got her out of the big group of
         16  refugees and, through the interpreter, asked what was
         17  going on with her.  She said that her children, five
         18  children, were already loaded on a lorry and she had
         19  lost them in the big chaos, and she now saw them in the
         20  back of that truck, already starting to drive away from
         21  where she was.
         22            Through the interpreter that became clear to
         23  me, and I planned to get her on the truck that was
         24  already moving.  The situation was that we had the
         25  refugees -- we were there in between the refugees and

          1  the Serbs, and practically no movement of UN soldiers
          2  was from our location towards the buses, because in
          3  between there were the Serb soldiers.
          4            So I asked the interpreter, I said, "Well,
          5  can you help me?"  Because General Mladic was in
          6  between talking to that Serb soldier.  And I said, "Go
          7  over to General Mladic, who is the highest in command,
          8  over there, explain to him what I'm doing, because I'm
          9  taking that woman up to that lorry now, and I don't
         10  know what the Serb soldiers will do, how they will
         11  react if I cross that, more or less, border."  I didn't
         12  ask for his reaction.  I took the woman, carried her
         13  to -- running towards the lorry, and when I put her on
         14  the lorry together with the children, and I turned
         15  around, I saw that the interpreter had gone over to
         16  General Mladic and tried to explain.  So he did what I
         17  had asked him to do.
         18            So I went up to General Mladic, and at that
         19  point General Mladic was very, very mad, and he told
         20  me, also through the interpreter, that if I would ever
         21  send the interpreter up to General Mladic without it
         22  being clear that he was interpreting for me, then he
         23  would shoot him right there on the spot.  At that
         24  point, the interpreter was so scared, and he was
         25  shivering all over, so I had him escorted back to the

          1  UN Compound.
          2       Q.   Did General Mladic say to you or explain to
          3  you why he would shoot the interpreter?
          4       A.   Just for speaking to him as a Muslim
          5  interpreter.  Just for speaking to him without it being
          6  clear that he was interpreting for me.
          7       Q.   Do you recall how much longer General Mladic
          8  stayed in Potocari?
          9       A.   No.  I haven't seen him from that moment on.
         10       Q.   Now, after General Mladic left or indeed went
         11  out of your sight, do you recall what you saw
         12  commencing in and around Potocari?
         13       A.   As I explained, the situation was that we
         14  tried to calm the Muslim refugees; that, through Mane,
         15  it would be clear to me how many buses there were and
         16  how many people could go onto the bus, and then we
         17  would leave, would let them leave in little groups so
         18  that they wouldn't trample each other by rushing to the
         19  buses.  So we had a little control about the buses so
         20  that there wouldn't be any overcrowding of the buses
         21  that happened in the beginning.
         22       Q.   Now, the groups that were going towards the
         23  buses, they consisted of women and children; or men,
         24  women, and children.  Do you recall?
         25       A.   In the beginning, men, women, and children,

          1  but on the first day I noticed that about 50 meters
          2  behind where the UN soldiers were and where I was, men
          3  were sitting in a lawn, front lawn of a house, a small
          4  house that was near the factory sites.
          5            And I asked Mane, who was in charge there of
          6  the Serb soldiers, because it was clear to me that they
          7  were selecting the men out, why he had done that.  And
          8  he said, "Well, we will bring them over to Bratunac and
          9  we will have a list of war criminals, Muslim war
         10  criminals, and we want to compare the men we have here,
         11  the names of those men, to the list we have of war
         12  criminals.  And if there are war criminals, we will
         13  send them to a court; and if they are not, if they're
         14  civilians, we will send them on with the normal convoys
         15  towards Tuzla."
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         17  Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/2, which I actually believe, I
         18  think, is my copy, because the Court copy was marked.
         19       Q.   While the registrar is finding that exhibit,
         20  how long did those men stay on that stretch of lawn
         21  outside those houses?
         22       A.   On the first day, that was the first day, so
         23  that was the place where they were brought to.  They
         24  stayed there the rest of the day, until the evening,
         25  when all of the convoys and deportation was stopped,

          1  and then were brought -- or taken away by a lorry.  I
          2  don't know where they brought them.  I could see from
          3  about a hundred meters distance that they were put into
          4  a lorry and were taken away.
          5       Q.   Now, if you can recall, Captain van Duijn,
          6  the location where you saw these men on the 12th of
          7  July.
          8       A.   It was a house in this neighbourhood
          9  [indicates].
         10       Q.   If you could leave your pointer there.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  And the witness is pointing
         12  to -- I think there are two small houses under that
         13  pointer, as one looks at the photograph, to the right
         14  of the road, passing north/south in the photograph and
         15  just beneath the point of the arrow marking the Zinc
         16  Factory, perhaps two centimeters below the point of the
         17  arrow which marks the Zinc Factory.
         18       Q.   Thank you, Captain van Duijn.
         19            Can you recall from your memory at what stage
         20  the transport of Muslims ceased on the 12th of July?
         21       A.   It was the beginning of the evening, about
         22  6.00 in the evening, I think 6.00 or 7.00 in the
         23  evening, just before it became dark.
         24       Q.   Did you speak with Mane again that evening?
         25       A.   He said that of course the deportation

          1  stopped, the convoy stopped, the buses wouldn't come,
          2  until the next morning; that he and his soldiers would
          3  retreat to Bratunac to go and celebrate; and that he
          4  wanted us to clear the road, because a lot of refugees
          5  were still on the road, on the asphalt road, and he
          6  wanted us to clear it of refugees because they wanted
          7  to use, or other units would use that road to move
          8  troops to the south.
          9       Q.   Now, you say that he stated to you that he
         10  wanted the road cleared because they wanted to use --
         11  or other units would use the road to move troops
         12  south.  Which troops are you referring to?
         13       A.   I don't know what troops they were.
         14       Q.   Are you referring to Bosnian Serb soldiers?
         15       A.   Bosnian Serb soldiers, yes.
         16       Q.   Do you recall anything else of significance
         17  from your memory that actually happened on that day, on
         18  the 12th of July?
         19       A.   On the day itself or in the evening?
         20       Q.   In the evening.  In the evening.
         21       A.   When I returned, because I had been relieved
         22  by Lieutenant Koster for that night -- he would stay
         23  there in the midst of the refugees, together with other
         24  soldiers -- I myself was of course real tired, coming
         25  from the blocking position, and after that day, so I

          1  tried to get some rest, went back to the UN Compound
          2  and of course report what had happened that day to my
          3  commanders.
          4            And when I went over to the UN Compound, I
          5  saw a roll-call taking place of Serb soldiers, I
          6  presume, because I saw the little man with code-name
          7  Stalin standing in front of a unit of more or less
          8  company size, between the location I had been earlier
          9  and the UN Compound.
         10            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         11  Prosecutor's Exhibit 73.  You can use this copy, and
         12  then if you just give it straight back to me, then we
         13  can move more quickly.
         14       Q.   Could you just indicate to the Judges,
         15  because you've mentioned him today and we mentioned him
         16  yesterday, if you could just point to the individual
         17  that you identified as Stalin.
         18       A.   This man [indicates].
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  So the witness is indicating
         20  again on that exhibit, Prosecutor's Exhibit 73, the
         21  individual on the right-hand side of the photograph
         22  with a moustache, wearing spectacles.
         23            Thank you, Captain van Duijn.  If I could
         24  have that exhibit back.  Thanks.
         25       Q.   Let's move to the next date, the 13th of

          1  July.  Do you remember approximately what time you rose
          2  in the morning?
          3       A.   I rose about 5.00 in the morning, and after
          4  seeing some soldiers that I wanted to accompany that
          5  day, I -- it was about 6.00, half past 6.00, again at
          6  the location where Lieutenant Koster was, and he told
          7  me about the things that happened during the night.
          8  And the plan was that I would take over from him at
          9  that stage again.
         10       Q.   Is that the same location that you showed the
         11  Judges yesterday on the aerial photograph?
         12       A.   It was a little bit more to the south,
         13  because I had spoken to Lieutenant Koster on the
         14  evening of the first day of the deportations, and it
         15  was very difficult for us to try and keep the refugees
         16  calm.  So I spoke to him and I said, "Well, I think we
         17  should make a sort of tunnel for the refugees to come
         18  in with APCs, formed with APCs," so the distance we had
         19  to cover with UN soldiers would be smaller, so we could
         20  easily -- more easily could contain them and keep them
         21  calm.
         22       Q.   Did Koster speak to you about what had
         23  happened during the night?
         24       A.   He said that a few incidents had happened,
         25  but the most memorable incidents were that a man had

          1  hung himself in the factory and they had to get the
          2  body down from the place where he had hung himself; and
          3  that another man had injured himself in total panic,
          4  hitting himself with a rock on his head, trying to
          5  become injured so he could be taken up to the hospital
          6  so he would be transported with the sick people.
          7       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you recall from
          8  when you took over from Koster, what happened that
          9  morning?
         10       A.   Because the Serb soldiers and Mane were not
         11  there at that time, he had said to me that he would be
         12  there about 8.00 or somewhere in the vicinity of that
         13  time.  But the bus drivers and the buses were already
         14  there, so I decided to keep the families together and
         15  to send everyone on the bus with the groups they
         16  wanted.  We already started, because the buses and the
         17  bus drivers knew where they had to drive, because they
         18  had been there the day before as well.  We already
         19  started the transports for about an hour or something.
         20  And then the Serbs came and Mane took over again.  And
         21  from that moment on, the men were singled out again.
         22       Q.   What time did the Bosnian Serb army return to
         23  Potocari?  Do you recall approximately?
         24       A.   I think it must be between 8.00 and 8.30 in
         25  the morning.

          1       Q.   Did the transportation process go on all day
          2  long?
          3       A.   It ended about 4.00, because by then all of
          4  the people of the big group of refugees had left by
          5  then, about 4.00 in the afternoon.
          6       Q.   Can you describe the scene to the Judges
          7  after all of the refugees had been transported out of
          8  Potocari, what you saw in and around the UN compound
          9  and indeed the factory and bus sites.
         10       A.   The factory sites were covered with goods
         11  that people had tried to take with them:  bags of
         12  potatoes, blankets, all of the things they had tried to
         13  take with them as they fled.  All the factory sites
         14  were covered in personal belongings as well, even
         15  pictures and stuff like that that they had left behind.
         16       Q.   Were there any Muslims left at all?
         17       A.   The men, on the second day, when they were
         18  singled out, were taken up to a house we called the
         19  White House, almost opposite of the entrance of the UN
         20  Compound in Potocari.
         21       Q.   If I can interrupt, Captain van Duijn?
         22            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         23  Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/17.
         24       Q.   Now, this is a photograph that I showed, I
         25  think, the day before yesterday.  Do you recognise this

          1  photograph?
          2       A.   This is the White House, only in the time we
          3  were there, there were much more trees and bushes that
          4  more or less covered the front lawn of that White
          5  House.
          6       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you saw at the
          7  White House?
          8       A.   The White House itself was packed with men of
          9  different ages, and there were a few refugees in front
         10  of the house but most of them were packed inside.  I
         11  only stayed standing in front of the White House and
         12  having a peek inside, but I didn't go to the back.  So
         13  I don't know what was there on the back side of the
         14  house.
         15       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges the appearance
         16  of those men that you saw at the White House?
         17       A.   They were packed together, and because it was
         18  very warm, they were sweating.  They were very, very
         19  scared.  Some of them were shivering.  Some of the men
         20  were speaking themselves, but you could easily see that
         21  they were very, very scared.
         22       Q.   Did you see anything else at the White House
         23  apart from these men that were packed inside and
         24  outside the White House?
         25       A.   When I came up to the White House, and as you

          1  can see, in the front of the White House there is a
          2  large lawn, it was covered totally with personal
          3  belongings, with pictures, holiday snapshots, as well
          4  as passports and other identity papers.
          5       Q.   Now, after you'd seen this, did you speak to
          6  anybody about what you'd seen at the White House?
          7       A.   I spoke to Mane again, because the first day
          8  of the deportations when I noticed that the men were
          9  singled out I asked him why, and he gave me the
         10  explanation of them wanting to distinguish who was a
         11  war criminal and who was not.  So I asked him again,
         12  because I saw all the passports and identity papers,
         13  why they couldn't take them with them, because that was
         14  in front of the house and not on the men itself.  He
         15  said, "Well, they don't need the stuff that's there.
         16  They don't need it any more."  Then I asked him how he
         17  could explain the fact that if they wanted to know who
         18  was a war criminal and who was not they could do that
         19  without identity papers, because if they would give a
         20  false name, it wouldn't be on the list of war
         21  criminals, and the person would go free and join the
         22  rest of the convoy to Tuzla.  Then he more or less
         23  laughed at me and said, "Well, don't make such a fuss
         24  out of it.  They just don't need their passports any
         25  more."

          1       Q.   What did you think at that point,
          2  Captain van Duijn?
          3       A.   I realised that the story he had told me
          4  before was not true any more, or hadn't been true at
          5  all, and at that moment, I realised that something bad
          6  was going to happen to the men, and the only thing I
          7  can recollect now is I thought about the things I had
          8  seen before on television, before I went to Bosnia,
          9  about concentration camps and men being sent to camps
         10  like that.  At least I knew that they were not going to
         11  be sent with a convoy when they were not on the list.
         12  They would just be sent on a convoy to Tuzla, and that
         13  wasn't true at all.
         14       Q.   Now, in terms of the transportation process
         15  that you saw taking place, is there any image or memory
         16  that remains with you above any other after these years
         17  have passed?
         18       A.   There is an incident of a family that
         19  consisted of about six to eight women, from an old
         20  woman about in her 60s, 70s until a young girl about 12
         21  years old, I think, and you could see that there were
         22  different generations.  With that family there was only
         23  one man, and he was about 45 to 50 years old, but he
         24  looked fit and in shape.  During the periods of the
         25  deportations, every time a man was singled out because

          1  of Mane telling me about they wanted to get to the
          2  warriors and the war criminals, whenever a man was
          3  singled out or a boy was singled out that was
          4  practically too old or too young to be a soldier, I
          5  spoke to Mane and protested with him.  I said, "Well,
          6  you can't be serious.  That can't be a soldier.  That
          7  can't be a war criminal," and every time I protested,
          8  he would let them go with their families.
          9            During the incident, I told you about the
         10  family that consisted of almost practically all women,
         11  and the one man, I didn't protest because he was the
         12  classical borderline case, where you could easily tell
         13  that he could be a soldier or he was just on the
         14  borderline, and I made the decision at that point not
         15  to protest and he was singled out.
         16            I know, of course, that if I would have
         17  protested with every man that was singled out, no one
         18  could stay with his family, and every man was singled
         19  out.  Every boy was singled out.  But I had to make a
         20  decision at that time, and I made the decision not to
         21  protest, and the man was singled out, and I think that
         22  will stay with me the rest of my life, that decision.
         23       Q.   Let's now, very briefly, go back to April of
         24  1995, and I think at that point you were a commander on
         25  two observation posts, were you not?

          1       A.   Yes, I was.
          2       Q.   Can you just tell the Judges which
          3  observation posts those were?
          4       A.   It was in the northeast, Sector 4 of the
          5  enclave.  They were Observation Posts Quebec and
          6  Romeo.
          7       Q.   I think there were Serb forces opposite your
          8  observation posts, and could you very briefly tell the
          9  Judges what you observed in April 1995 that happened
         10  with those Serb forces, what changes you saw taking
         11  place.
         12       A.   We had good contact with OP Romeo with the
         13  soldiers that were stationed near there, about 200
         14  metres from the location of OP Romeo.  We called that
         15  the Dragan bunker, named after the first Serb commander
         16  that was stationed there.  And we could see from March,
         17  April on, that the Serb forces that were there in the
         18  beginning consisted of old men, shabby clothes, with
         19  only handguns, and they were quite nice to my soldiers
         20  that were on OP Romeo.
         21            And from March, April on, there were
         22  reinforcements taking place.  Every Tuesday there would
         23  come a bus.  First, January, February, it was to
         24  relieve and replace the men that were inside the
         25  bunker, but from March, April on, there would come

          1  reinforcements, and the men that were there stayed
          2  there and they were only brought in new troops.  And
          3  the troops that were brought in were much better
          4  uniformed, polished their shoes, maintained their
          5  weapons, did some maintenance, and you could see that
          6  there was more or less a sort of build-up, and we
          7  reported it to our commanders.
          8       Q.   Very briefly, if you could talk about Muslim
          9  forces within the enclave.  If you could tell the
         10  Judges what you observed from your position at those
         11  two observation posts of Muslim forces within the
         12  enclave?
         13       A.   I had a lot of contact with the second in
         14  command.  He told me that he was from the Northern
         15  Brigade of the Muslims.  His name was Nasir Sabanovic,
         16  and he was the local commander for my two observation
         17  posts from the Muslim forces.  They did a lot of work
         18  to make trenches and bunkers near the observation posts
         19  or just behind my observation post.  Nasir Sabanovic --
         20  at that time I was on OP Quebec myself -- came up to
         21  the OP to tell me what he was thinking about the
         22  situation and also told me about his patrols that he
         23  went on, accompanied by two or three other Muslim
         24  soldiers, when he was going out of the enclave into
         25  Serb territory to do reconnaissance patrols or, as he

          1  stated to me, that he placed mines on the roads towards
          2  the enclave.
          3       Q.   From your location, how many Muslim soldiers
          4  did you see at your two observation posts?
          5       A.   In the vicinity of the two OPs that I was at,
          6  there must have been about 50 to 100 Muslim soldiers in
          7  that vicinity in the later period.
          8       Q.   How were they armed?
          9       A.   They were armed with handguns, with
         10  Kalashnikovs, and 1 out of 10 or 1 out of 15 had a
         11  rocket launcher of some sort.
         12       Q.   Did he also report to you any risk that there
         13  was to your two observation posts from Bosnian Serb
         14  forces?
         15       A.   He warned me about that because of the
         16  location of my OPs were the closest to Serb positions
         17  in the enclave, he said that there was a plan of the
         18  Serbs to take over the two OPs, two of my OPs, and he
         19  said that through his patrols he had stationed mines
         20  and placed mines.  So the initial threat was now gone,
         21  but he was still afraid of the Serbs taking over my
         22  OPs.
         23       Q.   Which indeed happened eventually.
         24       A.   Later on, yes.  Eventually.
         25       Q.   Now, let's just go back to what you saw

          1  taking place in July of 1995, and this is the final
          2  questions that I have for you.
          3            You are a Captain in the Dutch army.  Do you
          4  regularly go on military training exercises?
          5       A.   I went on a lot of exercises throughout my
          6  career.
          7       Q.   At what levels have you gone on exercise?  At
          8  what level of military formation have you been on
          9  exercise?
         10       A.   Platoon, company, battalion, and even big
         11  brigade or divisional exercises in Denmark or Germany
         12  or Greece.
         13       Q.   Now, when you look back at what you saw
         14  taking place in the Srebrenica enclave in July of 1995,
         15  can you estimate, from your experience, at what level
         16  that operation was taking place, now that you look
         17  back?
         18       A.   Of course, I've read about what had taken
         19  place and read about the number of Serb soldiers that
         20  were involved in their whole operation, but when you
         21  look at the piece of terrain, a very difficult part of
         22  terrain with only one road that's covered with asphalt,
         23  my opinion is that it should be at least on a
         24  divisional level.
         25       Q.   From your recollection --

          1       A.   By NATO standards, of course.
          2       Q.   Yes, by NATO standards.  And by that you mean
          3  the way NATO addresses particular military formations,
          4  how it labels those formations?
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   From your recollection, do you remember what
          7  the higher military formation was in the Bosnian Serb
          8  army that was responsible for the area of the
          9  Srebrenica enclave?
         10       A.   I remember from the beginning on that there
         11  was a unit called the Drina Wolves or the Drina Corps
         12  north of the enclave, and according to the
         13  conversations I had with Mane, who also told me that he
         14  was, with his military police unit, sort of a liaison
         15  or a part of the Drina Wolves, I suspected that that
         16  was the Drina Wolves that were there.
         17       Q.   Now, you say the Drina Wolves, which was a
         18  unit, but I'm actually interested in the larger
         19  formation, and you mentioned the Drina Corps.  Which
         20  was the larger military formation that was in the
         21  area?
         22       A.   I think the Drina Corps.
         23       Q.   And that's now, as you can remember?
         24       A.   Yes, because the nickname used for the Drina
         25  Corps was the Drina Wolves, as far as I know.  So when
          1  I mention the Drina Wolves, I mean the Drina Corps and
          2  otherwise.
          3       Q.   Okay.  Thank you very much indeed,
          4  Captain van Duijn.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  I have no further questions,
          6  Mr. President.  I can offer the witness for
          7  cross-examination.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          9  very much, Mr. Cayley.
         10            Mr. Petrusic, Witness H [sic], you're now
         11  going to answer questions that will be put to you by
         12  Mr. Petrusic, who is representing General Krstic.
         13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         14  Your Honours; good morning colleagues from the
         15  Prosecution.
         16                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         17       Q.   Good morning, Captain.  After the 13th of
         18  July, how long did you and your unit stay in the base,
         19  that is, in Potocari?
         20       A.   We stayed for a couple of more days, and I
         21  believe we returned to Zagreb on the 20th of July.  I
         22  don't know the exact date any more.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         24  Mr. Petrusic, I'm very sorry to interrupt you, but I
         25  can see in the transcript that we -- that somebody

          1  referred to Witness H, but the witness in question is
          2  Captain van Duijn and not Witness H.  I can see this in
          3  line 6 on page 22, and this will have to be corrected.
          4            Sorry, Mr. Petrusic.  You may continue now.
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
          6       Q.   During that time, Captain, did you ever go to
          7  Srebrenica?
          8       A.   No, not any more.
          9       Q.   In response to a question put to you by my
         10  learned colleague Mr. Cayley, you said that there was a
         11  unit that operated in the area of Srebrenica, a unit
         12  which belonged to the VRS.  Can you be more specific
         13  and explain to us whether between the unit that you
         14  referred to as Drina Wolves and the Drina Corps, as a
         15  larger military unit, whether there was any smaller
         16  unit between the two which would still belong to the
         17  Drina Corps?
         18       A.   The only smaller unit I know of was the
         19  military police unit where Captain Mane was in.  That
         20  was more or less attached to the Drina Wolves or Drina
         21  Corps.
         22            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         23  Captain van Duijn.
         24            Your Honours, I do not have any further
         25  questions for this witness.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          2  Mr. Petrusic.
          3            Mr. Cayley, do you have any further
          4  additional questions?
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I don't have any
          6  further questions.  Thank you.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          8  very much.
          9            Judge Riad.
         10            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr.
         11  President.
         12                 Questioned by the Court:
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Captain van Duijn, good morning?
         14       A.   Good morning.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  I'll just ask you from the end,
         16  because the learned Defence counsel asked if you had
         17  been to Srebrenica.  You mentioned yesterday, at the
         18  beginning of your testimony, that you saw scenes in
         19  Srebrenica, smoke coming from houses, shelling, and the
         20  panic of the people.  You saw it in Srebrenica itself
         21  or you saw it from a distance?
         22       A.   When I -- at that period, I was in the
         23  blocking position south of Srebrenica, and I saw it
         24  taking place in the city itself.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  The city itself.

          1       A.   From the south I could look down on the city
          2  of Srebrenica, and I could see smoke coming from the
          3  houses and houses being hit by shelling.  To my
          4  knowledge, the question that was asked by the Defence
          5  was about the period after the fall.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  I see.  So you were close enough
          7  to see all this.
          8       A.   Yes.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  We have your description.  It's
         10  there, so I don't need to ask about it any more.  You
         11  referred to the conversation with Mane when he was
         12  telling you that they needed these men for inquiry to
         13  find out if they committed war crimes, and you told
         14  them, "Then why don't they keep their papers because
         15  the papers will be essential."  He told you they do not
         16  need their identity papers any more.
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Laughingly.  So what was your
         19  conclusion?  What was the meaning of that for you as a
         20  responsible UN officer?
         21       A.   I thought that at least the story that he had
         22  told me about trying to single out the war criminals
         23  was not true, so they would more or less treat all the
         24  men in the same way, the same terrible way.  At that
         25  point, I radioed to the OPs room and said, "Well, we

          1  have to transport.  We have to send vehicles with
          2  transportation of the men.  We have to be there,
          3  whatever happens."
          4            I tried, myself, tried to get into the bus
          5  but was pulled away by Mane and also at gunpoint from a
          6  soldier that blocked the entrance of the bus.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  At the end of your testimony,
          8  you referred to the Drina Corps and the Drina Wolves,
          9  which you consider it almost identical, but you didn't
         10  mention much about them.  What do you know about this
         11  Drina Corps during this period when you were in charge?
         12       A.   I only know about the intel we had before we
         13  went to Bosnia, where they said "Well, the Drina Corps
         14  was stationed there."  We must have been -- must have
         15  had lessons about their insignias or ranks, but I don't
         16  recollect that any more.
         17            The only thing I was thinking about again was
         18  during the conversation with Mane, when he told me that
         19  he was part of the Drina Corps with his military unit.
         20  So that's the things I know about.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  He was part of the Drina Corps?
         22       A.   He said that he was more or less part of the
         23  Drina Corps.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  And Mr. Stalin, was he part of
         25  the Drina Corps?

          1       A.   He was the commander of Mane, so I presume he
          2  was also in the same unit.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Was there any actions which
          4  justified calling him Mr. Stalin?
          5       A.   No.  Not that I know of.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  You know what Stalin did?
          7       A.   I know what Stalin did, yes.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  Was it related to the kind of
          9  actions which Stalin did?
         10       A.   I asked Mane what his real name was instead
         11  of Stalin, but Mane didn't answer about it, he just
         12  said his radio name or his radio nickname is Stalin and
         13  that's the only thing I know about that man.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Was he high in grade,
         15  Mr. Stalin?
         16       A.   He was higher than Mane and Mane told me he
         17  was a Captain.  So I presume that he was major or
         18  something, but I don't know.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  But he had higher authorities
         20  than him?
         21       A.   He had higher authorities than Mane.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean Stalin was not the chief
         23  of everything?
         24       A.   No.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Was not the man giving orders?

          1       A.   No.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you know who was giving
          3  orders around the whole place apart from Mladic?
          4       A.   On my location, it was Mane, and because
          5  Stalin, the man we'd nicknamed Stalin was the commander
          6  of Mane, I presumed that Stalin was giving orders to
          7  Mane about a larger area, but I don't know who was
          8  giving orders in the whole of the enclave.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  The part of the White House and
         10  where you had this --
         11       A.   Where I was.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  It was Stalin and Mane?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  And you met Mladic.  Did you
         15  ever meet General Krstic?
         16       A.   No, not that I recollect.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Nor see him around, see him
         18  moving around, giving orders?
         19       A.   I don't remember that, no.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  And when you were talking to
         21  Mladic, this very significant conversation, which was
         22  very unclear to me, you said at a certain moment he
         23  hugged the interpreter and told you he was a Serb.
         24       A.   Yes.  He was --
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  And then he would say he would

          1  kill him?
          2       A.   He played a sort of a role-play at first with
          3  the Muslim interpreter, embarrassing him by saying,
          4  well -- and he hugged him like this with his arm around
          5  him, crushing him to his own body, and he said, "Do you
          6  know him?"  And I said, "Well, of course I know him,
          7  because he's my interpreter.  He said, "No, he's not
          8  your interpreter.  He's not a Muslim.  He's a Serb.
          9  He's a good guy."
         10            And Mladic, General Mladic, then pointed to
         11  himself and he said, "Well, I am a Muslim, and I only
         12  think about making babies, so I am a bastard.  But this
         13  guy is a good guy."  So he pretended that the Muslim
         14  was a Serb and he himself was a Muslim.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  It was some kind of changing
         16  roles.
         17       A.   Yes.  Sort of a role-playing to --
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  And making fun, perhaps.
         19       A.   -- to embarrass the Muslim interpreter, who
         20  was of course very scared.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  And then he added that he would
         22  be coming -- he would be defending Holland against the
         23  Muslim invasion?
         24       A.   He saw a few of my soldiers sitting, and he
         25  actually shook hands with him, and there were two white

          1  soldiers and one Negro soldier.  And then he said,
          2  "Well, is he from Holland too?"  And I explained to
          3  him that we have a very multiracial society in
          4  Holland.  And then General Mladic said, "Well, that's
          5  not good, and in ten years the Bosnian Muslim army will
          6  be in Holland to protect you from the Muslims."
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  What did he mean by that?
          8       A.   That it was not good that Holland has a
          9  multiracial society or something.  I think that he
         10  meant that.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  He wanted ethnic cleansing in
         12  Holland, or what?
         13       A.   Maybe.  I don't know.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         16  very much, Judge Riad.
         17            Captain, I should also like to ask a few
         18  questions of you.  You spoke about the period of April
         19  1995 and about the changes that you could observe from
         20  your observation posts Q and R.  You also spoke about
         21  propaganda which was conducted by General Mladic.  My
         22  question in respect to that is as follows:  Before
         23  these events, had there been any propaganda by Serbs in
         24  the enclave of Srebrenica, if you know anything about
         25  that?

          1       A.   No, not to my recollection.  I don't know.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I should
          3  like to ask you to clarify something with my next
          4  question.  Speaking of the Drina Corps and Drina
          5  Wolves, is it one and the same thing or are we speaking
          6  about two different things here?  Because I thought
          7  that you said that Drina Wolves was just a nickname for
          8  the Drina Corps.
          9       A.   As far as I know, that Drina Wolves is a
         10  nickname for Drina Corps, and so they -- the two mean
         11  the same thing, in my knowledge.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         13  You also spoke about the White House.  You said that
         14  there had been a pile of documents, passports, personal
         15  belongings of people who were in the White House.  Do
         16  you know, by any chance, what has happened with all
         17  those things?
         18       A.   The days after all of the events had taken
         19  place and we were back in the UN Compound, we could see
         20  a lot of people coming from Bratunac and more or less
         21  looting everything that was usable from all of the
         22  houses, and we could also see that at the location of
         23  the White House, stuff was brought together and burnt,
         24  and that's when I remembered that possibly all of the
         25  papers and all of the passports were burnt at that time
          1  as well.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Who burnt
          3  those documents and passports?
          4       A.   I don't know.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          6  very much, Captain.  You have provided a lot of
          7  information, lots of clarification for us.
          8            Let me just verify if there are any documents
          9  that we have to deal with.
         10            THE REGISTRAR:  Yes.  Prosecution Exhibit 71,
         11  72, 73, and 74.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] What is the
         13  situation with them?
         14            Mr. Cayley.
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, those are a
         16  series of four photographs that the witness recognised
         17  and indeed provided foundation for their admission, so
         18  I would apply to you for admission of those photographs
         19  into evidence, please.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         21  Mr. Petrusic, or Mr. Visnjic, do you have any
         22  objections?
         23            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         24  we do not.  At the same time, I should like to take
         25  this opportunity -- I don't know whether you're now

          1  going to have a break or if we're going to continue
          2  with the proceedings, but after we have liberated the
          3  witness, and before the next witness comes into the
          4  courtroom, the Defence should like to have 10 or 15
          5  minutes for two oral motions.  So if we could kindly
          6  have that opportunity, Mr. President.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, very
          8  well.  The documents have been admitted into evidence.
          9            Captain van Duijn, thank you very much once
         10  again on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal
         11  for coming here to testify.  We understand that you
         12  have been through quite an ordeal while you were still
         13  very young, and I hope that you will continue to enjoy
         14  this multiracial, multiethnical atmosphere in this
         15  beautiful country of yours.  Thank you very much.  You
         16  are now free to go.
         17            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
         18                 [The witness withdrew]
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Well, let
         20  me just tell you that we have something at around
         21  11.00.  We are not able to continue before 11.10.  So I
         22  think that it's much better to deal with the motions of
         23  the Defence now, and then after that we will have a
         24  break, and after the break we will continue with the
         25  witness.  We have this commitment around 11.00.  If we

          1  didn't have it, we could continue right away, but I
          2  think that it's better in this situation to organise
          3  our break around 11.00.
          4            So let us hear Mr. Visnjic.  Let us hear your
          5  motion.  You have the floor.
          6            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          7  Mr. President.  Our motions are in a way interrelated,
          8  but we nevertheless separated them, and I shall now
          9  submit the first one.
         10            The Defence would like the Chamber to rule on
         11  a problem which arose with regard to the statements of
         12  the witnesses for the Prosecution, and to pass a ruling
         13  to resolve the matter in a principled manner.
         14            Before I do that, I should like to remind the
         15  Chamber that both the Defence and the Prosecution for
         16  the last two months before the beginning of the trial
         17  had done a great deal of work regarding the disclosure
         18  of evidence, so that on the eve of the trial, the
         19  Defence found itself with a very large quantity of
         20  evidence on its hands disclosed by the Prosecution, and
         21  that includes also witness statements, both in English
         22  and in Serbo-Croatian.  Some of these statements we
         23  also received after the trial began.  For reasons that
         24  Your Honours already know, the summaries of the witness
         25  statements we received a week before the trial began.

          1            On the other hand, the change of schedule of
          2  the hearings, and of course we do understand that it is
          3  a forced measure, has precluded the Defence to go
          4  through this evidence and to verify all the evidence
          5  that it received during the period that I have just
          6  mentioned.
          7            Needless to say, we're all trying to somehow
          8  reconcile the principle of expediency with the
          9  principle of the right to defence.  And of late, some
         10  witnesses, in their testimony before the Chamber, have
         11  begun describing incidents which were not mentioned in
         12  their earlier statements, and that is a completely new
         13  situation now so far as the Defence counsel are
         14  concerned, and we were unable to go through these
         15  statements without a special investigation.
         16            In light of all this, with regard to those
         17  witnesses and the witnesses whose statements we
         18  received within some 60 days before the beginning of
         19  the trial, we should like to request the Chamber to
         20  pass a ruling, to pass a decision, to allow the
         21  Defence, as a matter of principle, to, subject to
         22  supplementary investigation to be conducted by the
         23  Defence, to therefore permit the Defence to call back a
         24  certain witness -- of course, depending on whatever it
         25  is established by the additional investigation -- to

          1  call back the witness and have him give evidence
          2  regarding the newly arisen facts.
          3            So this is a principled motion, and we would,
          4  needless to say, make such submissions in every
          5  individual case, following, of course, following the
          6  decision of the Chamber, if the Chamber makes such a
          7  ruling as we are now asking you to do.
          8            We are governed in this by Rule 65 ter (E)
          9  (iv), Roman (iv), and 66(A)(ii) and Article 21, 4(A)
         10  and (B), of the Statute of the Tribunal.  That would be
         11  our first motion.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] As you
         13  said, Mr. Visnjic, these applications are interrelated,
         14  but you wanted to do it separately.  Perhaps we could
         15  indeed treat them severally; that is, you can hear the
         16  Prosecutor's statements and then submit your
         17  application.  That is, also perhaps we could hear the
         18  answer of the Prosecution, or rather the reaction of
         19  the Prosecution.
         20            What do you think, Mr. Harmon, about this
         21  application?  However, before that -- excuse me,
         22  Mr. Harmon.
         23            Before that, have you discussed the matter
         24  with the Prosecution?
         25            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] No,

          1  Mr. President, not in this manner.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          3  But we have already established that Rule before any
          4  motion is presented, but we should hear the opinion of
          5  the other party and whether they agree or do not
          6  agree.  If they agree, very well; if not, we can try to
          7  reach an agreement, an understanding.  But we now have
          8  to hear the view of the Prosecutor, and we also have a
          9  break.  And during the break, of course, it is also
         10  possible to shed views on various matters.  But since
         11  the Chamber is not sitting in full, we shall not be
         12  able to make a ruling now; that is, the Chamber has not
         13  yet passed another decision which is also pending.  We
         14  shall therefore await for Judge Wald to return in order
         15  to pass the decision, and we shall also need the
         16  presence of Judge Wald to decide on this matter as
         17  well.
         18            But we shall hear all this matter, and the
         19  Chamber will then discuss.  Today we cannot pass that
         20  decision, because Judge Wald is not with us.  But be
         21  that as it may, I should like to hear the opinion of
         22  Mr. Harmon in this respect.
         23            MR. HARMON:  Good morning, Mr. President;
         24  good morning, Judge Riad; good morning, counsel.
         25            My first observation is somewhat similar to

          1  yours.  If the second motion is related to the first
          2  motion, I think perhaps they should be explored
          3  together.  There may be an interrelationship that might
          4  affect the answer that I give.  So if I could invite
          5  counsel to give the second part of his motion, I'm
          6  happy to respond to both.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          8  We appreciate your suggestion, Mr. Harmon.
          9            Mr. Visnjic, I have to go back to what I just
         10  said.  It was perhaps preferable to hear both
         11  applications so that we could address them both at the
         12  same time.  Could we hear your second application,
         13  please?
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         15  we submitted a motion regarding the text of the
         16  indictment, and we had certain objections against some
         17  of the Prosecution evidence.  You made a ruling in that
         18  respect, and I am not commenting on that.  However,
         19  after that, the Registry gave us a certificate
         20  explaining to us that the Serbian text of the
         21  indictment, the one that was available to Mr. Petrusic
         22  and me, was erroneously translated.  It had to do with
         23  our previous motion.
         24            Article 18.4 of the Statute of the Tribunal
         25  in this regard says that when the Prosecutor determines

          1  that there is a prima facie case, he, that is, the
          2  Prosecutor, shall prepare an indictment containing a
          3  concise statement of the facts and the crime or crimes
          4  with which the accused is charged under the Statute.
          5  This means that every count in the indictment with
          6  which the accused is charged should relate to specific
          7  definitions in the Statute.
          8            At the same time, Article 21 stipulates that
          9  the accused shall be informed promptly and in detail in
         10  a language which he understands.
         11            At the same time, Rule 47(G) says that if the
         12  accused does not understand either of the official
         13  languages of the Tribunal, a translation of the
         14  indictment in that language shall also be prepared in
         15  the language that the accused understands and which
         16  will make part or be included as part of each certified
         17  copy of the indictment.
         18            These provisions were adopted so that the
         19  accused would be informed about the accusations, about
         20  the charges made against him, and the case which he
         21  needs to prepare in this defence, in the language which
         22  he, that is, the accused, understands.  These
         23  provisions also impose certain limitations, certain
         24  limits on the evidence to be used in the proceedings
         25  before the Chamber.

          1            Specifically, we are in a situation now where
          2  the Prosecutors have done properly their part of the
          3  job.  The English and the French versions of the
          4  indictment were handled in an appropriate manner, that
          5  is, in a manner corresponding to the manner in which
          6  the Prosecution prepared their evidence.
          7            On the other hand, it is evident that for, if
          8  I may call them technical reasons, the Defence has
          9  been, and especially the defendant, has been in a way
         10  denied one of its fundamental rights.
         11            Mr. President, we looked at this situation
         12  carefully and we believe that the accused has suffered
         13  certain damage, that his rights have been prejudiced in
         14  a certain way, and we thought about how this situation
         15  could be remedied.  The Defence believes that it could
         16  be set right if additional time were allotted for the
         17  investigation at the three sites which are called into
         18  question due to this misunderstanding, I'll call it.
         19            I do not wish to go now into the timetable,
         20  into the time schedule of the Chamber, but the
         21  application for the supplementary time I shall submit
         22  when the Prosecution closes its case, since we already
         23  announced such a possibility.
         24            So basically, our second application is as
         25  follows:  We first wish to clarify the situation that

          1  we are in now; and secondly, the Defence, subsequent to
          2  its application for this additional investigation, the
          3  Defence will apply to be allotted that additional time,
          4  because if one reads the Serbo-Croatian text which we
          5  had, it is quite clear that only the sites listed in
          6  the indictment are the subject of the charges.
          7            Thank you, Mr. President.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          9  I believe the time has now come for our break.  Before
         10  we make the break, I should like to hear who will be
         11  our next witness.  Are any protective measures sought,
         12  what kind of protective measures?  Mr. Harmon.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Our next witness will be Colonel
         14  Kingori, and no protective measures will be sought.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         16  We will also use the break.  As I told you, we have an
         17  obligation around 11.00, so if we could make a
         18  half-hour break, and the parties can meet now that the
         19  Prosecutor knows the substance of the application or
         20  applications of the Defence, you could perhaps meet and
         21  discuss it before the next witness is called.  You can
         22  also talk to the Chamber and let us know what are your
         23  views, whether you agree with that or not.  If you do
         24  not agree, then the Chamber will take the decision on
         25  the motion, on the application of the Defence.
          1            Now we shall have a break of half an hour,
          2  that is, until 11.20, until twenty past eleven.
          3                 --- Recess taken at 10.50 a.m.
          4                 --- On resuming at 11.40 a.m.
          5                 [The witness entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, Witness.  Can you hear me?
          8            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         10  very much for coming here, Witness.  Let us first hear
         11  your solemn declaration.
         12            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         13  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         14  truth.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         16  very much.  You may be seated now.
         17                 WITNESS:  JOSEPH KINGORI
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Are you
         19  comfortable?
         20            THE WITNESS:  Yes, Your Honour.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         22  we have somewhat changed the order of the day.  I will
         23  explain this later on.
         24            Witness, thank you very much for coming to
         25  testify here.  You will begin by answering questions

          1  put to you by counsel for the Prosecution, Mr. Harmon.
          2            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
          3            MR. HARMON:  Thank you.  If I could first ask
          4  the usher to move the ELMO back so I can see the
          5  witness, I would appreciate it.  Thank you very much.
          6                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          7       Q.   Colonel Kingori, can you state your full name
          8  and spell your last name for the record, please?
          9       A.   My name is Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Gichuhi
         10  Kingori.  I spell the last name K-i-n-g-o-r-i.
         11       Q.   Colonel, you're a career military officer; is
         12  that correct?
         13       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         14       Q.   Your nationality is Kenyan?
         15       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         16       Q.   How long have you been in the Kenyan Air
         17  Force?
         18       A.   I joined the Kenyan Air Force in 1977.  That
         19  means by now I've been there for over 23 years.
         20       Q.   In 1994, Colonel Kingori, did you serve as a
         21  United Nations military observer?
         22       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         23       Q.   Did you serve in that capacity in the former
         24  Yugoslavia?
         25       A.   Yes, Your Honour.

          1       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges what is the
          2  role of a United Nations military observer?
          3       A.   Physically, Your Honour, as a military
          4  observer -- we used to call them U-N-M-O, that is
          5  UNMOs -- you are there to monitor the violations to the
          6  ceasefire agreement, and also you are supposed to be
          7  neutral and bring the warring factions together.  This
          8  could have been by means of holding meetings with
          9  either side and bringing whatever you're told from one
         10  side to the other, so as to bring them as close as
         11  possible to each other.
         12            Also if there was anything to be conveyed
         13  from the UN headquarters, it used to pass through us.
         14  Likewise, we also had to convey whatever we get from
         15  the warring factions to the UN headquarters through the
         16  UNMO channels.
         17       Q.   Was your principal role as an UNMO to observe
         18  materials that related to the military and related to
         19  ceasefire violations?
         20       A.   Correct, Your Honour.
         21       Q.   Now, when you say that you had to report up
         22  the normal chain, can you tell the Judges what was the
         23  chain of your reporting?
         24       A.   Your Honour, the normal chain was from the
         25  UNMO sector, that is, from where we were.  We write the

          1  report to the UNMO headquarters.  Like in Srebrenica
          2  our headquarters was in Tuzla.  So we relayed the
          3  message to Tuzla, and then they would relay the same to
          4  the UNMO headquarters in Zagreb.  Then that is formally
          5  transmitted to the UN headquarters in New York.
          6       Q.   Thank you, Colonel.  Now, can you explain to
          7  the Judges the difference between an UNMO and a soldier
          8  who was serving in the former Yugoslavia as a part of
          9  UNPROFOR?
         10       A.   Your Honour, as I said concerning UNMO, the
         11  main roles was to monitor any violations to the
         12  ceasefire agreement and also handle military matters.
         13  Also you are to do some humanitarian issues, like
         14  helping the aged, helping those who are injured,
         15  analysing craters, that is, a crater analysis, in case
         16  of any impacts using heavy weapons, and then send the
         17  same to the headquarters to the channel that I gave
         18  you.
         19            As for UNPROFOR, UNPROFOR, one thing to note
         20  is that they were armed.  They had arms and they were
         21  staying in their battalion headquarters of various
         22  outposts, as required in their observation posts and
         23  all that.
         24            The difference comes whereby we are not
         25  supposed to use arms, because we did not have any.  But

          1  for the UNPROFOR, in case of anything, they could have
          2  used arms.  Hence the difference in that we, as almost
          3  who are neutral -- we are supposed to be as neutral as
          4  possible -- hence the requirement that we stay together
          5  with the people in the village.
          6       Q.   So you were not -- when you were serving as
          7  an UNMO officer, you were not at the same location and
          8  quartered with UNPROFOR soldiers.
          9       A.   Yes, Your Honour.  We were staying
         10  separately.
         11       Q.   Now, did UNPROFOR have a different mandate
         12  than you?
         13       A.   Yes, Your Honour, they had a different
         14  mandate.
         15       Q.   And are you able to describe their mandate as
         16  opposed to your mandate?
         17       A.   Your Honour, their mandate was, as a
         18  requirement of the UNPROFOR headquarters, to also
         19  monitor, but relate the military activities to what
         20  they had been told to do.  That is, in case of any
         21  activity from the warring factions, they could be
         22  called in to act against the source of the fire.  With
         23  us, we were not.
         24       Q.   And did UNPROFOR have a principal role in
         25  ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid to various

          1  locations in the former Yugoslavia?
          2       A.   Repeat your question, sir.
          3       Q.   Was one of the principal roles, as opposed to
          4  your role, which dealt almost exclusively with military
          5  matters, was UNPROFOR's role different in that it was
          6  to ensure, or attempt to ensure, that humanitarian aid
          7  would flow to various parts in the former Yugoslavia?
          8       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          9       Q.   Now, as an UNMO, how long did you serve in
         10  the former Yugoslavia?
         11       A.   Your Honour, I stayed there for one year:
         12  six months in East Krajina, that is, Sector 8; and then
         13  four months in Srebrenica; and the remaining period was
         14  in Sector south, in Knin.
         15       Q.   When did you receive your assignment to go to
         16  Srebrenica?
         17       A.   This was towards the end of March, 1995.
         18       Q.   And when did you actually arrive in
         19  Srebrenica?
         20       A.   Your Honour, I arrived in Srebrenica
         21  somewhere around -- I think it was 4th or 5th.  I'm not
         22  very sure of the actual dates.
         23       Q.   The 4th or 5th of which month?
         24       A.   Of April 1995.
         25       Q.   And when you arrived, where were you

          1  headquartered?
          2       A.   Your Honour, our headquarters was in the PTT
          3  building in Srebrenica town.
          4       Q.   And when you arrived, how many other UNMOs
          5  were also in Srebrenica?
          6       A.   Your Honour, there were five other UNMOs, and
          7  with me that made six.
          8       Q.   Where were they there, the other UNMOs?
          9       A.   Your Honour, I can remember one was from
         10  Canada, there was one from Ukraine, there was one from
         11  Ghana, one from Holland, and the other one was from --
         12  where?
         13       Q.   Was the other from Brazil?
         14       A.   From Brazil, Your Honour.
         15       Q.   Now, at the time the enclave fell in July of
         16  1995, how many UNMOs were in the Srebrenica enclave?
         17       A.   At this time, Your Honour, it's good to
         18  inform you that for the UNMOs, we were to stay in one
         19  place for one month, and then we go out for leave or
         20  vacation for six days, then go back to continue with
         21  the work.
         22            At this time there were three UNMOs who were
         23  supposed to be rotated, and one of them had stayed
         24  there for I think four months or so.  When his time
         25  came, he was not allowed to leave the enclave.

          1            The second one, who was supposed to leave the
          2  following month, was not given clearance by the Serbs
          3  to leave the enclave, and so the same happened to that
          4  one.
          5            That means just before the war started, the
          6  three were allowed to leave the enclave, but
          7  unfortunately there was no replacement allowed to go
          8  into the enclave by the Serbs.  That means we were
          9  left, only three of us:  that is me, from Kenya; David
         10  Tetteh from Ghana; and Andryk, from Holland.  But it's
         11  worth noting that by this time Andryk was admitted in
         12  the DutchBat hospital, so we were only two in
         13  Srebrenica.
         14       Q.   Now, as part of your duties, you had to get
         15  to know contacts from the various warring factions;
         16  isn't that correct?
         17       A.   That's correct, Your Honour.
         18       Q.   Now, I'd like to focus your attention on the
         19  Bosnian Serb army.  Could you tell the Judges who were
         20  your points of contact from the Bosnian Serb side?
         21       A.   Your Honour, from the Bosnian Serbs -- that
         22  is, we used to call them the BSA -- we were contacting
         23  directly with Major Nikolic and at times with a colonel
         24  called Vukovic, through our interpreter, who was called
         25  Petar.  And something to remember is that when we were

          1  to meet with any other person, Major Nikolic was always
          2  there.
          3       Q.   Now, how did Major Nikolic dress?
          4       A.   Your Honour, Major Nikolic was always dressed
          5  in combat dress; that is, camouflage, green; green
          6  camouflage.
          7       Q.   And how was Colonel Vukovic dressed?
          8       A.   Your Honour, Colonel Vukovic was dressed the
          9  same way.
         10       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what position you
         11  believed Major Nikolic to have?
         12       A.   Your Honour, Major Nikolic was, as we were
         13  told, in charge of one of the units, one of the
         14  fighting units on the BSA side.
         15       Q.   And do you know what his higher military
         16  formation was?
         17       A.   Your Honour, the way the BSA was organised
         18  was that there were superior officers above him, and
         19  all that chain went, as far as I know, up to General
         20  Mladic level.
         21       Q.   And can you tell me about Colonel Vukovic.
         22  How did he represent himself to you?
         23       A.   Your Honour, Colonel Vukovic was also in
         24  charge of one of the brigades, which I do not remember
         25  which one, and he was actually -- the way he was -- he

          1  was actually senior to Major Nikolic, the way he
          2  presented himself.
          3       Q.   So in your view, both Major Nikolic and
          4  Colonel Vukovic were from brigades that were around the
          5  Srebrenica enclave; is that correct?
          6       A.   That's correct, Your Honour.
          7       Q.   Now, I'd like you to describe to the Judges
          8  the attitude that you observed in Colonel Vukovic in
          9  respect of the Muslims who resided in the enclave.
         10       A.   Your Honour, Colonel Vukovic -- okay.  I
         11  don't know the right word, but he was a bit rough as
         12  far as the Muslims were concerned, because even at one
         13  of the meetings that we had, it was said that the
         14  Muslims have to leave Srebrenica enclave in total.  He
         15  doesn't want to see them there.  And if they are there,
         16  he might end up killing one of them.  He once said
         17  that.  So I can say he was a bit rough as far as the
         18  Muslims are concerned.
         19       Q.   Now, let me turn your attention to the Muslim
         20  side.  Can you tell the Judges the representatives the
         21  Muslim military formations that you had contact with?
         22       A.   Your Honour, we were contacting with the
         23  chief of staff, who was, I remember, Ramiz Becirovic.
         24  Then there was the intelligence officer, IO for short,
         25  who was called Ekrem Salihovic or someone like that.

          1  Then there was the mayor, the deputy mayor, and the
          2  president of the opstina.  Those are the main people
          3  that we were contacting with.
          4       Q.   Based on your contacts with these Muslim
          5  representatives, what was their attitude in respect of
          6  the Serbs who were outside of the enclave?  How did
          7  they express themselves to you?
          8       A.   Your Honour, the Muslims, in whichever
          9  meeting that we had, were always afraid of what the
         10  Serbs around them would do or could do to them.  They
         11  were in constant fear that they might overrun the
         12  enclave and maybe even harass them.  But as far as
         13  military activities, there was very little military
         14  activities, only when they used to go to look for food
         15  outside.  They were always afraid that something could
         16  happen to them on the way, because there was not enough
         17  food in the enclave.
         18       Q.   You described a rough attitude of
         19  Colonel Vukovic.  Did you see a similar rough attitude
         20  in the representatives of the Muslim community with
         21  whom you were dealing?
         22       A.   Your Honour, I did not see any.
         23       Q.   Now, Colonel Kingori, let me ask you in terms
         24  of how you would conduct your business.  If there was
         25  an allegation of a ceasefire violation, what would you

          1  do?
          2       A.   Your Honour, the first thing I would do is to
          3  request for more information, especially concerning the
          4  actual location where the violation has occurred.  Then
          5  go to that particular place, see what violation has
          6  occurred.  By "seeing," I mean maybe if it was some
          7  rocket or artillery shell had fallen at that place, I
          8  would go and see the actual location, maybe analyse the
          9  crater to know the source of the artillery piece.  Then
         10  using the maps that we had, know the source, where it
         11  actually came from that is, and get it in terms of grid
         12  references so that we can forward it to the UN
         13  headquarters through the normal channels.
         14            But if it was a violation of maybe some
         15  normal shooting, which was prevalent in that area,
         16  mainly from the BSA side, I would also interview the
         17  locals.  I would interview them, ask them what actually
         18  transpired, who actually infiltrated into that
         19  particular area, who they believe those guys were
         20  after, and after getting all that, I would forward it
         21  to the UNMO headquarters.
         22       Q.   So would it be fair to say, Colonel Kingori,
         23  that from the time you arrived in the enclave until the
         24  fall of the enclave, you spent a considerable period of
         25  your time in the field?

          1       A.   Your Honour, that is very true.
          2       Q.   And when you were in the field, were you
          3  observing and making assessments of the various
          4  capabilities of the warring factions?
          5       A.   That's very true, Your Honour.
          6       Q.   Now, if there was a violation of a ceasefire
          7  or there was an incident or there was a shelling, you
          8  mentioned you prepared reports.  Those were reports
          9  that were prepared by you personally or prepared by
         10  part of your team or both?
         11       A.   Your Honour, these reports were being
         12  prepared by either me or the other UNMOs, or at times
         13  we could draft them together.  What used to happen was
         14  that when you are in the field, you come with what you
         15  have found.  Maybe someone else was in a different
         16  area, and maybe the other guys who are left, the other
         17  UNMOs who are left in there -- in the office.  So we
         18  would combine all these and make one report and send it
         19  to the UNMO headquarters.  So it was a combination of
         20  all of us.
         21       Q.   Thank you, Colonel.  We'll return to the
         22  issue of reports in a few minutes.
         23            Now, let me ask you:  When the Bosnian Serb
         24  side wanted to contact you, how would they do that?
         25       A.   Your Honour, from the BSA side, they would

          1  contact our interpreter, that is, Petar, and since he
          2  had a radio, one of the radios with a frequency, he
          3  would contact us using that radio and tell us that one
          4  of them wanted to meet us, the location, that is, where
          5  he would like to meet us, and then we would confirm our
          6  availability, and just go there.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Could I have Prosecutor's
          8  Exhibit 42 placed on the ELMO, please.
          9       Q.   Colonel, there's an image of an individual
         10  that's been placed on the ELMO.  Do you recognise that
         11  individual?
         12       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         13       Q.   Who is that?
         14       A.   Your Honour, this was our interpreter,
         15  Mr. Petar.
         16       Q.   This was your --
         17       A.   The Serb interpreter.
         18       Q.   Your initial source of contact.  When the
         19  Serbs wanted a meeting at UNMOs, they would go through
         20  Petar?
         21       A.   That's correct, Your Honour.
         22       Q.   Okay.  Now, let me ask you:  In the meetings
         23  that you had with the representatives of the Bosnian
         24  Serb army, from the time you arrived in the enclave in
         25  April until the time that the enclave fell, did the

          1  Bosnian Serbs complain to you about attacks being made
          2  by armed units, Muslim units from within the enclave
          3  going out of the enclave and attacking either military
          4  formations or civilian targets?
          5       A.   Your Honour, I do not remember of any single
          6  time that the BSA complained about firing from that
          7  side, except maybe once, but that was not firing, it
          8  was the people now going to Zepa to look for food.
          9  There was nothing like military activities from the BiH
         10  side that was complained about the BSA side.
         11       Q.   Now, did the Serbs ever explain to you, in
         12  the time that you were in Srebrenica, about Serbian
         13  casualties, either civilian or military, that were the
         14  result of attacks by Muslim soldiers who had been
         15  within the enclave?
         16       A.   Your Honour, I don't remember any time.
         17       Q.   Now, let me go to the other side of the
         18  conflict.  Can you tell the Judges:  Did the Muslim
         19  representatives complain to you about attacks by Serbs
         20  coming into the enclave, either personally by infantry
         21  formation or by artillery?
         22       A.   Your Honour, this happened several times,
         23  very many times.  The reports we could receive either
         24  from the military organisation or from locals coming
         25  from the other sides, other villages of Srebrenica, and

          1  most of the time we would even go there and find people
          2  maybe have been hit by shells.  We would later take
          3  them to hospital, and analyse the craters, or just
          4  leave them there if their injuries are not serious.
          5  But the violations were more from the BSA side.
          6       Q.   Did the Muslims then complain to you about
          7  civilian casualties that had been suffered and did you,
          8  in fact, confirm the existence of civilian casualties
          9  on the Muslim side?
         10       A.   Your Honour, that was almost the order of the
         11  day.  Most of the time we would get complaints of
         12  civilian casualties.
         13       Q.   Colonel Kingori, you were a neutral party,
         14  but can you give the Judges your assessment of which of
         15  the warring factions appeared to you to be the
         16  aggressor?
         17       A.   Your Honour, from what I have said and what I
         18  observed when I was there, most of the violations were
         19  against the Muslims.  I can't remember of any that was
         20  against the Serbs from the Muslims.  So that means,
         21  basically, the BSA are the ones who were most of time
         22  there actually the aggressors, as far as I know.
         23       Q.   Now, given the fact that you have testified
         24  that you spent a considerable period of your time in
         25  the field within the enclave, could you kindly give the

          1  Judges your assessment of the Bosnian military
          2  formations that were within the enclave?  First of all,
          3  can you describe the types of equipment that you saw
          4  them in possession of?
          5       A.   Your Honour, can you confirm whether you mean
          6  the Bosnian Serbs or --
          7       Q.   Sorry, I made a mistake.  I meant the Bosnian
          8  Muslims who were within the enclave.  Can you provide
          9  the Judges with an assessment of those military
         10  formations, and when you give that assessment, can you
         11  include all aspects of military analysis?
         12       A.   Your Honour, from the Muslim side, that is
         13  BiH, there was no organised military as such.  For one,
         14  it is good to remember that they did not have heavy
         15  weapons.  All the heavy weapons had been withdrawn and
         16  taken to DutchBat for safe custody, because the whole
         17  enclave was a safe area.  It was a demilitarised zone.
         18  That means all the weapons, especially the heavy
         19  weapons, were withdrawn and taken to DutchBat for safe
         20  custody.  In fact, most of it was in the B-Company
         21  Compound near where we were living.
         22            Okay.  We cannot discount the fact that they
         23  had some small arms.  We're talking about AK-47s and
         24  all that, but they did not have heavy weapons.  They
         25  were not -- as we can say militarily, they were not

          1  armed as such.  They were not.
          2       Q.   Did you ever see any formations of soldiers?
          3       A.   Your Honour, I cannot remember seeing any
          4  formation.  Okay.  At times you could see one, two
          5  soldiers with some small arms, but the biggest number I
          6  ever saw was a maximum of ten, and those are very few
          7  soldiers.
          8       Q.   How would you assess their command
          9  structure?
         10       A.   Your Honour, what I can say is that their
         11  command structure -- okay.  We can say it existed, but
         12  it sort of -- it was not fully established.  They had a
         13  chief of staff who was Ramiz.  They had someone -- I
         14  can't remember what his name was.  He was a senior
         15  person whom I never met.  But you cannot call that an
         16  organised military command structure.  It was not
         17  exactly that.  Okay, they had an IO, an intelligence
         18  officer, that is Ekrem, but it was not an organised
         19  structure the way the military should be, as far as I
         20  could see.
         21       Q.   What was your assessment, Colonel Kingori, of
         22  the threat that these armed Muslims within the enclave
         23  posed to the areas outside of the enclave?
         24       A.   Your Honour, I don't think they posed any
         25  threat at all.  They were not armed as such, and as

          1  compared to what I knew the BSA had or what they showed
          2  later that they had, definitely the Muslims were no
          3  match for the Serbs.
          4       Q.   Why don't we address your attention then to
          5  what the Bosnian Serb army had.  Can you describe that
          6  army?
          7       A.   Your Honour, at least the Serbs -- I can say
          8  they had an organised structure, and they used to
          9  follow it.  At the same time, I can also say they were
         10  armed with heavy weapons.  At least they had artillery,
         11  because they used it.  They had mortars.  They had
         12  machine-guns.  They had rockets, even indicated at some
         13  times where their rocket launchers were.  They had
         14  tanks and many other types of heavy weapons.
         15       Q.   Did they have armoured personnel carriers?
         16  Did they have jeeps?
         17       A.   Yes, Your Honour, they had them.  Later on,
         18  anyway.  They robbed some from the UNPROFOR, but that
         19  was just in addition to what they had.
         20       Q.   Now, can you assess or provide the Judges
         21  with an assessment on the command structure?  Was it a
         22  command structure that, in your opinion, functioned and
         23  functioned properly?
         24       A.   Your Honour, as far as I know, their command
         25  structure functioned.  The way it was organised was a

          1  normal, we can say conventional military, and you could
          2  see -- sometimes they could tell you, "I cannot be able
          3  to answer you this until I check with our higher
          4  commanders."  That means they had an organised command
          5  structure.
          6       Q.   Now, did it appear to you that the Bosnian
          7  Serb army was an entity that was that one where the
          8  higher levels would issue orders and the lower
          9  subordinate units would follow orders?
         10       A.   Your Honour, that is the case.  The higher
         11  commanders used to give orders and the lower ones used
         12  to obey.
         13       Q.   Colonel Kingori, I'd like to focus your
         14  attention on a meeting that occurred in June of 1995
         15  and took place at the Hotel Fontana with
         16  representatives of the Bosnian Serb army.  Do you
         17  recall that particular meeting?
         18       A.   Your Honour, I can.
         19       Q.   How was it that that meeting was called?
         20       A.   Your Honour, that meeting was called through
         21  by Major Nikolic, through our interpreter, Petar, and
         22  we went to the Hotel Fontana for that meeting.
         23       Q.   And did you personally attend that meeting?
         24       A.   Your Honour, I did.
         25       Q.   From the Bosnian Serb side, who was present?

          1       A.   Your Honour, from the BSA side there was
          2  Major Nikolic, Colonel Vukovic, and some other senior
          3  officers.
          4       Q.   Could I show you Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/4
          5  and ask you if this particular man in Prosecutor's
          6  Exhibit 28/4 was present at that meeting.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, you can use my
          8  exhibit right here, it might be faster.  If that could
          9  be placed on the ELMO.
         10       Q.   And do you see anybody in that exhibit,
         11  Colonel Kingori, who was also present; and if so, can
         12  you point him out?
         13       A.   Your Honour, this particular individual was
         14  in the meeting [indicates].
         15            MR. HARMON:  For the record, on Prosecutor's
         16  28/4, Colonel Kingori has identified the individual who
         17  is in the foreground with an orange face.  He is the
         18  second individual from the right-hand side of the
         19  photograph.
         20            Thank you, Colonel.
         21            MR. HARMON:  And if I could have my exhibit
         22  back, Mr. Usher.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
         24  Mr. Harmon.  Could the witness perhaps try to remember
         25  that person's name?

          1            MR. HARMON:
          2       Q.   Do you recall at present that person's name?
          3       A.   Your Honour, I cannot remember the name,
          4  but -- I cannot remember the actual name, to be
          5  honest.
          6       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what the purpose of
          7  that meeting was?
          8       A.   Your Honour, the purpose of that meeting was
          9  mainly to discuss the people in the enclave and -- yes,
         10  I think it was mainly to discuss that.
         11       Q.   And do you recall what was said at that
         12  particular meeting in respect of the people in the
         13  enclave?
         14       A.   Your Honour, it was said that the people in
         15  the enclave should leave the enclave as -- you know,
         16  what they said was that they do not belong there; they
         17  should leave the enclave in totality.
         18       Q.   And do you recall who was saying that?
         19       A.   Your Honour, this was said by Colonel
         20  Vukovic.
         21       Q.   Did he make any statements that you
         22  interpreted to be menacing?
         23       A.   Your Honour, the words he used that time were
         24  menacing, if I can say, because he said if the Muslims
         25  do not leave, he is going to kill all of them.

          1       Q.   Now, did any of the Bosnian Serb military
          2  people who were present -- or strike that.  Were other
          3  Bosnian Serb military personnel present when Colonel
          4  Vukovic said that?
          5       A.   Your Honour, the other senior officers were
          6  also present.
          7       Q.   Did any of the other senior Bosnian Serb
          8  military officers who were present when Colonel Vukovic
          9  said that disagree with him or attempt to soften that
         10  in any way?
         11       A.   Your Honour, as far as I know, no one
         12  objected to what Colonel Vukovic said, no one talked
         13  about it, and it is as if what he said is something
         14  they had discussed earlier, or he was just conveying
         15  what they had discussed earlier or something like that.
         16       Q.   Was there also a discussion that included a
         17  discussion about safe passage of the Muslims from the
         18  enclave?
         19       A.   Your Honour, that is true.  He said that --
         20  it was said that if the Muslims decide to leave, as
         21  they were requested to do, they would be given a safe
         22  passage to leave through up to Tuzla, to join their
         23  brothers in Tuzla.
         24       Q.   At the conclusion of this meeting, Colonel
         25  Kingori, did you form any opinions about the intentions

          1  of the Bosnian Serb army?  Did you walk away from that
          2  meeting with any particular feelings?
          3       A.   Your Honour, the feelings that I got out of
          4  that meeting was that maybe something was afoot,
          5  something was being planned, something to make sure
          6  that whatever Colonel Vukovic said will be done; that
          7  is, the Serbs -- the Muslims should leave the enclave
          8  and they will be given a free passage, and if they do
          9  not, maybe something will be done.  We suspected
         10  something could be done, and they conveyed the same to
         11  the UN headquarters.
         12       Q.   Now, let me fast-forward a bit to the attack
         13  on the enclave itself.  When the attack on the enclave
         14  started, where were you?
         15       A.   Your Honour, I was in the PTT building.  We
         16  were asleep at that time, me and Major Tetteh.
         17       Q.   And did you remain in the PTT building from
         18  the time the attack started until approximately the 9th
         19  of July?
         20       A.   Your Honour, we stayed -- okay.  We did not
         21  stay inside the building, because we were going out to
         22  check what is happening.  We were also going out to
         23  analyse the craters, that is, carrying out our normal
         24  onward duties.  Then we would go back to the PTT
         25  building, write the sitreps, that is, the situation

          1  reports, and send them over as they occurred.  And
          2  during that period, if there is anything else, we would
          3  still go out and come back with the same thing.  But
          4  basically I can say we were in Srebrenica and we stayed
          5  there until much later, when we left for DutchBat
          6  Compound.
          7       Q.   All right, Colonel Kingori.
          8            MR. HARMON:  I'm going to ask, first of all,
          9  Mr. President, that Prosecutor's Exhibit 77 be
         10  distributed.  And Your Honours, Prosecutor's 77 are a
         11  series of UNMO reports and UNPROFOR reports between the
         12  dates of the 6th of July and the 18th of July.
         13       Q.   Now, Colonel Kingori, have you seen these
         14  reports before?  Have I shown you these reports, and
         15  did you recognise these reports?
         16       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         17       Q.   Now, were these reports that were prepared by
         18  you or other members of -- Major Tetteh, who was the
         19  other UNMO, at or about the time the events described
         20  in the reports were occurring?
         21       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         22       Q.   And do these reports contain your
         23  observations as you best knew them at the time?
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         25  excuse me for interrupting you, but would you find it

          1  more expedient and efficient to show these reports to
          2  the public too so that people know what we are
          3  addressing here?
          4            MR. HARMON:  I would be glad if the usher
          5  could take out the first report and -- I'm sorry -- the
          6  report that is -- yes, the first report, the report
          7  that is found in tab 1.  If you could put that --
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] As you
          9  know, Mr. Harmon, we have open sessions and we have to
         10  take care of that.  Of course, the Judges need to see
         11  the reports, but perhaps the public should also see
         12  them.  Thank you, Mr. Harmon.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Thank you very much,
         14  Mr. President.
         15       Q.   Now, the report that's been found in
         16  Prosecutor's Exhibit 77 tab 1 has been placed on the
         17  ELMO.  Can you identify that report as being either an
         18  UNMO report or an UNPROFOR report?
         19       A.   Your Honour, this is an UNMO report, as can
         20  be seen from the way it is written.  It's from UNMO
         21  headquarters sector Bosnia-Herzegovina north-east 2,
         22  UNMO headquarters, BiH command.  So it is an UNMO
         23  report.
         24       Q.   And is there a date on that report, and can
         25  you point with the pointer where the date of this

          1  report is located?
          2       A.   Your Honour, this is the date, which is the
          3  6th of July, 1995.
          4       Q.   And on a particular day did you send more
          5  than one report up your chain of command?
          6       A.   Your Honour, that is true, because we had to
          7  send the situation reports, and if something occurred
          8  in the course of time, we would send updates of the
          9  same report.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Now if the usher could take that
         11  particular item off of the ELMO and if we could place
         12  the Prosecutor's 77, tab 2, on the ELMO, we'll be able
         13  to make a distinction between the reports that are
         14  contained in Prosecutor's Exhibit 77.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         16  sorry once again for interrupting you.  I should like
         17  to ask the technicians to do the following:  When the
         18  document is placed on the ELMO, if they could first
         19  show us the document in its entirety, and only after
         20  that to focus on the pertinent paragraph.  Could you
         21  please show us the whole document?  Thank you.  This
         22  would be enough.  Thank you very much.
         23            Sorry, Mr. Harmon, for this interruption.
         24            MR. HARMON:
         25       Q.   Now, for purposes of future reference for

          1  both for counsel and for the Trial Chamber, so they can
          2  make a distinction, is the report that is now on the
          3  ELMO an UNMO report or an UNPROFOR report?
          4       A.   Your Honour, this is an UNPROFOR report.
          5       Q.   And are the observations contained in that
          6  report based on observations of UNPROFOR personnel?
          7       A.   Your Honour, that is true.  It's based on
          8  UNPROFOR personnel and not necessarily anything to do
          9  with UNMO.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Now, let me just, for purposes
         11  of future reference and convenience, let me turn to the
         12  item that is found in Prosecutor's 77, tab 6.  If that
         13  could be placed on the ELMO.  This will be of
         14  assistance both to the Trial Chamber and to counsel
         15  when they review these reports.
         16       Q.   Colonel Kingori, this is an UNMO report,
         17  isn't it?
         18       A.   Your Honour, it is an UNMO report.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Now, if we could zoom down on
         20  the UNMO report, please, to the top of the page.  Right
         21  there is fine.
         22       Q.   And do you see, Colonel, the top of the page,
         23  underneath the word "from," there is the letters DTG,
         24  and then there are a series of numbers with July 1995.
         25  Could you explain to the Judges what those numbers are

          1  and how to read those numbers in respect of this
          2  document and in other documents where similar numbers
          3  appear?
          4       A.   Your Honour, DTG means date, time, group.  It
          5  is different from the normal dates.  In the military,
          6  the way we write, you start the date -- the DTG with
          7  the date.  That is the date.  Like, here you can see it
          8  was on the 8th [indicates].  Then the time.  That is
          9  using a 24-hour clock.  That is, now it was at 1430.
         10  And then the letter Bravo, that is, B, means the time
         11  zone.  For example, like where we were, we were using a
         12  time zone Bravo, and I think it is the same even here.
         13  In Kenya, West Africa, we use Charlie.  So there is a
         14  difference in the time zones.  Then the JUL, that means
         15  it's July.  That is the month.  And then the 95
         16  indicates the year.
         17       Q.   Colonel, thank you very much.  I hope that
         18  will assist the Chamber when they have an opportunity
         19  to review the reports, and assist counsel as well, in
         20  what time these particular observations that are
         21  reflected in the reports are being made.
         22            Now, I don't intend to go through all of
         23  these reports with you, Colonel Kingori, because that
         24  would take more time than I think would be necessary,
         25  but let me ask you:  Do the reports that are found in

          1  Prosecutor's 77, and which you've had an opportunity to
          2  review, do they accurately reflect the events, as you
          3  perceive them, on the ground?
          4       A.   Your Honour, they do.
          5       Q.   Now, I'd like you to -- first of all, can you
          6  tell us when the attack on the Srebrenica enclave
          7  started.
          8       A.   Your Honour, the attack on the enclave
          9  started on the 6th of July, 1995.
         10       Q.   And can you summarise the attack, the methods
         11  that were used and the targets of the attack?
         12       A.   Your Honour, that day, in the morning, what
         13  woke us up was the shelling.  "Shelling," we are
         14  talking about the usage of heavy weapons, like
         15  artillery pieces, mortars, and all that.  So that is
         16  what woke us up that morning.
         17            The attack was concentrated on that day on
         18  the village of Srebrenica and Potocari, and as far as I
         19  knew, there were no military targets in that area.
         20  Like, where they were hitting in Srebrenica, they were
         21  hitting on the roads, next to the hospital, near --
         22  hitting houses and all that.  As far as I know, there
         23  were no military targets in that area that they were
         24  targeting.
         25       Q.   Can you describe the intensity of the

          1  shelling over the three days that you were in
          2  Srebrenica itself?
          3       A.   Your Honour, what I can say is that it was
          4  very high.  At times we could count over a hundred
          5  shells landing in the same place, be it at Srebrenica.
          6  You know, a continuous shelling of up to a hundred
          7  shells in the same area, and that is quite high
          8  intensity, considering the size of those villages.
          9       Q.   Now, you mentioned the hospital.  What
         10  happened to the hospital in Srebrenica?
         11       A.   Your Honour, the hospital was missed, I think
         12  three times.  Three shells missed the hospital just by
         13  a whisker sort of.  We could sense that it could have
         14  been targeted in that due to the inaccuracy of the
         15  weapons, we thought that was the reason why they could
         16  not get a direct hit on the hospital, because the miss
         17  was just by a few metres, just by a few metres.
         18       Q.   Was any damage inflicted on the hospital?
         19       A.   Your Honour, other than maybe broken -- okay,
         20  broken windows due to fragmentation, there was no
         21  serious damage on the hospital.
         22       Q.   What about the PTT building where you and
         23  Major Tetteh were headquartered, was that struck by
         24  artillery?
         25       A.   Your Honour, the PTT building was not hit at

          1  that particular time, it was hit later, but it was
          2  missed several times.  Some of the shells could land on
          3  the opposite side where there was a hill, and we could
          4  sense maybe they were also targeting that area, but we
          5  were missed that time, until much later after we had
          6  withdrawn to DutchBat Compound.  That is when it was
          7  hit.
          8       Q.   What is your assessment, Colonel Kingori,
          9  about this particular artillery attack over the days
         10  that you remained in Srebrenica?  Against what kind of
         11  targets were these shells directed?
         12       A.   Your Honour, the target, as far as we knew,
         13  as far as we could get when we were going out for our
         14  patrols during that period, was mainly the populous;
         15  that is, the personnel -- the people in that area, that
         16  is, the civilians.  Because after shelling for some
         17  period, you know, targeting the houses in that
         18  particular village, they would wait for some time then
         19  shell the same place again.  According to our own
         20  assessment, that meant that they were waiting for the
         21  people to come out to pick the injured and maybe check
         22  the damage and all that, and then they would hit them
         23  again when they're still there.  So they wanted, as far
         24  as we were concerned, to get maximum casualties on the
         25  people who were there.

          1       Q.   Why do you think they were targeting
          2  civilians, in your opinion?
          3       A.   Your Honour, in my opinion, the main reason
          4  was to make sure that they harassed these people in
          5  such a way that they are forced to leave the enclave,
          6  because as they had said earlier, they did not want the
          7  Muslims inside that enclave.  They just wanted it for
          8  themselves; that is, the Serbs.  So they just wanted to
          9  cause fear, panic, and force the Muslims to flee that
         10  enclave.
         11       Q.   Now, did you eventually leave Srebrenica town
         12  and go to Potocari?
         13       A.   Your Honour, we did, and this was -- we
         14  actually tried to stay in that place.  We wanted to be
         15  as close as possible to the concentration of the
         16  shelling so that we could report as objectively as
         17  possible, but a time came when we were also, you know,
         18  threatened.  When we sighted a tank positioned in a
         19  direct line of fire, about two kilometres or so from
         20  our location, we felt we were directly threatened and
         21  they could get a direct hit on us, and we feared for
         22  our own safety and decided to leave, though even --
         23  okay.  I will not go to that part, but by the time we
         24  were leaving, the Muslims did not want us to leave,
         25  because they felt if we leave them, the Serbs would

          1  just come and overrun that place.
          2            They also thought that the Serbs were maybe
          3  not hitting that place as seriously as they would have
          4  done because of our presence; that is, the presence of
          5  the UNMOs in that particular place, and that if we
          6  left, now they will do whatever they wanted with that
          7  village.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, I'm not sure when
          9  Your Honour wants to take a break in time.  I'm
         10  prepared to proceed.  I just am unclear on the timing.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I was just
         12  thinking of how to split the last part of the day.
         13  Maybe it's a good idea to have a break now.  We still
         14  have a couple of issues pending which need discussion,
         15  so I think that it would be perhaps a good idea to
         16  finish the testimony of Colonel Kingori at 2.15, and
         17  then we will have 15 minutes left for our discussion.
         18            So we are going to have a 20-minute break
         19  now, after which we will continue with the testimony of
         20  Colonel Kingori.
         21            Let me just tell you that we cannot hear this
         22  witness later than 2.15, because we have to have 15
         23  minutes for our discussion.
         24                 --- Recess taken at 12.43 p.m.
         25                 --- On resuming at 1.15 p.m.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
          2  let us continue until quarter past two, more or less.
          3            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          4       Q.   Colonel Kingori, on the 9th of July you went
          5  to Potocari; is that correct?
          6       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          7       Q.   At approximately what time did you arrive in
          8  Potocari and where did you go in Potocari?
          9       A.   We left the PTT building around 1800 hours,
         10  and I think we arrived maybe 10, 15 minutes after
         11  that.
         12       Q.   Where did you go in Potocari?
         13       A.   Your Honour, in Potocari, we went to the
         14  DutchBat Compound.  That is where the Dutch Battalion
         15  was located.
         16       Q.   Now, the following day, the 10th of July, did
         17  you attempt to contact representatives from the Bosnian
         18  Serb side?
         19       A.   Your Honour, we attempted.  We tried that
         20  time, but we were unable to contact them.
         21       Q.   Who did you contact and who were you trying
         22  to contact?
         23       A.   Your Honour, we were trying to contact
         24  Major Nikolic through your interpreter Petar.
         25       Q.   Did you succeed?

          1       A.   Your Honour, we did not succeed.
          2       Q.   Now, let me turn your attention to the
          3  11th of July, the next day, and can you tell me and
          4  tell the Chamber approximately what time refugees
          5  started to arrive in and around Potocari on the 11th of
          6  July?
          7       A.   Your Honour, the refugees started streaming
          8  in in the afternoon on the 11th of July.
          9       Q.   And on the 11th of July, are you able to
         10  estimate how many refugees were in and around the
         11  UN Compound in Potocari?
         12       A.   Your Honour, what I can remember is that
         13  inside the compound there were about 5.000 or so
         14  refugees, and outside there were actually more than
         15  that.  It could have been even up to 7.000, 8.000, or
         16  even up to 10.000.
         17       Q.   Can you give the Judges your assessment of
         18  the composition of those refugees, the percentage of
         19  men to women, the ages of the refugees?
         20       A.   Your Honour, the percentages -- I might not
         21  be very correct, but the men were fewer than the
         22  women.  Let's say -- we can say it's about 80 per cent
         23  women and the other percentage men, and also that the
         24  men who were there were -- okay.  Most of them are
         25  older people, you know, beyond fighting age, as I can

          1  say, and the others were just boys, young boys.
          2       Q.   Was there sufficient food, sufficient water
          3  for those refugees?
          4       A.   As far as I can remember, we had problems
          5  with water and food.  Water -- actually, at that time
          6  we did not have any to feed those people with, and they
          7  were very thirsty.  Even when I said -- okay.  In the
          8  DutchBat Compound we had some water, but those who were
          9  outside did not have any at all.
         10       Q.   What do you recall the weather conditions to
         11  be like on the 11th of July?
         12       A.   Your Honour, on the 11th it was hot, very hot
         13  during the day, and in the evening it was very, very
         14  cold.
         15       Q.   Now, on the 11th of July, did you receive a
         16  telephone call from a representative from the Bosnian
         17  Serb side, either a telephone call or radio contact,
         18  some form of communication?
         19       A.   Your Honour, on the 11th, Petar tried to
         20  communicate to us, requesting for a meeting with Major
         21  Nikolic.  That is now us and UNPROFOR.  But when we
         22  requested the UN headquarters for approval, we were not
         23  allowed to go there for that meeting.
         24       Q.   Why not?
         25       A.   The assessment of the situation at that time

          1  was that since the airstrikes had already been called
          2  for, maybe that could have been the reason why the BSA
          3  wanted to call us for a meeting, and maybe even hold us
          4  as human shields against the airstrikes so that they do
          5  not occur.  And we feared also, and our UN
          6  headquarters, that is, the sector headquarters, also
          7  feared for that fact, because something like that had
          8  happened earlier in other sectors, and it is a risky
          9  business.
         10       Q.   Now, did you see any Muslim fighters, Muslim
         11  people who were armed in and around the UN Compound in
         12  Potocari on the 11th of July?
         13       A.   Your Honour, there were several, many BSA
         14  soldiers who came there that day.
         15       Q.   If I said Serb soldiers, I made a mistake.  I
         16  meant to say Muslim fighters.  Did you see any Muslim
         17  fighters on the 11th of July?
         18       A.   Your Honour, there were no Muslims soldiers
         19  there at all.
         20       Q.   On the 11th of July, was there any shelling
         21  in and around the compound at Potocari?
         22       A.   Your Honour, as far as I can remember,
         23  shelling was ongoing, even at that time.
         24       Q.   Do you remember what areas were being
         25  shelled, if you can recall?

          1       A.   Your Honour, Potocari was a target and
          2  Srebrenica was also a target.  And we could hear some
          3  rockets overflying us, going towards other parts of the
          4  enclave.  But at least Potocari and Srebrenica were
          5  still being targeted.
          6       Q.   Could you see where those rockets or where
          7  that artillery fire was hitting?
          8       A.   Your Honour, some of them we could see,
          9  because -- like, the ones which were falling around
         10  Potocari we could see.  But the ones going beyond, we
         11  could not know where they were hitting.  But at least
         12  for Srebrenica we had one interpreter who had gone
         13  there and who from there could tell us what was going
         14  on.  At least Srebrenica was being hit also.
         15       Q.   Now, let me turn your attention to the next
         16  day, the 12th of July.  Did you see the arrival of
         17  Bosnian Serb soldiers on the 12th of July?
         18       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         19       Q.   Can you -- well, let me ask you this
         20  question:  Approximately what time do you recall they
         21  arrived?
         22       A.   Your Honour, this was in the morning
         23  section.  If I can remember very well, it was in the
         24  morning section, and -- yes, they arrived in the
         25  morning section.

          1       Q.   Can you describe the soldiers that you saw
          2  arriving into the Potocari area?
          3       A.   Your Honour, the soldiers I remember seeing
          4  coming over there wore black -- they had black
          5  uniforms.  They looked different from the normal BSA
          6  soldiers we used to see around there.
          7       Q.   In addition to those soldiers, did you see
          8  any other soldiers?
          9       A.   Your Honour, I also saw the normal, ordinary
         10  soldiers in green camouflage, and -- that is, their
         11  normal BSA camouflage -- and also there were some in
         12  blue, which was normally being used by the police.
         13       Q.   What was the reaction of the Muslim people
         14  when the Bosnian Serb soldiers arrived?
         15       A.   Your Honour, the actual reaction was they
         16  were all afraid when they saw the soldiers passing
         17  through there.  You could see fear in them,
         18  uncertainty.  They did not know what will happen to
         19  them, because they were now in one place.  And they
         20  were always -- they were afraid of the worst, you know,
         21  what could happen to them at that particular time.  You
         22  could see it in their eyes, their reaction, the way
         23  they talked.  They were all afraid.
         24       Q.   Now, sometime on the 12th of July, did
         25  Bosnian Serb military representatives come to the UN

          1  Compound?
          2       A.   Your Honour, they did.
          3       Q.   Can you tell the Judges the circumstances
          4  under which they came and who came?
          5       A.   The ones who came in, they were just coming
          6  to check whether there were any Muslim soldiers inside
          7  there, Muslim soldiers, you know, whether they were
          8  armed or not.  At least they were looking for Muslim
          9  soldiers inside there.
         10            Secondly, they wanted to see who is actually
         11  housed there, because when we met them, we told them it
         12  is only the injured people, the women and older men of
         13  Srebrenica who are inside there.  And they sort of
         14  maybe did not trust what we told them, and they decided
         15  to go in and check for themselves.
         16       Q.   Were you there when these representatives
         17  from the Bosnian Serb army came?
         18       A.   Your Honour, I was personally there.
         19       Q.   Can you identify any of the individuals who
         20  came to the UN Compound at that time?
         21       A.   Your Honour, I can.  I can remember some of
         22  them.  At least I can remember some of them.
         23       Q.   Who were they?
         24       A.   Your Honour, at least there was Major
         25  Nikolic, he was there; the interpreter, Petar, was also

          1  there; Colonel Vukovic was also there; and there was --
          2  Krstic was also there; another guy I cannot remember,
          3  another senior officer.  I cannot remember his name
          4  very well.  But I can remember some of their faces.
          5       Q.   You've previously identified Petar.  You said
          6  Krstic.
          7       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          8       Q.   Who was Krstic?
          9       A.   Your Honour, he was introduced to us together
         10  with the other senior officers, and he was introduced
         11  as being one of the senior officers from the BSA side.
         12  And I cannot remember his actual position in that
         13  hierarchy.  I can't remember that well.
         14       Q.   Have you seen a picture of an individual who
         15  you have identified as Krstic?
         16       A.   Your Honour, I have.
         17       Q.   Is that individual in this courtroom today?
         18       A.   Mind if I stand up?
         19       Q.   Please.
         20       A.   It's that individual there [indicates].
         21       Q.   Can you identify what he's wearing, for the
         22  record?
         23       A.   That time he was in green camouflage, but his
         24  weight was a bit -- difficult for me to identify him
         25  now.

          1       Q.   Can you identify what he's wearing now?
          2       A.   Right now he's in a black suit and a blue
          3  shirt and a dotted tie.
          4            MR. HARMON:  Could the record reflect,
          5  Mr. President, that the defendant has been identified
          6  by Colonel Kingori.
          7       Q.   You can have a seat, Colonel Kingori.
          8            Now, let me ask that -- let me ask you this
          9  question:  Who introduced you to General Krstic?
         10       A.   Your Honour, anyway, I didn't know him as a
         11  General at that time, but he was introduced to me by
         12  Major Nikolic.
         13       Q.   And how long did the individuals Major
         14  Nikolic, General Krstic, Petar, and others, remain with
         15  you in and around the UN Compound on that occasion?
         16       A.   Your Honour, we were together in that area,
         17  inside the compound, for about 15 minutes or so,
         18  somewhere there.
         19       Q.   Now, let me ask -- you said you could not --
         20  you didn't know the names of some of the others, but
         21  you could recognise them.  Did I have an opportunity to
         22  show you Prosecutor's Exhibit number 28, and did you
         23  identify an individual from within this exhibit?
         24       A.   Your Honour, that's true.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Now, could I have Prosecutor's

          1  Exhibit 28/3.2 put on the ELMO, please.  That's not
          2  3.2.  This is 3.2.  It's under tab 1.  It's under tab
          3  1.  You can use mine.  Use this.
          4       Q.   Can you identify one of the individuals who
          5  you saw with General Krstic and Petar and Major Nikolic
          6  at the UN Compound?
          7       A.   This individual was there that time.
          8            MR. HARMON:  On this particular exhibit,
          9  Mr. President, the witness has pointed to the
         10  individual in the left-hand side of the photograph.
         11            Now, Mr. Usher, if you can give that back to
         12  me, I will show you another photograph.
         13       Q.   This is Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/1.  Do you
         14  see that same individual in this particular
         15  photograph?
         16       A.   Your Honour, I can see him.  He's the one
         17  here.
         18       Q.   Indicating the individual on the far
         19  left-hand side of that particular image.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Thank you very much, Mr. Usher.
         21       Q.   Now, Colonel, after the individuals left, did
         22  you have an opportunity to see General Mladic?
         23       A.   Your Honour, I did.
         24       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges the
         25  circumstances under which you met General Mladic?

          1       A.   At that time, I saw some -- okay, the normal
          2  movement of the BSA soldiers now on the road adjacent
          3  to the DutchBat Compound, and I went out to check what
          4  was going on, normal routine just to see what was
          5  happening outside there.  That is when I saw a group of
          6  BSA soldiers surrounding a certain individual, and I
          7  became a bit curious.  Upon arriving there, I saw
          8  General Mladic, who I could identify, because I had
          9  seen him earlier on television, photos, and all that.
         10  So at least I could identify him.
         11       Q.   What was he doing?  I'm sorry.  What was he
         12  doing?
         13       A.   At that particular moment, he was -- I can't
         14  remember whether that is the time he was
         15  distributing -- yeah.  That is the time he was
         16  distributing soft drinks and candies and all that to
         17  the refugees who were outside the main compound.
         18       Q.   Now, in addition to General Mladic
         19  distributing sweets and drinks to the refugees, did you
         20  see anybody else doing that?
         21       A.   Your Honour, there were other senior officers
         22  and soldiers who were doing the same, the distribution.
         23       Q.   Now, let me show you, if I could,
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibit 78.
         25            MR. HARMON:  This, Mr. President, is a very

          1  short piece of film footage that has been seen
          2  previously.  In order to shorten it, I have made this
          3  film footage.  It is only a matter of seconds.  But if
          4  we could play Prosecutor's Exhibit 78, please.
          5       Q.   Colonel, it should come up on your monitor in
          6  front of you.
          7                 [Videotape played]
          8            MR. HARMON:
          9       Q.   Colonel, did you see that scene or scenes
         10  similar to that?
         11       A.   Your Honour, I was there that time when that
         12  distribution was going on.
         13       Q.   Could you tell the Judges what else you saw?
         14       A.   At that time, when the distribution was going
         15  on, there was someone with a video camera.  At least he
         16  was filming whenever the distribution was going on.  As
         17  far as I thought at that time, it was maybe a PR or,
         18  let's say, a propaganda issue.  That is what I thought,
         19  that maybe they want to show the world that they are
         20  doing something for these people, and maybe the
         21  International Community could forget whatever they have
         22  done against those people.
         23            Also what I saw that time was immediately the
         24  camera turned to a different direction, some of the
         25  soldiers could pick the candies back, you know, from

          1  the people they have just given, the children and all
          2  that.  So that is something unique.  I did not
          3  understand why they had to do that.  And that is --
          4  that forced me to conclude that this is just a PR or
          5  personal relationship thing, maybe just to show the
          6  International Community that they are not against these
          7  Muslims per se.
          8       Q.   Now, Colonel Kingori --
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  I'm sorry, I do not understand
         10  this last thing.  You said -- what did you conclude
         11  when they picked back the sweets?  What did you
         12  conclude?  That it was not against the Muslims?
         13       A.   Your Honour, what I concluded was that if
         14  they're picking these candies back from the
         15  individuals, the main purpose of giving them was to
         16  show, because the filming was going on, to show the
         17  International Community that they are doing good things
         18  to these refugees, so that the opinion of the
         19  International Community can forget or can ignore the
         20  atrocities they have already committed to those
         21  people.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         23            MR. HARMON:
         24       Q.   Colonel Kingori, did you see General Mladic
         25  on one occasion or more than one occasion on the

          1  12th of July?
          2       A.   On the 12th, I saw him twice.  I think twice,
          3  yes.
          4       Q.   What were the circumstances of the second
          5  occasion?
          6       A.   The second occasion was when I realised that
          7  there was separation, separation going on between the
          8  men and the women and children.  And men were being
          9  taken to a certain location, actually a house on the
         10  left side as you go from Srebrenica, actually out of
         11  Potocari.  I did not understand why the separation was
         12  there.  And also the way the men were being kept in
         13  that building was not in a good manner.  There were
         14  very many.  It was crowded.  They were stepping on each
         15  other.
         16            The whole scenario did not look good to me,
         17  and that is why I went to General Mladic and asked him
         18  what is actually going on.  Why are they doing
         19  something like that; that is, putting people together,
         20  huddling them together in such a small place, and all
         21  the men, why they were doing that.  He told me, they
         22  don't have anything -- there's nothing bad they're
         23  doing.  In fact, the people there are very
         24  comfortable.  They're very comfortable inside there.
         25            Then he requested me to accompany him, but

          1  then there was a delay, a small delay.  We went there
          2  with him, but that time some BSA soldiers had already
          3  gone towards the house, and when we arrived there, they
          4  started distributing beer, soft drinks to the men now.
          5  And he asked me, "Can't you see that they're
          6  comfortable?  Can't you see?" just because they were
          7  taking the drink.  "Can't you see that they're okay?"
          8            There's nothing that I had done, because I
          9  had earlier tried to go there and I was prevented.  Now
         10  this time I requested him to allow me to enter the
         11  house, and he personally told me no, there is no point
         12  in going inside there.  So there is practically nothing
         13  I could have done.
         14       Q.   Colonel Kingori, you said you tried to go
         15  into the house earlier.  Who prevented you from going
         16  into the house where these men were being kept?
         17       A.   BSA soldiers who were guarding that place.
         18  The place was being guarded by BSA soldiers.  They were
         19  the ones who told me I cannot be allowed to go inside
         20  that building.
         21       Q.   Okay.  And as a result of that, you went to
         22  see General Mladic, I take it, and that's when he
         23  returned with you.
         24       A.   Right.  That is what I did.
         25       Q.   Now, did you also have another occasion to

          1  see General Krstic and other high-ranking officers that
          2  day?
          3       A.   Your Honour, I did.
          4       Q.   Explain to the Judges the circumstances under
          5  which you saw General Krstic and other high-ranking
          6  officers.
          7       A.   Your Honour, this was partly -- at the same
          8  time when we were with General Mladic, these guys were
          9  there.  All of them, they were there and around.  After
         10  that -- I cannot remember the other place where I met
         11  him.
         12       Q.   Now, when you say "these guys," who are the
         13  individuals you said are "these guys"?  Can you
         14  identify them more precisely?
         15       A.   Your Honour, the people I'm talking about are
         16  the senior BSA soldiers -- BSA officers.  We're talking
         17  about Major Nikolic, Colonel Vukovic -- the ones I can
         18  remember the names -- and also Krstic, and another
         19  person who introduced himself to me as the legal
         20  officer, a legal officer.  Can I remember the name?
         21  Oskuminic or someone like that.  But he told me he's a
         22  legal officer and even wrote his address for me, which
         23  I still keep.
         24       Q.   What language did the legal officer speak?
         25       A.   Your Honour, the legal officer was speaking

          1  English, you know, fluent.  Good English.  Good
          2  English.  That is why we were able to discuss with
          3  him.
          4       Q.   I'd like to show you a photograph of
          5  Prosecutor's 28/13.1.
          6            MR. HARMON:  And this is found, Mr. Usher, in
          7  tab 11.  That's it.  Yes.  Could you place that on the
          8  ELMO, please?
          9       Q.   Can you identify this individual?
         10       A.   Your Honour, this is the guy who presented
         11  himself as the legal officer.  I can remember him very
         12  well.
         13       Q.   And the individual who was speaking English?
         14       A.   And the person who was speaking English.
         15       Q.   Now, previously in this testimony you also
         16  identify an individual who was found at Prosecutor's
         17  Exhibit 28/8.1.
         18            MR. HARMON:  Which, Mr. Usher, is found in
         19  tab 6.  Place that on the ELMO, please.
         20       Q.   The individual on the left-hand side of this
         21  Prosecutor's Exhibit, did you see him again that day?
         22       A.   Your Honour, he was there.  We were with him
         23  there.
         24       Q.   On the second occasion?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   You've also identified an individual who is
          2  in Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/4.
          3            MR. HARMON:  Which is found in tab 2,
          4  Mr. Usher.  Place that on the ELMO.
          5       Q.   The individual you've previously identified
          6  in Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/4, did you see him as well?
          7       A.   Yes, Your Honour.  He is the individual.
          8       Q.   Now, were you in a position to see what the
          9  accused, General Krstic, and these individuals were
         10  doing?
         11       A.   What I can remember very well was that they
         12  were coming in and going out.  They were at one time
         13  with us and with General Mladic there, and at times
         14  they would go out there, I mean, to the soldiers, talk
         15  to them, which, as far as I was concerned, they were
         16  giving orders to these soldiers.  Then they would later
         17  come back and join us or go to another place.  So they
         18  were in and out.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, I'm finished with
         20  that exhibit.  Thank you very much.
         21       Q.   Now, did you see the accused and these other
         22  individuals near the area where these Muslim men who
         23  had been separated were being detained?
         24       A.   Your Honour, when we went there with
         25  General Mladic, these people were there.  These -- we

          1  were together, all of us.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have
          3  Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/17 placed on the ELMO.
          4       Q.   I'd like to ask you if you can identify this
          5  particular location.  Do you recognise that particular
          6  building?
          7       A.   Yes, Your Honour, I can.
          8       Q.   What is that building?
          9       A.   This is the building we were calling White
         10  House.  This is the place where the men were being
         11  taken to.
         12       Q.   Was there more than one building where the
         13  men were being taken to?
         14       A.   Your Honour, this was one of them.  The other
         15  one was somewhere in a different location, but this was
         16  the place I said after the separation of the men were
         17  being handled together.
         18       Q.   Let me show you Prosecutor's
         19  Exhibit 53/B [sic], which is a new exhibit.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Let me ask that that be placed
         21  on the ELMO.
         22       Q.   And ask you, Colonel Kingori, if you can
         23  locate on Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/3B the second location
         24  where men were being detained.
         25       A.   Your Honour, it's not very easy to detect

          1  from here, but the other location was somewhere here
          2  [indicates].
          3       Q.   Would you take a pen, please -- there should
          4  be a pen available to you -- and would you circle the
          5  area where the second location is where the men were
          6  being detained?
          7       A.   [Marks]
          8       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much, Colonel.
          9  Now, did you actually see the men being separated, and
         10  did you see what happened to them when they approached
         11  one or both of these locations?
         12       A.   If I can start with the White Building, I was
         13  personally there, and I saw the men being taken towards
         14  that building.  They were being forced to leave their
         15  belongings at the road junction with the truck that
         16  leads to the building just somewhere there, all their
         17  belongings.  By that I mean even the money they had,
         18  the pocketknives they had, their wallets, and any other
         19  belongings, maybe bags and all that.  They were leaving
         20  all of them out there before they entered the
         21  building.
         22            As for the other house, the one I have just
         23  marked, the men who were being taken there, I was told
         24  by some Dutch soldiers that there were some men who had
         25  been taken behind that building, and they didn't know

          1  what was happening.  So I decided to go inside there
          2  and check.
          3            The soldier, the Dutch soldiers do not go
          4  inside there but as an UNMO I could go in there.  It's
          5  taking a risk obviously, but I went inside there, tried
          6  to go behind to see what was going on, but I was
          7  prevented from continuing by the Serb soldiers who were
          8  there.  They told me -- they just showed me to go back,
          9  and I just retreated, and that was it at that
         10  particular time.
         11       Q.   Could you take --
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         13  I'm sorry for the interruption, but I saw in the
         14  transcript on page 92, 22nd line, it mentions the
         15  exhibit, your exhibit 53/B, and it should be corrected
         16  5/3B.  I believe one needs to pay attention because
         17  this marking, this kind of numbering could cause
         18  problems later on.  It is not 53, it is 5/3, and I
         19  should like to ask either the court reporters or the
         20  interpreters or you to pay attention when exhibits are
         21  called out.  I'm sorry for having to interrupt you.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         23       Q.   Colonel, could you turn your attention,
         24  please, to Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/B -- I'm sorry,
         25  5/3B.  That is on the ELMO in front of you.  You said

          1  you attempted to go into that particular area.
          2  And why was that again?
          3       A.   The reason why I wanted to go to that
          4  particular area was that the Dutch -- some Dutch
          5  soldiers had reported that men were being taken behind
          6  there, and were not returning.  Whenever they were
          7  taken behind there, none of them was coming back.  So
          8  mine was purely to go and investigate what was going
          9  on.  And according to him, he told me that shooting was
         10  going on behind.  There was some shooting.  They could
         11  hear some shooting there.  And so I went there to
         12  investigate.
         13       Q.   Could you hear some shooting?
         14       A.   I personally did.  I heard some shooting when
         15  I tried -- when I attempted to go behind there.
         16       Q.   Could you take your pointer, please, and
         17  indicate the area where you attempted to pass.
         18       A.   The place I attempted to pass was through
         19  here, behind these buildings [indicates].
         20       Q.   Indicating the buildings that are circled?
         21       A.   Yes.  And that is where I could not be led
         22  through.
         23       Q.   Were you able to determine the shooting
         24  point, where you heard the sounds of the shots coming
         25  from?

          1       A.   Your Honour, it was not easy to detect, but
          2  it was at a close place; it was not far.  Because the
          3  noise that was coming could -- you know, indicated that
          4  the shooting is not happening far from where I was.
          5  And it was -- if I can clarify, it was single shots;
          6  not bursts, but single shots.
          7       Q.   Now, let me ask you, Colonel Kingori:  I'd
          8  like to return to some of your earlier testimony where
          9  you said that you personally saw Muslim males having
         10  their belongings taken out of their -- off their
         11  persons.  Did that include their identifications?
         12       A.   I think one thing to say there is that it's
         13  not -- things were not being removed from their
         14  pocket.  They were forced to remove them.  And
         15  secondly, that that included the identification and
         16  everything.  When an individual removed his items,
         17  whatever he had, then he would go ahead to another
         18  soldier who would physically search whether there is
         19  anything inside.  But still, if there was anything,
         20  they were being forced -- they were being told to
         21  remove them and put them down.  So this actually
         22  included even their identification cards.
         23       Q.   Now, let me ask you this question, Colonel.
         24  Had you had a conversation with any representative of
         25  the Bosnian Serb army about what was going to happen to

          1  these particular men who had been separated?
          2       A.   Your Honour, I asked that, and the individual
          3  who answered me that question -- that is, the first
          4  question I had asked was:  Why the separation?  Then
          5  the second question was:  What do they intend to do
          6  with these men after they separate them?  And the
          7  answer was given by the person identified as -- having
          8  told me he was the legal officer, he told me that the
          9  reason why they are separating the men was for them to
         10  use them in exchange to their own prisoners of war who
         11  had been taken by the Muslims.
         12       Q.   Now, in light of what you saw, that is,
         13  identification papers and other personal effects being
         14  dropped on the ground, what conclusions, if any, did
         15  you come to?
         16       A.   It was a bit difficult now to know what was
         17  actually going on, but if you do not -- normally, if
         18  you don't want to have someone -- if you do not want
         19  someone to have an identification card, it literally
         20  means that maybe you don't want him in that way to
         21  identify himself or be identified by someone else,
         22  because that is the only thing -- that is, the ID
         23  card -- the only thing one can use to identify
         24  himself.
         25       Q.   And did you ever go back and inform the

          1  person who was identified as the legal officer about
          2  why they were required to leave their identifications
          3  on the ground?
          4       A.   Your Honour, I did not ask him exactly, you
          5  know, that way, whether -- I mean, as you have put it,
          6  I did not put the question as such.  The question I had
          7  asked was why they were being separated, but not why
          8  they were leaving their ID cards there.
          9       Q.   Did you see -- how long did these separations
         10  last on the day of the 12th of July?
         11       A.   Your Honour, it took quite some time.  It
         12  took quite some time.
         13       Q.   And did you see any buses that left the area
         14  with just men in them?
         15       A.   That is correct.  I saw.
         16       Q.   And where were these men being taken from
         17  before they were put on the buses?
         18       A.   Your Honour, there were two sets here.  The
         19  main one was the men who were being taken from that
         20  white building, the ones who had been put together
         21  earlier.  They were put on their own buses, different
         22  from the ones carrying the women and children, and we
         23  did not know where their destination was, though they
         24  were telling us they are going to take them, I think,
         25  to Zvornik or somewhere.  But we did not -- they did

          1  not clarify in particular what they are going to do
          2  with them.
          3       Q.   Did you have any conversations with any of
          4  the men, the Muslim men who had been put on those
          5  buses?
          6       A.   This was an emotional period.  This was an
          7  emotional time, as far as I was concerned, because some
          8  of the men are people we had lived together with in
          9  that village, and they were being put in these buses.
         10  Even, you know, when they were lined up beside the
         11  road, they could cry and shout to us, requesting for
         12  assistance, asking us what we can do to help them.
         13  They could shout and say, "You know these people are
         14  going to kill us, and then you are not doing anything
         15  about it."  And I mean, to us it was a bit emotional.
         16  It was very emotional.
         17            And also to them.  You could see the fear.
         18  There was a lot of fear.  They didn't know what would
         19  happen.  They felt, you know, that they are
         20  definitely -- something bad was actually going to be
         21  done to them.  You know, we could see it, and they
         22  could also shout about it.  In fact, some of them I
         23  even tried to tell them with the literal language of
         24  theirs that I could use, telling them not to worry; we
         25  have been told where they were being taken to, that

          1  is -- what do you call this place? -- Zvornik, and
          2  then later on to Tuzla, and they should not fear.
          3  Because at least we had been assured nothing bad would
          4  happen to them.  But you could see there was a lot of
          5  fear.  They were crying.  You know, men -- you can
          6  imagine men crying in front of you and seeking
          7  assistance from you, assistance which you cannot give.
          8  We, as individuals -- in fact, at that time I was, I
          9  think, the only UNMO there, and as an individual, there
         10  is no assistance I could have given.  It was beyond --
         11  it had gone beyond my control.  And you could see them,
         12  you know, crying.  It was quite emotional.
         13       Q.   Colonel Kingori, what was the age range of
         14  the males who had been separated and who had been
         15  placed in the White House and the other house?
         16       A.   The men in the White House, those were the
         17  younger men, if I can say, because the others who were
         18  in the main DutchBat Compound were the older people,
         19  the very old, who some of them could hardly walk well.
         20  But these ones -- those ones in the White House were
         21  the younger, you know, slightly younger people.
         22       Q.   Who was the youngest person you saw separated
         23  on the 12th of July?
         24       A.   That time they were separating even some very
         25  young boys, some as young as 13, 14, and they were

          1  telling them to go and join the other men.  And several
          2  instances I intervened and starting asking the boys,
          3  "What is your age?"  They would tell me, "I'm 14."
          4  And then I would tell the soldiers, "These guys -- this
          5  boy is 14 years old.  Why are you separating them?"
          6  And maybe that way they could allow them to continue.
          7  I saw another one, I could do the same.
          8            But immediately I turned from that direction
          9  and started -- they were still having the same boys,
         10  you know, to go and join the men.  So I could not be
         11  able to cope with the situation.  I could not prevent
         12  all the younger boys from me being separated, so some
         13  of them were actually taken together with the men.
         14       Q.   Now, let me ask you to turn your attention to
         15  the 13th of July.  Did the separations that you've
         16  described witnessing on the 12th of July continue on
         17  the 13th?
         18       A.   Yes, Your Honour, they did.
         19       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges the separation
         20  process that you saw on the 13th?
         21       A.   The separation on the 13th was just almost a
         22  continuation of what was happening earlier; it was only
         23  that now -- it was almost a continuation of the same,
         24  as I can see.
         25       Q.   Now, again, when you say "almost a

          1  continuation," were males separated and taken to one of
          2  the two locations that you've previously described, and
          3  were they forced to abandon their belongings at those
          4  locations?
          5       A.   At this time no men were being taken to
          6  that -- to the White House, but at least they were
          7  still abandoning their belongings, they were being
          8  forced to leave their belongings.  Because some of
          9  these at that time were those who were in the DutchBat
         10  Compound.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, I'm going to ask
         12  that Prosecutor's Exhibit 75 be played.  It's a film
         13  clip that lasts approximately three minutes.
         14       Q.   Colonel, you have seen this film clip
         15  before.  You are in this film clip.  And I'd like you
         16  to take a look at this film clip and then you can
         17  discuss with the Court your observations about it.
         18            MR. HARMON:  So if we could please play
         19  Prosecutor's Exhibit 75.
         20                 [Videotape played]
         21            MR. HARMON:
         22       Q.   Is that you, Colonel?
         23       A.   That's me.
         24       Q.   Are these the abandoned belongings, Colonel?
         25       A.   Your Honour, these are the belongings which

          1  were abandoned by the men.
          2       Q.   The man in the blue vest, is that a Serb or a
          3  Dutchman?
          4       A.   That is a Serb soldier.
          5       Q.   Are these abandoned belongings as well?
          6       A.   Yes, these are some of the belongings which
          7  were abandoned there.
          8       Q.   One last question about the man who you just
          9  identified as a Serb soldier.  He was wearing a blue
         10  vest.  Was that -- what kind of vest was that?
         11       A.   This was a vest that we used to wear when we
         12  were there.  It was bullet-proof.  I don't you know
         13  what we can -- you know, some of them were not actually
         14  bullet-proof, but they were to protect our bodies, that
         15  is, the chest, from many small arms.  And I'm sure it
         16  had been stolen from some of the Dutch soldiers.
         17       Q.   Can you explain to the Judges that particular
         18  part of the film clip that they have just seen?
         19       A.   That particular part was when I noticed the
         20  separation, that is, when the men who were being
         21  removed from the group and being taken to the White
         22  House, and I decided to ask for permission -- I mean,
         23  decided to be taken there.  I decided to request to be
         24  taken to that White House to see what is going on.  So
         25  in fact I was talking to the Serb soldiers who were

          1  there, to take me up there to see what exactly was
          2  going on, to prove to them that something was really
          3  wrong inside there.  Anyway, I was not allowed to go
          4  there.
          5            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, I know you had
          6  indicated 2.15 would be an appropriate time to break,
          7  and I therefore would suggest we conclude at this point
          8  so we can hear the motions and deal with the motions
          9  that have been raised by counsel.
         10            Colonel, thank you very much.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         12  you have not finished the examination-in-chief of this
         13  witness, I assume.
         14            MR. HARMON:  I have about 10 more minutes,
         15  Mr. President.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         17  then.
         18            Colonel Kingori, we have to finish with your
         19  testimony for today.  You will have to come back on
         20  Monday at 9.30.  I hope you will have a possibility to
         21  enjoy a nice weekend in The Hague.  Have a nice
         22  weekend, and we'll see you again on Monday.
         23            THE WITNESS:  Thank you very much, Your
         24  Honour.
         25                 [The witness stands down]
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
          2  I think it was your turn, actually.  We have heard the
          3  Defence, we have heard their applications, and we were
          4  about to hear your response to the said applications.
          5  So I will give you the floor so that we can hear your
          6  position on the two applications that have been made by
          7  the Defence.  Maybe you have also some other
          8  information that you can provide to us.  Maybe some
          9  discussion has taken place in the meantime.  Let us
         10  hear you.
         11            MR. HARMON:  There has been some discussion
         12  that has taken place.
         13            In respect of the first application made by
         14  the Defence, I understand that application to be that,
         15  one, as a matter of principle, the Defence is
         16  interested in obtaining additional time in order to
         17  permit them to investigate in the event that there is
         18  new material testified to by a witness that is not
         19  contained in a statement that has been provided to the
         20  Defence pursuant to the normal discovery rules.  And
         21  the second part of their request is to permit the
         22  Defence to call back certain witnesses under those
         23  circumstances so that the Defence can question those
         24  witnesses about the new information after a proper
         25  investigation has been completed by the Defence.

          1            In respect of that motion, we have no
          2  objection to it in principle.  We believe, however,
          3  Mr. President, that there should be an application made
          4  by the Defence on a case-by-case basis when the Defence
          5  deems that those certain circumstances have arisen.
          6  It's also our position that the showing that would be
          7  required by the Defence in order to either gain
          8  additional time for an investigation, or calling the
          9  witness back, would be, one, a demonstration that the
         10  material that needs to be investigated and was not
         11  provided previously is material to the Defence, and
         12  that after a showing of materiality, then the parties
         13  would have an opportunity to make their comments to the
         14  Court and the Court could then decide.  But one
         15  additional condition, in our view, would be if the
         16  Defence already has this material and has been provided
         17  the material, and is not about information that's new
         18  and not contained in the statement, then there would be
         19  no opportunity to call back the witness.
         20  Cross-examination is the proper time to inquire about
         21  information that's contained in the statements.  So to
         22  reiterate, if it's new information and it's material,
         23  we would urge the Court to consider it on a
         24  case-by-case basis and permit both sides to address the
         25  Court before rendering a decision.

          1            So in principle, on those conditions, we have
          2  no objection.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          4  Mr. Visnjic, do you wish to add something?
          5            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          6  I should like to make one thing clear.  I think there
          7  is one slight difference between our two positions.  We
          8  requested the same treatment, both in respect of the
          9  events that were not stated in witness statements, as
         10  well as for the witness statements that we received
         11  prior to the trial, and after the trial began.  We
         12  requested the same treatment for both statements.  This
         13  goes to the quality of the evidence that has been
         14  disclosed.
         15            As regards this other condition, the
         16  condition of a showing, of the necessity to make a good
         17  showing, showing of materiality, I think that this is
         18  contained in our material.  I believe that we are quite
         19  clear in respect of that.
         20            Let me just try to broaden the point a little
         21  bit.  We are requesting the same treatment in respect
         22  of events that were not contained in witness
         23  statements, as well as the events that are contained in
         24  witness statements, but the statements that have been
         25  received shortly prior to the beginning of the trial,

          1  or after the trial began.  And we have to bear in mind,
          2  of course, both versions in English and in
          3  Serbo-Croatian language as provided by Rule 66.  Thank
          4  you.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          6  very much, Mr. Visnjic.  We will examine your
          7  application together with the response made here during
          8  the discussion, and I believe that the Chamber will
          9  soon be able to make its ruling, perhaps on Monday, but
         10  probably not at the beginning of the session.  I'm
         11  telling you this because I myself cannot be present on
         12  Tuesday.  So Judge Riad and Judge Wald will be sitting
         13  on Tuesday, and the session will be presided by
         14  Judge Riad.
         15            In view of that, I think that we have to try
         16  and make a ruling on Monday.  And I don't forget that
         17  we have another ruling pending, which hasn't been made
         18  yet, because it has to be made by the full Chamber,
         19  which was not the case this week because the absence of
         20  Judge Patricia Wald.  We have to wait for her and we
         21  will make both rulings next week.
         22            I hope that for the time being this is all,
         23  but I should perhaps tell you, I do not have my
         24  schedule here, but as regards the programme of the
         25  Chamber, we're trying really hard to establish, to the

          1  extent it is possible, a calendar until the end of the
          2  year, including, of course, the months of July, August,
          3  September, and up until the end of the year.  We will
          4  probably have a recess.  I think it will be -- anyway,
          5  I will provide you with specific information when I
          6  have it.
          7            However, as regards the following months, we
          8  will continue hearing this case until the week which
          9  begins on the 1st of May.  We have already talked about
         10  it.  After that, after that week, we will give you
         11  enough time to revise your work, to prepare your work,
         12  because we will be sitting in another case for at least
         13  three weeks in a row.
         14            I'm telling you this so that both parties can
         15  organise themselves, but I hope that on Monday I will
         16  be in a position to give you more precise information,
         17  even in respect of the latter half of the year.
         18            However, one must bear in mind that this is a
         19  provisional schedule.  The organisation in itself is
         20  not an objective of work, it is simply a means of our
         21  work.  It can be changed, it may be changed if it is
         22  necessary to do so.  There are a number of things that
         23  cannot be foreseen, and we have to leave enough space,
         24  enough time to organise matters accordingly.
         25            I see that Mr. Harmon would like to say

          1  something.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  Thank you.  I didn't
          3  address yet, Mr. President, the second part of the
          4  motion that was made by the Defence, which was an
          5  application for more time because of what was, in fact,
          6  an omission in the B/C/S version of the amended
          7  indictment, and I think the record should contain or
          8  refer to the certificate and the nature of the error
          9  that was presented and which limited the Defence, my
         10  colleagues from the Defence, in understanding the full
         11  extent of the indictment, because as I understand it,
         12  and I have a copy of the certificate from the
         13  registrar, on the French and the English version, in
         14  paragraph 24, the word at the end of the sentence of
         15  paragraph 24, the word "included" was present, but in
         16  the B/C/S version of the amended indictment that was
         17  made available to my colleagues, the word "included"
         18  was omitted, and it is based on that omission that the
         19  Defence is requesting, as I understand their request,
         20  additional time to investigate three locations that
         21  have been testified about by Mr. Ruez, the first being
         22  Nova Kasaba; the second, Konjevic Polje; and the third,
         23  the Jadar River, the Defence believing that the list on
         24  the indictment that they received was an exclusive
         25  list, and in the French and English languages, the

          1  authoritative languages of that Tribunal, it was
          2  broader than that.
          3            Now, I'd like to make clear for the record,
          4  as we already argued this motion or a related motion to
          5  this, and I won't belabour the point, but the facts
          6  that underlined each of these three locations had been
          7  provided to the Defence.  There were aerial images that
          8  were made under Rule 70(B) to the Defence.
          9            What the Defence did not see in our
         10  presentation, in Mr. Ruez's presentation, are a total
         11  of 12 photographs that are found in Prosecutor's
         12  Exhibit 13/1, 13/2, 14/5 through 8, 14/11, 17/2, 17/3,
         13  and 18/1.  Those photographs obviously the Defence
         14  could have seen had they made an application for
         15  reciprocal discovery under Rule 66(B), but all the
         16  information they were entitled to see prior to the
         17  commencement of this trial on these particular areas
         18  they did see, and they did see that in a timely
         19  fashion.
         20            Having said that, Mr. President, if the Court
         21  deems it appropriate that because of the translation
         22  error additional time is required for my colleagues to
         23  investigate those areas, we certainly would not oppose
         24  any decision by this Chamber to allot them additional
         25  time, but I think the record has to be clear about the

          1  facts that we have made available to them prior to this
          2  unfortunate omission.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          4  very much, Mr. Harmon.  You may be seated.
          5            Let me just remind you that the Chamber has
          6  already made a ruling in this matter.  It was one of
          7  our rulings.  I do not want to insist, but I just want
          8  to remind you that we do not work on an authoritative
          9  basis, and as soon as parties have their reasons for a
         10  particular motion, we can always try and revise our
         11  schedules.  We're not slaves of an organisation or a
         12  calendar.
         13            I understand that the Defence needs some
         14  additional time to prepare itself.  As soon as reasons
         15  can be explained and justified, the Chamber can
         16  exercise its authority in an appropriate matter.
         17            Thank you very much, Mr. Harmon, for
         18  reminding us of this problem, but as regards the
         19  specific issues of the inclusion of the three
         20  locations, Nova Kasaba, Zeleni Jadar, and Konjevic
         21  Polje, the Chamber has already made a ruling.
         22            We will, of course, take into account what
         23  has been said here.  We, in general, are mindful of the
         24  needs of the parties in respect of their respective
         25  preparations, and we will make another ruling in

          1  respect of that next week.
          2            All I can do at the end of this day is to
          3  wish you a nice weekend.  Have a nice weekend,
          4  therefore, and we'll see you again on Monday, 9.30.
          5                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
          6                 at 2.32 p.m., to be reconvened on
          7                 Monday, the 3rd day of April, 2000,
