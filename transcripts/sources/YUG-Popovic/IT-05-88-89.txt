 3                          [The witness entered court]
 4                          --- Upon commencing at 9.22 a.m.
 5                          [The accused entered court]
 6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good morning, ladies and
 7    gentlemen.  Good morning to the technical booth and interpreters.  Good
 8    morning to the Office of the Prosecutor; I see that you're all there.  The
 9    Defence counsel and the Judges are here, too.
10            Good morning, Professor.  Good morning, Witness.  We shall be
11    taking up your testimony where we left off.  Let me remind you that you
12    will be continuing under oath in answering questions put to you by
13    Mr. Visnjic.
14            Please proceed, Mr. Visnjic.  Your witness.
15            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
16                          WITNESS:  RADOVAN RADINOVIC [Resumed]
17                          [Witness answered through interpreter]
18                          Examined by Mr. Visnjic: [Continued]
19       Q.   [Interpretation] General Radinovic, we're going to continue from
20    where we left off.
21            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] And to do that, I should like to ask
22    the usher to give us Defence Exhibit 426, and to prepare documents -- 425,
23    and to prepare documents 426 and 427.  So the next exhibit is Exhibit 425.
24            Could the usher turn to page -- to paragraph 4, which is page 6 on
25    the Serbo-Croatian version.

 1       Q.   General Radinovic, yesterday you talked to us about a large number
 2    of operations which are mentioned in the directives and many of which were
 3    not actually implemented.  On the basis of this decision of the Supreme
 4    Commander, can you -- of the army of Republika Srpska, can you explain to
 5    the Trial Chamber what this -- how this applies to document 7?
 6       A.   In point 4, according to doctrine, this conceptual part, the
 7    concept of a decision, and as I said, in point 4 in the documents for
 8    command, the basic idea or concept is set out by -- that is to say, the
 9    command document sets this out.
10            In paragraph 4 of the directive of the Supreme Commander, the
11    operations to be carried out are implemented -- are noted, and they are in
12    this section here.  They are set out in this paragraph here.  They mention
13    the strategic operation in 1995, Prozor, Spreca, and so on.  That is an
14    operation at the operational level.  But none of those operations listed
15    here were carried out.  They were not planned, and they were not executed.
16       Q.   I should now like to ask you to look at page 8 of the directive,
17    the section which refers to the Drina Corps.  Have you found it?  That is
18    the English version.
19            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could the usher please find that
20    part of the document and place it on the ELMO.  It is page 10 of the
21    English version, and page 11 as well later on.  Page 10 now and page 11
22    later.
23       A.   Yes, I've found it.  This section relating to the Drina Corps --
24            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could you turn the page over,
25    please.

 1       A.   On the following page within the directive which relates to the
 2    Drina Corps, we see all the points that -- that is to say, operations that
 3    could come under that Corps and operations such as Spreca, Zvijezda 95,
 4    Spreca 95 are mentioned.  None of those operations were in fact planned or
 5    executed.
 6            As I said yesterday, in documents of this kind which provide a
 7    conceptual plan and indicate the possible activities in the ensuing period
 8    or in the coming year, and they therefore provide an analysis of the
 9    strategic situation, they assess the intentions of the two parties -- of
10    the parties, and they set out a sort of reliable forecasting, as far as
11    that is possible, for the coming year.
12            Having set out -- having drafted documents of principle of this
13    kind, the Supreme Command in stages, in a concrete -- for a concrete
14    period of time, in keeping with the conditions prevailing on the theatre
15    of operation, they order the execution of individual operations.  That
16    comes later.  And as I studied the documents for the Krivaja 95 operation,
17    I have become convinced that Krivaja 95 was not founded upon documents of
18    this kind; that is to say, it was not -- it did not directly emerge from
19    these documents.  Of course, this directive was conceived in such a way
20    and devised in such a way to be an overall framework for most of the
21    activities taking place in the theatre of operation, and that is why it is
22    not a concrete document and cannot be a direct operative link to Operation
23    Krivaja 95.  And when I myself tried to find an answer to the question of
24    what was the basis and foundation for the execution of that particular
25    operation -- because, of course, the Corps Commander cannot decide himself

 1    to plan an operation.  Operations must be tied into a uniform, strategic
 2    system on the battleground under the control of the Supreme Command, which
 3    means the civilian and state political powers that be.
 4            In the preamble to this directive, we -- that is to say, in the
 5    preamble of the order of the Drina Corps commander for active action,
 6    there is a sentence which might lead us to an answer to this question,
 7    that is to say, what served as the basis and foundation and groundwork for
 8    the execution of this particular operation, and I hope we'll come to that
 9    in due course.  But I think that it is quite certain that the operation
10    was executed on the basis of the concrete situation, the prevailing
11    situation at that time, and the concrete situation related to the Drina
12    Corps was that the -- where the activities of the Muslim forces from the
13    enclaves within the framework of the sabotage operation named Skakavac or
14    Grasshopper.
15            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Would the usher now place on the
16    ELMO Exhibit -- Prosecution Exhibit 426.  We need page 3.
17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I just have an additional document
18    here, not the main one.  I just have the attachment to the basic
19    document.  I haven't got the basic document, if it is directive 7/1 that
20    we're talking about.
21            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
22       Q.   The exhibit number was 426.  It is directive 7/1, issued by the
23    Main Staff of the VRS.  I haven't got a copy myself now, but could you
24    find the section which refers to the Drina Corps.  I think it is on page 3
25    or 4.

 1       A.   It is page 3.4, which relates to the conceptual part and where the
 2    Supreme Command decides what actions should be taken.
 3       Q.   Could you wait for it to be placed on the ELMO, please.  Thank
 4    you.
 5       A.   In this point, point 4, for the Drina Corps, it is expressly --
 6    the following is expressly stated:  The forces of the East Bosnian Corps
 7    and the Drina Corps, with reinforcements from the Herzegovina and
 8    Sarajevo-Romanija Corps - and I stress - should, as soon as possible,
 9    realise the tasks from the Spreca operation, Operation Spreca 95, cut off
10    and destroy enemy forces east of the Vis-Stolica line, and in this way
11    create conditions for continuing the attack towards Tuzla and Zivinice,
12    that is to say, completely outside the zone of responsibility and any of
13    the enclaves.  It is that point up there, north-west of Zvornik.
14            So there's no mention made at all in this directive, in directive
15    7/1, which should be the concretisation of the directive from the Supreme
16    Commander, and with tasks specified, and the tasks that should be
17    considered operative.  However, as we see in this directive, there is
18    nothing at all which could lead us to the Krivaja 95 operation.
19       Q.   Could you now look at a separate paragraph which relates to the
20    Drina Corps itself.
21       A.   We come to the tasks of the units and the Drina Corps, one of
22    them.  It is point 5.3, paragraph 5.3.  And it is the task of the Drina
23    Corps under paragraph 5.3 to defend and exert active combat activity in
24    the north-western part of the battlefield and to prevent the breakthrough
25    of the enemy on the tactical axes, and demonstratively and with the

 1    application of measures, operative measures, that is to say, active forms,
 2    to link up forces.  And this is defence, not offence; a defensive action
 3    and not an offensive action.
 4            And with the IBK or East Bosnian Corps to realise the tasks from
 5    the Spreca 95 operation as soon as possible.  And this is not an operation
 6    that I know of.  It was never executed, nor do we know what it applied to,
 7    what it actually meant.  Perhaps those who -- I'm sure that those who
 8    devised this did know, but I myself did not learn what this meant because
 9    the operation was not planned and not executed.
10            So in the first stage of that operation, the aim was to break
11    through to the Vis-Kalesija line, that is, towards Tuzla, and then to
12    regroup forces.  And then in the second and third phases of the operation
13    by an appropriate manoeuvre, infiltrating strong groups into the enemy
14    rear and introducing strong-armoured mechanised forces to execute an
15    attack in the direction of Kalesija-Tuzla, that is to say, quite outside
16    the context in which Operation Krivaja 95 was positioned and everything
17    that occurred in the zone of responsibility of the Drina Corps from the
18    beginning of July up until the end.
19       Q.   General Radinovic, in the previous document, directive 7, there is
20    a sentence which mentions -- which makes mention of the enclaves.  It is
21    the portion where the Drina Corps comes.  However, in directive 7/1, in
22    the portion which relates to the Drina Corps, the enclaves are no longer
23    mentioned.
24            Bearing in mind the relationship of the directives, and you said
25    that 7/1 should be an elaboration of directive 7, how do you explain that?

 1       A.   Well, I explain that in -- I have several explanations.  First,
 2    what I stressed yesterday when I was talking about the organisational
 3    structure of the VRS and about Supreme Command and commanding, and if you
 4    recall, I said yesterday that the positioning of the Main Staff as a
 5    parallel Supreme Command by giving it command responsibility - not staff
 6    and professional responsibility which is the practice in all armies of the
 7    world - this in a certain sense and in a certain way and under certain
 8    conditions and in certain situations can give birth to certain forms of
 9    dual authority and parallel Supreme Command.  For example, these two
10    directives clearly bear that out.  They clearly confirm that.
11            So, and let's see how it reflects on the Drina Corps, the most
12    important thing for the operative situation in the zone of responsibility
13    of the Drina Corps is the conduct of the armed forces of the BiH army in
14    the enclaves and their activity vis-a-vis the VRS.  In directive number 7
15    issued by the Supreme Commander, that is to say, the president of the
16    Republika Srpska, there is one sentence which refers to the enclaves.  Of
17    course, I would not have written it.  I would not have written it, and I
18    do not think that he should have written it either.  But there is not a
19    single letter in directive 7/1 referring to that sentence, the sentence
20    which referred to the Drina Corps.  Therefore, the commander of the Main
21    Staff of the VRS and the military system considered that there is -- that
22    they were not -- that the realisation of this idea contained in that
23    sentence need not be realised, and in directive 7/1 that sentence, indeed,
24    does not exist.  It is not there.  I personally as an officer am very
25    pleased to see that that sentence does not exist here.

 1            Second, and this is another important point, the directive of the
 2    president, or rather, the Supreme Commander of the civilian head of state
 3    is a more generalised directive, and the directive of a -- of the Main
 4    Staff commander must be more precise with respect to the subordinates who
 5    are to carry it out.  And this directive issued by the commander of the
 6    Main Staff, directive 7/1, is indeed shorter.  It is an abridged version,
 7    a more concise, precise version, without the descriptions that exist in
 8    the previous one.  There is no assessment and analysis, but goes straight
 9    to the essential points, points which could be essential.
10            Therefore, if we want to take the order of realisation in turn,
11    the commander of the Drina Corps realises the tasks sent to him by the
12    commander of the Main Staff.  The commander of the Main Staff is
13    responsible to the Supreme Commander for his own conduct and for the
14    conduct of his army.  And when we spoke about at the very beginning of my
15    testimony yesterday of how orders are carried out, then we said that they
16    are not -- orders are not carried out which imply a violation of law or
17    violation of the principles of humanitarian law, and the commander of the
18    Main Staff in his own directive did not take over a text which could imply
19    that kind of behaviour.
20       Q.   General Radinovic, how long -- how much time is necessary for an
21    operation to be well planned and organised?
22            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] And I should like to ask the usher
23    to prepare Prosecution Exhibit 427 in the meantime.
24       A.   In answer to that question, I can say the following, that is to
25    say, I would say the same thing that General Dannatt said in his expert

 1    report, and I completely agree that for this level of operation, for an
 2    operation of this level, it is -- 72 hours would be quite sufficient for
 3    its planning.
 4            According to our standards, the time given for timely preparation
 5    and all-around -- for preparing an operation well is three to five days,
 6    depending on whether the command system is in charge of the situation, is
 7    in control of the situation in the area where the operation is to take
 8    place, or whether you are planning to send forces to a terrain which is
 9    not well known to you, and where you have an operational situation which
10    is not well known.  And this occurs in in-depth manoeuvres when the
11    activities are to take place outside the zone of responsibility.
12            In this concrete case, we're talking about the zone of
13    responsibility which the command system of the Drina Corps is well
14    acquainted with.  I would say that it is quite enough to have three to
15    five days for the preparation of that kind of operation.
16       Q.   General Radinovic, you have before you Prosecution Exhibit 427.
17    It is a preparatory order number one dated the 2nd of July, 1995.  In the
18    context of the time necessary for planning, which is otherwise stated in
19    the last paragraph of this order, how can you comment, the time which was
20    spent for the planning and preparation of Operation Krivaja 95?
21       A.   In the last paragraph of this document, the last point on page 2,
22    and that's this here, this last paragraph, the commander of the Corps
23    orders that all the forthcoming activities with regard to the planning of
24    combat activities in all variations, and the drawing up of all necessary
25    combat documents be completed by the 3rd of July, 1995, and the documents

 1    to be delivered to the units performing active operations should be done
 2    only following his orders.
 3            If we go back to page 1 of this document, when the document was
 4    dated, that is to say, in the upper left-hand corner, the date is the 2nd
 5    of July, 1995.  That means that for all the preparations necessary and
 6    planning necessary for the organisation necessary, bringing in the units,
 7    reconnaissance work, and so on and so forth, that was -- only one day was
 8    allowed by the Corps Commander for all that to be done.
 9            It is my personal view that that is an extremely short space of
10    time and insufficient for any serious planning of the operation to be done
11    within it.  So that I myself would say that this operation, Operation
12    Krivaja 95, with only that fact, bearing that fact in mind, I would rank
13    it among the groups -- that is to say, with the groups of operations which
14    are speedily, hastily prepared, and they hasty -- extorted, if I can use
15    that term, operation.  And you know that anything done in haste is not
16    done very well, and you can -- there can be many things that are not
17    well-thought out in the haste given.
18            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] May the witness now be given
19    Prosecution Exhibit 428 to look at.
20       Q.   General Radinovic, what are the objectives of the Operation
21    Krivaja 95, that is, the objective of the order for combat action?
22       A.   I'm sorry, I don't have the document.
23       Q.   Let us wait for the document, then.
24       A.   Yes.  May I?  On page 2, this is the B/C/S version, in paragraph
25    4, we have the same conceptual part of the decision, that is, the concept

 1    which was made by the commander whereby he decided to use the main force,
 2    and I stress that, the main force of the Drina Corps, that they should
 3    continue a resolute and active defence, and only to separate the enclaves
 4    of Zepa/Srebrenica with the part of the free forces.  So there is no
 5    mention of that in the conceptual part of the decision.  No mention is
 6    made of the takeover of Srebrenica in the conceptual part.
 7            Operations have their stages, according to the military doctrine,
 8    and tactical activities have immediate and long-term tasks, long-term
 9    tasks not having to be necessarily completed.  So the immediate task was
10    to reach out the line, which I will have to indicate on the map if that
11    hasn't been indicated so far in the proceedings.
12       Q.   I believe it has.  The Chamber is familiar with the geography.
13       A.   So the line in question was Predol, Divljakinja, Banja Guber,
14    Zivkovo Brdo, Alibegovac, Kak.  So that was the immediate task.  And the
15    next task was to reach the line going along Bojna and Siljato Brdo.
16            So no mention is made in this part, which refers to the objectives
17    of the operation by the Drina Corps commander, of the attack on the town
18    itself.  What is stated here is that they should reach certain features,
19    certain lines, which will, militarily speaking, deactivate the enclave and
20    which will enable them to prevent all military activities which were being
21    launched from the Muslim army from the enclave of Srebrenica throughout
22    the period when the area functioned as a protected area, which was
23    especially -- which became especially obvious during the Grasshopper
24    operation.
25            The objective is further on articulated in paragraph 3, where it

 1    is stated as follows:  "By a surprise attack, to separate and reduce in
 2    size the Srebrenica and Zepa enclaves."  That is, not to take them over
 3    but to reduce them in size.  And further on:  "To improve the tactical
 4    position of the forces in the depth of the area and to create conditions
 5    for the elimination of the enclaves."
 6            I should like to comment on this portion of the text, if I may.
 7    The very fact that the task was to reach and to take control of the
 8    features stated in this portion of the order, so by this fact the
 9    commander enabled -- wanted to enable strategical and tactical conditions
10    for the elimination of the enclaves, in military terms, if that should
11    become necessary.  However, the sentence that is stated here, that you can
12    read here, cannot be interpreted as an attack on urban areas of the town.
13    It merely refers to the creation of appropriate conditions to eliminate
14    the enclaves should the development of the military situation require so.
15    In this manner, the scope of the Operation Krivaja 95 is finished; that
16    is, the objective of the operation is accomplished once those features are
17    taken possession of.
18            There are other elements of the order here but which are not
19    particularly relevant for our case here.
20       Q.   So we have talked about the main concept and the plan for the
21    Krivaja 95 operation.
22            General, let me ask my question.  I would like to know which
23    planning documents, which supporting documents you came across during your
24    studies, during your analysis.
25       A.   Well, I found this planning document which is called the

 1    preparatory order for combat activities.  This is something very common
 2    when one should move over to the following stage.  If the stage involving
 3    active operations should be started, then this document of this kind is
 4    drafted, and this is what I had.  And I also had the order of the Corps
 5    Commander for active combat and certain elements of the plan for
 6    communications support.  I didn't have the actual plan for communications
 7    which would indicate the communications between the command post and other
 8    participants in the overall command and control of the operation.  I just
 9    had access to certain planning documents concerning radio links.  So those
10    are two documents which I had access to.
11            There is a whole range of documents which are lacking.  For
12    example, there is no plan for -- explicit plan for artillery support, for
13    logistics support, for quartermaster support, and so on and so forth.
14       Q.   What can you -- what is the conclusion that you can make on the
15    basis of that?
16       A.   Well, this is the consequence of the fact, which is beyond dispute
17    for me, that this operation was extorted by the Grasshopper operation, so
18    an operation which was not a result of a long-term planning but an
19    operation which was an immediate response to the situation and the
20    developments that were taking place in the spring of 1995, and that is why
21    they were allocated only one day for planning that operation.  So they
22    were not able to make a quality overall plan for the operation,
23    which -- the fact which must have affected the operation itself.
24       Q.   Bearing in mind what we have discussed so far, could you tell us
25    what were the specific events that actually provoked, that entailed the

 1    planning of the Krivaja 95 operation.
 2       A.   I believe I have already answered that question in part when I
 3    said that the events were numerous, the events that were taking place
 4    during the last ten days of the month of June; namely, the terrorist
 5    activities and the incursions of Muslim forces into the rear of the VRS, a
 6    huge amount of losses inflicted to the VRS, according to the documents and
 7    testimonies from the Muslim side.  On the 15th and the 16th of June, for
 8    example, a whole brigade was infiltrated into the rear of the 1st Podrinje
 9    Brigade, which resulted in the killing of 40 troops.
10            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could the usher please prepare D67
11    for the witness, please.
12       A.   May I continue, please?
13       Q.   Please do, General.
14       A.   So if you link that with the events which were taking place in the
15    immediate vicinity of the enclave of Srebrenica, and from the enclave of
16    Srebrenica, one can conclude that the Operation Krivaja 95 was planned as
17    a response to such events and that the objective was to prevent such
18    incidents from reoccurring.
19            In this document here we can see a report of the commander of the
20    28th Division, which was addressed to the commander of the 2nd Corps.  The
21    report was written on the 30th of June, 1995.  In this report the
22    commander of the 28th Division is informing his commander of the
23    activities of his units and formations in the immediate vicinity, that is,
24    in the rear of the Serbian positions around the enclave.
25       Q.   General Radinovic, the Trial Chamber is familiar with the contents

 1    of this document because it was entered into evidence some time ago.  My
 2    question in relation to this document would be as follows:  In this
 3    document, in a document like this, D67, can we find a brief overview of
 4    all of the activities of the 28th Division outside the boundaries of the
 5    protected areas of Srebrenica and Zepa?
 6       A.   Yes.  This is precisely such a document.  It speaks about that.
 7       Q.   I should now like you to link this document with the orders, if
 8    you can remember, issued by the VRS, and which we discussed yesterday, D88
 9    and D153, orders of the Drina Corps, signed by General Zivanovic,
10    concerning the inspection of troops and the order issued to the Milici
11    Brigade, and so on and so forth.
12       A.   Yes, I remember that document.  In his order, to achieve better
13    quality control over the area, General Zivanovic orders visits of all of
14    the units and he orders the responsible individuals to report to them by
15    the 25th of June.  In his document he makes mention of an incident
16    involving an incursion of the brigade, of a Muslim brigade, into the rear
17    of the 1st Podrinje and the 5th Podrinje Brigade.  And he requests his
18    commanders to carry out an inspection of their troops, inspection of the
19    positions, and to see if the line is properly fortified and so on, and to
20    report to him about such visits by the 25th of June.  And indeed, he was
21    briefed about what has been accomplished to that effect by the 24th of
22    June, by one of his commanders, and the same was probably done by other
23    commanders, but that was the kind of report that I had access to.
24       Q.   During -- while you were preparing your analysis, did you come
25    across any indications that active combat operations were being prepared

 1    by the end of June 1995 concerning the enclave of Srebrenica?  Was there
 2    any mention made, any indications, any documents, any signs which would
 3    indicate that such activities were undergoing preparations by the VRS,
 4    that is, the preparation of offensive combat activities prior to the 1st
 5    of July, 1995?
 6       A.   You should bear in mind one particular fact which is of the
 7    essence for every single army in the world.  Every army, by definition,
 8    are in the best state of preparation when they carry out offensive
 9    activities.  Nobody likes defensive activities, because it implies
10    relinquishing the initiative to the enemy, and this does not -- nobody
11    likes that.
12            But I must say that I haven't come across any single piece of
13    evidence, any single indication, neither in the documents nor through the
14    conversations with the people who were involved in one way or the other in
15    this operation, which would indicate that by the end of June 1995, anybody
16    had any thoughts about executing such an operation.  There were no
17    conditions whatsoever to launch an operation of that kind.  The situation
18    at the front line was very difficult, and especially in the area of
19    responsibility of the Drina Corps.  So there was no talk whatsoever about
20    the possibility of launching such an offensive.
21            JUDGE RIAD:  General, you just -- if I understood rightly, you
22    said there was no way, neither in the documents, there was nothing
23    indicated -- I'm sorry, I want to read it, that by the end of June 1993 --
24    1995, anybody had any thoughts about executing an operation of that kind
25    by one -- from one way or -- with the people who were involved in one way

 1    or the other.  "Involved in one way or the other," do you mean the two,
 2    the two fighting sides?  You mean the VRS and the Muslims, one way or the
 3    other, people involved in one way or the other?  Who are they?
 4       A.   I'm afraid I have been misinterpreted.  My response was to the
 5    question whether throughout my preparations for this testimony and while I
 6    was studying this matter, whether I had come across any indication to the
 7    effect that the VRS, that is, the Drina Corps, was preparing an offensive
 8    operation around the enclaves.  That was the question that I was
 9    responding to.  And I said, that was part of my answer, that the nature of
10    every army is to be offensive, not to wait, because armies like to have
11    initiative.  Soldiers do not like defensive approach.  However, in the
12    month of June, 1995, the VRS was in a defensive position, and I didn't
13    come across any single document which would indicate that offensive combat
14    activities were being prepared.
15            Second, I said that neither in the conversations with people who
16    were involved in the operation did I come across such indication.  And
17    yesterday I told you that I had spoken with the people who had been
18    involved in the operation on the Serb side, unfortunately.  I did not have
19    an opportunity to discuss it with the people who were involved in the
20    operation on the other side, but that was not possible, unfortunately.  So
21    from the conversations with those individuals I made a very firm
22    conclusion that there was no talk at the time about launching an operation
23    of that kind.
24            So that was the essence of my answer.  I don't know whether it has
25    come across this time.

 1            JUDGE RIAD:  So you're speaking only of the -- you're speaking
 2    only of the VRS when you say one people --
 3       A.   Yes.
 4            JUDGE RIAD:  -- involved [Realtime transcript read in error
 5    "going"] in one way or the other, only of the VRS?  Thank you.
 6       A.   Yes.
 7            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
 8       Q.   General Radinovic, I don't know whether you have exhibit number
 9    P428, the order for combat activities.
10            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me, I want to correct the transcript of what I
11    said.  I didn't say "going" one way or the other; I said, "people involved
12    in one way or the other."  Thank you.
13            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
14       Q.   General, in the order for active combat activities, a provision
15    was made for a forward command post?
16       A.   If you will allow me before you proceed with your question,
17    because I didn't fully answer your previous question regarding objectives.
18            In paragraph 5 of the order issued by the commander when setting
19    out the objectives, he said the objective of the units which -- involving
20    the separation of the enclaves and the shrinking of the territory of the
21    enclaves.  So you have this specific mention made in the title, that is,
22    the reduction, to reduce the territory, to reduce them in size.  So that
23    is something that should be taken into account while assessing the
24    objectives of the operation.
25       Q.   Mention is made of the forward command post at Pribicevac in this

 1    order.  What is the customary role of a forward command post in the
 2    execution of an operation?  How do you divide them?  How do you take
 3    possession of them?  What kind of protection do they require?
 4       A.   Command posts refer both to the actual space, the actual location,
 5    and the facility from which command and control is executed over the units
 6    involved in combat operations.  These facilities include facilities for
 7    work, for rest and recuperation, and some support buildings, as well as
 8    facilities intended to provide protection for the command post.
 9            Command posts can be divided into the basic command post, the rear
10    command post, the forward command post, and reserve command posts.  The
11    command post in itself is the most developed one in the sense of the
12    quality of the facilities that it has.  It has to be on such a location in
13    terms of space and have such conditions to be able to provide quality and
14    relatively comfortable conditions for work of the command on the execution
15    of their tasks.  So that is the basic idea of a command post.
16            In order to accomplish that task, groups of commanding officers
17    are assigned to a specific command post.  We have the command group, the
18    support group, and then the protection unit, and other necessary elements.
19    Of course, the command group is the most important one.  It also includes
20    the operational part, that is, the operation room, where all the necessary
21    information is being gathered and collated, where the creative part of the
22    operation is taking place, where necessary supporting orders are being
23    drafted, and all other activities undertaken that have to ensure a good
24    execution of an operation.
25            We have the commander there, assistant commander for intelligence,

 1    for security, and the Chief of Staff of course, and the basic staff which
 2    provide relevant assistance to the commander.  And we also have service
 3    chiefs, and there has to be someone from the logistics branch as part of
 4    the command group as well.
 5            As regards the rear command post, it is used for the purposes of
 6    conducting logistical work, logistical support, and forward [as
 7    interpreted] command posts are determined -- are realised when one cannot
 8    conduct military operations from the basic command post.  So it should be
 9    situated on an appropriate location from where one can have adequate
10    insight into what is going on in the field and from which adequate
11    communication with the units in the field can be ensured, in a timely
12    fashion, of course.
13            As regards the Drina Corps in particular, and VRS corps in
14    general, we have something that is perhaps contrary to some basic
15    doctrinary principles when it comes to command posts; that is to say,
16    corps have their appropriate areas of responsibility.  In their areas of
17    responsibility they have their headquarters, the corps headquarters, where
18    the command is located.  In the case of the Drina Corps, this was in
19    Vlasenica.
20            When it comes to the communicational aspect of command, the Drina
21    Corps designated Vlasenica as its command post, which would mean that that
22    was their basic command post.  However, the basic command post is always
23    determined for operations.  However, there are peacetime command posts,
24    and there are also command posts where commands are relocated in cases of
25    combat activities.

 1            In this case, the location was renamed a basic command post, that
 2    is, the location in Vlasenica was the basic command post for the Drina
 3    Corps.  So this was somehow contrary to the military doctrine, but the
 4    reason for that was the fact that the Drina Corps had a relatively
 5    permanent area of responsibility, and it was possible to ensure proper
 6    functioning of basic command and functions from the headquarters in
 7    Vlasenica.
 8            The Corps command availed themselves of the possibility of
 9    creating forward command posts for certain military activities, and it did
10    so in the case of the Operation Srebrenica when they relocated their
11    command post at Pribicevac, and also in the case of Zepa where they had
12    their forward command post in the place called Krivace.
13            The Corps Commander goes to the forward command post together with
14    his Chief of Staff and the necessary number of staff officers who have to
15    be there, who are required to be there.  There are no very strict
16    regulations for that; however, there is a very strict requirement that the
17    commander should be located at the forward command post because that is
18    the very reason why the command is being relocated because it is so that
19    the commander can have a more efficient control over his troops from the
20    forward command post.
21       Q.   Which parts of the command of the Drina Corps were at the forward
22    command post of Pribicevac?
23       A.   You mean the command?  The command of the Drina Corps, you mean.
24            At the forward command post of the Drina Corps, there was the
25    Corps Commander; the Chief of Staff of the Corps; the assistant for the

 1    Chief of Staff for operative affairs; the assistant for intelligence, but
 2    he wasn't there all the time, he would go back to the basic command post
 3    from time to time; the head of communications, which is always there.  So
 4    those are the organs that I was interested in.  I didn't focus on the
 5    others, but that is quite enough for the effective functioning of a
 6    forward command post.
 7       Q.   Did the commander of the Drina Corps during the Krivaja operation,
 8    was he at the forward command post all the time?
 9       A.   I did not study that problem for the simple reason that it is up
10    to the personal assessment of a commander whether he's going to spend all
11    his time at the forward command post or whether he's going to make
12    periodical tours of the units in combat, to the logistics portion, or
13    whether he's going to be at the basic command post or in the region of the
14    units who are the main forces of the Corps to carry out defensive
15    operations towards Tuzla and Kladanj.
16            So the Corps Commander need not be at the forward command post all
17    the time, but what is most important is that the command functions.  And
18    when the commander isn't on the spot, he has his Chief of Staff who
19    replaces him, and this is an automatic mechanism.  When the commander is
20    absent, the Chief of Staff de facto takes over the command so there are no
21    breaks or pauses in the system of command, regardless of whether the
22    command is at the forward command post or is absent from it.  It is
23    important to know that the forward command post is the spot from which the
24    units are commanded, the units in the operation are being commanded, for
25    which the forward command post was established in the first place.

 1       Q.   General Radinovic, what portion of the overall forces were
 2    engaged - and I'm thinking of the Drina Corps, the overall Drina
 3    Corps - how many of their men were engaged in the Krivaja 95 operation,
 4    involved there?
 5       A.   In the order of the commander, in point 4 of that order, the
 6    conceptual part that we commented in response to your previous question,
 7    is it explicitly says that the main forces of the corps should continue to
 8    exert defensive action at the outer areas of the zone of responsibility
 9    towards Tuzla and Kladanj, and those are the main forces, the bulk of the
10    troops.  And only part of the free forces should execute the Krivaja 95
11    operation, and not even all those free forces, but a portion of them.
12            In the order we saw that it was explicitly stated which these
13    forces were.  It was a combat group from the Zvornik Brigade, in fact,
14    which went along the Zeleni Jadar-Srebrenica axis and was active there.
15    It is the combat group from the 2nd Romanija and Bratunac Brigades as
16    well, and the Milici Brigade.  And the Bratunac Brigade, the Milici
17    Brigade link up forces but don't actually take part in the operation, so
18    they link up the forces and engage forces of the 28th Division.
19            So in the Krivaja 95, to all practical terms, it was forces below
20    the number of a brigade, which means two and a half battalions perhaps,
21    two and a half battalions took part.  The equivalent would be about three
22    battalions, which is far below the equivalent of a serious brigade.
23            So in answer to your question, I can say, in summing up, that they
24    were very restricted forces, just part of the free forces and in our
25    doctrine these are called auxiliary forces.

 1       Q.   What was the operative position of the forces engaged in the
 2    Krivaja 95 operation, both on the Muslim side and the -- that is to say,
 3    the BH army side and the VRS side?
 4       A.   Well, the forces of the 28th Division, at their positions, at the
 5    positions they were at, were there for a long time.  They held those
 6    positions for a long time, that is to say, from May 1993 -- of course,
 7    those forces -- not all the forces were there in 1993 that were there in
 8    1995.  They grew in number.  But they were there from 1993, to all
 9    practical purposes, so they were there for two whole years in those
10    positions, regardless of whether they were there throughout or whether
11    they came later on.
12            But we can say quite certainly that they had enough time to
13    prepare their defence positions very well.  That means to become
14    entrenched, a high degree of fortification and protection; to protect the
15    facilities, the existing facilities, and adapt them as protection against
16    fire power.  They had enough time to do all the reconnoitring they needed,
17    to study the methods and dynamics of defence, to study all these things.
18    They had enough time to do this very well, if they wanted to, of course.
19    Whether they did so or did not, I don't know, but with regard to the
20    persistence that they defended Srebrenica, I do not think they did avail
21    themselves of all that.
22            They were engaged in their defence in a circular system.  They
23    were in an encirclement, which is an unfavourable indicator of their
24    condition, this encirclement.  The fact that they were in an encirclement
25    means that they were at a disadvantageous position.

 1            The presence of UNPROFOR, or rather the Dutch Battalion, was a
 2    positive factor in the operational position of the forces of the 28th
 3    Division.  Constant activity on the part of the units of the 2nd Corps,
 4    the Muslim army, on the external axes from Kladanj and Tuzla, and constant
 5    pressure that was exerted on the zone of responsibility of the Drina Corps
 6    made it binding on the forces of the corps to hold their main forces at
 7    defensive positions and defensive deployment towards the external
 8    boundaries of the zone of responsibility.  And that was an additional
 9    factor advantageous to the position of the forces in the enclave, although
10    let me repeat once again:  When forces are found in an encirclement, taken
11    as a whole their position is considered to be disadvantageous.
12            As far as the position of the Drina Corps forces is concerned, I
13    would like to stress -- of course, we can stress some positive elements,
14    but there are negative ones as well.  The positive ones was that the
15    forces were on the external edges of the enclave and held the forces of
16    the 28th Division in an encirclement.  The space between the enclaves was
17    not controlled by the VRS, and that was a disadvantageous fact for the
18    operational position of the Drina Corps forces which held the enclaves.
19            Another unfavourable fact for the VRS was that it did not -- that
20    is to say, the Drina Corps was, quite simply -- it did not have any free
21    forces for manoeuvring and for taking over offensive actions.  All the
22    forces were engaged in defending the external reaches.
23       Q.   What would be the overall ratio of forces between the BH army and
24    the 28th Division on the one side and the others taking part in the
25    Krivaja 95 operation?

 1       A.   I analysed the ratio of forces in Srebrenica.  I have analysed
 2    that.  And if we take -- although the numerical situation, as borne out by
 3    the documents, they vary; the numbers vary from one document to another.
 4    Some documents say that the 28th Division had about 8.000 men; other
 5    documents quote different figures.  These are assessments rather than
 6    precise data, precise facts and figures as to how many troops there were.
 7            There is intelligence information which was used in the system of
 8    communication in the Drina Corps as well, for example, and you can draw
 9    conclusions from Muslim documents which speak of four organisational
10    formations in Srebrenica from the autumn of 1993 up to the middle of 1995,
11    or rather April 1995.  And if I weigh all those facts and figures up, then
12    it would appear that the 28th Division in Srebrenica had about 10.000 men,
13    in formation terms, and perhaps 8.000 armed men.  So those were forces
14    which far surpassed, numerically far surpassed the numbers of men in the
15    units engaged around Srebrenica.
16            And if we talk about the directly confronted parties on the two
17    sides, the two sides in Srebrenica in the Krivaja 95 operation, then my
18    calculations would be as follows:  The ratio of forces was 2.8:1 to the
19    advantage of the 28th Division, 2.8:1 to the advantage of the 28th
20    Division, which meant that they were numerically superior.
21            You must, of course, relativise that ratio in the sense that the
22    VRS was better equipped, better armed, it had better fire power support,
23    whereas the Muslim forces were weaker in that respect.  But at any rate,
24    that ratio of forces would still be to the advantage of the Muslim side,
25    regardless of that.

 1       Q.   Do any standards exist in military theory with respect to the
 2    ratio of forces in attacks on settlements, inhabited areas, and attacks on
 3    positions outside inhabited areas?
 4       A.   Yes, there are standards.  They exist generally in war doctrine,
 5    and we have a doctrine about that too.  In latter-day doctrine, attacks on
 6    inhabited areas are to be avoided, for two reasons:  First, because
 7    settlements are prepared for long-term defence and they rely on buildings
 8    and basements and cellars, which can be well adapted to provide defence
 9    and protection.  So populated areas are resistance points of the first
10    order, and in principle they are not attacked.
11            Let me remind you of the Israeli aggression on Lebanon in 1982.
12    Israel blocked Beirut but did not attack Beirut.  Of course, not only for
13    those reasons, but it never entered anybody's mind to attack Beirut.
14            So in principle, towns are not attacked, and latter-day doctrine
15    states this, because they are very strong fortification and can be used
16    for long-term resistance.  That is the first reason.
17            The second more important reason is that by attacking towns with
18    highly destructive systems and weaponry, there would be heavy losses
19    sustained in human lives on the side of the defenders, and this could
20    never be justified through the principle of military effectiveness.
21            So that is one serious reason why towns are not attacked.  But if
22    towns were to come under attack, then the ratio of forces between the
23    attacker, they must be -- the attacker must be more superior, 7 to 10
24    times more -- 7 to 10 times stronger, because it is very difficult to take
25    control of a town, so you would have to be far stronger.  Well-fortified

 1    defence positions outside inhabited areas on open ground, in open space,
 2    if we're talking about what we call manoeuvring territory, where the
 3    defenders do not have facilities and features which are dominant and which
 4    rise up above the area of attack, then the ratio of forces is usually 3:1
 5    or 5:1 on the attacker's side.  But for a well-prepared defence on a
 6    difficult terrain, inaccessible terrain, which enables the defender to
 7    organise a firm defence, then the ratio of forces goes up to 7:1, to the
 8    advantage of the attacker.  Without that numerical superiority, they would
 9    have no chance of gaining control of the area.
10       Q.   And this brings me to my last question before the break.  The
11    existing ratio of forces, did it guarantee success of the attack on
12    Srebrenica or was the takeover of Srebrenica planned at all, in view of
13    the existing ratio of forces?
14       A.   In the existing ratio of forces, it was absolutely not realistic
15    to plan the takeover of Srebrenica.  Nobody in the command system of the
16    Drina Corps could have had this, may I use the term, "mad plan" of taking
17    over Srebrenica.  No, it would have not entered anybody's mind because an
18    attack on Srebrenica was absolutely not feasible in view of the forces
19    that existed on the 6th of July, 1995.
20            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, may I suggest a break
21    at this point?
22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, that is a good proposal.
23    We shall reconvene at 11.00.
24                          --- Recess taken at 10.39 a.m.
25                          --- Upon resuming at 11.01 a.m.

 1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Visnjic, let us continue,
 2    and I think we should be working until 10 minutes past 12.
 3            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
 4       Q.   General Radinovic, could you give us just a brief description,
 5    because the Chamber has heard a lot of evidence to that effect, of the
 6    main course of the events and the developments during the Operation
 7    Krivaja 95, bearing in mind the internal structure of the combat
 8    activities; and also if you can give us your definition of the operation
 9    in question.
10       A.   Pursuant to the order of the Drina Corps Commander, the main axis
11    of attack was along the Zeleni Jadar-Srebrenica line, so that was the main
12    axis of combat operation.  The main feature that needed to be taken
13    possession of was Zivkovo Brdo, which was on the route of advance of the
14    2nd Combat Group from the 2nd Romanija and Birac Brigades.  In response to
15    one of your questions I said Bratunac Brigade.  No, they were from the
16    Birac Brigade.  The main feature that had to be occupied was Alibegovac,
17    and also the Kak feature which was also on the route of advance of those
18    units.
19            The attack started in the morning hours of the 6th, and the
20    weather conditions were very bad.  It was raining all the time, so
21    practically speaking there were no specific actions.  Some reconnaissance
22    work was still being done on certain locations, some regrouping of
23    forces.
24            My apologies to the interpreters.  I tend to get carried away.
25            So one can say that the dynamics, that the rhythm of advance was

 1    very slow indeed on the first day; that is, on the 6th of July they didn't
 2    make any significant gains at all.  But it is important to give an
 3    assessment of the situation here rather than to engage into detailed
 4    description of the events themselves.
 5            As early as on the 9th, objectively speaking, the units of the
 6    Drina Corps accomplished the objectives of the operation between the 9th
 7    and the 10th of July.  By reaching the Kak and Zivkovo Brdo features, the
 8    main objective of the operation was achieved.  The enclave was reduced in
 9    size, and it was made impossible for any military communication to be
10    conducted between the two enclaves, and that objective was accomplished in
11    the night between the 9th and the 10th of July.
12            As regards further developments concerning the Operation
13    Srebrenica, pursuant to the order of the Corps Commander, the actual
14    operation came to an end.  That was the end of it at that time.  Whatever
15    happened later on happened pursuant to the decision to enter the town of
16    Srebrenica for which the Corps Commander needed a new mandate from his
17    superior command.
18            As regards the intensity of the activities, I would place this
19    operation in the group of operations with very low intensity.  On the
20    basis of what?  Well, I can make that conclusion on the basis of the
21    dynamics of advancing because we are talking about several kilometres per
22    day.  That is a very slow rate of advance.
23            Second, there were very few losses, very few casualties on both
24    sides.  In the documents that I had a chance to study, I didn't come
25    across any such data, any data to the effect that there would be any

 1    serious losses on both warring sides, talking about the Operation
 2    Srebrenica.
 3            Third, there was very little destruction throughout that time
 4    which speaks to the fact that the fire support and the equipment used to
 5    provide fire support was very limited, very restricted.  It is obvious
 6    that the Corps artillery did not take part in the activities.  Had the
 7    Drina Corps had the intention to capture the town of Srebrenica, they
 8    would have used the Corps artillery support.  However, this artillery was
 9    not present here, and their support was not used.
10            I came across various data concerning the number of rounds that
11    were fired as part of the fire support to the operation.  Some sources
12    claim that over 200 artillery shells were falling every day.  If we were
13    to talk about, really talk about 200 artillery shells per day, the
14    destruction would be quite serious and quite extensive.
15            On the video footage showing the entry of the VRS units into the
16    town of Srebrenica I was not able to notice, to observe, such a level of
17    destruction which would justify the number of rounds fired.  But I must
18    say that these are the data that I read in the documents and the reports
19    which were sent by the UN military observers.  They were probably located
20    inside their facilities; they didn't go out into the field.  They were not
21    able to verify for themselves that information, so they probably received
22    that data from the local Muslim population which was, of course, afraid,
23    and which led them to exaggerate the number.  Again, the destruction would
24    be far more extensive if that number of rounds were fired.
25            The reports of the Dutch Battalion are more accurate, and the

 1    number that they give, the number of shells that were fired during the
 2    operation, was much lower.  In view of the structure of the operation, one
 3    can say that we are talking about an operation with restricted objective
 4    and a low intensity operation.
 5            Certain elements which characterise each operation are lacking
 6    here.  When preparing for an attack on a fortified position, and one can
 7    expect that the positions of the 28th Division were very well fortified,
 8    because they had two years to prepare themselves, and in such conditions
 9    the preparation for fire support for the operation usually takes longer.
10            That element of the operation Krivaja 95 is lacking here.  Of
11    course, there were some -- there was a certain amount of support, but I
12    think that that support was provided by the battalion forces who were
13    actually taking part in the combat activities, and probably the support
14    given by tanks.  But I don't think that there can be any talk about large
15    artillery -- large-calibre artillery.  So this element of serious
16    artillery preparation is lacking.  Not a single offensive operation can be
17    carried out with any serious objective in mind without extensive artillery
18    preparations.
19            Furthermore, there were no major clashes along the confrontation
20    line.  There were no deep advances, there were no flank attacks.  So there
21    is a certain dynamics which is lacking in this particular operation, and
22    such dynamics is always characteristic for major military operations, and
23    that leads me to conclude that the operation in question was one with a
24    restricted objective, and, structurally speaking, it was a simplified
25    operation in view of the elements that it contained.

 1       Q.   General Radinovic, if we compare the attack on Srebrenica, that
 2    is, the attack of the VRS which took place in 1993, when the objective was
 3    to take over Srebrenica and the Krivaja 95 operation, what kind of
 4    conclusion can we draw from that comparison?
 5       A.   Well, the only conclusion that one can draw is the one which would
 6    confirm what I have just said about the scope and the intensity of the
 7    operation.  In the Srebrenica Operation 1995, the forces that were
 8    committed were below the level of a brigade, whereas in 1993 the forces
 9    that were deployed were those of the strength of four brigades.
10            Let me just remind you that there were two guard brigades at that
11    time:  The 1st Guards Brigade from Bijeljina, with the code-name Mauzer,
12    and one of the Protection Regiment, forces of the Milici Brigade.  All
13    those forces were deployed for the purposes of that operation, and they
14    can -- they were in the strength of four brigades at that time.  That
15    number of troops was necessary in order for the town of Srebrenica to be
16    occupied, and that is the ratio of the forces that I spoke about,
17    7 to 10:1.
18            Srebrenica was the objective of the attack in 1993.  The VRS had
19    the intention to take control of the town of Srebrenica, thereby gaining
20    the control of the overall area of central Podrinje.  Yesterday we spoke
21    about the reasons why that operation was never completed, and in response
22    to your question here, I can just say that those forces were such that it
23    was possible for them to take possession of the town, whereas the forces
24    that were committed for the purposes of the Krivaja 95 operation were not
25    such as to guarantee the success of the takeover of the town.  And from

 1    that perspective, the only conclusion I can draw was that there was no
 2    intention whatsoever to take control of the town, and such conclusion can
 3    be made also on the basis of the documents which were drafted for the
 4    purposes of this operation, in particular, the order for combat
 5    activities.
 6       Q.   General Radinovic, the 28th Division, how persistent was it in its
 7    defence of the town of Srebrenica?
 8       A.   Well, that's a different story.  I don't think that they were very
 9    persistent in their defence.  There were, I think, operational and
10    tactical possibilities for the town of Srebrenica to be fiercely
11    defended.  I am familiar with certain relevant testimonies to that effect,
12    and I am familiar with the document issued by the UN Secretary-General
13    where he stated that the forces of the 28th Division were not able to put
14    up a fierce defence of the town of Srebrenica for a long time period.  I
15    cannot agree with that, and I have a number of data which can support my
16    conclusion.  I know that the Secretary-General based himself on the report
17    submitted to him by his soldiers, but when I spoke about the ways a town
18    can defend itself, I wanted to say that Srebrenica was able to prepare
19    adequate defence with its forces despite the fact that the area was
20    restricted and despite the fact that their combat readiness was not at the
21    highest level.
22            For the purposes for the defence of town of Srebrenica, it was
23    quite enough -- what the 28th Division had at their disposal was quite
24    enough, including mine and ordnance equipment, adequate ammunition and
25    weapons, because such operations were low-intensity operations, without

 1    air support or artillery support.  We're talking about minor clashes which
 2    are of very low intensity, with the use of -- with the restricted use of
 3    equipment.  And I'm quite sure that the resources of the 28th Division
 4    were such that it was able to defend the town of Srebrenica so long as the
 5    forces of the International Community didn't meddle in the defence, that
 6    is, the forces of the United Nations, which would prevent any further
 7    exacerbation of the conflict.
 8            And if I may at this point, I have to address a certain amount of
 9    blame for what happened there to the system of command of Srebrenica.  Had
10    they put up a more persistent defence in the town of Srebrenica, I'm sure
11    that the members of UNPROFOR would have intervened and they would have
12    helped them.  But I think the way things were happening, it was a fait
13    accompli.
14            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, could I make an objection?
15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. Cayley.
16            MR. CAYLEY:  I make this objection before we get on to matters
17    which are really more germane, more material to the case.  The General is
18    making very sweeping, broad statements about matters.  He's giving his
19    opinion.  And he makes statements in such a fashion - I'll give you an
20    example in a moment - without any specific basis for that opinion.
21            He said to us earlier on, I think yesterday in his testimony, that
22    he's relied on documents and speaking to a number of people and
23    Prosecution exhibits; but a statement that he's just made where he states
24    the 28th Division had sufficient equipment, sufficient ammunition to
25    defend the enclave, could he identify for the Prosecution how he actually

 1    comes to that conclusion - here is Exhibit D57, here is Prosecutor's
 2    Exhibit such - rather than just making these very sweeping statements with
 3    some kind of broad bases of which we have absolutely know idea about at
 4    all.  Because unless he was there and he actually counted all the
 5    ammunition and the weapons that the Muslims had, I really don't see how he
 6    could make these kind of comments.  That would be my point.
 7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Visnjic, you have heard this
 8    request for clarification.  I should also like you to try and streamline
 9    the answers of your witness and to have him tell us the sources for his
10    conclusions, and tell us if he reached his conclusions after the events.
11    It is very easy to draw conclusions later on, post facto; however, we have
12    to try and place ourselves in the relevant situation in space and time.
13            We need to hear very clear opinions of this witness, including the
14    foundations for his answers, because after all, he is an expert witness,
15    and we have to know what the bases for his answers is.
16            I hope that I was clear enough, Mr. Visnjic, and the witness has
17    also heard me, I hope.
18            Is that all, Mr. Cayley, that you wanted to object to?
19            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  I think you've been very clear.
20    It's just a specific basis for what the witness is saying, as Mr. Butler
21    did.  He would come forward to you with a conclusion, and then he would
22    produce a document to actually support his conclusion.  So that's all I'm
23    asking for, thank you.
24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, go ahead, Mr. Visnjic.
25    Please continue.

 1            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, if you will allow me
 2    just a brief response to my learned colleague Mr. Cayley.
 3            I cannot answer instead of the witness.  I know that the Defence
 4    has provided the witness with a number of documents which speak about the
 5    army -- of the arming of the BiH army inside the protected area of
 6    Srebrenica, so I assume that those documents are one of the sources and
 7    bases for his conclusions.  On the other hand, I know that at the time the
 8    General was preparing his report, we had a number of difficulties because
 9    we had to work parallelly on certain documents that were already tendered
10    here into evidence, and the General had some other documents at his
11    disposal.  So that is perhaps the reason for this misunderstanding.
12            As regards the issue of arming, one portion of the relevant
13    documents hasn't yet been tendered into evidence.  It has been handed
14    over, but it is still not in evidence, and those are the documents that
15    the witness used during the preparation of his report, and I think he will
16    mention them in due time.
17       Q.   General Radinovic, did the forces and positions of UNPROFOR, were
18    they the object of an attack target?  No, I withdraw that question.
19            Could you tell us more specifically the sources which allowed you
20    to make the conclusions you have been making about the weapons and fire
21    power of the forces of the 28th Division?
22       A.   Well, first, I did not -- let me say that I did not base my
23    conclusions only on the documents that I studied for this particular
24    occasion alone.  There is something that we call a standard when an army
25    is being established.  We know the standards.  We know what a detachment,

 1    a platoon, a company, a battalion, a brigade, a division has, how many men
 2    and so on, and what type of weaponry, and what units have what kind of
 3    weapons at their disposal if somebody, a soldier, under arms, that is to
 4    say, carrying arms, in the armed formations.
 5            Then it is quite certain that these armed soldiers have their own
 6    personal weapons which means that they have rifles.  Whether it is an M-48
 7    rifle or an automatic rifle or semi-automatic rifle, that is another
 8    matter.  That is the subject for additional analysis.  But they would have
 9    had a rifle.
10            It is quite certain that a brigade in the organisational and
11    formational sense has fire support.  It had its brigade firing groups.  It
12    had mortars of the lowest calibre.  So that materiel, coupled with mines
13    and explosives because they had that too, and I say that had they only
14    used that basic equipment, the basic equipment that each soldier has and
15    the mines and explosives, Srebrenica could have been defended in the
16    encirclement for as long as it took the International Community to
17    interfere and bring the conflict to an end.
18            The testimony on the basis of that document does not have any
19    great specific weight, but in the book about Srebrenica, and I quote it in
20    my expert report, there is a photograph from which we can see the type of
21    uniform and type of weapons carried and worn by the Muslim soldiers in
22    Srebrenica.  And believe me when I say that not even the VRS had weapons
23    of that kind.  They were modern automatic rifles and special flack jackets
24    and so on.  I don't say all these soldiers in Srebrenica were equipped in
25    this way, but it does tend to show that they were a force to be reckoned

 1    with, to inspire confidence.
 2       Q.   Were the forces of UNPROFOR targets of the VRS?
 3       A.   No, they were not.  And in the documents that I have had occasion
 4    to study and see and consult for this expert opinion, the positions -- the
 5    UNPROFOR positions were not the target of attack.  And the documents of
 6    the superior command with the Drina Corps, it is explicitly stated that
 7    the UNPROFOR forces must not be the target of attack.  And that they were
 8    not the target of attack, indeed, is borne out by the fact that most of
 9    the UNPROFOR forces passed through the front lines of the Drina Corps and
10    behind them -- they were behind them in the rear, and losses were
11    prevented in this way.
12            And we know that a member of the Dutch Battalion unfortunately was
13    killed by the Muslims in Srebrenica, unhappily.  But luckily, we do not
14    have any data, and I think that is true, that we did not sustain any --
15    that the Dutch Battalion did not sustain any casualties from the Serbian
16    side.
17       Q.   How do you assess the efficiency and effectiveness of UNPROFOR
18    with respect to the combat activities in and around Srebrenica?
19       A.   UNPROFOR did not have any combat, did not undertake any combat
20    activities.  That is a fact, and there is no need to go into that.  It did
21    not act against the forces of the Drina Corps which attacked towards
22    Srebrenica.  However, I think that we must stress the fact at this point
23    that the other UNPROFOR forces were not active either, in the sense of
24    preventing - I say preventing - a serious operational crisis around
25    Srebrenica.

 1            I personally feel that the UNPROFOR system should have reacted
 2    when it came to the Krivaja 95 operation and its execution, and they
 3    should have at all costs prevented its further advance; that is to say, it
 4    should have unleashed the mechanism which it had at its disposal and
 5    compel the belligerents to respect the safe area, both the Serb side and
 6    the Muslim side.  But that is a story apart; that is post festum, as the
 7    President has so aptly said.  It is an assessment made after the fact,
 8    after the events, but I think that UNPROFOR did have the necessary
 9    materiel at its disposal to be able to prevent that operation, and it
10    would have had to have done so.
11       Q.   What was the relationship of the BiH army towards UNPROFOR, that
12    is to say, what were the -- what was the 28th Division's relationship
13    towards UNPROFOR, its attitude towards UNPROFOR?
14       A.   Well, it had a dual attitude, twofold.  First of all, whether
15    rightly or not, they expected UNPROFOR to protect them fully, completely,
16    and they were not concerned about the fact that they themselves were
17    launching sabotage and divisionary action in the rear of the Drina Corps
18    forces which directly led to the Krivaja 95 operation as a response.  It
19    was the direct consequence of the sabotage and diversionary groups from
20    the enclave and their activities.  Had that not happened, the operation
21    would have not happened because all the documents point to the fact that
22    that was the main reason, and that unleashed the idea of having the
23    operation.
24            Second, when the activities had been undertaken, then the Muslim
25    forces of the 28th Division expected the arms controlled in the hands of

 1    UNPROFOR to be handed over to them, probably.  In assessing the
 2    relationship between the Muslim forces and UNPROFOR, the attitude they had
 3    towards UNPROFOR, we must bear in mind the fact that those forces expected
 4    more from UNPROFOR than UNPROFOR was able to give and that this led to a
 5    certain amount of frustration on the Muslim side.
 6            I wish to believe that that was the consequence and that it was
 7    due to this force of circumstances which led to the death of one member of
 8    the Dutch Battalion, but it also indicates the negative attitude of the
 9    28th Division vis-a-vis UNPROFOR.  There are indications of that, and
10    there are documents which state that the Muslims seized weapons from the
11    Dutch Battalion as well.
12            So in a word, we could say in summing up that the attitude of the
13    28th Division towards UNPROFOR, that their relationships were not as might
14    have been expected in this safe area, protected area.  Nor did the members
15    of the 28th Division respect the regime; neither did UNPROFOR compel them
16    to respect it on its part.
17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. Cayley.
18            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt.  I think you
19    know the objection I'm going to make.
20            Here the witness is talking about the relationship between the
21    Dutch and the 28th Division.  He's saying that the Muslims expected to be
22    protected, and that the relationship was not what it should have been.
23    Could he please identify what is his foundation for saying that?  Can he
24    identify the testimony that's been heard by the Court, the documents, the
25    specific documents that indicate this.

 1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Professor Radinovic, we
 2    are now at a different level of analysis and conclusion.  A conclusion
 3    supposes an analysis behind it.  So could you specify, please, what
 4    documents, what facts, or what results of your observations or
 5    conversations that you have had allow you to draw those conclusions.
 6       A.   The killing of the member of the Dutch Battalion is a fact which
 7    testifies and speaks of the unacceptable relationship of the 28th Division
 8    towards members of the Dutch Battalion, for example.  That is a fact which
 9    illustrates that most directly.  I don't know what else would be stronger,
10    which argument would be stronger than the death of an innocent soldier who
11    was there to protect the safe area and not there to lose his life or to
12    put his life in jeopardy.
13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, Witness, but the bad
14    relationships that you spoke about between the 28th Division and the
15    UNPROFOR forces existed before the death of that soldier.  Did they -- was
16    it because of those relations that the soldier lost his life or was it
17    because of the soldier's loss of life that the relationships were poor?
18    You must see this line of reasoning.  So in order to say that relations
19    were bad between the 28th Division and UNPROFOR, or if you say that they
20    weren't good, at any rate, you must have reasons for saying so, reasons to
21    back this up, and that is what Mr. Cayley is asking you:  What is the
22    foundation for you to make that conclusion?  The death of that particular
23    soldier, as I have demonstrated, does not show that, because your answer
24    does not establish a relationship before the killing and after the
25    killing, cause and effect.

 1            Mr. Cayley is still on his feet, I see, so please proceed,
 2    Mr. Cayley.  Any more objections?
 3            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, you've actually articulated my
 4    thoughts, so I have nothing to add.
 5            JUDGE RODRIGUES:  I'm so sorry.  [Interpretation] I do apologise
 6    for doing your work for you.
 7            Witness, you have heard the line our discussion has taken.  What
 8    do you have to say in response?
 9       A.   It is the principal responsibility of the Dutch Battalion, as a
10    part of the UNPROFOR mechanism, to ensure the regime of a safe area in
11    Srebrenica.  The principal responsibility of the 28th Division was to
12    respect that regime.  The 28th Division, as we have seen on the basis of a
13    series of documents, did not respect that regime, and for me that is the
14    most important pointer to unacceptable behaviour on the part of the 28th
15    Division and the principal responsibility of the Dutch Battalion, which
16    was to ensure that the safe area be respected.  That is to say that from
17    the safe area, from Srebrenica, no combat activities were allowed towards
18    the VRS.  So that is the main indicator.  Whether they had any emotional
19    relationship towards the Dutch Battalion, that is not a subject of
20    discussion here; it is not important for what we're discussing.  But their
21    conduct was not proper.  They did not respect the regime of the safe area,
22    which they signed in the agreement of April and May 1993 and pledged
23    themselves to do so.
24            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I shall now attempt
25    to help the witness respond to that question with a few documents, and

 1    later on I should like to give a brief explanation to the Trial Chamber.
 2       Q.   One of the documents, General Radinovic, that you based your
 3    report on, was it the report based on debriefing in Srebrenica of the
 4    Dutch Defence Ministry?  Was that one of your basic documents?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Now, in that document, and I have the Serbian version -- that is
 7    to say, does the document speak of the relationship of the BH army towards
 8    the Dutch Battalion, if you happen to remember?
 9       A.   Yes, it does.
10            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I can quote from the
11    document which has already been introduced into evidence as a Prosecution
12    Exhibit.  Just by way of example of what Mr. Cayley is asking
13    Mr. Radinovic to do:  Mr. Butler was a very good witness in that respect.
14    He had a lot of facts and figures in his head.  I talked to General
15    Radinovic in preparation for his testimony, and there are two reasons for
16    which he cannot fulfil Mr. Cayley's demands.  The first is that he does
17    not have all the sources with him at the moment, all the sources he used.
18    And the second reason is that he can't remember; relying on his memory, he
19    can't sometimes remember all those documents.  Now, if the Prosecution
20    insists upon having each assertion backed up by its source and foundation,
21    I propose that we do this later on in writing, and then the assertions
22    could be supported by these written materials or it can remain open as an
23    assertion without the corresponding foundation or support, if I can use
24    that term.
25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I would like to open up

 1    this -- I don't want to open up a full discussion, but I would like to ask
 2    Mr. Cayley's position on this point:  That is to say, if the witness
 3    expresses his opinion and then tells us the steps which he took to make
 4    that conclusion, and next we will have the cross-examination by the
 5    Prosecution, which will take up more time elucidating those points.  But
 6    at any rate, I would like to hear Mr. Cayley's response to the proposal
 7    just made by Defence counsel.
 8            MR. CAYLEY:  I've had the opportunity, Mr. President, of
 9    consulting with Mr. Harmon, so the Prosecution speaks with one voice.  The
10    reason that I ask this is not to be difficult but is simply, as I think
11    you already understand, to facilitate an efficient cross-examination of
12    the witness.  Because unless we are aware of the foundation on which the
13    witness bases his opinion, it makes it exceptionally hard to cross-examine
14    him, because we simply have to kind of look up into the sky to try to
15    fathom out how he's come to a particular conclusion.
16            Our view would be that that is not an acceptable way of presenting
17    this kind of evidence, that the witness comes here, he testifies, he's
18    cross-examined, and then subsequently the Defence produce some kind of
19    written document which supports every written assertion he makes by
20    reference to a particular document.  That is what he should be doing here
21    and now as a witness, otherwise it makes the whole process ridiculous; it
22    doesn't make it a proper kind of examination and cross-examination at all.
23            JUDGE WALD:  I would like to just add to this.  I think we have to
24    allow a certain amount of flexibility in expert opinion.  As you know, in
25    some jurisdictions, including our own, the expert does not always have to

 1    specify and give the exact line of his reasoning or all his documents
 2    behind it.  Certainly I understand your position that you need to have
 3    some notion of where it's coming from in order to conduct the
 4    cross-examination, but as I recall, and I have to do this from memory,
 5    even Mr. Butler and others, they sometimes gave opinions in which they
 6    didn't give a source.  I can remember a specific instance or two, because
 7    we asked them a question and they gave an opinion without saying, "I am
 8    basing this on this document."  It was their opinion based upon the
 9    overall investigation that they had done.  And certainly Mr. Ruez did a
10    certain amount of that in his testimony.
11            So while I sympathise with your general notion, I do think that we
12    have to allow an amount of flexibility, and I think the credibility of the
13    expert's opinion will be assessed by us to some degree on the amount of
14    specification he can give to pass it up, to follow it up, and that I know
15    you will bring out adeptly on cross-examination.  So I'm finding it just a
16    little bit -- I won't use the word "irritating," but I'm finding it a
17    little bit disconcerting to have the notion that every time he says a
18    sentence, given that we do have his report and we know what it's based on,
19    that he's expected to produce the exact document.  I would like to,
20    frankly, hear the narrative and get on with this expert opinion on this.
21    I think we gave you a fair amount of flexibility with some of the
22    Prosecution's expert witnesses in this regard.
23            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Cayley, can I add, can I add some -- perhaps what
24    Judge Wald said.  Of course, sweeping statements have got their weight
25    before this Court or anywhere, and they are worth what they are worth, and

 1    it might be difficult for you to cross-examine a sweeping statement except
 2    by a sweeping statement.  But if then we might need support of the
 3    sweeping statement if it's not available now.  It's in the interests of
 4    justice to have it.  In that case you are entitled, in fact, since you
 5    have not been able to cross-examine it, you are entitled to ask that the
 6    witness comes back to be examined on this if you are really challenging
 7    the supporting material, if that suits you.
 8            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, if I could respond to what Her
 9    Honour --
10            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for Judge Rodrigues, please.
11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I apologise.  I was saying that
12    you spoke the same language and the interpreters have difficulties
13    following you.  If you don't make pauses between your interventions, we
14    will have problems.  I apologise, Mr. Cayley, for this interruption.
15    Please continue.
16            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
17            If I could respond, Your Honour, to the comments that you made.
18    I'm not suggesting for one moment that every single assertion that he
19    makes has to be supported by a particular document or by reference to oral
20    testimony, but I think - and I'm objecting now before we get on to matters
21    which we all know are going to be really material to this case - that
22    where he does come out with assertions, with propositions which go right
23    to the heart of the indictment, I think it's not unreasonable for him in
24    those particular instances to actually give evidential support for that
25    particular statement.

 1            Moreover, in respect of the report itself, Your Honour, there are,
 2    I think, in total about 30 footnotes, and I think if you look at
 3    Mr. Butler's report, there are literally hundreds and hundreds and
 4    hundreds of footnotes actually supporting assertions that he makes.  So
 5    whilst I don't wish to irritate anybody in the courtroom by making these
 6    objections, I do believe and I do maintain my position that for
 7    fundamental assertions which are important to this case, the witness has
 8    to give some kind of foundation.  Otherwise he can simply say, "I am
 9    making an inference."  If he's not basing it on something specific he can
10    say, "I'm making an inference."  And in fact, when he was questioned about
11    the 28th Division relationship, it was apparent that it was an inference
12    based on one single fact, that he made a global statement about the
13    relationship between the 28th Division and the Dutch Battalion.
14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I think that we have just heard
15    a very important argument from Mr. Cayley.  I think that we are now coming
16    to the core of this issue.  So far we have been discussing the framework.
17    We have to make a distinction:  Either the witness is giving his personal
18    opinion or his opinion as an expert.  He has to tell us about the
19    documents that he saw, and he has to tell us specifically on the basis of
20    which documents he has come to that conclusion, the conclusion that he
21    makes as an expert witness, otherwise I think that we will be allowing the
22    Prosecutor to interrupt the Defence constantly.  This is the basic
23    requirement for his cross-examination.  He needs to have some sources on
24    the basis of which he can conduct his examination.
25            I don't want the witness to think that we are now discussing his

 1    credibility.  This is just a technical aspect of the hearing of evidence.
 2    It is not a personal question.  It has nothing to do with you personally.
 3            Mr. Visnjic, I think that we can see certain similarities here
 4    with the issue of leading questions.  It is possible to lead the witness
 5    towards certain aspects which are not really at the heart of the matter,
 6    but we cannot do that when we are discussing core issues.  I should like
 7    to appeal to Mr. Visnjic to lead to a certain extent his witness in the
 8    extent that he should go to the important questions, really pertinent
 9    questions, and streamline him in his answers.  Because if you let him
10    speak at length, then the witness will be tempted to give his personal
11    opinions without quoting sources which he used as the basis for his
12    conclusions.  So I should like to ask Mr. Visnjic to intervene a little
13    more, once we have reached the heart of the matter, and you can also ask
14    the witness specific questions as regards his sources, the documents on
15    which he based himself, and in that way we will avoid very frequent
16    objections.
17            And Mr. Cayley, your objections, let me tell you, are never
18    irritating; on the other hand, they are quite welcome.
19            So Mr. Visnjic, if you can bear this guideline in mind and lead
20    your witness a little more in his testimony.
21            JUDGE WALD:  I feel compelled to add one thing more.  I think we
22    have to keep in mind the difference between a fact witness and an expert
23    witness.  A fact witness gives you a lot of documentation.  An expert
24    witness is called as an expert witness precisely because he is thought to
25    have the experience and the academic training which allow him to give a

 1    particular lens or a particular viewpoint to it.  I agree, he has to let
 2    you know if that's happened, but suppose, just suppose he were to say,
 3    "Based upon the events which happened in Srebrenica prior to the takeover
 4    in Srebrenica, just based upon those events, it is my expert opinion,
 5    having studied the military organisations and battles of the world, that
 6    that signifies a bad relationship between them."  We might not agree with
 7    him, but I think that would be a perfectly credible statement or a
 8    perfectly legitimate statement for an expert witness to have rather than
 9    to have to put in ten documents showing us.
10            MR. CAYLEY:  I agree with you.
11            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.
12            MR. CAYLEY:  I agree with you on that.
13            JUDGE WALD:  I just wanted to draw that -- I'm not irritated, but
14    I wanted to draw that distinction so we keep it in mind.
15            MR. CAYLEY:  That is exactly what -- I'm sorry, because the
16    interpretation has got to catch up.
17            Your Honour, what is exactly the point that I make, and if the
18    witness had said that, I would never have jumped to my feet and caused all
19    this delay.  If he says, "I'm a Lieutenant General.  Based on all my
20    experience over the years, I can't point to any particular document, but I
21    can tell you as a professional soldier, this is my opinion" that's all I
22    ask for.
23            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Cayley, I would like to reassure you that -- to
24    trust the good judgement of the Bench, and when certain things are just an
25    inference, we know it's an inference.  When he says, for instance, the

 1    28th Division was hostile to the DutchBat because one DutchBat soldier was
 2    killed, we know what it means.  We know that it's an inference, as you
 3    know -- draw the same thing.  So let him do the inferences, and leave the
 4    other job to us.
 5            MR. CAYLEY:  I apologise, Your Honour, if you think I'm doing your
 6    job, but that fact was actually drawn out by the President.  The actual
 7    fact of the death of the soldier was brought out by the President on the
 8    questioning of the witness.  Prior to that it was based on apparently
 9    nothing at all.
10            JUDGE RIAD:  We can draw the same conclusions, so don't you worry.
11            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Your Honour.
12            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, if you will allow me
13    to -- in reply to this issue that was broached by Mr. Cayley very briefly.
14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Visnjic, we have to bear in
15    mind that we are in front of an expert witness, what my colleague Judge
16    Wald has just pointed out, and the objective of this testimony is not fact
17    but the evaluation of the facts made by this witness, which is implied by
18    the very concept of expert witnesses.  Very often it is very difficult to
19    speak about evaluations without having adequate facts attached to it.
20            I think we can find a compromise solution here.  Once we get to
21    the most important aspects of the case, we have to know if there are -- if
22    the opinion in question is a personal opinion or if it's an expert
23    opinion.  Since we are here to judge the facts, one has to support those
24    facts with evaluations and opinions.
25            So I should like to ask Mr. Visnjic to bear that in mind while

 1    examining his witness.  I think we have about ten minutes to see if it is
 2    going to work.
 3            Mr. Visnjic, please continue.
 4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  But
 5    if you will allow me to expose a very brief aspect that I think is
 6    important and should be taken into account while assessing the value of
 7    testimony of Mr. Radinovic.  I'm glad that Mr. Cayley mentioned a
 8    comparison of this testimony with the testimony of Mr. Butler and
 9    Mr. Dannatt, although Mr. Dannatt's testimony was not as detailed as
10    Mr. Butler's.
11            It was allowed for the witness to have 60 hours to deal with this
12    issue, but believe me, in view of the quantity of documentation and in
13    view of the nature of -- I'm sorry, my colleague has just corrected me:
14    80 hours.  In view of the quality of the documents and in view of the pace
15    with which the documents -- the witness received the documents, this
16    precise analysis which was carried out by Mr. Dannatt and Mr. Butler, we
17    would need an additional two or three months in order to comply with the
18    requests of the Prosecutor.
19            Bearing in mind our very restricted resources -- and I must say
20    that I do understand the situation of my learned colleagues from the
21    Prosecution, but they also have to put themselves in our shoes.  Bearing
22    in mind our restricted resources, the very little amount of time, and the
23    nature of the subject matter, it is my opinion that this witness has put a
24    huge amount of effort in order to comply with the conditions and
25    requirements which were posed by the Chamber in respect to his testimony.

 1            I do not wish to discuss his capacity, his ability to provide you
 2    instantly with his sources, and that was precisely the reason for my
 3    proposal.  If something is really very important and very relevant, and if
 4    we cannot have the relevant source right away, we will make additional
 5    effort to provide the Chamber and the Prosecution with the relevant
 6    sources in due time.
 7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Visnjic, I really think we
 8    need a break at this point.  It is 12.00.  It is high noon, and we're
 9    going to have a break now, and when we come back we will take up the issue
10    once again.
11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. President, Your Honours, can you
12    just allow me two sentences?
13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] After the break, General.  After
14    the break.
15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Maybe it would be more useful for
16    you to hear it now, if you will allow me.
17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] No, I'm sorry, General.  After
18    the break.
19            We will come back at 1.00.
20                          --- Luncheon recess taken at 12.01 p.m.
21                          --- On resuming at 1.03 p.m.
22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Professor Radinovic, you wanted
23    to say a few words.  I apologise for not allowing you to do so before the
24    pause, but I had some urgent business to attend to.  I agree that for
25    purposes of economy, that might have been better, but would you like to

 1    add anything to the discussion we were having before the break?
 2            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. President.  To avoid
 3    repetition of situations of this kind, may I explain how I have understood
 4    my role in this trial to be, what I have understood it to be like?  And
 5    perhaps this explanation would be useful.
 6            I'm a military expert dealing in military strategic synthesis.  Of
 7    course, I do not do this arbitrarily.  I do not devise strategic synthesis
 8    arbitrarily but on the basis of analyses, comparative analyses, study of
 9    documents, but of course also basing it on my experience and the great
10    knowledge and experience that I have gained in the many years that I have
11    worked in the field, in my professional field.
12            I am not the type of witness of Mr. Butler.  I have enormous
13    respect for Mr. Butler and the enormous effort that he made in writing his
14    expert report, but I am not that type of analytical witness.  I am a
15    witness of the type of General Dannatt, and that is how I understood my
16    role.  So for all of my assertions, I, of course, do have arguments to
17    back them up as foundation, but in the kind of synthesis that I make, it
18    is absolutely not possible to say each and every time which source I base
19    my assertion on.
20            I have been -- I have said here that I gained the impression that
21    the relationships between the 28th Division and UNPROFOR in Srebrenica
22    were not good relations.  I assumed that that was sufficient -- that it
23    was sufficient to illustrate that.  And I, of course, have arguments to
24    back my opinion up.  I have the plan of attack, the document of the plan
25    of attack on the UNPROFOR camp devised by the Muslim command in November

 1    1994.
 2            Furthermore, I have the whole chapter on debriefing, which speaks
 3    about the poor relations that existed between the 28th Division and the
 4    Dutch Battalion of UNPROFOR.
 5            I also have the testimonies of the Dutch officers themselves about
 6    the fact that they did not know which forces existed in Srebrenica, what
 7    their structure was, what the command composition was, what kind of
 8    weaponry they had.  And when there are two armies on the same territory,
 9    in the same region, you don't know what they have by way of materiel and
10    equipment, then the conclusion is clear.  It means that they have not
11    exchanged information of that kind, which means that their relations are
12    poor.
13            So I want to tell you of the way in which I draw my conclusions
14    and make my assertions and what they are founded upon.  The method of
15    work, the methodology of my work, is different from what it was with some
16    of the other participants in these legal proceedings, and so -- and I
17    would not have accepted -- I do not accept Mr. Visnjic's defence.  I did
18    not -- I am not lacking -- I did not lack -- not do something because of
19    the -- I didn't have enough hours at any disposal.  I don't accept that
20    defence.  Even if I had two hours, I would have made my expert -- given my
21    expert opinion with all validity.  So the problem was not that I didn't
22    have enough hours at my disposal, as Mr. Visnjic implied; it was quite
23    something else, that I did my best with all the knowledge and experience
24    that I have as a professional and expert.
25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Professor Radinovic, thank you

 1    for your explanations.  We have heard them and we'll try to function in
 2    accordance with what you have presented.  Yes, it is true that you did not
 3    have as much time as you might have liked and the Registry did not pay you
 4    for all the time that you did invest.
 5            But Mr. Visnjic, was there something that --
 6            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] No, Mr. President, perhaps we did
 7    not understand each other.  It wasn't a question of payment or
 8    reimbursement.
 9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Let us move forward.  What is
10    the problem now?  If it wasn't a problem of reimbursement, then let's move
11    on.  I was just trying to -- right, you say that it wasn't a matter of
12    payment.  Very well, very well.
13            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] No, Mr. President, that is not what
14    I meant.  The remark was with respect to the time necessary.  That was how
15    I understood the problem, but the General put me right there.  He knows
16    what he meant, so he presented his view.
17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Visnjic, what we're going to
18    do now is the following:  You are going to continue your examination of
19    the witness, your examination-in-chief of this witness.  Try to explain to
20    us the foundation for his opinions, and do not lose from sight that the
21    object of the testimony is for the Trial Chamber to assess matters, and
22    the Prosecution will be able to cross-examine on the basis of the
23    foundation presented.  But for the Prosecution to be able to do that and
24    to have the minimum -- the minimum must be furnished so that the
25    Prosecution knows where it stands and can use that information during the

 1    cross-examination.
 2            JUDGE RIAD:  I have a comment, Mr. President.
 3            General Radinovic, you are a professor, and you can apply, of
 4    course, the method -- I'm going to say it's not anything you don't apply.
 5    When we listen to you, we'd like to know, to make things easier for us, to
 6    differentiate between facts and between your personal inferences.
 7            For instance, you can say -- tell us that the 28th Division was
 8    well armed.  You know it's a fact; you know about it.  When you told us,
 9    for instance, that the 28th Division was hostile to the UNPROFOR, I took
10    it as a fact.  Then when Mr. Visnjic asked you to develop it and to give
11    the reason, you said because they killed one man.  That's not fact any
12    more, it is your own inference.  I accept it, too, but if you just tell
13    us, "This is my inference," we don't even need to ask you why.  That's
14    your conclusion, and then you can proceed and know what is your conclusion
15    as an expert, but -- and what are the facts which don't require -- the way
16    you do when you teach.  Thank you.
17            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
18       Q.   General Radinovic, when did the forces of the Drina Corps succeed
19    in their planned targets?
20       A.   The Drina Corps forces achieved the goals of their Operation
21    Krivaja 95 when they reached the line Kak-Alibegovac-Zivkovo Brdo, when
22    they took possession of those dominant heights above the enclave.  And
23    that I say on the basis of the documents and what happened between the 9th
24    and 10th of July.
25       Q.   When was the decision taken to extend -- expand the objectives of

 1    the operation, that is to say, to launch a new operation for taking
 2    control of Srebrenica?  And who made that decision?
 3       A.   That decision was made by the sole person authorised to do so,
 4    that is to say, the Supreme Commander, the president of Republika Srpska
 5    in his role as Supreme Commander.
 6       Q.   On the basis of what?
 7       A.   On the basis of documents, documents which at the command post of
 8    the Drina Corps were sent by one of the assistants of the Main Staff of
 9    the VRS informing them that the president of the republic agreed, was in
10    agreement, that the activities continue, and that they enter Srebrenica.
11    That is the document dated the 9th of July, the evening of the 9th of
12    July, and it came from the Main Staff and was dispatched to the Drina
13    Corps command.  Do you want me to produce the document?
14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] It is Prosecution Exhibit 423 for
15    the benefit of my learned colleagues for the Prosecution.
16       Q.   General Radinovic, what forces of the VRS entered Srebrenica?  How
17    many troops, and what do you know about that?
18       A.   I was not able to ascertain exactly how many soldiers entered
19    Srebrenica; however, I did have occasion to see a videotape when the
20    commander of the Main Staff, together with some of his commanding
21    officers, entered Srebrenica.  There was a very limited number of soldiers
22    there, and quite simply, you can't see soldiers moving in file.  You don't
23    see the combat weapons; combat formation isn't seen.  And as I don't know
24    these facts, I can conclude that there were not many soldiers.  Several
25    dozens.

 1            I read the book of the Commander-in-Chief of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
 2    General Sefer Halilovic, who reacted.  This was in reaction to the
 3    situation in Srebrenica, and he made the assessment.  What he said was
 4    that there were less -- less Serbian soldiers entered Srebrenica than
 5    there were in the security of -- providing security for General Delic at
 6    the seminar or congress of the SDA party in Tuzla, and he said that not
 7    even 200 soldiers entered.  That is a statement from General Halilovic, a
 8    quotation from him, and I assume that he would be well placed to know
 9    those things.
10       Q.   Who did the forces of the Drina Corps encounter when they entered
11    Srebrenica?
12       A.   From that document, that is to say the videotape which I saw, I
13    was able to conclude that they did not come across anyone in Srebrenica,
14    that is to say that Srebrenica was empty.
15       Q.   Where was the civilian population at that time, and where was the
16    28th Infantry Division; do you know about that?
17       A.   The civilian population had been gathering in the Potocari
18    UNPROFOR base, and the members of the 28th Division in the region of these
19    villages of Susnjari and Jaglici, and that is in this region here.  May I
20    get up to indicate it on the map?  [Indicates].
21       Q.   The withdrawal and grouping and formation of the retreating
22    members of the 28th Infantry Division, that is to say, what was the nature
23    of that withdrawal?  I'm thinking of them going to the village of
24    Susnjari, and on what do you base your assessment?
25       A.   I can conclude that the withdrawal of the forces of the 28th

 1    Division from Srebrenica began much earlier than the 11th when they
 2    appeared in the Susnjari and Jaglici region, which is where the blue
 3    circle is and the arrow on the map.  How do I -- what do I base that on?
 4            The Trial Chamber and the Prosecution must believe me when I say
 5    that I have studied things of this kind my whole life, and I know how this
 6    is usually done.  The confronting parties, for them to be separated and to
 7    avoid the enemy continuing an attack from the rear and take control of
 8    their own combat positions, they must organise lines of collection and
 9    reception in the rear and so lose this combat contact and confrontation
10    line, and create conditions for them to become separated and to move
11    towards Susnjari and Jaglici.  And this is an ongoing process.  It lasts;
12    it has its duration.  That is one fact.
13            The second relevant fact is that it is an area which from the
14    confrontation line up to Susnjari is about 10 kilometres.  The contact
15    line from Susnjari is 10 kilometres away, at a distance of 10 kilometres.
16    It wasn't individual withdrawal, but units had to be established.
17            Furthermore, they were coming from different directions, from a
18    circular area, an encirclement, so they had to be gathered together and
19    collected up.
20            And another important fact for my assessment in saying that it
21    probably took place much earlier on was that no member of the 28th
22    Division was captured.  Their members weren't captured around Srebrenica
23    or in Srebrenica.  That means that the 28th Division spent one day or one
24    and a half days -- they started their withdrawal one and a half days
25    before.  So quite certainly on the 10th -- they started withdrawing on the

 1    10th.  That is certain.
 2            And there's another fact that leads me to draw that conclusion,
 3    and I think it is an important fact; it is significant.  On the 9th of
 4    July we had the -- saw the first initiative on the part of the civilian
 5    representatives of the population in Srebrenica, who sought contacts with
 6    the VRS, the army of Republika Srpska, with regard to the departure of the
 7    population.  I don't think that the representatives of the civilian
 8    authorities in Srebrenica would ask for having contact with the VRS if the
 9    28th Division were in combat preparedness, full combat preparedness, and
10    had -- if they had persisted in the defence of the approaches to
11    Srebrenica.
12            Those are the facts on the basis of which I draw my conclusion.
13       Q.   This withdrawal, could that have taken place on the day Srebrenica
14    was taken control of itself?
15       A.   No, that couldn't have occurred on that same day, quite simply
16    because from that large circle and encirclement, had there not been within
17    the organisation of the 28th Division, had this not been agreed, then what
18    would have happened was that some portions of the 28th Division, that is
19    to say, the forces who were in the direct contact line, they would have
20    been encircled and captured or destroyed.  As that did not happen, I
21    assume that this action of withdrawal was done in a planned fashion, in a
22    timely fashion, which means that it took place during the 10th.
23            So those are my analytical assessments on the basis of which I can
24    conclude that this whole withdrawal process lasted for a day to a day and
25    a half.

 1       Q.   General Radinovic, let us move on to a new area, still, of course,
 2    following the chronology of the events.  From the moment when the Drina
 3    Corps units entered the town of Srebrenica, several operational
 4    problems -- the parties were faced with several operational problems.
 5    Could you tell us something about those operational problems that both
 6    sides had at that moment?
 7       A.   For the Muslim side, the main problem was the pull-out of the
 8    forces of the troops of the 28th Division, their regrouping; that is to
 9    say, the troops had to be gathered at certain holding points, see what the
10    situation was, what kind of problems they were facing, and try to see what
11    they can do next, what would be their next step.  The commanding officers
12    had to gather at one particular location where they were supposed to agree
13    on what to do next.
14            Now, whether it was possible to make an overall plan to that
15    effect, that remains unclear.  However, there must have been a kind of
16    contact between the commander or whoever was in command at the time with
17    the subordinate brigade commanders, and the brigade commanders had to
18    contact their subordinates in turn in order to agree on the route that
19    needed to be taken and the kind of formation that would follow that route
20    for the purposes of the pull-out.  So that was the main problem that the
21    Muslim side had to resolve after the entry of the Serb forces into the
22    town of Srebrenica.
23            There was an even more serious problem with which they were faced
24    at the time, and that was what to do with the civilian population that had
25    gathered around the UN base in Potocari or inside the base itself,

 1    including all the humanitarian problems that are implied and the problems
 2    which such an action would imply.
 3            As regards the Serb side, their problem was, acting in accordance
 4    with the requests of the representatives of the civilian authorities in
 5    Srebrenica, how to organise and ensure the transfer of the population,
 6    because such initiative was taken not only by the civilian population but
 7    also by the representatives of the International Community.  We have a
 8    document by Mr. Akashi, a telegram which he sent to the United Nations
 9    headquarters on the 11th and which concerns the problem of the pull-out of
10    the civilian population from Srebrenica.  Likewise, the commander of the
11    Dutch Battalion, during the meeting which took place at the Fontana Hotel,
12    requested for the members -- for the representatives of the VRS for that
13    measure to be ensured.  So that was one of the problems that they had,
14    that is, the civilian population, and what to do with them.
15            The second problem was, of course, the whereabouts of the 28th
16    Division and what the obligation of the Drina Corps was in respect of
17    those forces, the forces of the 28th Division, with whom they had
18    obviously lost contact.
19       Q.   General Radinovic, the transfer of the population, was it
20    something that could be realistically expected in that operation?
21       A.   In view of my insight of the situation, the moving out of the
22    population was not something that could be expected.
23       Q.   Did it constitute a desirable military objective of the VRS?
24       A.   No.  The moving out of the civilian population from Srebrenica
25    could by no means constitute a desirable objective of the VRS.  Now, what

 1    do I base my conclusion on?  Every army, if they want to behave in a
 2    rational way, would try to ensure with all accepted means to restrict the
 3    demographic potential of the enemy, of the opposing side.  That is to say,
 4    the VRS didn't like the idea to have a new 10.000 combatants appearing on
 5    the front lines.  That was a more unrealistic situation for them.  So the
 6    most logical step for the VRS would be for the local population, for the
 7    civilian population to remain in Srebrenica, but for them, for the
 8    civilian population not to be active in the military sense.  So the area
 9    had to be deactivated in the military sense of the word.  That was the
10    objective of the VRS.
11            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Can we have 404, footnote 73,
12    presented to the witness, and can we also prepare Prosecution Exhibits 39A
13    and B.
14       Q.   General Radinovic, to your knowledge, who first had the initiative
15    to move out the civilian population from the UN base in Potocari?  Who was
16    the first person who came up with such an idea?
17       A.   According to what I know, I think that the initiative for the
18    moving out of the civilian population from Srebrenica came from the
19    president of the presidency, Osman Suljic, who signed a document to that
20    effect, that is, the presidency of the Srebrenica municipality.  The
21    document in question is dated the 9th of July, 1995, and it was issued in
22    1900 hours.
23            President of the presidency, Mr. Osman Suljic, addresses
24    himself -- I'll try to paraphrase the document.  "Since the aggressor
25    enemy entered the town of Srebrenica at 1800 hours from the direction of

 1    Zeleni Jadar, and since our military command is dissolving and the members
 2    of the 28th Division are no longer able to do anything to prevent
 3    aggressive forces from entering the town, chaos and panic prevail and the
 4    civilian authorities are left with the least unpopular step to save the
 5    population.  And it is also stressed at the meeting at the level of the
 6    state and military organs of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with
 7    the Serbian aggressors side, that a meeting should be organised as soon as
 8    possible with the aim of finding the possibility to open a corridor for
 9    the population to move to the nearest free territory of the Republic of
10    Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of international factors.  We
11    need an urgent reply, at the latest by 2400 hours."
12            This document was signed by the president of the presidency of the
13    Srebrenica municipality.
14       Q.   If we place this document in the context of the time, that is at
15    the time where the order was expanded to the effect that Srebrenica should
16    be attacked.
17       A.   Yes, this document was issued before that, obviously, before it
18    was ordered for the troops to actually enter the town of Srebrenica.
19            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could the usher please give to the
20    witness the Prosecution Exhibit 39, and to put the page 9 - I believe it
21    is the same page in both versions - on the ELMO.
22            Your Honours, the document in question is a transcript of a video
23    clip which we have seen on a number of occasions here during this trial.
24    It is a video footage of the first meeting between General Mladic and
25    Colonel Karremans.

 1       Q.   General Radinovic, I have just asked the usher to turn to page 9
 2    of this document.  We have a combined translation here, English and
 3    Serbian.  Page 9 or 8.
 4            Could you give us a brief description of this conversation?
 5       A.   This conversation was conducted between Colonel Karremans and
 6    General Mladic.  Colonel Karremans speaks through an interpreter, and he
 7    says that there is a lot of weapons.  There's a huge amount of weapons in
 8    the enclave, and that the weapons had been smuggled from outside of the
 9    enclave.  He goes further on to state that he had put that many times in
10    the information to the higher military authorities and nationals in Tuzla
11    and Sarajevo.  The reason for that, says he, is because the Dutch
12    Battalion didn't -- was not able to defend the enclave and to have a full
13    control over its territory.
14            It's difficult for me to follow this because there are both
15    versions of the text here.
16            He refers at one point to a request which was made on behalf of
17    the civilian population, because he was not in a position to demand
18    anything.  He says that the command in Sarajevo had said that the enclave
19    had been lost, which we can link up with this request for the moving out
20    of the civilian population that we have just seen, and Colonel Karremans
21    is asking for this to be ensured.
22       Q.   General Radinovic, have you come across any document of the VRS,
23    or before the 11th of July did you come across any indication that the
24    moving out of the civilian population from Srebrenica had been planned,
25    anything that would speak to that effect?

 1       A.   No.  I have never come across any such document, anything that
 2    would indicate that anyone from the Drina Corps command or the VRS command
 3    would expect that the population would be moved out.
 4       Q.   Had that been planned, would certain documents have surfaced to
 5    that effect, the documents that were actually part of the overall planning
 6    of the Krivaja 95 operation?
 7       A.   I fully agree with General Dannatt on this issue.  This issue is
 8    discussed in the portion of his report when he says that the moving out of
 9    the civilian population is a very complex step to take, and that an
10    overall plan is necessary which would include provisions for the
11    accommodation and so on and so forth.  So there should have been a number
12    of such documents, and I fully agree with his claim to that effect.
13            However, I must add one more thing.  Such a comprehensive plan
14    could not be articulated or submitted to the Drina Corps for execution
15    without at least something of those documents being exposed to the
16    public.  I don't think that such a document could be drafted without
17    necessarily making it public because it would involve a great number of
18    participants, and such a plan would not -- it wouldn't be possible to
19    conceal such a plan because there would have been a number of individuals
20    who would have to be familiar with such a plan.
21            So as regards the planning documents for the Krivaja 95 operation,
22    there should have been something which would speak to that effect, on
23    condition that such a plan had indeed existed.  I didn't find anything of
24    that kind, and on the basis of that, I can conclude that those who were
25    involved in the planning of the Krivaja 95 operation, that is to say, the

 1    Drina Corps command, did not envisage that consequence.
 2            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] I should like the usher to prepare
 3    Defence Exhibit 154, OTP Exhibit 404, footnote 125, 126, and 127, and 128.
 4       Q.   General Radinovic, when was the first contact made, that is to
 5    say, the first actions, the first steps that were taken to that respect,
 6    that is, for the purposes of the moving out of the civilian population
 7    from Potocari?
 8       A.   In view of what I had at my disposal, I first came across such
 9    indicators in the documents which date from the evening hours of the 11th
10    of July, that is, the documents originating from the meeting that took
11    place in the Fontana Hotel between the representatives of the VRS and the
12    Dutch Battalion.
13            On the 12th of July, we see many more of such documents, and I'm
14    referring to the request of the Drina Corps Commander, for means of
15    transportation, for vehicles.
16       Q.   I believe that the usher has just prepared some documents for you.
17       A.   Yes.  The Drina Corps command on the 12th of July, 1995, addresses
18    itself to its subordinate brigades - the 1st Zvornik, the 1st Bratunac
19    Brigades, the Romanija Motorised Brigade, the 1st Bratunac Light Infantry
20    Brigade, the 1st Birac Brigade, the 5th Podrinje Light Infantry Brigade -
21    whereby it requests or, rather, orders that all available buses and vans
22    in ownership -- which are property of the VRS units, that they should be
23    placed at the disposal of the Drina Corps command on the 12th of July,
24    1995.
25            The said buses are to be forwarded to Bratunac, the sports

 1    stadium, on the 12th of July, 1995, not later than 1630.  The buses
 2    passing through Vlasenica were supposed to be filled up at the petrol
 3    station in Vlasenica.
 4       Q.   I don't think we need to discuss the details of this document,
 5    General Radinovic.  The document 154 is actually the same document as
 6    Prosecution Exhibit 404, footnote 125; it's just that it has come to us
 7    from a different source.
 8            As regards 404 and footnotes 125, 126, 127, and 128, it is
 9    actually a range of documents which speak about the same issue, and I
10    should like to hear your very brief comment on that.
11            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] And if we can have just one of those
12    documents placed on the ELMO so that we can see by way of illustration
13    what we are talking about.
14       A.   I believe I have already read this document.  This is the same
15    document.  Yes, Major-General Zivanovic for the 12th of July.  This is
16    exactly the same document.
17       Q.   Can we just hear your comments of the remaining three documents,
18    OTP 404, footnotes 126, 127, and 128.
19       A.   Secretariat for Defence in Zvornik, on the basis of a request
20    issued by the general staff of the VRS on the 12th of July for the
21    purposes of mobilising a certain number of buses, they request for such
22    buses to be placed at their disposal -- all of the buses from the
23    municipality, Zvornik, Visegrad, Vlasenica, Milici, and Bratunac and, if
24    necessary, from other municipalities as well.  A request is being made
25    here that the vehicles, that is to say, the drivers of the vehicles should

 1    immediately report at the stadium.
 2            So this is a similar request.  We have a request which was made by
 3    the Drina Corps Commander and addressed to the commanders of his brigades,
 4    that is for the buses which are property of the army to be placed at their
 5    disposal.  Then we have this same similar request issued to the municipal
 6    authorities, and also we see that the mention is made of the general
 7    request made by the general staff of the VRS.
 8            So we can see that in the space of one day or one morning, a
 9    request, an urgent request is made for buses and other vehicles to be
10    placed at their disposal for the purposes of moving out of the civilian
11    population as it had been agreed upon.
12       Q.   When did that start, and how long did that operation last?
13       A.   In accordance with the documents sent by General Zivanovic and the
14    Ministry of Defence, one can conclude that the moving out of the
15    population started on the 12th, in the afternoon hours of the 12th of
16    July, and on the basis of the documents that I had an opportunity to
17    study, the operation was completed on the 13th of July by half-past seven
18    p.m.
19       Q.   What were the mechanisms that were employed to that effect, the
20    mechanisms of the United Nations, and what was their situation?
21       A.   Well, the Dutch Battalion was in a very difficult situation
22    because they had received this very high number of people there.  And in
23    view of the fact that its mission was to ensure protection of the safe
24    area, they had a very weighty responsibility to bear.  I'm not going to
25    make any assessment as to how successful they were in accomplishing that

 1    mission; I just want to stress that I know how difficult their position
 2    was.  However, I must say that they acted irresponsibly once they found
 3    themselves in such a situation and faced with such a difficult problem.  I
 4    personally think that a mere telegram should not have sufficed, the
 5    telegram that Mr. Akashi sent to the Security Council in New York.  He had
 6    to find means and transport himself to the location, well, if not
 7    personally, then to send someone, his personal envoy, his personal
 8    representative, to act pursuant to his instructions and to be there in
 9    place.
10            Furthermore, I think that Mr. Bildt also should have been there at
11    the scene.  The same applies to the UNPROFOR BH commander, General Smith.
12    I just cannot explain to myself why they never showed up, why the
13    commander never showed up at the location.  Had the whole commanding
14    mechanism of UNPROFOR been actively involved in the situation, I believe
15    that the whole procedure, the whole operation, would have been carried out
16    without adverse consequences.  At least, I believe that it would have been
17    carried out in a more orderly fashion and with much less serious
18    consequences.
19       Q.   In the documentation that you studied, which relates to the period
20    immediately after the moving out of the population, did you come across
21    certain parts which stressed the irregularity of the moving out of the
22    population?  And here I mean the documents of the United Nations or some
23    of its organs.
24       A.   Yes, I did encounter some.  In the Secretary-General's report it
25    talks about that, the UN Secretary-General's report, that there were

 1    irregularities.  And in the expert opinions they also speak about that,
 2    the witnesses, Prosecution expert witnesses.  And in all the studies that
 3    I read through and studied for Srebrenica, the authors are Muslims, that
 4    is to say, members of the Muslim nation.  These authors speak about the
 5    fact that there were irregularities, and I have no reason not to believe
 6    that.
 7       Q.   General Radinovic, do you know of any other example where the
 8    population moved out in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Apart from
 9    this instance in Srebrenica, was there any other example and occasion?
10       A.   Well, unfortunately there were instances when the population moved
11    out, and this was something that was continuously apparent as the result
12    of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  As soon as an army, one army or
13    the other had established control in certain parts of the territory, all
14    those who did not consider that army to belong to them, they left the
15    area; they moved out.  So this moving out of the population is a regular
16    occurrence of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
17            Let me give you some examples which confirm my thesis.  For
18    example, the Neretva River Valley, including Mostar.  Mostar is a large
19    town compared to the size of the former Yugoslavia.  All the Serb
20    population left, from Capljina to Konjic; they all moved out.  The Croats
21    from Central Bosnia, they were moved out and escorted by the VRS army, and
22    this moving out of Central Bosnia was the result of the Muslim activities
23    there, not the Serb activities.  The Serb army helped the population to
24    shift and move out, without any serious repercussions.
25            There was an instance of moving out of the Muslim population in

 1    1993 as well from Srebrenica.  On that occasion 10.000 Muslims moved out.
 2    As you know full well, from Sarajevo, at the end of the war, all the Serb
 3    population, all the Serb inhabitants, left Sarajevo.  So we can say and
 4    make the conclusion that the moving out of the civilian population from
 5    areas taken over by war is no specific feature of Srebrenica; it is
 6    something that always accompanies civil wars.  I repeat:  Civil wars,
 7    civil wars of the kind that took place in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 8       Q.   And finally, General Radinovic, how would you assess the moving
 9    out that took place on the 12th and the 13th of July, 1995 in Srebrenica?
10    How would you characterise it:  as a planned operation, an operation
11    planned in advance, or as an ad hoc operation?
12       A.   Looking at the initiatives that were taken to move the population
13    out, and when I look at the documents that I had at my disposal for
14    assessing this action, this occurrence - and all documents indicate that
15    the problem should be resolved and that this referred to the 12th, before
16    noon - I am adamant in my conclusion that it was an ad hoc problem which
17    occurred on the spur of the moment, completely an unplanned consequence of
18    the Operation Krivaja 95, an unplanned consequence of the Krivaja 95
19    operation, and that is why it could not have been planned in advance,
20    planned beforehand, elaborated beforehand, and agreed upon beforehand, and
21    all the necessary things secured for it to be implemented, precisely
22    because it was an ad hoc operation.  It was carried out with serious
23    negative features which led to the consequences that are talked about in
24    the documents.
25            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, in view of our

 1    timetable yesterday, perhaps this would be a good moment for a break.
 2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  We're going to split up
 3    our afternoon work in two halves.  We're going to have a 15-minute break
 4    now.
 5                          --- Recess taken at 1.55 p.m.
 6                          --- On resuming at 2.11 p.m.
 7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Visnjic, please proceed.
 8    You have until 3.00.
 9            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
10       Q.   General Radinovic, before this Trial Chamber we have heard
11    numerous testimony, exhibits, videotapes, and other evidential material
12    speaking about the separation of military-abled men in Potocari on the
13    12th and 13th of July, 1995.  Do you consider it legitimate to test the
14    identity of the military-abled men?
15       A.   Yes, I do consider it legitimate to check up the identity of the
16    males, of the men.  Now, why do I say that?  Because in Srebrenica, the
17    28th Infantry Division was positioned at the BiH army, was based there,
18    and like any other army, it engaged in warfare.
19            Since the beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, up until the
20    time of the Srebrenica operation, the VRS had data on a number of members
21    of the 28th Division who had committed crimes.  The command of the
22    Bratunac Brigade had a list, had in its possession a list of people, that
23    is to say, members of the 28th Division, who had been suspected of
24    committing war crimes, and this list was handed over to the Main Staff,
25    the headquarters, that is to say, the command of the Drina Corps.

 1            It was quite normal, therefore, to check out the people and to see
 2    whether these members were not among the civilian population in Potocari
 3    or around Potocari, to see whether any of those from that list of war
 4    criminals were amongst the population and had mingled with the population.
 5       Q.   The representatives of UNPROFOR were informed about this on both
 6    meetings, on the 11th and on the 12th.  No, I'm sorry, on the 12th, the
 7    evening of the 12th, and the following day.
 8       A.   Yes.  The commander of the Main Staff at the meeting directly
 9    imparted this information to the commander of the UNPROFOR battalion.
10       Q.   General Radinovic, let us move on to another area now, and that is
11    the pulling out and withdrawal of the 28th Division and the breakthrough.
12    You said that the forces of the 28th Division had collected up in the
13    village of Susnjari, and the Trial Chamber has sufficient other evidence
14    about that, that this was on the 11th of July.
15            When these forces appeared on the periphery of the enclave, when
16    did that happen?  When did they appear on the periphery of the enclave?
17       A.   There are two facts which are relevant in establishing when they
18    appeared.  On the 11th, it is incontestable that those forces were
19    concentrated in that area and that they were preparing for a breakthrough.
20    From the report of the Chief of Staff of the Zvornik Brigade who sat in
21    for the brigade commander who was at Zepa, that report was dated the 13th
22    of July, the 13th of July, which means that on the 13th of July, the Chief
23    of Staff of the Zvornik Brigade, assuming the role of commander, sent to
24    the command of the Drina Corps a report in which he clearly states that he
25    knows that the column has started moving towards his zone of

 1    responsibility.  And that means, and from that document I'm able to
 2    conclude, that for him to be able to send this, dispatch this report out
 3    on the 13th, he must have known about it on the 12th.  So the first
 4    contacts were quite certainly on that day, and already on the 13th we have
 5    combat contact.
 6       Q.   Do you have any information as to which forces of the 28th
 7    Division were there, how long the column was, what kind of weapons they
 8    had, and the composition of the column itself?
 9       A.   This differs from one source to another.  Serb sources assess
10    this -- Serb sources say that the number is between 10.000 and 15.000 and
11    that a third were armed.  In the testimony of Mr. Butler, the number of
12    armed persons was lower.  But I don't think that we need say specific
13    numbers.  The column was a numerous one and there was quite a considerable
14    number of armed men.  According to my analysis, if you look at the overall
15    men that the 28th Division had, if we know that they were not captured or
16    did not surrender, then it would be quite certain that in that column
17    there would be between 7.000 and 10.000 members of the 28th Division.
18       Q.   What operative formation were the forces of the 28th Division
19    moving in, and what, according to military doctrine, is that action they
20    took called?  How do you refer to it?  What is the term used to denote it?
21       A.   According to some information and certain data that I found in the
22    documents of the Chief of Staff of the Zvornik Brigade and his reports to
23    the command of the Drina Corps of the 13th and 14th - and he stresses that
24    the first combat contacts with the members of the 28th Division took place
25    here, where you see the blue arrows, on the 13th - the bulk of the column

 1    from the Susnjari and Potocari region could not have, in such a short
 2    space of time, crossed such a large area.
 3            I now conclude, on the basis of that, that most probably the
 4    command of the 28th Division had formed a forerunner, an advanced group
 5    which started out earlier on.  And in view of the fact that in the reports
 6    and later documents I failed to find that any of the commanders had -- or
 7    leaders of the units had fallen, had been casualties, except one, Major
 8    Golic, Ejub Golic, I therefore conclude that in this advanced group or
 9    party, that the whole commanding cadre of the 28th Division was in that
10    advanced group and that that advanced group pulled out before the main
11    fighting began in the zone of responsibility in the Drina Corps against
12    the forces of the 28th Division.
13            So this operative formation for withdrawal, for pulling out, had
14    an advanced group, it had the main column, without enough operative links
15    between the advanced group and the main column, and it would appear that
16    it was not the goal of the advanced column to allow the column to be able
17    to pull out but to reach the area controlled by the Muslims as fast as
18    possible.
19            Now, this action that the 28th Division performed, according to
20    military theory and doctrine, is called a breakthrough out of an
21    encirclement, that is to say, to break out of the encirclement.  This
22    action also contains within itself elements of a military action which is
23    called a desist march, which implies a certain formation and order, which
24    means that they must be led by the -- for detachments which enter into
25    combat action with forces preventing the withdrawal, they break through

 1    those ambushes and obstacles in order to prevent their withdrawal.  They
 2    expand this area, place security on their flanks, and the columns march
 3    through these openings in their withdrawal.  And this occurs at all of the
 4    spots where positions are organised to prevent this from taking place, to
 5    prevent this pulling out.
 6            It is obvious that the command of the 28th Division did not do
 7    that.  It did not do that for the simple reason that according to data and
 8    information and a portion of the testimony of Mr. Ruez, what happened was
 9    that at individual places, the Muslim forces in retreat suffered heavy
10    losses.
11       Q.   The VRS also took certain action prescribed in military doctrine
12    with respect to the combat formations of the 28th Division.  What were
13    those actions?
14       A.   The expected combat actions in situations of this kind is to
15    pursue the enemy.  It is called "pursuing the enemy."  And after losing
16    combat contact with the enemy, forces are established for pursuing,
17    pursuing forces.  Pursuing columns, pursuing forces, pursuing detachments,
18    various pursuing formations are established and put into effect in
19    situations of that kind.
20            Now, what is the characteristic feature here?  For this process
21    and for an assessment of this entire complex of activities, that is to
22    say, the withdrawal of the 28th Division and all the consequences that
23    arose from that, it is highly unusual that the command of the Drina Corps
24    did not organise the pursuing of the enemy, pursuit of the enemy.  Why he
25    didn't do that, I cannot say.  All I know is that he did not.  Probably

 1    because in the zone of responsibility of the Drina Corps, the forces
 2    existed which were able to apply another method of preventing the forces
 3    of the 28th Division from moving out of the zone of responsibility under
 4    the Drina Corps, and the main reason was that immediately after the end of
 5    the operation for Srebrenica, the Drina Corps was ordered to continue with
 6    the Zepa operation.
 7            It is not natural to begin a second operation until you have
 8    completed, fully completed the first, with all the consequences that that
 9    entailed, the consequences of the previous operation.  But it is the right
10    of command to do so, and we have seen that, in fact, it was an operative
11    error that that was so.
12            Had it turned out that the Drina Corps after completing the
13    Srebrenica operation had gone in pursuit of the enemy which was
14    withdrawing, it is quite certain that the consequences to the 28th
15    Division would have been much more serious than they actually were.
16       Q.   When was the first combat contact established of the 28th Division
17    and the VRS in the zone of responsibility of the Drina Corps?  When did
18    this -- where did this happen, what were the conflicting, combatting
19    parties, and what were the consequences for the VRS and, of course, for
20    the 28th Division?
21       A.   I will adhere to the testimony of Mr. Ruez here.  At the tip of
22    this first arrow there is a place called Bare, and Mr. Ruez claims that on
23    the 13th of July, that that was where the first serious settling of
24    accounts took place between the force -- with the forces of the 28th
25    Division who were in retreat and the forces that were in control of that

 1    territory.
 2            According to Ruez's testimony, there were about 600 members of the
 3    28th Division who were killed on the occasion.  I personally think that
 4    such heavy losses could have been expected in view of the fact -- in view
 5    of the situation that the 28th Division found itself in, and bearing in
 6    mind first and foremost the fact that it was not capacitated for such a
 7    complicated and risky operation, this operation of retreat and
 8    breakthrough, the encirclement in enemy territory which was more than a
 9    hundred kilometres in depth.  And if we know that it is not a straight
10    line, then they weren't moving in a straight line.  And if we bear in mind
11    the fact that along that axis of movement, there had to have been
12    resistance and retreat through three or four -- through four or five lines
13    or positions.
14       Q.   Let me give some additional information.  It was Mr. Ruez's
15    testimony of the 14th of March, page 594 and 595, where he says that in
16    the zone that you yourself mentioned in 1996, about 600 bodies were found
17    when -- in the course of an operation conducted by, I think it was the
18    Finnish experts, not linked to the Prosecution's activities.  So in that
19    zone, about 500 bodies were uncovered.  It is assumed that they are Muslim
20    soldiers and that they died in battle because there were no other
21    indicators.
22            General Radinovic, could you tell the Trial Chamber what the depth
23    of the area was that the 28th Division had to overcome, and what time they
24    needed for that under the prevailing operative conditions?
25       A.   In my reply to your previous question, towards the end of it when

 1    I explained it was a risky business, it was a risky undertaking for these
 2    forces to decide to break through, I said that the depth -- because it was
 3    not linear movement, they weren't proper roads, they were paths, winding
 4    paths, that this was between 80 and 100 kilometres in depth.
 5            Now, during the fighting in combat, it is a route and a distance
 6    which it is difficult to cross in less than eight to ten days, but the
 7    28th Division did so in a shorter space of time, that is to say, quicker;
 8    probably partially because the units along its path, along their path,
 9    failed to do what they should have done in a situation of that kind and
10    had they put a stop to this retreat in the way that that should have been
11    done.
12       Q.   General Radinovic, in response to my question you told and
13    explained to the Trial Chamber what the VRS failed to do and what it
14    should have done in pursuit of the enemy, but I think my question was what
15    action did the VRS take.  Not what action it did not take, but what action
16    did it take.  How did it deal with the 28th Division?
17       A.   The army of Republika Srpska applied a method which was available
18    to it at the time, which was open to it -- in view of the fact that the
19    Drina Corps immediately after the Srebrenica operation received an
20    assignment to launch another operation for Zepa, they applied the method
21    of ambushes, ambushes at these lines, and they used the forces that were
22    available to them in the area.
23            So these ambushes and obstacles were placed immediately after the
24    ring around Srebrenica.  The next one was positioned at the
25    Kasaba-Konjevic Polje road, the following one is at Snagovo where the

 1    arrows are, the two arrows, and the fourth was in the zone of
 2    responsibility of the 4th Battalion of the Zvornik Brigade.  Where it says
 3    the 16th of July, that position there.
 4            So that unit in retreat had to overcome several successive
 5    ambushes and obstacles that the forces had placed in the zone of
 6    responsibility of the Drina Corps.
 7            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] I'd like to ask the usher to prepare
 8    Prosecution Exhibit 540 and 550, Exhibits 540 and 550.
 9       Q.   General Radinovic, in retreating from the zone of responsibility
10    from the Srebrenica zone, the 28th Division established combat contact
11    with part of the forces belonging to the Drina Corps, and they were the
12    forces of the Zvornik Brigade.  What operative problems did the Chief of
13    Staff of the Zvornik Brigade have to solve from the 13th of July, and how
14    did he endeavour to solve the problems that arose?
15       A.   I have a document that I've already mentioned dated the 13th of
16    July.  It is the Chief of Staff of the Zvornik Brigade in the role of
17    commander, sending --
18       Q.   I apologise, just one moment.  It is Exhibit 540.
19            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could the usher please place Exhibit
20    540 on the ELMO so as to facilitate the work of the Trial Chamber.
21       A.   On the 13th, therefore, the command of the Zvornik Brigade, and
22    the Chief of Staff acting as commander, informs the command of the Drina
23    Corps that with the aim of blocking the groups retreating towards Tuzla
24    and -- from Srebrenica and Tuzla, and that the following measures were
25    undertaken: that a platoon of the military police had organised an ambush

 1    at Dzafin Kamen, and that is here.  That is this location here, Dzafin
 2    Kamen.  That was where the military police platoon was.  And some
 3    intervention platoons from the 5th Battalion and the 6th Battalion, they
 4    organised an ambush here in this part.  And it is the Snagovo region,
 5    Snagovo.
 6            Now, what am I able to deduce from that?  I am able to deduce from
 7    that that the commander - the Chief of Staff of the Zvornik Brigade acting
 8    as commander, actually - did not assess the situation seriously enough,
 9    nor was he conscious of the forces that he had to face, until he came face
10    to face with them in this area here.  Only then, when he came up against
11    those forces, the forces of the 28th Division, and when they were able to
12    break the ambush that was set up, and when they moved -- started moving
13    towards Zvornik, from that time on, that is to say, from the 14th of July,
14    in actual fact, the Chief of Staff was -- asked the command of the brigade
15    to return - he was panic-stricken, if I can use that term - and parts of
16    the brigade at Zepa to deal with this serious operational situation which
17    occurred in the zone of responsibility of that brigade.  And as a result
18    of his demands, the commander, the Corps Commander, orders the Zvornik
19    Brigade to return to the zone of responsibility.  And already on the 15th
20    of July the commander of the Zvornik Brigade reached the zone of
21    responsibility with the men he had brought from Zepa, and that is when a
22    very serious settling of accounts began with the 28th Division.  And that
23    was a life-and-death -- they fought to the death.  It was a life-and-death
24    situation.
25            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] May we have Prosecution Exhibit 550

 1    placed on the ELMO now, please.  It is a daily combat report, that is to
 2    say, an extraordinary report of the Zvornik Brigade, an interim report, an
 3    interim report which illustrates the position that the Zvornik Brigade
 4    found itself in.
 5       Q.   General Radinovic, when did the commander of the Zvornik Brigade
 6    return to his area of responsibility and what kind of steps did he take in
 7    order to improve the situation in his area of responsibility?
 8       A.   This report also comes from the Chief of Staff acting as
 9    commander.  It is dated the 14th of July, 1995 and it is a consequence of
10    an ambush which took place in his area of responsibility.  He is informing
11    the Drina Corps command that a group -- that is, that the column of
12    Muslims is 3 kilometres long and that he is expecting that they should
13    attempt to have contact with the forces of his brigade.  He further on
14    states:  "Try to find some means of bringing in more intervention forces
15    early in the morning," otherwise he would be unable to defend his area of
16    responsibility.
17            This is an appeal issued by the brigade commander, and the Drina
18    Corps command replied to his request by pulling out the forces of the
19    Zvornik Brigade from the Zepa area and sending those forces back to the
20    area of responsibility of that brigade.  And the commander in question is
21    beginning to deal with the situation in his area of responsibility.  This
22    turned out not to be enough, and what ensued was a very complex
23    operational situation which might have led to the separation -- to the
24    splitting of the area of responsibility of that brigade in two parts.
25       Q.   How do you assess the situation in the area of the Zvornik Brigade

 1    and what kind of consequences could be expected from the intensity of the
 2    combat activities?
 3       A.   The intensity of the combat activities in the area of the Zvornik
 4    Brigade from the 14th of July, then going on to the 15th, the 16th, and
 5    the 17th of July, is something that I can qualify as very high intensity.
 6    So the highest level of intensity took place in the area where we can read
 7    the date, the 16th of July, 1995, at the tip of the arrow there, in that
 8    particular area.  Those activities were taking place at such an intensity
 9    that it was -- it could be expected that the 28th Division would suffer
10    great losses.  During those activities the Zvornik Brigade suffered losses
11    amongst their members.  They had 39 killed in combat, 5 missing, who were
12    also probably killed, and over 200 men were placed en ordre de combat.
13            Let me give you an illustration to try to describe for you how
14    intense the attack was.  It was the 4th Battalion of the Zvornik Brigade
15    who found itself in the most difficult situation, where this arrow is on
16    the map.  The forces of the 28th Division managed to pierce through the
17    positions of the 4th Battalion and to take up control of three trenches
18    and to capture a Howitzer battery and three mortars, and practically
19    speaking they were faced with the possibility of being wiped out from that
20    particular area, the members of the 4th Battalion.
21            The brigade commander did something unusual.  He opened up the
22    corridor for the members of the 28th Division to pass, and until the main
23    forces of the column had passed through, the corridor was not closed
24    again.  The corridor would be closed again only on the 17th of July.  And
25    one can say that by the 17th of July, the main forces of the 28th Division

 1    left the area of responsibility of the Drina Corps and managed to reach
 2    the area of Nezuk, which was their objective, that is, the territory which
 3    was under the control of the forces of the 2nd Corps -- 2nd Tuzla Corps of
 4    the BH army.
 5       Q.   General Radinovic, do you have any information as to the type of
 6    losses of the 28th Division in the area of responsibility of the Zvornik
 7    Brigade at that time?
 8       A.   From the documents that I had access to, from the material that I
 9    studied, I was not able to establish the exact number of individuals
10    killed in action.  However, in view of the intensity of activities and the
11    depth of the territory and the situation in which the members of the 28th
12    Division found themselves, it is perfectly realistic to expect such losses
13    to be very high.  I would measure them in thousands, not in hundreds.  But
14    I cannot refer you to any specific document to that effect.
15            As regards the books that I studied and the testimony of the
16    witnesses that took part in that pull-out, mention is made of very high
17    casualties at at least two locations: the village of Bare and also at the
18    location just above Snagovo, where you can again read this date, the 16th
19    of July, 1995.  So at those two locations, according to what I was able to
20    see from the documents that I studied, the 28th Division suffered greatest
21    losses.
22       Q.   General Radinovic, as regards the issuing of the order to break
23    through, what could the command of the 28th Division realistically expect
24    if there had been such a decision, that is, the decision to attempt a
25    breakthrough?  What could they realistically expect?

 1       A.   Well, I think you would be best assisted in your question if I
 2    tell you that it all depended on the individual who made such a decision,
 3    and practically speaking I think that he sacrificed the 28th Division by
 4    making such a decision.  We have had numerous examples in history of
 5    warfare of that kind.  The Liberation Army of Yugoslavia in the valley of
 6    the Sutjeska River in 1943 sacrificed their 7th Banja Division in order to
 7    defend themselves from -- in order to protect 4.000 wounded combatants
 8    from the German troops.  Practically speaking, that division was
 9    destroyed.  I don't know what were the objectives of the Supreme Command
10    of the BH army concerning the 28th Division.  Why would they sacrifice
11    them?  That was an operation that had been ordered by them to the 28th
12    Division, and in view of the conditions and circumstances for the
13    execution of such an operation, the objective was, practically speaking,
14    unrealistic and unfathomable.  It is hard to imagine for a command who was
15    aware of the consequences that could ensue from such an operation to
16    actually order the execution of it.
17            Once again, I have to repeat that had the forces of the Drina
18    Corps had carried out a proper pursuit, there would be no members of the
19    28th Division any more, and they did not engage in that pursuit because
20    they were busy with the Zepa operations.
21            I cannot believe that the officers of the supreme command of the
22    BiH army were unable to foresee the consequences of their steps.  They are
23    professional officers; they went to the same schools as I did; and they
24    were, in my opinion, perfectly aware of the consequences.  As to why they
25    still went ahead with the decision, I really don't know.

 1       Q.   After the pullout of the members of the 28th Division, there was a
 2    lot of discussion regarding the composition of that division, and members
 3    who went across and managed to reach the territory under the BiH army
 4    control.  Could you tell us something about that?
 5       A.   I had an opportunity to read what General Sefer Halilovic said
 6    about it who was the Commander-in-Chief before General Delic.  I think
 7    that he was actually right when he spoke about the behaviour and the
 8    conduct of the commander of the 2nd Corps and the Supreme Command of the
 9    BiH army.
10            The only permissible action when the 28th Division was ordered to
11    attempt a breakthrough, and actually the only justified and possible
12    method and approach was to find free forces and to have them launch an
13    attack from the area, from the direction of Tuzla, and to start moving
14    towards the forces of the 28th Division.
15            I know quite a few things about that matter, and I can say that if
16    that had not been ordered, and if the 28th Division had indeed been
17    ordered to attempt a breakthrough, the only thing that I can conclude is
18    that they were actually sacrificed.  And it was -- they were lucky to the
19    extent that the Drina Corps forces were busy with the Zepa operation;
20    otherwise, had that not been the case, the consequences would be far
21    worse.  They would be annihilated.
22       Q.   General Radinovic, you already told us that it was impossible to
23    establish the accurate number of Muslim combatants who were killed during
24    the breakthrough.  What happened with the terrain afterwards?  Was a
25    proper clearing operation of the battlefield taken up?  What is your

 1    knowledge to that effect, and what can you tell us about that?
 2       A.   Well, I have to be very critical about the conduct of the forces
 3    of the VRS and the units of the Drina Corps in that respect.  There is an
 4    obligation which is incumbent on the commanders of the local units which
 5    consists of proper searches of the terrain with the objective to locate
 6    and find the remaining groups of the enemy forces, and also for the
 7    purposes of discovering all kinds of obstacles that can be expected in the
 8    theatre of operations.
 9            As part of that action, the searching of the terrain, there is
10    something that we call clearing up the battlefield.  It is an action which
11    is designed to restore the terrain in question and to bring it back into
12    its former state.  It also includes the location of bodies, first of all
13    bodies of people, and then corpses of cattle, and then it includes
14    subsequent burial of those bodies.  Whether it was done or not I don't
15    know.  I believe it was.
16            However, and this is quite important, that there is no -- there
17    are no documents, there are no reports which would with a certain amount
18    of certainty tell us something about that particular activity.  I haven't
19    crossed -- I haven't come across any single report which would contain
20    data about the number of bodies collected and buried as a part of the
21    clearing up of the battlefield.
22            So that is a very serious obstacle when it comes to the need to
23    establish what happened in the area of responsibility of the Drina Corps,
24    in particular, in that part of the terrain where the members of the 28th
25    Division attempted a breakthrough.

 1       Q.   General Radinovic, while studying these materials, you have
 2    probably come across a number of documents which indicate that during the
 3    breakthrough of the 28th Division through the territory of the area of
 4    responsibility of the Drina Corps, that there was a certain number of
 5    Muslim prisoners of war at that time in that particular area.
 6       A.   I had an opportunity to study an interim combat report of the
 7    commander of the Zvornik Brigade which was dated the 15th of July.
 8       Q.   We will spend some more time discussing this particular document,
 9    if you can be brief and just tell me whether you know about it.
10       A.   Yes, I know about the document, and I studied it.
11       Q.   Could you tell us if it was in the interest of the VRS to
12    liquidate as many war prisoners as possible?
13       A.   No.
14       Q.   Why?
15       A.   That would be completely contrary to the interests of the VRS.
16    I'm now not talking about humanitarian and legal considerations which are
17    self-implied and understood; I'm talking about the operational aspect of
18    the operation.
19            At the time of the capture of the members of the 28th Division,
20    the VRS had a number of prisoners at the Muslim side, prisoners of their
21    own.  So the only factor which would force the Muslim side to accept an
22    exchange was the fact that there were as many war prisoners as possible on
23    the other side, so they needed to have enough people for an exchange.
24            So that would have been the main interest of the VRS, to have as
25    many of prisoners of war as possible for the purposes of an exchange and

 1    not to liquidate all of them.  Once again, I'm not talking about the legal
 2    aspects of the -- that particular portion of the operation.  That goes
 3    without saying.
 4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I think that this
 5    would be the convenient moment to adjourn for the day.
 6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, indeed, Mr. Visnjic.  We
 7    will call it a day, but I have to ask you before we finish how much time
 8    do you think you will still need to complete the examination-in-chief?
 9            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I'm running a little
10    late, but I hope that we will be able to finish the examination-in-chief
11    tomorrow.  At this point, I cannot tell you whether we'll be able to wind
12    up by 1.00 or 2.00, but we will do our best to complete, to finish the
13    examination-in-chief tomorrow.
14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We will see.  Are you sure that
15    we will be able to finish this tomorrow this week, because if the
16    Prosecutor is going to dedicate the same amount of time as the Defence, I
17    don't think that we will be able to finish with this testimony by the end
18    of the week, but we will see about that tomorrow.
19            Mr. Cayley, do you have any ideas as regards to time that you
20    think you will need for your cross-examination?
21            MR. CAYLEY:  Well, I have to say, Your Honour, based on practice,
22    at least as much time as the Defence has taken; but I hope to try and move
23    to some of the more fundamental issues that the witness has spoken about
24    rather than spending a lot of time on the periphery, but probably at least
25    three days.

 1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, because we have one more
 2    witness for this week that was supposed to be heard on Monday, the one who
 3    was supposed to arrive on Monday.  Is he still travelling?
 4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I believe that
 5    Mr. Petrusic has more information about that.
 6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.  You know that we
 7    always try to make a programme and not to be caught by surprise at the end
 8    of the week.
 9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, the witness who was
10    supposed to arrive last week did not arrive on time because the flight was
11    cancelled; however, yesterday afternoon I was informed that even that
12    flight, due to weather conditions, had to be cancelled for today.  So it
13    will be only tonight that I will have information as to when he will
14    arrive.
15            We will discuss the issue with the Prosecution.  I don't know how
16    long they intend to cross-examine this witness and the following witness.
17    I don't know whether we should -- whether the whole matter will be -- will
18    go over, will spill over next week, but I'm afraid that I will be able
19    only tomorrow afternoon to inform you on the situation.
20            If we have only that witness next week, if he's the only witness
21    that we would have for next week, maybe it would be a better idea to bring
22    it back in January, but please allow me some time to try and find the
23    reasonable solution together with my colleagues from the Prosecution this
24    afternoon.
25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, the reason I asked that

 1    question was because I was hoping that we would be able to finish, and if
 2    necessary, that we could sit tomorrow afternoon if we can hear both
 3    witnesses.  If that is not possible, we can, I don't know, call him in
 4    January or perhaps on Monday.  But I have imparted to you our concerns,
 5    and I hope that you will be able to give us some information tomorrow.
 6            We will continue tomorrow morning at 9.20.  The hearing is
 7    adjourned for the day.
 8                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 3:02 p.m., to
 9                          be reconvened on Wednesday, the 6th day of December,
10                          2000, at 9:20 a.m.
