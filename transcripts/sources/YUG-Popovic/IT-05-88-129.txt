 7    case.

10            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you very much.  I'd like
11    to ask for the appearances first starting with the Prosecution.
12            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Good afternoon, Your Honour.  Peter McCloskey and
13    Janet Stewart.
14            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you.
15            I would like to ask the Defence counsel to introduce himself.
16            MR. STOJANOVIC:  Good afternoon, Mr. McCloskey, Ms. Stewart, my
17    name is Miodrag Stojanovic, today pro bono lawyer for
18    Mr. Ljubomir Borovcanin.  Thank you.
19            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] I'd like to greet all those
20    present here, I'd like to greet the Prosecutor as well as the Defence
21    counsel and I would also like to greet the accused as well as the
22    registrar, the court deputy, the Chamber legal officer, as well as all
23    those who assist us within and outside this courtroom.
24            First of all, I want to make sure that the accused is hearing what
25    we are saying and can understand what we are saying in his own language.

 1            Mr. Borovcanin, can you hear what I'm saying?
 2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Your Honour, yes I can hear and I
 3    can understand.
 4            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you very much.  You can
 5    sit down.
 6            Before moving on to the procedure under Rule 62, I would like to
 7    remind you of the following with regard to the indictment.  The accused
 8    was the deputy commander of a special police brigade of the Ministry of
 9    the Interior and he was present from 11th of July to 18th of July 1995 in
10    Bratunac, Potocari, Sandici, Kravica, Srebrenica, and Zvornik or around
11    these areas.  According to the indictment, the accused reported to
12    Radoslav Krstic who was then Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps of the
13    Bosnian Serb army.  Units under Borovcanin's command were deployed from
14    12th of July to 18th of July 1995 in Potocari, Sandici, Kravica, and
15    Zvornik, and around these areas.  In the several days following the attack
16    on Srebrenica, VRS and MUP forces captured, detained, summarily executed,
17    and buried over 7.000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys from the Srebrenica
18    enclave and forcibly transferred the Bosnian Muslim women and children of
19    the Srebrenica area out of the enclave.
20            The indictment against the accused refers to his alleged
21    involvement in opportunistic killings in Potocari, opportunistic killings
22    in Bratunac, wide scale and organised killings in Potocari and Tisca,
23    killings and mistreatments of prisoners captured along the Bratunac-Milici
24    road, and wide-scale and organised killings in the Zvornik area as well as
25    other opportunistic killings.

 1            It is also stated in the indictment that the accused together with
 2    other VRS and MUP officers and units as identified in the indictment was a
 3    member of and knowingly participated in a joint criminal enterprise the
 4    common purpose of which was, among other things, the forcible transfer of
 5     -- to forcibly transfer the women and children from the Srebrenica
 6    enclave to Kladanj on 12th of July and 13th of July, 1995, and from 12th
 7    of July, 1995, until and about 19th of July, 1995, to capture detain
 8    summarily execute by firing squad, bury and rebury thousands of Bosnian
 9    Muslim men and boys age 16 to 60 from the Srebrenica enclave.
10            The indictment charges Ljubomir Borovcanin on the basis of Article
11    7(1) of the Statute on the basis of his individual criminal responsibility
12    and on the basis of Article 7(3) of the Statute on the basis of his
13    superior responsibility with one count of complicity in genocide Article 4
14    of the Statute, complicity and genocide.  Four counts of crimes against
15    humanity, Article 5 of the Statute, extermination, murder, persecutions on
16    political, racial, and religious grounds and other inhumane acts, forcible
17    transfer; and one count of violation of the laws or customs of war,
18    Article 3 of the Statute, murder.
19            I have given a brief summary of the contents of the indictment.  I
20    would like to remind the parties that following an order issued by the
21    President of the Tribunal on 1st of April, 2005, this case was assigned to
22    Trial Chamber 2 of which I am a member.  I would also like to remind you
23    that the initial appearance took place on 7th of April, 2005 before Judge
24    Carmel Agius who is the Presiding Judge of Chamber 2, and during the last
25    initial on the 7th of April, 2005, once the indictment had been read out

 1    to him, the accused stated that he was not in a position too make his
 2    position known about the indictment and he was granted 30 days as provided
 3    by the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, he was granted 30 days to prepare
 4    his plea according to Rule 62 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
 5            Today's hearing is a Further Initial Appearance of the accused in
 6    order to know whether he is going to plead guilty or not guilty.
 7    Furthermore, on 20th of April, 2005, I was assigned as Pre-Trial Judge in
 8    this case.  Therefore, I am now going to move on to the procedures
 9    provided for by Rule 62 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and I'm
10    going to ask the accused to rise.
11            Sir, I would like you to state your last name and first name for
12    the transcript.
13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] My name is Ljubomir Borovcanin.
14            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Please tell me what is your date
15    of birth and where you were born.
16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I was born on the 27th of February,
17    1960, the municipality of Han Pijesak, Bosnia-Herzegovina.
18            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you very much.
19            During the first initial appearance, Judge Agius probably told you
20    that as an accused, you enjoy a number of rights.  These rights are listed
21    in Articles 20 and 21 of the Statute of the Tribunal.  During the first
22    initial appearance, these Articles were read out to you so we don't need
23    to do that again.  But I'd like to ask you, nevertheless, if you've
24    understood that you have rights and I would like to ask you whether you
25    would like these rights to be read out to you again.

 1            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I have understood my
 2    rights and there's no need for you to remind me of them.
 3            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you.  You also have the
 4    right to have the indictment read out to you in its entirety but you also
 5    have the right to waive that right if you, yourself, and your counsel,
 6    have read it before.  So I'm going to turn to your Defence counsel to ask
 7    him whether you waive that right, the right of having the indictment read
 8    out to you.
 9            MR. STOJANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour, having
10    consulted Mr. Borovcanin, we agree that there is no need to have the
11    indictment read out.  Thank you.
12            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  So you -- can you
13    confirm that you do not wish to have the indictment read out to you again
14    in it's entirety.
15            THE ACCUSED:  [No audible response]
16            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] All right.  Let's move on to the
17    main point of this hearing.  I'm going to ask you whether you would like
18    to enter a plea and to do so, I'm going to ask you that particular
19    question regarding each count of the indictment and then I will ask you
20    the question and you will give me your answer one way or the other.
21            Under count 1 of the indictment, you are charged on the basis of
22    Article 7(1), individual criminal responsibility, and under Article 7(3)
23    of the Statute with complicity in genocide punishable under Article 4(3)
24    (e) of the Statute of the Tribunal.  Do you plead guilty or not guilty to
25    that count?

 1            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Your Honour, not guilty.
 2            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you.  Under Count 2, you
 3    are charged on the basis of Article 7(1) individual criminal
 4    responsibility and article 7(3) of the Statute with extermination a crime
 5    against humanity punishable by Articles 5(b) of the Statute of the
 6    Tribunal.  Do you plead guilty or not guilty to that count?
 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Not guilty.
 8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Under count 3, you are charged on
 9    the basis of Article 7(1), individual criminal responsibility, and on the
10    basis of Article 7(3) of the Statute with murder, a crime against humanity
11    punishable under Article 5(a) of the Statute Tribunal.  Do you plead
12    guilty or not guilty to that count?
13            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Not guilty.
14            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Under count 4, you are charged
15    on the basis of Article 7(1), individual criminal responsibility, and on
16    the basis of Article 7(3) with murder, a violation of the laws or customs
17    of war punishable under Article 3 of the Statute of the Tribunal.  Do you
18    plead guilty or not guilty to that count?
19            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Not guilty.
20            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Under count 5, you are charged

 6    count?
 7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Your Honour, honourable Judge, not
 8    guilty.
 9            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you very much, you may sit
10    down.
11            Mr. Registrar, I would like you to note that the accused has
12    pleaded not guilty to the six counts of the indictment.
13            Sir, you've pleaded not guilty and it is my duty to inform you
14    that before the trial, there is going to be what we call a pre-trial stage
15    and during that pre-trial stage that can last a few months, the Prosecutor
16    is -- has to disclose to your counsel all the material at its disposal.
17    There will be exchanges of -- between the Prosecution and the Defence.
18    The Defence will be in a position to file a number of motions regarding
19    the indictment, to challenge the indictment, for example.  There will be
20    this phase dedicated to the pre-trial stage.
21            As I said previously, the aim of this stage is to organise
22    exchanges between the parties for the trial to be able to start as early
23    as possible and the other objective is to allow me, as a Pre-Trial Judge,
24    to make sure that everything is going according to plan and that you
25    don't -- you are not faced with any problems in detention.  You are

 1    currently in custody.  According to the rules under Article -- under Rule
 2    65, you can file a motion for provisional release.  It is my duty to
 3    immediately turn to the Prosecutor to check that in accordance with Rule
 4    66(a)(i) the Prosecutor will or has already made available already to the
 5    Defence copies of the supporting material which accompanied the
 6    indictment.
 7            Can you please tell me if you've disclosed these documents to the
 8    Defence or if you are going to do it.
 9            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Your Honour, we have not yet disclosed the
10    material and the reason is because the situation in terms of assigned
11    counsel is still slightly undecided.  The Prosecution knows Mr. Stojanovic
12    very well and has complete faith and trust in him and his abilities yet,
13    as he will tell you, he is still, I believe, just appointed as duty lawyer
14    and as soon as OLAD firms up the appointment, we will be able to provide
15    the material to -- to the permanent lawyer unless for some reason
16    Mr. Borovcanin wants that material before that.  But I'm sure that he
17    knows that starts the time running.
18            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  Mr. Borovcanin,
19    you've been informed that the counsel here is the duty counsel who is here
20    to assist you.  Nothing has been decided yet with regard to your counsel,
21    whether you're going to have another counsel, whether counsel here is
22    going to be your counsel for this case.
23            Now, with regard to your counsel, have you made a decision one way
24    or the other?
25            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I have proposed, as

 1    lead counsel for my defence, I have proposed lead counsel, I think the
 2    procedure is ongoing and that the matter will be settled in a few days'
 3    time.  So as far as disclosure is concerned, the best thing is for us to
 4    wait until that -- for that procedure to be completed.
 5            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  I take good note of
 6    that.  And it's indeed a good idea to wait for your counsel to be
 7    appointed before starting with disclosure.
 8            You may sit down.
 9            Mr. Stojanovic, would you like to take the floor now?
10            MR. STOJANOVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.  Just to
11    confirm what you've already been informed of by the Prosecution and
12    Mr. Borovcanin, thanks to the transparency of the registry, Mr. Borovcanin
13    has had an opportunity of taking an informed decision as to his lead
14    counsel.  He has already made that decision, the name has been sent into
15    the registry, and as far as we know, the procedure is underway.  And I
16    think that the name of the lead counsel will be disclosed over the next
17    few days and then we'll start the ball rolling in conformity with Rule 45
18    and the appointment of co-counsel.
19            Today as I've already said, I'm here as the duty counsel pro bono
20    and I think that in a short space of time, thanks first of all to the
21    registry and registrar, we'll have a complete Defence team and we'll be
22    ready to go ahead fully manned.  Thank you.
23            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  Mr. Borovcanin, I
24    would like to inform you that as soon as your counsel has been appointed,
25    the Prosecutor will send him all relevant material, then your counsel will

 1    have 30 days to file any preliminary motion based on the material and on
 2    the indictment.  That's the way the procedure is organised.  It might
 3    sound complicated but it's actually rather simple, if you know the Rules
 4    of Procedure and Evidence.  I'm sure you've been given a copy of these
 5    rules.
 6            Furthermore, it is my duty to tell you that every 120 days, I will
 7    have to convene a conference with you and your counsel in order to look at
 8    the development of the case, 120 days, that's four months.  Today is the
 9    5th of May, that leads us to September.  Therefore, we'll meet again in
10    September, at the beginning of September around the 2nd, 3rd or 4th of
11    September to be in compliance with the rules of four months.
12            I have to ask you two things now.  First of all, I have to ask you
13    a question about your conditions in detention.  Is this satisfactory?  Do
14    you have any problems?  Are you in a position to receive visits from
15    members of your family?  Are you in a position to place phone calls?  Are
16    you -- do you have any problems or is everything all right?  If you have
17    any problems, tell me now in order for me to be able to refer the matter
18    to the registry.
19            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Your Honour, thank you for asking.
20    Since my initial appearance I said that everything is satisfactory in the
21    Detention Unit, everything has been done professionally.  Everything is
22    proper.  Nothing has changed, so I have nothing to complain of.  Quite the
23    contrary, my impression is a positive one.
24            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  My second question
25    has to do with your state of health, with your health.  Are you all right?

 1    Do you have anything -- any matter you would like to raise regarding your
 2    health or is there nothing to say about that?
 3            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I have nothing special to say.  Any
 4    ongoing matters are daily taken care of in the Detention Unit so I have
 5    nothing to complain about.  Thank you.
 6            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Thank you.  You may sit down.
 7            Before adjourning for today, I would like to turn to the
 8    Prosecutor to ask him whether there's any matter he would like to raise.
 9    Is there anything you would like to tell us?  You have the floor.
10            MR. MCCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Your Honour.  As I think I had just
11    said before you -- I think it's a good idea to inform counsel and the
12    accused that it's the Prosecution's intention to file a joinder motion and
13    join the cases, his case with the other Srebrenica accused.  And in that
14    regard, the 30-day time limit that is -- that comes to play after they
15    receive the supporting material is not something the Prosecution is going
16    to be pushing, though it's not up to the Prosecution, as we know.
17            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  Yes.  The Prosecutor
18    has just informed you that the Prosecution intends to file a motion for
19    joinder of cases because as part of the so-called Srebrenica case, a
20    number of accused are prosecuted for the same counts and the Prosecution
21    is considering a single trial for all these accused.  This raises a number
22    of issues that have not been resolved at yet but it was necessary for you
23    to be informed of that matter.
24            Mr. Stojanovic, is there anything you would like to say, anything
25    you would like to raise?  You have the floor.

 1            MR. STOJANOVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.  We are
 2    acquainted with the intention of the Prosecution, we have been informed it
 3    have for sometime, and we know about the situation concerning a large
 4    number of accused in the Srebrenica case.  There are eight at the moment,
 5    and as far as I know, we expect the arrival or non-arrival of the ninth.
 6    And we are prepared for this proposal made by the Prosecution and I'm sure
 7    that in the deadline provided by the Rules, we will make our decision as
 8    to whether we are going to appeal or not with respect to the joinder of
 9    cases, the motion for joinder.  In view of the position of Mr. Borovcanin,
10    who is the sole accused from the police structures, so we'll be stating
11    our views on time on that matter.  Thank you.
12            JUDGE ANTONETTI: [Interpretation] Very well.  Thank you very much.
13            We have covered all the points on -- we've dealt with all the
14    points on the agenda, thank you very much.  As I said, we'll meet at the
15    beginning of September.  Thank you very much.
16                          --- Whereupon the further appearance adjourned at
17                          2.47 p.m.
