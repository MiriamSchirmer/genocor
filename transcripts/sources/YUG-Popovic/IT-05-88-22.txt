          2                 [Open session]
          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 10.15 a.m.
          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning,
          8  interpreters, I can see that you are there; good
          9  morning, sound engineers, counsel for the Prosecution,
         10  for the Defence, General Krstic; and also good morning
         11  to the witness and his interpreter.
         12            We shall now resume our case, the Krstic
         13  case.  For the record, we are all here, the same,
         14  except for Judge Wald, who, for urgent and pressing
         15  matters, could not join us.  Under Rule 15 bis,
         16  paragraph (A), the two Judges, Judge Riad and I,
         17  believe that the interests of justice, that is, a fair
         18  and expedient process, requires that we continue
         19  hearing this case.
         20            During the absence of Judge Wald, and she
         21  will be absent for three days, we have decided to
         22  continue hearing the case, and we shall do so by
         23  hearing the evidence that was begun yesterday by the
         24  witness who is already in the witness box.
         25            Mr. McCloskey, it is now up to you.  I should

          1  like to remind the witness and his interpreter that you
          2  are both under oath, and you will now continue to give
          3  your testimony.  Mr. McCloskey, it is now really time
          4  for you.  Thank you.
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          6                 WITNESS:  WITNESS F [Resumed]
          7                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
          8                 Examined by Mr. McCloskey: [Cont'd]
          9       Q.   Witness F, I believe we left off yesterday
         10  where you had described the bodies you'd seen and
         11  photographed, and you were describing them on the
         12  pictures.
         13            Now, let me ask you, how close were you able
         14  to get to those bodies and view them?
         15       A.   Approximately 20 to 25 metres.  I was on a
         16  slope, on an incline, so I didn't see straight ahead.
         17  I looked downwards.
         18       Q.   Were you able to make out the kinds of
         19  clothes that the people were wearing?
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
         21  Mr. McCloskey.  The French booth did not hear your
         22  question.  Could you repeat it, please?
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.
         24       Q.   Were you able to make out the different kinds
         25  of clothing that the people were wearing?

          1       A.   Yes, I could.  The victims had all civilian
          2  clothes; some of them had blue jeans, pullovers,
          3  coats.  But there were no persons with military
          4  clothes.
          5       Q.   Could you make out the sexes of the victims?
          6       A.   They were all men between the ages of
          7  approximately 15 to --
          8            THE INTERPRETER:  -- 45, I believe the
          9  witness said.  The interpreter is not sure.
         10            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         11       Q.   Can you state that again?  There was a little
         12  bit of an interpretation problem.  They didn't make out
         13  your last answer.
         14       A.   They were all men, in the age group 15 to
         15  45.
         16       Q.   And were you able to see any injury on any of
         17  these victims?
         18       A.   Yes.  Some of them had bloodstains on their
         19  backs and at the back of their heads.
         20       Q.   And what did you do after seeing these
         21  victims and photographing them?
         22       A.   I climbed back up and I joined my colleague
         23  who was standing on guard there.  I looked at him.  I
         24  was in shock.  And we immediately returned to the
         25  compound.

          1       Q.   And about what time was that, if you can
          2  recall?
          3       A.   Around noon.
          4       Q.   And did you go back outside the compound any
          5  time that day?
          6       A.   After returning to the compound, I returned,
          7  I had a cup of coffee, and then I went back outside.
          8       Q.   And what was going on outside the compound?
          9       A.   People were still being deported, taken to
         10  buses, just like the first day, actually.
         11       Q.   And I believe you discussed this briefly, but
         12  can you tell us what the senior VRS officers you saw
         13  there -- out there that day?
         14       A.   High-ranking officers, they were all present
         15  again.  Some of them were just standing and looking
         16  whether things were going according to plan, and for
         17  the rest, they didn't do much.
         18       Q.   And can you name the officers whose names you
         19  now know?
         20       A.   The person present in the courtroom was
         21  there, and some others, some people who just were
         22  walking around, not so many, and that was all.
         23       Q.   How about General Mladic?
         24       A.   He was also present, indeed, yes.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  He said they were

          1  standing and looking.  He didn't say looking at what
          2  and standing where.  Can I just ask?
          3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Those officers
          4  were in the vicinity, standing near the vicinity of the
          5  main compound, near the interrogation house, and they
          6  were just watching whether everything was going to
          7  plan, and some of them also went towards the direction
          8  of Srebrenica, the officers.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Near the interrogation house or
         10  near the bodies?
         11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Next to the
         12  interrogation house is where the officers were.
         13            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         14       Q.   And how long did it take until all of the
         15  Muslims were transported from the area outside the
         16  compound?
         17       A.   Till about dusk, 6.00 or 7.00 in the evening,
         18  since it was summertime.  I would like to repeat that I
         19  don't remember the times, I didn't -- when you live
         20  through such days, you don't watch the time, you don't
         21  look at your watch.  One is a bit unstable.
         22       Q.   Did you see anything happen to the belongings
         23  that were in front of the White House after everyone
         24  was transported out of the area?
         25       A.   All around the compound, there were many

          1  personal belongings belonging to those Muslim
          2  civilians, mainly next to this White House, the
          3  interrogation house.  The belongings of all those men
          4  were heaped up, the men who had been separated.  Most
          5  of those belongings were just put on one big heap and
          6  then were set afire.
          7       Q.   And were you able to photograph this?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And if we could show the
         10  witness Exhibit 62.
         11       Q.   Do you recognise this photograph as a
         12  photograph you took?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   And approximately when was this taken?
         15       A.   During the end of the evening, when dusk
         16  broke.
         17       Q.   And was that the same day that the Muslims
         18  were finally all transported out of the area?
         19       A.   That's correct.
         20       Q.   And were you able to see who lit this pile of
         21  belongings on fire?
         22       A.   Negative.
         23       Q.   Could it have been Dutch soldiers?
         24       A.   No.
         25       Q.   Now, the soldiers you saw in black that

          1  you've described earlier, did you ever get close enough
          2  to them to be able to identify if they had any emblems
          3  on insignias on them?
          4       A.   Yes, indeed, I was close to them, but I
          5  couldn't see any emblems.
          6       Q.   Were you able to make out any emblems or
          7  insignia on any of the soldiers that you were close
          8  enough to see during those two days?
          9       A.   No.  The infantry units only had little
         10  strips of fabric on their shoulders, just to show that
         11  they were belonging together, and of course the police
         12  cars had the letters "Police" written on them.  And
         13  that was all the emblems I could see.
         14       Q.   So did you stay in Potocari for about another
         15  week, and then -- until you were finally shipped out
         16  with the rest of your colleagues?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I have no further questions,
         19  Mr. President.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         21  Mr. McCloskey.
         22            Now, Witness F, the time has come for you to
         23  answer the questions which Mr. Petrusic, as I see, will
         24  ask you.  He is one of the counsel for the defence of
         25  General Krstic.
          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
          2  Your Honours, my learned friends.
          3                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
          4       Q.   Good morning, Witness F.  In the beginning of
          5  your testimony, and today, you referred to units
          6  dressed in black uniforms.  Did these units have their
          7  own command?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   And independently of units wearing camouflage
         10  uniforms of somewhat poorer quality, operated on their
         11  own, operated independently?
         12       A.   No, they were independent of the black
         13  units.
         14       Q.   Yes.  My question is they operated
         15  independently of other units, didn't they?
         16       A.   Yes.  They didn't do any business with other
         17  infantry units.
         18       Q.   So those other infantry units had their own
         19  command, didn't they?
         20       A.   Yes.  They mainly consisted of NCOs who went
         21  along with them, along the lines, and the people in
         22  black had their own commanders.  So they were separate
         23  from each other.
         24       Q.   These units, just for the sake of
         25  identification, I will call them the same way you did,

          1  that is, poorer dressed units, wearing uniforms of
          2  worse quality, engaged in combat with the Muslim units,
          3  didn't they?
          4       A.   That's correct.
          5       Q.   Could you tell us where precisely was this
          6  combat in relation to Bratunac-Srebrenica road?  Where
          7  was fighting taking place?
          8       A.   If I could have a map, I could show you, just
          9  to clear things up.
         10            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         11  just a moment while we show the witness the exhibit.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         13  Mr. Petrusic.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I'm sorry.
         15  Perhaps it would even be better if -- Mr. Dubuisson is
         16  suggesting to use Exhibit 2, and then the witness
         17  perhaps could show it on that map.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         19  Mr. Dubuisson will help us now.
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         21  may I make a suggestion, please?  Perhaps this will,
         22  after all, be a better solution.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, I
         24  think you are right, Mr. Petrusic, and I think we
         25  should remove the big map, if it is not necessary.  If

          1  the small map is put on the ELMO, then we can all see
          2  it.  And perhaps we shall not need the big map,
          3  Mr. Dubuisson, perhaps it could be removed.  I think
          4  that it blocks the view for our interpreters, and they
          5  do need to have at least visual communication with
          6  Mr. Petrusic.
          7            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] I should also
          8  like to ask Mr. Petrusic the number of the exhibit.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, for the
         10  record, Exhibit 5A of the Prosecution.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  I
         12  think it is better now, because otherwise we would have
         13  to go into a closed session because if the witness had
         14  to move about, then it would be difficult to provide
         15  the protection measures.
         16            Yes, Mr. Petrusic, I think now it will be all
         17  right.
         18       A.   At that moment, when I was on my location,
         19  looking towards Bratunac, OP Papa, to the eastern side
         20  there were a couple of Muslim fighters, so that is that
         21  side [indicates]; to the north we heard sounds, heavy
         22  engine sounds, heavy vehicles.  It later turned out to
         23  be a Russian T-55 tank.  They came from the
         24  direction -- they came from the western direction.  The
         25  Muslim fighters fired light mortar from the east

          1  towards north, and this fire was answered by Serb
          2  machine-gun fire, not tank fire.  And their position
          3  was such -- my position was such that I saw the shells
          4  coming in, I had to crouch behind my sandbag from time
          5  to time, because also our position was a bit harmed by
          6  this.
          7            In the days before the fall of the enclave,
          8  there were -- for a couple of days, there was heavy
          9  artillery fire to be heard around Srebrenica, and it
         10  all came from the north into Srebrenica.  A couple of
         11  times we had to hide in our bunkers, and in the
         12  vicinity of Potocari, here [indicates] in the
         13  mountains, there was quite some fire.  It was heavy
         14  machine-gun fire and mortar shellings.
         15            From this direction [indicates], here were
         16  Serb positions, there was heavy fire with cannon fire.
         17  MT-12 was the type of those cannons, and that went on
         18  for a couple of days.  Thank you.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         20  Mr. Petrusic, I'm sorry to cut in, but perhaps we need
         21  to have a synthesis of what the witness said, because
         22  we are receiving the interpretation "from here to
         23  here," but we do not know where he was.  Could you give
         24  us the coordinate points?  Where is Bratunac?  Where is
         25  Srebrenica?  And where was the witness?  I think it

          1  will be a synthesis, but this is merely a suggestion,
          2  Mr. Petrusic.
          3            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Precisely that
          4  is what I wanted to ask about the road between Bratunac
          5  and Srebrenica.
          6       Q.   Where exactly did the fighting between Serb
          7  and Muslim forces take place?
          8            If I may be allowed to continue.  The
          9  witness, when pointing, because we have those figures
         10  on the map, perhaps he will keep the pointer on the
         11  figure, or rather on the box, on the square, that he's
         12  showing.
         13       A.   My position was in map square 91, this square
         14  here [indicates], at the top of this square.  I was
         15  looking towards map square 64, 65, the square under 65,
         16  90, and 63.  The Muslim fighters were all in the map
         17  square here [indicates], under this, so that's 59, and
         18  they fired from 59 to --
         19            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness please
         20  repeat the last number?  Could the witness please
         21  repeat the last number?
         22       A.   Square 59 is where the Muslim fighters fired
         23  their mortars, towards square 64, this general
         24  direction [indicates], and this fire was answered with
         25  machine-gun fire, and from time to time cannon shots.

          1  My position was such that I saw the shells come in and
          2  land in this location [indicates].  Sometimes I had to
          3  hide behind my position because of the detonations and
          4  the shells.
          5            In the days before that, before the enclave
          6  fell, there was heavy firing from square 64 -- or, I
          7  correct myself, 65, up till 83, up to and including
          8  83.  Along this line [indicates], there was heavy
          9  artillery mortar fire, and the fire was so heavy that
         10  the compound was shaking in this vicinity.
         11            Around the compound Potocari, I will mark
         12  this with a circle here, there were quite some fights
         13  taking place in the woods here [indicates].  From the
         14  direction of Budak here, square 63, we heard heavy
         15  engine sounds.  It later turned out to be a tank, T-55,
         16  a Russian T-55 tank.  It turned on the way to
         17  Srebrenica, and later on it entered Srebrenica.
         18            Behind the tank there was an armoured vehicle
         19  with an anti-aircraft -- which was used for shooting at
         20  houses, and of course there were many infantry units
         21  with them.
         22            The Muslim fighters which were here already
         23  were seen to be running back and forth while they were
         24  fired at, looking for new positions in the field.  In
         25  63, there were also quite some Muslim fighters.

          1  Apparently, they tried to resist against advancing Serb
          2  military, in square 63 to 66.
          3            I could see all of this, I observed it from
          4  my position, my location on the compound, in map square
          5  90/91.
          6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Excuse me, Mr. President.  My
          7  colleague has pointed out to me that it's not clear who
          8  had the anti-aircraft gun, and perhaps that's an
          9  important factor for this discussion.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  I
         11  think that there have been quite a few problems with
         12  interpretation here.  I believe that the French
         13  interpretation has more or less followed, but while
         14  Mr. McCloskey was speaking, they were still
         15  interpreting the words of the witness.  We should try
         16  to figure out exactly where the anti-aircraft gun was
         17  positioned, I believe that that was the question.
         18  After the witness has answered to that question, I will
         19  then ask Mr. Petrusic to ask specific questions because
         20  the witness has already covered quite a few facts.
         21            But let me ask the witness the following
         22  question:  If we look at the map, if we look at the
         23  circle on the map, I think that Bratunac is in the
         24  north-westerly direction, whereas Srebrenica is
         25  situated towards south.  Is that the case, Witness?

          1            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Could you
          3  therefore be more specific and tell us the exact
          4  position of the AA gun?
          5            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] This
          6  anti-aircraft gun was placed on a vehicle.  I'm not
          7  familiar with the kind of vehicle, but the
          8  anti-aircraft gun was a ZSU-23.2 [Interpreter's Note:
          9  "ZSU-23.2" I believe the witness said] it came from
         10  the direction of OP Papa.  It was the direction
         11  of the compound Potocari, towards the direction of
         12  Srebrenica.  It halted at the edge of a wood,
         13  approximately at a distance of three kilometers --
         14  no, I correct myself -- two kilometres from the
         15  compound.  They were firing at the positions in the
         16  eastern direction, in map square 92, where the Muslim
         17  fighters were at that moment.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         19  Mr. Petrusic, could you now ask your question.
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes,
         21  Mr. President.  My first question was also quite
         22  specific, but the witness elaborated on it.  I will
         23  continue asking very specific questions, Your Honour.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         25  then.  But both of you, both you, Mr. Petrusic, and

          1  counsel for the Prosecution, can always ask the
          2  witness -- can always remind the witness to give
          3  specific answers.
          4            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
          5       Q.   Bearing that in mind, therefore, could you
          6  tell us the time of day when this conflict between
          7  Serbian and Bosnian forces occurred?
          8       A.   They were already busy quite early in the
          9  morning on that day, and the nearer the Serbs advanced,
         10  the fights became heavier.  And during the previous
         11  days, of course, there were also -- we heard some
         12  fights --
         13       Q.   Yes.  Thank you.  Could you now tell us what
         14  date it was?
         15       A.   We're mainly talking about the first day.
         16       Q.   Could you perhaps refer us to a specific
         17  event which took place on a date which you are sure
         18  about, to put it somehow in context?  And then in
         19  respect of that date, if you can please tell us the
         20  exact date of this particular event, which is now
         21  interesting for us.
         22       A.   Those -- around the days of the 10th and the
         23  11th, until the Serbs had entered the enclave, then
         24  there was hardly any fighting anymore.  But I can't
         25  very well remember the dates.  We just lived from day

          1  to day.
          2       Q.   Yesterday, Witness F, you testified about a
          3  police transporter or personnel carrier that arrived in
          4  Potocari.
          5       A.   Do you mean the blue vehicle?
          6       Q.   Yes.
          7       A.   That's correct.  It had also arrived, yes.
          8       Q.   You refer to it as a police personnel
          9  carrier.
         10       A.   That vehicle was a blue vehicle.  It was very
         11  distinctive between all that green materiel.  It was an
         12  armoured vehicle, on wheels.
         13       Q.   Were there any police forces in Potocari?
         14       A.   Yes.  When the troops had all entered, there
         15  were also police officers present, and they mainly
         16  drove Volkswagen Golfs, [Interpreter's Note: "Type E,"
         17  I believe the witness said].  Blue ones.
         18       Q.   When did the Muslim refugees start arriving
         19  in Potocari from the direction of Srebrenica?  Could
         20  you tell us the date, please?
         21       A.   The refugees already had realised that the
         22  tension was mounting, so those refugees had been
         23  gathering a couple of days before the fall, they had
         24  been gathering around the compound.  But to repeat, I
         25  don't know all the dates.

          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
          2  Mr. President -- very well, then.
          3       Q.   Witness F, do you know where the transport of
          4  refugees from Potocari towards Bratunac by buses had
          5  begun?
          6       A.   Around noon.
          7       Q.   On what day, please?
          8       A.   Directly after the fall of the enclave, after
          9  the Serbs had entered.
         10       Q.   Was it on the day after the fall of the
         11  enclave?
         12       A.   The same day the enclave fell and the Serbs
         13  marched next to the compound, immediately vehicles were
         14  put on the disposal for the refugees, to take them
         15  away.
         16       Q.   Did the enclave fall on the 11th of July?
         17       A.   That's correct.
         18       Q.   Therefore, can we say that the evacuations
         19  started on the 12th -- I'm sorry, on the 11th of July?
         20       A.   Immediately after the Serbs had entered, the
         21  buses and trucks came to transport those people.  They
         22  came immediately behind the troops.  So it was
         23  prepared.
         24       Q.   So this took place on the 11th of July?
         25       A.   To my knowledge, yes.

          1       Q.   Was it on that day that you first saw General
          2  Krstic?
          3       A.   That's right.
          4       Q.   The next time you saw him was on the
          5  following day?
          6       A.   I saw him during two days; that's correct.
          7       Q.   So it was on the following day?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Could we say that you yourself concluded
         10  that, in addition to other officers, General Krstic was
         11  trying to look after the things, was trying to make
         12  sure that everything was going on according to a plan?
         13       A.   Yes.  I think that was the case.  Of course,
         14  I didn't know at that time what his function was.
         15  There were several officers present whom I didn't
         16  know.  And it was their affair, of course.
         17       Q.   So it was your conclusion?
         18       A.   Yes, because such an operation is led on a
         19  high level, and that high level is usually present to
         20  see whether everything is going according to plan.  Why
         21  else would they be there?
         22       Q.   So after the second time you saw General
         23  Krstic, you never saw him again in that area?
         24       A.   That's right.
         25       Q.   Did you know that a higher ranking officer of

          1  the VRS was arrested and that proceedings have been
          2  opened against him before this International Tribunal?
          3       A.   I knew that there were proceedings going on,
          4  but I never really followed against whom and why.  I
          5  don't have time for that.  I'm too busy with my work.
          6       Q.   A film was shown here in the Netherlands,
          7  whose authors, I believe, are some BBC journalists.
          8  The subject of the film were the events which took
          9  place in July 1995 in Srebrenica.  The title of the
         10  film was "A Cry from the Grave" or "A Scream from the
         11  Grave."  Have you seen that film, by any chance?
         12       A.   Actually, during five years, I only heard
         13  negative things about Srebrenica.  That is why I did
         14  not -- I didn't want to deal with Srebrenica anymore.
         15  I had enough of it, like many of us.  And I was not
         16  interested in Srebrenica anymore.  I've been harassed
         17  by these events for long enough now.
         18       Q.   And lastly, Witness F, I should like to know
         19  whether, when you saw General Krstic, whether you also
         20  saw him giving any orders to his subordinates, to his
         21  subordinate officers?
         22       A.   Of course I was not with the commanders, but
         23  if anything was discussed, it was said and it was
         24  talked about, and they made gestures and they moved
         25  their arms.  But I don't know what was said.  I don't

          1  understand the language.  Of course, there were
          2  directions to follow plans.
          3            In the army, usually the case is that an
          4  order is given out, but it's never carried out as it
          5  was given, so you always have to adapt it.
          6       Q.   But in this particular case, do you know
          7  which instructions we are talking about?  I mean, the
          8  instructions emanating from General Krstic.  And if you
          9  could please give me a yes or no to this question.
         10       A.   It was mainly about the transport being
         11  speeded up --
         12            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         13  I apologise, but I wanted a simple yes or no answer
         14  from the witness.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness F,
         16  you have been asked a question by Mr. Petrusic, who
         17  wanted to know whether you are able to -- that is,
         18  whether you were able to hear the instructions that
         19  were allegedly given by General Krstic to his
         20  subordinate officers, and I think that the answer
         21  should be yes or no.
         22            I hope I'm correctly interpreting your
         23  intervention, Mr. Petrusic.
         24            So, please, yes or no.
         25       A.   I didn't understand the language, but orders

          1  were given.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
          3       Q.   We have a bit of a contradictory answer here,
          4  because if you do not understand the language --
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          6  Mr. Petrusic -- sorry.  I believe the witness has
          7  answered your question.  Apparently, there is a slight
          8  contradiction, but the witness is a soldier and I
          9  believe that he's able to understand the so-called
         10  non-verbal aspects of the communication.  He said that
         11  he did not hear the General give instructions because
         12  he doesn't speak the language, but it was his
         13  impression that he was giving instructions.  So I think
         14  that we should accept this.
         15            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         16  Your Honour.  I do not have any more questions for this
         17  witness.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         19  Mr. Petrusic, I did not want to interrupt the
         20  cross-examination, but I think that we should avoid
         21  repeating what was already said during the direct
         22  examination.  We should have a very specific context,
         23  lay some foundations, and then ask specific questions.
         24  We, of course, have a possibility to discuss later on
         25  evidence given by witnesses in general.  There will be
          1  enough time for that, and the Defence, as well as the
          2  Prosecution, will have an opportunity to do so at the
          3  end, to make their submissions.  At this point in time,
          4  we are just hearing the evidence.  You are doing your
          5  job, both the Defence and the Prosecution, and we, the
          6  Judges, are listening.
          7            So in future cases, please try not to oblige
          8  the witness to repeat what has already been said during
          9  the direct examination, and try to restrict yourself to
         10  specific and concrete questions.  Thank you, once
         11  again, Mr. Petrusic.
         12            Mr. McCloskey, will there be any redirect
         13  examination?
         14            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Just briefly, Mr. President.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         16  Mr. McCloskey, let us hear you.
         17                 Re-examined by Mr. McCloskey:
         18       Q.   I believe you've testified that you're not
         19  sure about the various dates of these incidents; is
         20  that correct?
         21       A.   That's correct.
         22       Q.   Are you clear that the day that the Bosnian
         23  Serb troops came into Potocari is the same day that the
         24  transportation of the refugees began?
         25       A.   When the Serbs had entered, immediately after
          1  them the vehicles arrived in order to transport the
          2  people.  That's correct.
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you.  I don't have
          4  anything further, Mr. President.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          6  Mr. McCloskey.
          7            Judge Fouad Riad.
          8            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          9  Mr. President.
         10                 Questioned by the Court:
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  I'll call you Witness F.  Good
         12  morning.  My questions will be of a general character
         13  and would help us draw the conclusions without going
         14  into details most of the time.  In fact, my questions
         15  turn around to main things, the role of the Drina Corps
         16  in this organisation, which you mentioned was very well
         17  organised and it was a well-prepared stage.
         18            Now, what was the role of the Drina Corps, in
         19  your opinion, in this very well-organised stage?  Was
         20  it a prominent role?  Was it a leading role?  What was
         21  your assessment?
         22       A.   In my opinion, to cleanse the area as quickly
         23  as possible, mop it up from all sides.  As you know,
         24  there were also military advancing from Srebrenica.
         25  And from the vicinity of Bratunac, also units were

          1  advancing.  So they closed the whole Muslim fighting
          2  area.  That was a prepared operation, very well
          3  prepared indeed.  And immediately afterwards, they
          4  mopped up the area, cleared it of all resistance, so
          5  that within a couple of days the area was under their
          6  command.  So that the main road from Bratunac towards
          7  Srebrenica was in their own hands, because for them
          8  that was a main road in this area.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  And the Drina Corps was there
         10  all the time?
         11       A.   Yes, it was always present.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Always present.  And it is also
         13  a well-organised corps.  What you said, that the Serbs
         14  were very well-organised, this applies also to the
         15  Drina Corps?
         16       A.   Yes, certainly.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  And a good chain of command?
         18  I'm repeating you.  With a good chain of command?
         19       A.   Yes, indeed, there was very good command.
         20  They were disciplined men, they were experienced
         21  military men.  Indeed, it was a well-planned
         22  operation.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  You did not notice that some
         24  soldiers were just going wild and doing whatever they
         25  wanted, killing or raping, whatever they wanted?

          1       A.   During the first stage, what I for myself --
          2  what I called the disciplined military, had the main
          3  area to mop up the area as quickly as possible.  And
          4  the second stage, those were the Rambo-types, a bit
          5  wild, indeed, who looted other houses, took away
          6  belongings, and I'm sure they have -- they committed --
          7  the witnesses who committed human rights, they were
          8  under the command of another commanding person.  I
          9  think they were kind of temporary soldiers, like
         10  temps.  I don't think that the first line committed
         11  those acts, because they didn't have time for that.
         12  They had another duty.  They had the duty to empty the
         13  area of rebels and resistance.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you mentioned several cases
         15  where you saw General Krstic.  I noted them, but of
         16  course you know them as well as I.  He was with General
         17  Mladic when he was distributing the sweets to the
         18  children, and then you saw him when he wanted to enter
         19  the compound to see how many refugees were there.
         20  That's the first day.
         21            You apparently saw him the second day, around
         22  the White House, looking whether everything went
         23  according to plan.  And you also mentioned that you saw
         24  him with high-ranking officers of the VRS, standing and
         25  looking around to see if everything was according to

          1  plan, near the interrogation house.  Apart from other
          2  things.
          3            And also you mentioned that he was there to
          4  see that everything was going according to plan.
          5            Now, doesn't that really -- that doesn't
          6  really fit in, when you say that the others were doing
          7  what they wanted.  If he was there to see if everything
          8  was going to plan, then there was someone in control of
          9  the situation.  Was he in control of the situation?
         10       A.   Indeed, he was constantly present, but those
         11  rebels or those Rambo-types just went their own way.
         12            On the second day, when I took the pictures
         13  in the vicinity, the pictures of the bodies, there were
         14  many Rambo-types around.  They guarded the surroundings
         15  and they were in houses and on chairs, all sitting on
         16  material belonging to Muslims, and they used stuff and
         17  they took it along, and he didn't say anything about
         18  it.  Those people carried alcohol, cigarettes.  They
         19  had stolen our watches, our weapons, and nothing was
         20  said about that.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, to take an example, when
         22  you mentioned today that he was with high-ranking
         23  officers, standing and looking around, I even asked you
         24  what he was looking at.  And the dead bodies which you
         25  spoke about, with the bloodstains on the back of their

          1  heads and so on, were lying behind -- were lying behind
          2  the interrogation house.  Was it possible that he would
          3  just not see anything of what's happening?
          4       A.   Nine to ten corpses which I found were
          5  diagonally in an open field at the edge of a forest,
          6  near a creek, behind the interrogation house, about 700
          7  metres from the compound.  I don't think it was visible
          8  by Dutch military men, but I'm sure that he knew about
          9  it.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  How far were these dead bodies
         11  from the interrogation house?
         12       A.   400 to 450 metres.  That's my estimate.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  And other things you mentioned,
         14  for instance, the babies -- when you mentioned the
         15  first night, people hanged themselves and there were
         16  dead babies inside the compound.  Is anybody in control
         17  of this situation?  Would it be possible for him to be
         18  completely unaware of it?
         19       A.   You mean somebody belonging to DutchBat?
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  No.  General Krstic.  Somebody
         21  in control.
         22       A.   Of course they knew about this.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         25  Judge Riad.

          1            I should like the witness to look again at
          2  Exhibit 5/2.  Here it is.
          3            Witness F, you mentioned the site marked "F"
          4  as the point of observation where you observed a series
          5  of events which you then described to us; is that
          6  correct?
          7       A.   That is absolutely correct.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Can you use
          9  the pointer and indicate on the ELMO -- will you please
         10  turn to the ELMO?
         11            Perhaps, Mr. Usher, you could help the
         12  witness.
         13            Can you tell us:  What was the angle at which
         14  you were observing these events?  Could you trace it?
         15  Could you mark it with the marker?  Could you use the
         16  marker to show at which angle you were?  Could you just
         17  draw at which angle were you watching it, the visual
         18  angle.
         19       A.   [Marks]
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Just to get
         21  our bearings right.  Could you perhaps put next to
         22  letter "F", "north" and "south."
         23       A.   [Marks]
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So now
         25  north is the direction of Bratunac.  Is that so?  And

          1  then Srebrenica to the south.
          2       A.   That's correct.  Yes.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And for
          4  west and east, we have mountains on those two sides.
          5       A.   That's correct.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now, I
          7  should like to ask you:  How long were you at that
          8  particular site observing, more or less?  How long did
          9  you observe them from that particular place?
         10       A.   The day before the fall, plus the night, till
         11  about 11.00 on the first day.  I think 15 or 16 hours.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So if I
         13  understand you well, you were there on the 10th, during
         14  the night between the 10th and 11th, and on the 11th
         15  until about 11.00.
         16       A.   That's right.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Did you go
         18  back to your observation point after 11.00 on the
         19  11th of July?
         20       A.   Yes.  This position had been prepared when
         21  the situation -- when the tension was mounting, so it
         22  also had to be broken down.  So this was an additional
         23  position on the compound.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you did
         25  not come back to this observation post.  You picked out

          1  a different observation post; is that correct?
          2       A.   Indeed.  I had been assigned to another
          3  place, yes, and of course there was a command for me,
          4  when the Serbs had already entered.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  And
          6  where was this other observation post?
          7            THE INTERPRETER:  Excuse me.  Could you
          8  please ask the witness to start again.   I'm sorry.
          9  Interpreter's mistake.  Could you please ask the
         10  witness to start again.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         12  Excuse me, Witness F.  You really have to speak slowly
         13  and make a pause between question and answer.
         14            THE INTERPRETER:  And could the witness speak
         15  up, please.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We need a
         17  double pause because we are not in the usual situation
         18  with the interpreters.  With the working conditions
         19  that we have now, we need twice as much time for breaks
         20  so the interpreters can catch up with you.  So will you
         21  please begin once again?  So your second observation
         22  post, where was it?
         23            THE INTERPRETER:  And could the witness speak
         24  up, please.
         25       A.   The Muslim refugees were already present on

          1  the compound, and I was assigned to take up an
          2  additional position at the arrow "UN base."  This was,
          3  at the same time, the toilet for all the Muslim
          4  refugees, so I was literally standing in you know
          5  what.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] My second
          7  question is as follows, Witness F:  Where were you when
          8  you saw General Krstic?
          9       A.   At the moment -- at that moment, I was at the
         10  main entrance to the compound, this location
         11  [indicates].
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Another
         13  question.  Where was General Krstic?
         14       A.   At the centre of all the happenings, around
         15  the refugees, so he was in the centre between the main
         16  entrance, the bus complex, and the White House, around
         17  the compound.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now,
         19  Witness F, I will ask you to use the pointer to show
         20  the place where you saw General Krstic.  And I'm going
         21  to use also the transcript which the Prosecutor used --
         22  I can use another letter, if we need one, in addition
         23  to the letter used by the Prosecutor.
         24            Can you show us on this exhibit, where were
         25  you when you saw General Krstic?  Where was the place

          1  from which you saw General Krstic?  And mark it with a
          2  "G".  We had an "F" on the exhibit, didn't we?
          3       A.   [Marks]
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very good.
          5  Now, will you mark the place where General Krstic was
          6  at the time, and put an "H" next to it.
          7       A.   [Marks]
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Another
          9  question, Witness F.  How far away are points "H" and
         10  "G"?
         11       A.   Ten to fifteen metres.  They just were
         12  walking around together.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Ten to
         14  fifteen metres; is that so?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Another
         17  question.  Were there any barriers, anything that would
         18  obstruct your view, houses or trees or anything,
         19  between the place where you were standing and the place
         20  where General Krstic was?
         21       A.   There were no obstacles, no trees, no rocks.
         22  There were security people, but nothing else.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So all the
         24  other VRS officers whom you mentioned, General Mladic,
         25  Commander Nikolic, and others, they were also there, at

          1  this place around point "H", were they?
          2       A.   Around point "H".
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Another
          4  question.  Why do you say that this person who is
          5  sitting behind in the dock is the same person that you
          6  saw from -- that you saw at point "H"?
          7       A.   I don't understand your question.  I'm
          8  sorry.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  I see
         10  that you couldn't understand because I was trying not
         11  to lead you.  You're saying that General Krstic, and
         12  that is the person who is sitting here in the bottom of
         13  this room, was on the 11th and the 12th of July -- that
         14  you saw him in that place.  Why is it, how, on the
         15  basis of what are you concluding that this is one and
         16  the same person?
         17            Sorry.  Did somebody tell you, "This is
         18  General Krstic," or did General Krstic meet you and
         19  introduce himself and say, "I'm General Krstic"?  That
         20  is it.  Can you understand now?  How did you know?
         21       A.   Nobody came up to me and told me that this is
         22  the General, but I recognise his face.  I recognise it
         23  very well.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you're
         25  saying that this is -- that this was General Krstic,

          1  because when you arrived here to the courtroom, you
          2  recognised this person as that person whom you already
          3  saw on the 11th and the 12th of July at that place.  Is
          4  that what we can infer from your answer, Witness F?
          5       A.   That's correct.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          7  Tell us another thing.  On the 11th of July and on the
          8  12th of July, so on the two occasions that you saw
          9  General Krstic, did you always see him at that same
         10  place, at "H", or did you see him in different places?
         11       A.   Of course, he moved around, but I saw him at
         12  those points.  And for the rest, I was busy with my own
         13  work.  I didn't always pay attention to him.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now, this
         15  was not my last question, Witness F.  I'm sorry.  I
         16  should like to -- if you can -- but I think that your
         17  training enables you to tell us the results of your
         18  observation.
         19            With regard to what you saw concerning
         20  General Krstic, what is it that you saw?  Don't give us
         21  your conjectures, but if possible, describe to us --
         22  because you had your camera.  So as in a photograph,
         23  tell us, what did you observe with regard to General
         24  Krstic?  It is both difficult and easy.
         25       A.   Indeed, it's difficult to find the right

          1  words to describe it.  I think a mass murder of a great
          2  amount of people, of many people, which were taken out
          3  by military apparatus.  And it was certainly
          4  well-prepared, and many civilians were victims of this,
          5  amongst them children, women, men, and that is to put
          6  it in very soft words.  The film "Schindler's List" was
          7  nothing compared to that.  It was really horrible.  And
          8  you can understand that, for me, this is a very
          9  emotional affair.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness F,
         11  I want to ask you now:  General Krstic -- who did
         12  General Krstic talk to, if he talked?
         13       A.   With several officers.  I apologise for being
         14  so emotional, but after five years, things are
         15  emerging.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] That is
         17  quite natural, Witness F.  It is human to
         18  have emotions, and we understand how you feel and we
         19  respect that too.  But if you answer my question, I
         20  will try to ask short questions, and you can answer
         21  them directly.  If you want a break, then we can make a
         22  break.  Shall we continue?  Very well.  Thank you.
         23            So were there some individuals who came and
         24  went to General Krstic?
         25       A.   Yes.  I think they were mainly officers, and

          1  I didn't observe it for the rest.  I was busy with
          2  other things, unfortunately.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And did
          4  General Krstic use some means of communication; that
          5  is, a radio, walkie-talkie, or something else that he
          6  used?
          7       A.   I didn't observe it directly.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] From what
          9  you saw, were there some individuals who looked as if
         10  they were asking questions of General Krstic or
         11  supplying him with some information?
         12       A.   Yes, indeed.  There was some consultation
         13  going on around the generals and the officers.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] When
         15  General Krstic moved from the place where he spent most
         16  of the time, that is, point "H", and when he moved away
         17  from there, did you have an opportunity to see what he
         18  was going to do?
         19       A.   Mainly he walked around and looked whether
         20  everything was going according to plan, but I didn't
         21  see what he did exactly.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Right.  I
         23  believe you have provided us with a great deal of
         24  information.  I think that Judge Riad has yet another
         25  question.

          1            Judge Riad.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Witness F, I'm not going to
          3  prolong your discomfort much longer, but to the best of
          4  your knowledge, and this is a question of general
          5  assessment and if you remember:  Was General Krstic
          6  present all the time in all the events during these two
          7  days, or was he -- because you mentioned that he was
          8  there when they were distributing sweets to the
          9  children in front of the camera, and he was there to
         10  meet important people -- but apart from that, you never
         11  referred to him.  You would say that General Krstic
         12  wanted to enter the compound to see how many refugees
         13  were hiding.  It was Krstic that was entering, not
         14  Mladic.  And in other cases, he was looking whether
         15  everything was according to plan.  You referred to
         16  Krstic as if he was in control and there was no
         17  Mladic.  Was Mladic not there anymore?
         18       A.   I didn't see him anymore.  I think he was one
         19  of the responsibles in assigning duties to the
         20  military.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  So it appeared to you that it
         22  was Krstic who was in charge in the execution, and he
         23  had the control?
         24       A.   Yes, I think he was one of the big officers
         25  who were in charge, yes, who had been assigned this

          1  task.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Was it apparent that there was
          3  somebody higher than him, someone who Mladic considered
          4  higher in hierarchy?
          5       A.   Yes.  That's right.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  No.  My question is:  Was there
          7  someone higher than Krstic in hierarchy, between Mladic
          8  Krstic?
          9       A.   Not at that moment at that point and in that
         10  place, but I think there was some evaluation going on
         11  with the chief of staff in higher levels.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  But not at this level, not on
         13  the ground.
         14       A.   Not directly there.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         17  Judge Riad.
         18            Witness F, only a point of clarification.
         19  Exhibit 5/2, on which you marked the angles at which
         20  you observed, and for the record, can one say that
         21  basically your angle of observation was towards west or
         22  north, to the east, but not to the south?  Yes?
         23       A.   That's right.  My view towards the south was
         24  blocked by the high tower on the compound.  I could
         25  look over the roof of the compound till the high tower

          1  and the beginning of the compound.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  I
          3  see.  In any event, I believe the exhibit and the
          4  record show quite clearly that your field of visibility
          5  went in three directions, except for the south.
          6            Very well, Witness F.  You have finished your
          7  testimony.  You testified for a long time here.  You
          8  lived through these events.  The Prosecution, the
          9  Defence, and the Bench and the Chamber asked you a
         10  number of questions.  But is there something that you
         11  would like to say and yet have had no opportunity to
         12  say before in answering questions?  If there is
         13  anything of that kind, you can do so now.
         14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you very
         15  much.  Again, for me, after five years, this is the
         16  first time I can talk about these photographs.  Hardly
         17  anybody knew about it.  I'm very grateful to you for
         18  listening to my story, and I think this is a very good
         19  thing for history and for human rights.  Thank you very
         20  much.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I also
         22  hope, we all hope, Witness F, that it will also be good
         23  for you and for your peace of mind, having been able to
         24  say all those things, to recount all those things that
         25  you have kept to yourself for such a long time.  We

          1  thank you very much for coming here.  Somebody will
          2  help you leave the courtroom.
          3            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Before you
          4  release the witness, I am referring to 5/2A, as marked
          5  by the witness, 5/3A, 59, 60, 61, 62, and 63 are all
          6  Prosecution Exhibits.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          8  Mr. McCloskey.
          9            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  We would
         10  tender those into evidence.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         12  Mr. Petrusic, any objection?
         13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No,
         14  Mr. President.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] These
         16  exhibits were tendered and admitted.  Mr. Dubuisson,
         17  you will take care of all the bureaucratic measures
         18  that are needed.
         19            Witness F, thank you.  I should also like to
         20  thank the interpreters who were with us.
         21                 [The witness withdrew]
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         23  before the break, what do we have next?
         24            MR. HARMON:  Good morning, Mr. President,
         25  Your Honours; good morning, counsel.

          1            We have two witnesses remaining for the day.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In open
          3  session or do we need any protection measures?
          4            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  That's correct.  Both
          5  witnesses will need protection measures.  The first
          6  will be in public session with face distortion and a
          7  pseudonym; the second, we are requesting a closed
          8  session.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         10  Mr. Petrusic, do you have any objection as to the
         11  application of protective measures?  We know that in
         12  principle you do not object to protective measures, but
         13  it has to be made clear for the record.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes,
         15  Mr. President.  Before we began this morning, we didn't
         16  have an opportunity to consult, so I do not know the
         17  order of witnesses.  So this should be perhaps left for
         18  after the break.  We should be made familiar with the
         19  order of witnesses, because we do not know which
         20  particular witness is requesting what protective
         21  measures.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         23  can you respond to that?
         24            MR. HARMON:  I was under the impression that
         25  we did provide the order of witnesses, but if it's

          1  unclear, I'm happy to do so again over the break.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, but as
          3  far as we understood you yesterday, there may have been
          4  some changes that occurred in the meantime.
          5            Mr. Harmon, is the order, therefore, the same
          6  as yesterday?
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I think
          8  that Mr. Harmon has suggested that you can solve the
          9  issue during the break.  However, let me remind you of
         10  one thing that is quite important for our work, that
         11  is, how we should proceed, because during the break we
         12  can undertake all the necessary measures for the next
         13  witness.  So Mr. Harmon said that he could tell you
         14  everything about the next witness during the break.
         15            Mr. Dubuisson, I hope that all the measures
         16  will be taken so that we can start right away with the
         17  witness once we come back from the break, and I hope
         18  that protective measures will be applied.
         19            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes.  Very
         20  well, Mr. President.  We will be sitting in public
         21  session for the next witness.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] A 20-minute
         23  break.
         24                 --- Recess taken at 12.00 p.m.
         25                 --- On resuming at 12.30 p.m.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          2  afternoon, Witness.  Can you hear me?  Could you please
          3  now read the solemn declaration.
          4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
          5  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
          6  and nothing but the truth.
          7                 WITNESS:  BEGO ADEMOVIC
          8                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
         10  seated now.
         11            Are you comfortable, sir?
         12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, I am.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I hope you
         14  have been well treated here in The Hague.
         15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Excellent.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We shall
         17  try to do the same.  Witness, I should like to thank
         18  you first for coming here, and let me just explain to
         19  you that you will first be answering questions put to
         20  you by Mr. Harmon, who is representing the Prosecution,
         21  as soon as we have made sure that everything is in
         22  order and that we can communicate properly.
         23            I can see that Mr. Harmon is satisfied that
         24  everything is okay.  Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President,

          1  Judge Riad.
          2                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          3       Q.   Sir, could you state your name?
          4       A.   Ademovic, Bego.
          5       Q.   How do you spell your last name?
          6       A.   A-d-e-m-o-v-i-c, "Bego" being my first name.
          7       Q.   How old are you, sir?
          8       A.   I'm 58.
          9            MR. HARMON:  I didn't get a translation in
         10  the English.
         11       A.   Fifty-eight.
         12            MR. HARMON:
         13       Q.   Could you tell us; are you a Muslim by faith,
         14  Mr. Ademovic?
         15       A.   Yes, I am.
         16       Q.   And can you tell us about your education?
         17  How far did you go in school?
         18       A.   I have the first four forms of the elementary
         19  school, and I'm a driver by profession.
         20       Q.   Do you have some difficulty in reading?
         21       A.   Well, I can't read very well.
         22       Q.   Now, you said that you were a driver by
         23  profession.  How many years were you --
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   -- how many years were you a driver?

          1       A.   Thirty.
          2       Q.   And what kind of vehicles did you drive?
          3       A.   All kinds of transport vehicles and buses.
          4       Q.   And where are were you employed as a driver?
          5       A.   I worked at the Vihor Company and the
          6  Partizanski Put Company in Belgrade.
          7       Q.   And where is the Vihor Company located?
          8       A.   In Bratunac.
          9       Q.   And how long were you employed as a driver in
         10  Bratunac?
         11       A.   I worked there for less than a year.  I mean,
         12  I worked less than a year in the Partizanski Put
         13  Company.
         14       Q.   And, therefore, did you work for a number of
         15  years in Bratunac as a driver?
         16       A.   Well, yes.  I retired as a driver.
         17       Q.   Now, before the war started, where did you
         18  live?
         19       A.   In the village of Dzile, the municipality of
         20  Vlasenica.
         21       Q.   Now, are you married?
         22       A.   Yes, and I'm a father of four children.
         23       Q.   Now, I'd like to draw your attention to the
         24  events that took place before the fall of the
         25  Srebrenica enclave, and let me ask you; before the fall

          1  of the enclave, were you living in the village of
          2  Kutezero?
          3       A.   Yes, I was.
          4       Q.   Where is that in relation to the town of
          5  Srebrenica?
          6       A.   It is situated in the direction of the Radava
          7  Mountain, in the vicinity of Srebrenica.
          8       Q.   And how far away is it from the town of
          9  Srebrenica, that particular village?
         10       A.   About ten kilometres, I couldn't be more
         11  precise.  Maybe less than ten kilometres.
         12       Q.   When you were living in that village, with
         13  whom were you living?
         14       A.   With my mother, with my uncle, my wife, my
         15  two sons, my two daughters-in-law, and my four
         16  grandchildren.
         17       Q.   Now, at some point in time, Mr. Ademovic, did
         18  the Bosnian Serb army come into the enclave and did you
         19  leave that village?
         20       A.   I'm sorry.  I don't understand your
         21  question.
         22       Q.   At some point in time, did you flee from the
         23  village of Kutezero?
         24       A.   I was living in Dzile, and then I fled Dzile
         25  after the fall of the Srebrenica municipality, and then

          1  I reached Kutezero.  If you're asking me about the fall
          2  of Srebrenica, well, yes, at that time, I fled from
          3  Kutezero.
          4       Q.   And with whom did you flee the village?
          5       A.   I fled with my daughters-in-law, and with my
          6  mother, and my uncle had died before the fall of
          7  Srebrenica, and our grandchildren were with us as
          8  well.
          9       Q.   And why did you flee?
         10       A.   Well, I fled from Chetniks.  I didn't want to
         11  be slaughtered by them.
         12       Q.   Where did you go?
         13       A.   We went to Potocari.
         14       Q.   Now, did all of you who had fled from your
         15  village arrive in Potocari?
         16       A.   I don't know about that.
         17       Q.   Did your mother arrive in Potocari?
         18       A.   My mother couldn't walk, so she couldn't
         19  continue, and she remained in the woods, and that's
         20  where she died.
         21       Q.   Now, let me ask you; do you remember the day
         22  when you arrived in Potocari?
         23       A.   It was on a Tuesday, on the 11th.
         24       Q.   Was that the 11th of July, 1995?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   And where did you and your wife and other
          2  members of your family take refuge?
          3       A.   At the Zinc Factory in Potocari.  There were
          4  lots of people there.
          5       Q.   Now, when you arrived in the Zinc Factory,
          6  was there any shooting going on in and around the Zinc
          7  Factory?
          8       A.   There was some shelling and some gunfire.
          9  People got injured by shells, fragments of shells.
         10  There may have been casualties or fatalities, but I'm
         11  not sure.
         12       Q.   Okay.  And when you arrived in Potocari on
         13  the 11th of July, were there other refugees in and
         14  around the Zinc Factory?
         15       A.   Yes.  Yes, a lot of people, a crowd of
         16  people.
         17       Q.   Are you able to estimate how many people
         18  there were?
         19       A.   Over 2.000 or 3.000, probably more than
         20  that.
         21       Q.   Did you and your wife and family members take
         22  refuge inside the Zinc Factory or outside on the
         23  grounds around the Zinc Factory?
         24       A.   Around the Zinc Factory, coming from the
         25  direction of Bratunac.

          1       Q.   Now, at some point in time, did members of
          2  the Bosnian Serb army arrive in Potocari?
          3       A.   No, they didn't.
          4       Q.   When did members of the Bosnian Serb army
          5  arrive in Potocari?
          6       A.   On the following day, after 10.00, on
          7  Wednesday.
          8       Q.   So that would be the 12th of July; is that
          9  correct?
         10       A.   Yes, the 12th of July.
         11       Q.   Now, could you see in which direction the
         12  Bosnian Serb soldiers were coming?
         13       A.   We were first told to clear the asphalt area,
         14  that soldiers would be coming from the direction of
         15  Srebrenica, and they came in in a column of two, and
         16  then they continued towards Bratunac.  And then
         17  Chetniks started arriving from all directions.
         18       Q.   Now, did you recognise any members of the
         19  Bosnian Serb army who had come in to Potocari?
         20       A.   I recognised only a colleague of mine from
         21  Vihor, Lazic.  He worked there as a bus driver, and he
         22  was working in the reserve section.
         23       Q.   When you say "the reserve section," do you
         24  mean the reserve section of the bus company or the
         25  reserve section of the army?

          1       A.   Of the former Yugoslavia, Tito's Yugoslavia.
          2       Q.   And when you say "reserve section," what are
          3  you referring to?
          4       A.   Oh, he was wearing clothes, this particular
          5  suit.
          6       Q.   Can you describe the particular suit he was
          7  wearing?
          8       A.   It was grey in colour.  It was a warm kind of
          9  clothing.
         10       Q.   Okay.  Did you see anybody else?
         11       A.   I couldn't recognise anyone else.  I didn't
         12  recognise anyone in the column.
         13       Q.   Did you, later on, notice any Bosnian Serb
         14  soldiers you knew by name who may not have walked in in
         15  the column but may have been walking amongst the
         16  people?
         17       A.   There was a huge crowd of people, and I knew
         18  only knew Zoran Mirosavljevic.
         19       Q.   How was he dressed?
         20       A.   He was wearing a camouflage suit.
         21       Q.   Now, let me ask you to focus your attention
         22  on that day again, the 12th of July, and ask you if you
         23  saw a conversation taking place between a Bosnian Serb
         24  soldier and a family of Bosnian Muslims.  Did you see a
         25  conversation taking place, and could you describe to

          1  the Judges what you saw and what you heard?
          2       A.   Yes.  There were lots of Chetniks walking
          3  around, quite a few people were sitting next to me.
          4  There was one man, together with his wife and their two
          5  children, son and daughter.  Two soldiers approached
          6  them.  They said hello to the man and the girl, and
          7  they inquired about their health.  And they said to the
          8  man, "Let us take your wife and your daughter so that
          9  they can be put on the first buses," and the man said,
         10  "No.  We're not going to separate."  But they grabbed
         11  the girl and they took her away from him.  The wife
         12  fainted, and the man was motionless.  He was simply
         13  watching this thing happen.  And the girl was taken
         14  away in the direction of Srebrenica, from the Zinc
         15  Factory.
         16       Q.   Do you know what happened to that girl?
         17       A.   No, I don't know.
         18       Q.   Can you tell the Judges how those soldiers
         19  were dressed?
         20       A.   They were wearing camouflage suits.
         21       Q.   What colour was the camouflage?
         22       A.   It was multi-coloured.
         23       Q.   Was there any particular dominant colour, any
         24  particular ...
         25       A.   It wasn't very visible.  I'm not a specialist

          1  for colours.  It was difficult to tell.
          2       Q.   Okay.  Do you know the kind of camouflage
          3  uniforms worn by the army and the kind of camouflage
          4  uniforms worn by the police?  Do you know the
          5  difference between those two?
          6       A.   No.  I cannot tell the difference.
          7       Q.   Did you know the names of those particular
          8  soldiers who took away the girl?
          9       A.   No.  I don't know them at all.
         10       Q.   Now, while you were in the Zinc compound
         11  area, did you see other Serb soldiers walking among the
         12  refugees?
         13       A.   I didn't see them do anything.  They were
         14  just cursing at people, calling them names, telling
         15  them that they would be slaughtered, that they would
         16  end out their lives there.  They were telling them to
         17  leave the area, that it was a Serb country, that it was
         18  part of the Greater Serbia.
         19       Q.   Now, how were the soldiers who were making
         20  those curses, do you remember how they were dressed?
         21       A.   The same.  The same kind of suit.
         22       Q.   Camouflage suits; is that correct?
         23       A.   Camouflage.
         24       Q.   Could you see any particular marks or badges
         25  or patches on those soldiers?

          1       A.   I could only see them on Zoran Mirosavljevic,
          2  but those who were cursing did not wear any insignia.
          3  Only Zoran had some kind of badge on his arm.
          4       Q.   Do you remember what kind of badge Zoran had
          5  on his arm?  Could you describe it?
          6       A.   I cannot describe it.  I only saw that he had
          7  some kind of insignia, but I wasn't paying attention to
          8  it.
          9       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, at some point in time when you
         10  were walking in and around the Zinc Factory, did you
         11  see a violent incident involving a child?
         12       A.   Yes, I did.
         13       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you saw?
         14       A.   Yes, I can.
         15       Q.   Please, tell the Judges what you saw.
         16       A.   After they'd taken away the girl, the
         17  situation was a bit calmer.  I walked around the Zinc
         18  Factory -- I wanted to get to my wife and my
         19  daughter-in-law -- and I went by a soldier where there
         20  was many people.  There was a woman carrying a child in
         21  her arms, and the soldier asked her whether the baby's
         22  name was Alija.  She said it wasn't.  Then he inquired
         23  whether it was a boy, and the woman said yes.  Then he
         24  bent down, took a knife out, he took the baby and hit
         25  the baby with a knife here, like this.  I turned around

          1  and the baby fell down.  It was dead.
          2       Q.   When you say "he hit the baby here," where
          3  did he strike the baby with the knife?
          4       A.   Here [indicates], in the chest.  Under the
          5  head, near the neck.
          6       Q.   What happened then?
          7       A.   I went back.  I didn't know what happened
          8  then.  I only learned that the child was dead.  But I
          9  fled in the opposite direction.
         10       Q.   Now, can you tell the Judges how that soldier
         11  was dressed?
         12       A.   He had the same kind of suit as others were
         13  wearing.
         14       Q.   That is a camouflage suit.
         15       A.   Yes, camouflage.
         16       Q.   At the time that that baby was murdered, were
         17  there other refugees in and around that crime scene?
         18       A.   Yes.  You couldn't move through them.  They
         19  were standing next to each other.
         20       Q.   What was the reaction of the people who saw
         21  this killing of this child?
         22       A.   There wasn't much reaction.  After that, it
         23  was as if things were normal.
         24       Q.   Okay.  And later on in the day -- let me ask
         25  you this question, Mr. Ademovic:  About what time of

          1  the day did that happen, if you can remember?
          2       A.   I didn't have a watch, but I think that it
          3  could have been around 12.00.
          4       Q.   Now, did you, that day, attempt to go get
          5  some water for your family?
          6       A.   Yes, I did.  I went up the hill, in the
          7  direction of Srebrenica, and wanted to take some
          8  water.  I also wanted to get some food.  I wanted to
          9  find something to cook for my children.  And then I was
         10  stopped by a soldier.  And this took place before
         11  10.00.  There were Serb troops over there, and there
         12  was a kind of ribbon which prevented us from moving
         13  on.  So I turned around and went back.
         14       Q.   Where did you go?
         15       A.   I went outside the compound of the Zinc
         16  Factory.
         17       Q.   And where outside the compound of the Zinc
         18  Factory did you go?
         19       A.   Outside the Zinc Factory.  I mean, up the
         20  hill, towards a barn.  There were a lot of people
         21  there.  The situation was somewhat calmer at that point
         22  in time, and people were moving around.  They went up
         23  to a meadow, and they were drinking and eating, but
         24  they were mostly silent.
         25       Q.   Were you with anybody?

          1       A.   I was with Dzemal Karic.  There were a lot of
          2  people around us, but the two of us stuck together.
          3       Q.   At some point in time, did a Serb soldier
          4  appear?
          5       A.   Yes, they appeared from behind.  We spent
          6  some time sitting there, and at one point somebody said
          7  that Serb soldiers were coming.  And people fled to the
          8  Zinc Factory.  And the two of us, we went to a barn and
          9  we hid there.  And we didn't follow the people who went
         10  towards the Zinc Factory, and they didn't see us.
         11       Q.   So you were hidden in a barn or near a barn,
         12  on a hillside, overlooking the Zinc Factory; is that
         13  correct?
         14       A.   There was a shed below the stable, and we hid
         15  behind that shed.
         16       Q.   What did you see when you hid behind that
         17  shed?
         18       A.   Two Serb soldiers followed the people, and
         19  they went in through a hole of the Zinc Factory fence.
         20  They took three Bosniak men from that -- through that
         21  hole, and they moved in the direction of Aljo's house.
         22  We saw them, and we were actually watching in their
         23  direction.  There were between 10 and 15 people there,
         24  between the Zinc Factory and Aljo's house.  There was a
         25  kind of ramp that had been prepared there, and they

          1  moved the people towards that location.  There were two
          2  Chetniks and some other soldiers as well, and they were
          3  taking people -- taking men by their arms.  They would
          4  hold them by an arm behind their back.  The third one
          5  would grab the person by the hair.  They would turn in
          6  the direction of the Zinc Factory and they would kill
          7  those men by -- with a kind of machete, decapitating
          8  them.
          9       Q.   How many people were involved in this killing
         10  operation?
         11       A.   I couldn't exactly tell.  They all looked the
         12  same.  They were wearing the same kind of clothing,
         13  they were more or less of the same age.  There were
         14  between eight and ten of them.  I don't know if this
         15  was done always by the same person, or rather the same
         16  persons, but they were there, lined up.  And I couldn't
         17  tell you anything more precise.
         18       Q.   Do you recall what the men who were doing the
         19  killings were wearing?
         20       A.   This same kind of clothing; the one that was
         21  worn by other soldiers.
         22       Q.   Camouflage clothing?
         23       A.   Yes, camouflage clothing.
         24       Q.   Now, after you witnessed these first three
         25  men being killed, tell the Judges what happened.

          1       A.   The two soldiers went back, and they were
          2  bringing in other Bosniak men.  And then a truck
          3  arrived, coming from the cornfield.  And when the truck
          4  was filled with dead bodies, they had some kind of
          5  camouflage bags, they ordered some Muslims to fill up
          6  those camouflage bags, which were then put onto a
          7  truck.  And they kept working like this for a while.
          8       Q.   Did the truck with the bodies leave the area?
          9       A.   Yes, on several occasions, and it would come
         10  back.
         11       Q.   And after the truck left the area, what
         12  happened?
         13       A.   The truck would leave the area, and then it
         14  would come back again.  The last time it came, it was
         15  already at dusk.
         16       Q.   Let me ask you, Mr. Ademovic, how long was it
         17  that you watched killings take place from your location
         18  near the shed?
         19       A.   It must have been, I'm not too sure, but it
         20  must have been two hours.  More.  More.
         21       Q.   Now, during this period of time, did you or
         22  your colleague, Mr. Karic, keep a count of how many
         23  people you had seen murdered?
         24       A.   Dzemal Karic had a box of cigarettes, Drina,
         25  from a Sarajevo factory, and he had a short pencil.

          1  And as they were taking them away, he was writing four,
          2  then five, then seven, and on.  And then he added it
          3  up, and we got the figure of 83.  But the pencil
          4  broke.  Anyway, it was a stub only, so that it couldn't
          5  write any longer, and they were still taking people
          6  away.
          7       Q.   Are you able to estimate the number of people
          8  you saw killed in the fashion which you've described?
          9       A.   What he added up was the correct sum, 83, but
         10  they continued taking people away, and then we could
         11  not write anymore.  But there must have been over 100.
         12       Q.   Now, please continue describing what occurred
         13  at that location.
         14       A.   Night had already fallen, but it wasn't quite
         15  dark yet.  I knew those people from sight.  I didn't
         16  know their names.  And the last batch, in it I
         17  recognised Hazim Lonjinac in that last group of five
         18  men.  And then all of a sudden noise started, and those
         19  people came back alive, that group of five men.  And
         20  they left.  And we entered the Zinc Factory.  And I
         21  found Hazim Lonjinac, who had been with that group,
         22  with a child in his arms.  He's some kind of a
         23  son-in-law of mine.  And I told him, "Son-in-law, I've
         24  already mourned you."  And he said that an officer had
         25  come and attacked those Chetniks, and he gave me his

          1  name.  And he said, "I was the one who got you away.
          2  Get down to the Zinc Factory."  But I've forgotten the
          3  name.  He gave me both the first and last name of that
          4  officer, but I've forgotten.
          5       Q.   What happened to the assassins?
          6       A.   They stayed there -- well, they left later
          7  on.  As soon as they stopped killing, they just
          8  vanished.
          9       Q.   Now, you mentioned the name of an individual
         10  who may be related to you by marriage, Hazim Lonjinac.
         11  And that's the man who you have identified as --
         12       A.   Yes, my niece -- he's my son-in-law.  My
         13  niece is married to him.
         14       Q.   Do you know what happened to Hazim Lonjinac?
         15       A.   Don't I?  My daughter-in-law told me, the
         16  wife of my son who was killed.  My two daughters-in-law
         17  and my wife went towards Kladanj that night.  And my
         18  daughter-in-law told me that she had got off the bus at
         19  some point, and several men were standing in a group
         20  next to a stone boundary.  And when the headlights went
         21  on, then she recognised Hazim in that group.
         22       Q.   Do you know the location where Hazim was
         23  standing in that group?
         24       A.   I didn't see it myself, but from what my
         25  daughter-in-law told me, next to the asphalt, up the

          1  slope, next to the boundary, next to the bank.
          2       Q.   Was there a name for that location?
          3       A.   Luke.  Some people call it Luke.  I've heard
          4  people call it Luke.
          5       Q.   Now, let me return to the time when you came
          6  down from the hill and after you saw Hazim.  Did you
          7  find your wife and your other family members in and
          8  around the Zinc Factory?
          9       A.   No.  And I never saw them again, until I
         10  arrived in Kladanj.  And they had left that night.
         11       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, I'd like you to describe, if
         12  you would, to the Judges the night between the 12th and
         13  the morning of the 13th.  Can you describe the scene as
         14  you saw it?
         15       A.   In the Zinc Factory compound -- nobody spent
         16  the night there, but across the asphalt, in the
         17  transport compound.  And I was in the middle.  All the
         18  people were around me.  There was moonlight, and the
         19  visibility was better than now.  And from all sides
         20  Chetniks were coming, carrying torches with them,
         21  flashlights.  And people lying down were tired.  They
         22  would pull the people up by the hair and look at their
         23  face.  If they would like the face, they would take him
         24  away.  If they didn't recognise him, they would leave
         25  him behind.  But they mostly took them away.  And

          1  people were screaming, people were distressed.  It was
          2  awful.
          3       Q.   Now, when you say, "The Chetniks were
          4  coming," can you be more precise?  Who were the
          5  Chetniks?  How were they dressed?
          6       A.   Chetniks.  That was no army.  Those are
          7  criminals.  They are called the Bosnian Serb army, but
          8  that's a crime.  They are beasts.  They are not
          9  humans.  A man, a human being, has a soul, and those
         10  people didn't have anything.  Heavy crimes.  What
         11  army?
         12       Q.   How were those individuals who came in in the
         13  night with those flashlights, how were they dressed?
         14  Do you remember?
         15       A.   All military.  I could have seen two or three
         16  in civilian clothes.
         17       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, let me now turn to the morning
         18  of the 13th of July and focus your attention on the
         19  early morning hours.  What did you do first thing in
         20  the morning of the 13th of July?
         21       A.   I didn't sleep, nor did anybody else.  The
         22  dawn broke and our heads hurt to a bursting point.
         23  Down there, there was the River Krizevica, and I
         24  started down to wash myself.  There was no Chetniks
         25  around.  And above me was a woman screaming like crazy,

          1  "What's happened?"  They took away two of her
          2  daughters that night.  I started towards the Krizevica,
          3  the stream.  I washed my face, came back.  I saw a man
          4  on his knees moving.  This is cut [indicating], both
          5  his hands, around his ankles, also both feet, his nose
          6  cut off, his ears cut off, his eyes gouged out.  He is
          7  moving on his knees and only moaning "Oh."  He was
          8  hanging like that.  I didn't come near him.
          9            Another one was hanging.  I'm sorry.  I
         10  didn't come near him.
         11       Q.   You saw two individuals, one of whom was
         12  mutilated and a second man who was hanging.  Did I
         13  understand your testimony correctly?
         14       A.   Yes, that's right.  You understood me.
         15       Q.   What did you do after you saw those two
         16  sights?
         17       A.   I saw buses and I headed there straight
         18  away.  I reached the rope, and they had separated --
         19  many of us continued separating, so I reached the
         20  rope.  It was tight there, but I bent down and passed
         21  under the rope, and nobody said anything.  So I reached
         22  the bus, and its driver was an acquaintance of mine
         23  before the war, a fellow driver.  So I sat next to him
         24  and headed for Kladanj.
         25       Q.   Let me interrupt you there for just a

          1  second.  I omitted to show you three exhibits.
          2            MR. HARMON:  And I'd like the usher to put
          3  these on the ELMO, Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/10, 5/13 and
          4  5/11.
          5       Q.   These relate to the killings that you
          6  described earlier.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Which exhibit is that, please?
          8            THE USHER:  5/10.
          9            MR. HARMON:
         10       Q.   Do you recognise Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/10?
         11       A.   I do.  Where shall I show it?  Here, this is
         12  Aljo's house [indicates].  This is also Aljo's house.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, let him use the
         14  ELMO.
         15       Q.   Would you please point to Aljo's house, and
         16  then I'll describe it to the Judges.
         17       A.   This is Aljo's house [indicates].
         18            MR. HARMON:  For the record, the witness has
         19  put the pointer on the house that is directly in the
         20  middle of the exhibit.
         21       Q.   Would you go to Exhibit 5/10, please.  I'm
         22  sorry, 5/13.  Do you recognise that photograph?
         23       A.   This is the stable.  This is the shed where I
         24  was, from where I watched.  Down here [indicates], down
         25  there, there should have been the Zinc Factory, but

          1  it's not here.  Aljo's house is over there.  That's
          2  where it should be.  Between the Zinc Factory and the
          3  house, there was to be some wheat or some corn, and
          4  that's where the slaughter took place.
          5            MR. HARMON:  Just for the record, the witness
          6  indicated with his pointer --
          7       Q.   -- and would you point again where you were
          8  hidden when observed these events took, please?
          9  Just put the pointer on the ELMO where you were hidden?
         10       A.   Here [indicates].
         11            MR. HARMON:  The witness has put his pointer
         12  on the left-hand side of this structure.  There appears
         13  to be some perpendicular wooden slats at the left side
         14  of that building, and that's where he said he was.
         15       Q.   Is that also the location where Mr. Karic
         16  was?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            MR. HARMON:  Now, Mr. Usher, could you place
         19  Prosecutor's 5/11 on the ELMO.
         20       Q.   Do you recognise anything in that particular
         21  photograph?
         22       A.   Here's the fence through which the Chetniks
         23  were taking away the Bosniaks, through this wire fence
         24  [indicates].  And this is Aljo's house.  And that's
         25  where they took them through, and there should be the

          1  stable, but it's not here.  I can't see it.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Now let me, for the record --
          3  the witness, when he was talking about the fence, he
          4  was pointing to a fence that is on the -- more to the
          5  right side than to the left side.  It appears to have a
          6  hole in it.  And when he pointed and referred to Aljo's
          7  house, he was referring to the house, the roof of which
          8  is on the left-hand side.  It's the tallest structure
          9  in the photograph.
         10       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Ademovic.  You can
         11  turn around and we can continue with your testimony.
         12       A.   Thank you.
         13       Q.   Before we get, Mr. Ademovic, to your actually
         14  leaving the enclave on a bus, let me ask you, did
         15  anybody, prior to your getting on a bus, come to you
         16  and give you a choice, as to whether you could stay in
         17  Srebrenica and Potocari, or whether you could go to any
         18  particular location you wanted?
         19       A.   No way.  All them, they were shouting at us,
         20  cursing us, cursing Aljo, saying, "Why didn't you go
         21  with Fikret?  Perhaps you would have survived."  Here,
         22  nobody -- no, we were all leaving, getting away from
         23  knives.
         24       Q.   Now, let me ask you, please, tell me where
         25  you went.  You said you got on a bus.  Tell the Judges

          1  what happened when you got on the bus and who you
          2  recognised.
          3       A.   I only recognised the fellow driver, that
          4  one, and all those people there, I wasn't really
          5  looking.  Perhaps I knew somebody, but I can't
          6  remember.  I only remember the driver, Raco
          7  Madzarevic.
          8       Q.   And he was a colleague of yours, or a former
          9  colleague; is that correct?
         10       A.   It is.
         11       Q.   He was a Serb.
         12       A.   He was.
         13       Q.   Tell me what happened.
         14       A.   Where?
         15       Q.   Once you got on the bus.
         16       A.   I got onto the bus, I sat somewhere in the
         17  middle of the bus, and when the bus was full, he set
         18  off.  When we passed by Bratunac, he called me to sit
         19  next to him and I sat next to him.  He offered me a
         20  cigarette and said, "Well, how about you?  Are your
         21  sons alive?"  I said, "I don't know."  "Where did you
         22  go?"  And I said, "Through the woods."  And he said
         23  "Not good.  There was some bad fighting with our army
         24  and there was also some fighting between your troops.
         25  Lots of people died.  I hope somebody is still alive.

          1  We were to take you tonight," Wednesday night, that is,
          2  "and I started and I was brought back from the petrol
          3  station at Zivinice, and I saw our troops moving to
          4  meet your troops to an ambush, so that I didn't drive
          5  last night, nobody drove last night."
          6            When we got to Sandici, Pantic called
          7  Milici -- militia men stopped us.  Before the war, he
          8  was a policeman.  And that man was lying there on the
          9  asphalt next to him, and there were about 20 through
         10  Sandici, 20 men in civilian clothes with their hands
         11  like that.  Pantic shook hands with me and said, "Hi.
         12  I looked for you yesterday in Potocari.  I was bringing
         13  you some Slivovitz, some brandy, but I couldn't find
         14  you.  And now I don't have it with me.  Go and sit in
         15  the back.  Don't sit here.  Raco, get those two lads,
         16  they're Muslims.  They arrived through the woods.  They
         17  were good to us."  And we went on.
         18       Q.   Let me ask you some questions to clarify your
         19  testimony.  Who was Pantic?  Was he a Serb?
         20       A.   A Serb.
         21       Q.   Did you know him -- you knew him from before
         22  the war; is that correct?
         23       A.   Yes, we knew each other well before the war.
         24       Q.   And you said that you saw 20 people.  How
         25  were their hands?  Could you show the Judges --

          1       A.   Around 20, around 20.
          2       Q.   Could you tell the Judges how they were
          3  positioned and what position their hands were in?
          4       A.   They were all in civilian clothes, and they
          5  their hands like this [indicates].  Nobody was driving
          6  them down.  They were coming down the hill by
          7  themselves, down to where Pantic is.
          8            MR. HARMON:  And when the witness said "like
          9  this," he put both his hands together behind the back
         10  of his head, so the record is perfectly clear.
         11       Q.   Now, did Pantic put some people on the bus?
         12       A.   Two young boys, some 12 or 13 years old.
         13       Q.   Do you know why he put those young lads on
         14  the bus?
         15       A.   I know nothing.  I don't know the reason.
         16       Q.   Did the bus then drive away from Sandici?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   In which direction did it drive?
         19       A.   Towards Konjevic Polje, Milici, Nova Kasaba,
         20  Vlasenica.
         21       Q.   Did you see anything unusual on the way to
         22  Konjevic Polje?
         23       A.   I did.  Before Kaldrmica, to our right, there
         24  were about two or three buses standing, and to the
         25  left, there were the Chetnik troops, so that Raco

          1  couldn't get through, and he stopped.  And he turned
          2  his hand, and with his coat, he covered my head behind
          3  his back.  And two soldiers approached Raco.  Raco
          4  opened the door, "We want to see if there is anything
          5  for us," and he said, "There's nothing for you," and
          6  they turned back, that is, they didn't get onto the
          7  bus.
          8       Q.   What happened then?
          9       A.   And I watched from the buses how they were
         10  taking off men, and there were some women.  And the
         11  buses started, and Raco started towards the playground,
         12  near Nova Kasaba.  Around 1.000 Muslim Bosniaks were
         13  walking in a column, with their hands like this
         14  [indicates].  And Chetnici escorting them with rifles.
         15  Raco was driving very slowly and said, "Bego, do you
         16  recognise anyone?"  And I said, "I don't, not one,"
         17  because I saw them from their back.
         18            So he stopped in Nova Kasaba, he honked, and
         19  a shop owner came out and Raco asked for a litre of
         20  brandy.  And the grocer brought it to him, and he paid
         21  him, and he just dropped it in front of him and went on
         22  driving.  And when we reached Luke --
         23       Q.   Let me interrupt you right there because I
         24  need to clarify a couple points in your testimony.
         25            You said you saw about 1.000 men.  Could you

          1  tell if these men were Muslim men or if they were
          2  Bosnian Serbs?
          3       A.   Muslims, and Bosnian Serbs were driving
          4  them.
          5       Q.   And in which direction were they going?  I'm
          6  afraid I missed that part of your testimony.  Were they
          7  going in a particular direction, to a particular
          8  location?
          9       A.   Towards Kasaba, before the playground.
         10  That's what I saw.  Towards Kasaba.
         11       Q.   When you say "playground," what kind of a
         12  playground is it?
         13       A.   Football, a football stadium.
         14            MR. HARMON:  Again, for the record, when this
         15  witness indicated that the men had their hands, again,
         16  in a particular position, he made a gesture for the
         17  Court to see, which was both hands behind the back of
         18  the head.
         19       Q.   Now, Mr. Ademovic, where did you stop that
         20  bus journey?
         21       A.   At Luke.
         22       Q.   What happened there?
         23       A.   The troops there surrounded the bus, and Raco
         24  got out that brandy from the glove compartment and two
         25  big tins and said, "Bego, give it to that woman, to put

          1  it in her bag, and when you cross over there, have a
          2  drink.  Had I known that I'd come across you, I would
          3  have brought some marks for you.  I've got lots of
          4  Serbian money, but you can't use it over there."  And I
          5  said, "Well, shall I cross alive?"  And he said, "You
          6  will."  And he opened the door, took me by my left
          7  shoulder and said -- he called the radio and said,
          8  "Vojvoda, call them on the radio and tell not to leave
          9  this one alone, he is our fellow driver," and the other
         10  one replied, "Nobody will touch Bego."  And that's how
         11  I continued my journey.
         12       Q.   At some point in time, did you help a woman,
         13  as well?
         14       A.   When I was leaving that bus, those troops,
         15  they shouted at me to come back asking, "Would I mind
         16  taking along a woman who had suffered a stroke?" and I
         17  said "Sure."  So I did.
         18       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, while you were at Luke, did you
         19  see anything happen to a young girl?
         20       A.   I did.  I saw a Chetnik dragging her back.
         21  She had torn all her clothes.  She could have been 18,
         22  19, and she was screaming, "Uncle Bego, help me.  Don't
         23  let them do it."  But I kept silent, I wasn't saying
         24  anything, and he dragged her behind.
         25       Q.   Did you know that young girl?

          1       A.   I didn't.  She knew me.  I didn't know her.
          2       Q.   Now, as you made your way toward the free
          3  territory, did you see any Bosnian Serb soldiers you
          4  knew?
          5       A.   Two were sitting to the right of the road,
          6  and he said, "Bego, take his wife, she has suffered a
          7  stroke," and I've shared lots of meals with them in
          8  their house, so all right.  So they said, "Bego, come
          9  sit down.  Have some water.  You'll faint."  So I sat
         10  down, he gave me a box of cigarettes, and I had a brief
         11  rest, and that's how I went on my journey.
         12       Q.   Do you know the name or nickname of that
         13  particular soldier?
         14       A.   I don't know his name.  He used to work for
         15  the bauxite.  That's what they called him.
         16       Q.   Sorry.  I didn't hear what they called him.
         17  What did they call him?
         18       A.   Lega.  That was his nickname or perhaps his
         19  last name.  I don't know.
         20       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Ademovic.  I've
         21  concluded my examination.  My colleagues will ask you
         22  some questions.
         23       A.   Thank you.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         25  Mr. Petrusic, how long will you need for your

          1  cross-examination, more or less?
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          3  it will be Mr. Visnjic who will cross-examine the
          4  witness.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          6  So I'm asking the same question of Mr. Visnjic.  How
          7  long will you take?  I'm asking because of the break.
          8  Should we make the break now or not?
          9            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         10  I was about to suggest a break because we have to
         11  resolve some technical matters with the technical
         12  booth, so as to get ready for it, and I should like to
         13  suggest a break.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         15  We shall now make a 15-minute break, then.
         16                 --- Recess taken at 1.25 p.m.
         17                 --- On resuming at 1.47 p.m.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         19  Mr. Ademovic, we are now going to continue with your
         20  evidence.  Let me just remind you that you have to
         21  speak slowly because we have interpreters here who are
         22  interpreting what you say, and you have to speak
         23  slowly.  I hope Mr. Visnjic will do the same.  And
         24  we'll also show you how to do it, how to speak slowly.
         25            Mr. Visnjic, you have the floor.
          1            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          2  Mr. President.
          3                 Cross-examined by Mr. Visnjic:
          4       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, I know it is hard for you to be
          5  reminded of these events, but unfortunately we have to
          6  ask you a few details, we have to ask you to explain
          7  the events that took place in July 1995 in somewhat
          8  greater detail.
          9            Mr. Ademovic, could you please explain to the
         10  Chamber whether you have given any statement about
         11  these events on any previous occasion?
         12       A.   Yes, I have.
         13       Q.   How many?
         14       A.   I don't know how many statements I gave to
         15  the Tribunal, but I remember giving a statement to the
         16  authorities in Tuzla on one occasion.
         17       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, the usher will now show you
         18  Exhibit 6.  Exhibit 6 is your statement of the 18th of
         19  August, 1995, the statement that you gave to the State
         20  Security Service in Tuzla.
         21       A.   Yes.  Yes, I can tell you all about it.  I
         22  don't have to read it.  I'll tell you how it happened.
         23  I was called in Tuzla, they told me to come to an
         24  office, which was a small office, a small room.  There
         25  were four of us, three men and one woman.  The

          1  investigators were not serious at all.  They were not
          2  serious.  So they were flirting with the lady, they
          3  were not listening to what I was saying.  And at the
          4  moment I had to put my signature on the statement, he
          5  didn't bother to read it -- I'm sorry.  He did read
          6  it.  But I told him that the statement had nothing to
          7  do with what I had just told him, and he told me that I
          8  should sign it now, that they were very busy, that he
          9  would later on come to see me at home or call me to his
         10  office, and that we would correct the statement later
         11  on.
         12            He never came to see me, nor did he ever call
         13  me.  But I was called by the Tribunal in Tuzla, so I
         14  told them that the statement that I had previously
         15  given was not correct, the statement that I gave to our
         16  SUP, Ministry of the Interior.  But they told me that
         17  this did not matter, that what mattered was what I was
         18  going to tell them, and this is how we proceeded.
         19            So the original statement is not correct, and
         20  I warned them about that.
         21       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, were you ever called again?
         22       A.   You mean by our people, by the SUP people,
         23  the people from Tuzla?
         24       Q.   Yes.
         25       A.   No, they didn't.

          1       Q.   Did you give one more statement to the
          2  Tribunal later on?
          3       A.   I gave several statements to the Tribunal.  I
          4  don't know how many.
          5       Q.   While you were giving your statement to the
          6  Tribunal, was anybody from the Bosniak police present
          7  on that occasion?
          8       A.   I gave the statement in the SUP, in Tuzla.
          9       Q.   While you were giving the statement to the
         10  Tribunal, was anybody present, anybody from the Tuzla
         11  Ministry of the Interior, present in the office?
         12       A.   I don't know.  I mean, they were wearing
         13  uniforms.  They were people from the SUP, people from
         14  the Ministry of the Interior.
         15       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, do you then deny everything
         16  that was said in the statement of the 18th of August,
         17  1995?
         18       A.   I do not deny everything.  There have been
         19  errors, that is true.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         21  Mr. Visnjic, sorry to interrupt, but I believe the
         22  witness has already answered that question.  If you ask
         23  specific questions, you will get specific answers.  I
         24  believe that the witness has already explained these
         25  things.

          1            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          2  Mr. President.  I was already going to ask a very
          3  specific question in relation to that.
          4       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, let me read you a passage from
          5  your statement of the 18th of August, I mean, the
          6  statement you said was a bit problematic, and I should
          7  like to hear an explanation from you.  I should like
          8  you to explain the differences from that statement and
          9  what you're saying now.
         10       A.   I don't know.  I don't remember what
         11  happened.
         12       Q.   Will you please wait for my question.
         13       A.   Yes.
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] For the
         15  interpreters, the Serbian version of the text is on
         16  page 2.
         17       Q.   "In the meantime, I ended up in the Express
         18  Transport compound, from where I saw a Chetnik, blond,
         19  short, medium build, close to the asphalt road.  He
         20  snatched a three-or four-month old child from its
         21  mother's arms and smashed it on the cement.  He then
         22  took the woman by the hair, put her head across his
         23  knee and slit her throat.  The two men from the crowd
         24  wrapped the corpses in a blanket and took them away
         25  along the Bratunac road."

          1       A.   No, no, I don't know what he wrote down.
          2  This is what I heard later on.  I heard that the woman
          3  had been Naser's close relative, that she was killed
          4  together with her child.  But I did not say that.
          5       Q.   Yes, but the event, the way you related it
          6  today, is not the same one that is described in the
          7  statement?
          8       A.   I don't know how it happened.  I only heard
          9  people describe the event later on, how this Naser's
         10  close relative was killed, together with her child.
         11       Q.   You told us about an event -- you told us
         12  about this event today, and you told us that a baby was
         13  killed by a soldier in the Zinc Company?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   However, this is not the same event.
         16       A.   Well, these are two different things.
         17       Q.   What do you mean, "two different things"?
         18       A.   Well, I can only say that the child -- I can
         19  only claim that the child was killed.
         20       Q.   Did you ever mention this event, the way you
         21  described it today, to the investigative authorities of
         22  Bosnia-Herzegovina?
         23       A.   I may have told them that I had heard about
         24  the event.
         25       Q.   But I'm asking you about this particular one

          1  that took place near the Zinc Company.
          2       A.   Yes.  I believe that I told them so.
          3            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the speakers please
          4  pause between question and answer.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I'm sorry
          6  to interrupt you, Mr. Visnjic, but Witness, please, try
          7  to make a pause before you start answering the
          8  questions.  This will be much easier for the
          9  interpreters.
         10            You speak the same language, the counsel and
         11  you, and I know that it is very easy for the two of you
         12  to communicate speedily, but you have to bear in mind
         13  that there are interpreters between you.  If you can
         14  please bear this fact in mind, the Chamber will be
         15  grateful.  I could perhaps motion to you, I can tell
         16  you either to slow down, like this [indicates], or to
         17  make a pause.
         18            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] I should like to
         19  remind the interpreters to say "Question" and "Answer"
         20  because sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish
         21  between the two.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         23            Mr. Visnjic, you may continue.
         24            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         25  Mr. President.

          1       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, let me read you one more
          2  passage from your statement of the 18th of August,
          3  1995.  It is the last passage on the first page of the
          4  Serbo-Croatian text.
          5            "When they left at around 1300, Chetniks
          6  went into the crowd and immediately began taking away
          7  young women.  I was with Ibran Mehmic [phoen] and
          8  Dzemal Karic from Kasaba in the Zinkada compound, when
          9  I saw Chetniks taking away a group of about ten young
         10  women towards the river, which was across from the
         11  Zinkada.  I do not know any of the young women, but I
         12  know that the group of Chetniks who took away the women
         13  was commanded by Zoran Mirosavljevic, son of Dimitri,
         14  from Bratunac."
         15       A.   I already told you that there were a lot of
         16  people there, and I told you that the people who took
         17  my statement didn't actually listen to what I was
         18  stating.  They were flirting with this young woman.  I
         19  don't know what they wrote down.  This is not what I
         20  said, this is not what I saw, and this is not what I
         21  told them.
         22       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, you described an event today in
         23  which a Serb soldier took away a Muslim girl from her
         24  parents.
         25       A.   Yes.  That took place in the Zinc Factory.

          1  There were two soldiers.
          2       Q.   Yes.  That is the event I have in mind.
          3  Could you please tell us whether the event that you
          4  have described today and the event as it is described
          5  in the statement, if such an event should have
          6  happened, are one and the same event?
          7       A.   I was just about to explain this to you.
          8  This is something different.  This is not what I said.
          9       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, I should like to go back to the
         10  12th of July, 1995 and your whereabouts on that day.  I
         11  think that the record shows that while you were near
         12  Aljo's house, that you reached that particular location
         13  at around 10.00, but I don't think it is correct.
         14       A.   No, this is not correct.  I got there on
         15  Tuesday, at 11.00 p.m.  I arrived in Potocari, in the
         16  Zinc Factory, on that evening.
         17       Q.   Yes.  Very well.  I should like to discuss
         18  the incident of the killing of a number of Muslims by
         19  Serb soldiers in the vicinity of Aljo's house.  Do you
         20  know which event I have in mind?
         21       A.   Yes, I do.
         22       Q.   When exactly did you reach the position from
         23  which you could observe the event?
         24       A.   Well, I didn't have a watch, but it could
         25  have been sometime after 3.00, 3.00 p.m.  Yes, it was

          1  in the afternoon hours.
          2       Q.   Could you give us an idea as to how long this
          3  event lasted?
          4       A.   I don't know whether you followed my
          5  testimony.  It was a bit -- it was between two and
          6  three hours.  But I didn't have a watch, so I couldn't
          7  tell you more precisely.
          8       Q.   I should now like to discuss a few details of
          9  that event, if you can remember them.
         10            You spoke about a kind of ramp.  I more or
         11  less have an idea as to what you had in mind, but could
         12  you explain to the Judges what it was?
         13       A.   There were two -- there was a kind of
         14  scaffold that had been prepared for the killing, and
         15  there was a beam across which people were put, with
         16  their hands behind their backs.  The Chetniks were
         17  holding their hands behind their backs.  There was a
         18  third Chetnik holding them by their head, and there was
         19  a fourth one who was chopping their heads off and
         20  throwing them on a pile.
         21       Q.   You said they used a kind of sword.
         22       A.   Well, some people call it a sword, some
         23  people call it a knife.  You probably know exactly what
         24  I'm talking about.  Some people even call it a
         25  machete.  We have hundreds of names for one particular

          1  thing in the Bosnian language.
          2       Q.   Yes, but I believe that there is a difference
          3  between a knife and a sword and a saber.  Could you
          4  please explain the difference to the Judges?
          5       A.   Well, I don't know what more you want.  There
          6  is this thing -- I must say that I didn't come close to
          7  those men.  I had not had any sleep for five days
          8  because of the shelling, because of the commotion and
          9  everything, but I could see a huge blade like this
         10  [indicates] that they used for chopping off people's
         11  heads.  I don't know exactly how you would call it.  We
         12  call it, I don't know, a saber, a sword, a butcher's
         13  knife.
         14       Q.   I know it's a bit uncomfortable for you to
         15  remember these details, but could you tell us how it
         16  happened, this chopping off of heads?
         17       A.   Yes, the same way -- they chopped off
         18  people's heads the way you chop off heads of animals.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         20  Mr. Visnjic, what is the objective of your questions?
         21  I mean, how can we be assisted by these details?
         22            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours,
         23  the witness has mentioned the approximate time of the
         24  event, and he also gave us an approximate number of
         25  people that were killed in this way.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
          2  Mr. Visnjic, but I think that we should be able to
          3  understand.  We all realise that it is very difficult
          4  for a witness to be very specific and precise after
          5  five years, and we cannot expect the witness to tell
          6  the exact time of the day, the exact number of the
          7  victims.  I don't think that these particular details
          8  are relevant for the present case.
          9            I do not wish to impose any method on you --
         10  you're doing your job and I have a profound respect for
         11  that -- but we simply cannot ask this witness to
         12  remember things that took place five years ago, and he
         13  just told you that he hadn't had any sleep for five
         14  days.  We have to be able to imagine the circumstances
         15  of the event, which was very emotional, and we have to
         16  bear in mind that there are certain limitations on
         17  human perception.
         18            I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that it is
         19  almost a torture -- I'm a bit reluctant to use this
         20  word -- for the witness, to try to remind him of all
         21  these events.  Well, I don't want to say that you've
         22  been torturing this witness, but please bear in mind
         23  the fact that we have to proceed in a speedy fashion
         24  and we have to restrict ourselves to the details which
         25  are really important and relevant.  Please try to be

          1  more precise and direct in your questions.
          2            And I'm sorry once again for having
          3  interrupted you, Mr. Visnjic.
          4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          5  Mr. President.
          6       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, I'm now going to read a portion
          7  from your statement given on the 23rd of May, 1996, and
          8  I should like you to confirm this passage.
          9            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] It is Exhibit
         10  7, page 3, last paragraph of the Serbo-Croat version.
         11            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] This
         12  statement will be marked as Exhibit D7.
         13       A.   Why don't you read it to me?  I can't read
         14  very well.
         15            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
         16       Q.   "In between the executions, the group of
         17  soldiers was drinking and eating."
         18       A.   Yes, they were.
         19       Q.   "It looked like it was for them a kind of
         20  entertainment --"
         21       A.   Yes, it was like a wedding.  They would drink
         22  and play amongst themselves in between two killings.
         23       Q.   "The same two soldiers went to fetch another
         24  group of men, and the same event happened again."
         25       A.   Yes, they brought another group of men.

          1       Q.   Mr. Ademovic, at what intervals would those
          2  two same soldiers go back to the Zinc Factory to bring
          3  new people?  And how many men would they bring along
          4  with them?
          5       A.   Well, not less than four, not more than six
          6  or seven.  Somewhere between four and seven.
          7       Q.   How long did it take them to go and bring
          8  that group?  Well, the Judge has just told you --
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
         10  Witness.  Could we make something into a rule?  Before
         11  you begin to answer, take one minute to think.  Can you
         12  understand what I'm saying?  So Mr. Visnjic asks you a
         13  question --
         14            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I do
         15  understand.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Just
         17  imagine that you have to take one minute to think about
         18  your answer, and then answer.  Okay?  All right?  Very
         19  well.
         20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I didn't have a
         21  watch.  I couldn't really time it.  I couldn't know.
         22            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
         23       Q.   One more question, Mr. Ademovic, about that
         24  incident.  You said that bodies were put in some
         25  camouflage bags, or something like that, if I
          1  understood you well.
          2       A.   Yes.  Yes.
          3       Q.   What kind of sacks were they?
          4       A.   Well, they are sky blue.  They are more or
          5  less like this chair here.
          6       Q.   Why camouflage?  I don't understand.  Was it
          7  something with the interpretation?
          8       A.   Well, that's the colour, that's what I call
          9  it.
         10       Q.   Who is Aljo Hasanovic, Mr. Ademovic?
         11       A.   Aljo Hasanovic, the owner of the house.  They
         12  were slaughtering next to his house.  Aljo.
         13            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] I have no
         14  further questions, Mr. President.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         16  do you have any additional questions?
         17            MR. HARMON:  No, Mr. President, I have no
         18  further questions.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Judge
         20  Riad.
         21                 Questioned by the Court:
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Mr. Bego Ademovic, good
         23  afternoon.  Can you hear me?
         24       A.   Good afternoon.  I can hear you very well.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  I just want to follow with you

          1  some of this very painful experience you had.  I will
          2  not prolong it, as much as I can.
          3            First you said, when I think the Prosecutor
          4  asked you about the Bosnian Serb soldiers, you said
          5  that that was no army.  When you said that, I
          6  understood, or perhaps it was meant, that these were
          7  monsters and not soldiers.  But did you also mean that
          8  they were not organised completely, they were just wild
          9  people running around, or was it disciplined as an
         10  army, although they were acting like monsters?  Did you
         11  understand my question?
         12       A.   I understand your question.  A proper army
         13  wages a war against an army and does not just kill,
         14  does not mutilate, does not rape the young girls, does
         15  not cut arms, does not gouge out eyes, does not behead
         16  people.  So that to me, they're wild men.  No army,
         17  they are.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Please bear with me.  It
         19  so happened in previous wars, perhaps you were not
         20  born, there was the Second World War, where some armies
         21  exterminated people and they were still called armies.
         22  So do you consider that this was just bands, wild
         23  bands, or was it in the form of an army?  I'm speaking
         24  from the formation side, not their morality.  I
         25  understand your revolt, but we're not discussing their

          1  morality.  So the discipline, the organisation, the
          2  weapons, and what constitutes an army officially.
          3       A.   The Chetnik leadership, the top, from
          4  Milosevic in Belgrade, organised something like a hoard
          5  of miscreants to exterminate the Muslims in Bosnia and
          6  Herzegovina, to create Greater Serbia.  When such a
          7  case happened, I wasn't born then, but the same thing
          8  was in 1941.  In my village, 73 people burnt to death
          9  in their houses, and 61 survived, and the tradition
         10  goes on.  That's what my parents told me.  I don't
         11  know.  They killed my uncle and brothers and sisters.
         12  And what do I know?  Lots of my relatives.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Well, that brings me to another
         14  question, because you also mentioned that the soldiers,
         15  when they stopped you and cursed you and your group,
         16  they told you, "This is a Serb country."  Did they tell
         17  you what you were supposed to do, where you were
         18  supposed to go?
         19       A.   The soldier did not stop me.  That was in
         20  Potocari.  When they stopped us, they did not insult
         21  anybody, they did not offend anybody on the road.  And
         22  this happened in Potocari, on Wednesday, after 10.00.
         23  They were cursing our balija mothers, "You'll all be
         24  butchered.  You will be burned in acid.  This is our
         25  Serb fatherland.  This is Greater Serbia."

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, when you were on your way
          2  to Konjevic Polje, I remember you said two soldiers
          3  asked the driver, Raco, when he stopped, they asked
          4  him, "Is there anything for us," if you remember.  What
          5  did they mean by "Is there anything for us?"
          6       A.   Well, he meant if they liked somebody, they
          7  would get them off, so to kill them, to rape.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  In fact, you also mentioned that
          9  sometimes, and you gave two different meanings, you
         10  said, "They would stop people and choose the people
         11  they liked to kill."  What is the meaning of "choose
         12  the people they liked"?  I remember your words.  You
         13  said, "Sometimes the people they liked and sometimes
         14  the people they suspected."  Does that apply to women
         15  or to men?
         16       A.   Well, women, if they liked them, to rape
         17  them, and men, to finish them off, unless somebody was
         18  a friend of theirs.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  I found your words.  You said,
         20  "They would pick the people they recognised."  Were
         21  they after certain people, or they just took anyone?
         22       A.   That happened too, to look for individuals,
         23  for specific individuals, but that only happened now
         24  and then.  They were usually taking everybody.  In
         25  Potocari, there lived Omer.  He was born like this

          1  [indicates], he was an invalid; he was 75 years old,
          2  and they killed him too.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  If you remember, you mentioned
          4  that you saw something like 1.000 Muslims, driven by
          5  Serbs, with their hands behind their heads.  I think
          6  that was when you were in the bus.  Did you know after
          7  that what happened to these men?
          8       A.   Killed in the playground, before Kasaba, all
          9  of them.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  And how did you know that?
         11       A.   People who watched it said, hiding in the
         12  thicket and watching from the thicket.  Brought to the
         13  playground, put a table there, a PAM on the table,
         14  around the table, and they would just go around, make a
         15  round, and finish them all off.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Also by slaughtering them with
         17  knives or shooting, or you don't know?  You don't know
         18  the way.
         19       A.   I heard only about shooting them dead, not
         20  about slaughtering them dead.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Just one last question.  Perhaps
         22  I don't want to remind you.  You said your mother died
         23  in the forest, in the woods.  How did she die?
         24       A.   My mother -- my mother was 81 and was over
         25  100 kilogrammes.  We were going through the woods -- we

          1  were going through the forest and she remained there,
          2  she died there.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  I would like to thank you and to
          4  apologise for having aroused these memories.
          5            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness
          7  Ademovic, I have only one question for you.  Are you
          8  ready?
          9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         11  very much.
         12            Witness Ademovic, you were a driver by
         13  profession, and it took you to large cities, especially
         14  before the war, on various occasions.
         15       A.   Yes.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] For
         17  instance, you must have been to Sarajevo very many
         18  times.
         19       A.   Yes.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In
         21  Sarajevo, was there a military barracks there?
         22       A.   Yes, but I never went into the barracks.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Was there a
         24  police station there, for instance?
         25       A.   In Sarajevo, you mean?  Yes.  Yes, there

          1  was.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In the
          3  streets of Sarajevo, for instance, or perhaps some
          4  other city, could you distinguish between a soldier and
          5  a policeman?
          6       A.   You mean before the war?
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Before the
          8  war, yes.
          9       A.   Yes.  Yes.  They had different uniforms.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] They had
         11  different uniforms.
         12       A.   Yes.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] On the
         14  10th, the 11th, the 12th, the 13th of July, did you see
         15  the difference between the police and the military
         16  uniforms?
         17       A.   I didn't.  Those camouflage uniforms are all
         18  alike, and I know nothing about them.  I knew what
         19  Tito's uniform was, but that was a different type of
         20  police and a different kind of army.  Now I don't
         21  understand anything.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So this was
         23  your answer.  Thank you very much.  We should like to
         24  thank you for coming to give your evidence.  It is
         25  always difficult to bring back those memories, to

          1  remember those horrible things that you lived through,
          2  but we hope that having come here, it will help you to
          3  find peace for yourself and enough peace to live in
          4  peace with other people, whether with people of your
          5  religion, your race, or perhaps you will make some
          6  other choice.
          7            But perhaps you were not asked something that
          8  you should like to say, that you had no other
          9  opportunity to say.  Is there something that you should
         10  like to say now?
         11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         12  Mr. President.  I hope if Alija goes from power, his
         13  party, and if Milosevic goes, then we shall live
         14  together as we did before.  If they stay on, there will
         15  be no life for us.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         17  Thank you very much, and we wish you a happy return
         18  home.
         19            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Once again,
         20  Your Honour, I want to see if Exhibits D6 and D7 are
         21  admitted.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         23  Mr. Visnjic, do you want to tender these documents?
         24            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Indeed,
         25  Mr. President, yes.  D6 and D7.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Any
          2  objections?  Mr. Harmon, do you object?
          3            MR. HARMON:  I have no objection to D6, and
          4  if you just give me one minute to look at D7, no
          5  objection to D7 either.  Thank you.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] As you
          7  know, Mr. Visnjic, the Prosecutor needs to look into
          8  it, to see if there is any obligation of
          9  confidentiality, if there is anything that requires
         10  different measures.
         11                 [The witness withdrew]
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         13  So D6 and D7 are admitted, and Mr. Dubuisson will take
         14  care of them.
         15            Very well.  It is now twenty-five past two.
         16  I don't think that it is really possible to call in
         17  another witness, is it, Mr. Harmon?
         18            MR. HARMON:  It's up to Your Honours,
         19  Mr. President.  We're prepared to present another
         20  witness, but I leave it to your discretion.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Thank
         22  you, Mr. Harmon.  I do not really think it will be very
         23  convenient and useful to have a witness who will only
         24  take the solemn declaration and then leave.  So we
         25  shall adjourn today, until half past nine tomorrow.

          1            I wish to apologise to the interpreters.  I
          2  know the interpreters are well familiar with the
          3  working conditions, better than we do.  We are really
          4  doing our best to help them, but there is --
          5  spontaneity, I think, is more powerful, and I don't
          6  think that even the President of the Chamber can not
          7  interfere with the witness and the way in which he
          8  speaks.  But we shall perhaps have to think of some
          9  technical device to keep us remembering the
         10  interpreters, that they are there.
         11            Very well.  I hope that if we understand what
         12  their working conditions are, then perhaps we shall be
         13  able to do something about them and make them better.
         14            Very well.  I wish you a pleasant afternoon,
         15  and we shall be back here at half past nine.  Thank
         16  you.
         17                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
         18                 2.38 p.m., to be reconvened on Thursday,
         19                 the 30th day of March, 2000, at
         20                 9.30 a.m.
