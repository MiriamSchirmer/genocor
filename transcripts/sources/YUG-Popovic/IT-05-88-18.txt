          2                 [Open session]
          3                 --- Upon commencing at 9.32 a.m.
          4                 [The accused entered court]
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          6  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning to the
          7  technical booth, to the interpreters.  Yes, I can hear
          8  you.
          9            We're back to resume the case against
         10  General Krstic.  I believe I see Mr. Cayley behind this
         11  pillar.  There's always this problem, but I see that
         12  the team is here.  We can now move on with our case.  I
         13  believe we have one witness today.
         14            Mr. Harmon, is that so?
         15            MR. HARMON:  We are continuing with
         16  Mrs. Omanovic, Mr. President.  Good morning,
         17  Mr. President and Your Honours; good morning, counsel.
         18                 [The witness entered court]
         19                 WITNESS:  CAMILA OMANOVIC [Resumed]
         20                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         22  morning, Mrs. Omanovic.  Can you hear me?
         23            THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Thank you.  Good
         24  morning.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You will

          1  now resume your evidence today.  I should like to
          2  remind you that you are still under your solemn
          3  declaration, and you will continue to answer questions
          4  which Mr. Harmon will ask of you.  Thank you.
          5                 Examined by Mr. Harmon: [Cont'd]
          6       Q.   Good morning, Mrs. Omanovic.
          7       A.   Good morning.
          8       Q.   Before we return to your description of the
          9  events in Potocari, I want to ask you a few questions
         10  about some individuals.  Do you know the Streten
         11  Petrovic family?
         12       A.   Yes, I do, that family, because Streten lived
         13  in the same area with me.
         14       Q.   Approximately how old is Streten Petrovic?
         15       A.   Forty-ish.  Slightly younger than I am.
         16       Q.   Do you know the name of Streten Petrovic's
         17  father?
         18       A.   They called him Ilija Saspata, and even
         19  before the war he had a very characteristic long
         20  moustache.
         21       Q.   Thank you very much.  Now, let us return to
         22  where we were yesterday when we took a recess.  In your
         23  testimony, you had described your flight from
         24  Srebrenica to Potocari, and you told us that you had
         25  arrived at a location known as the Zinc Factory.  Is

          1  that correct?
          2       A.   Yes.  We reached the compound of the zinc
          3  plating unit and that is where we spent the night.
          4       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges the conditions
          5  in which you found yourself at the zinc factory?
          6       A.   When we arrived from Srebrenica, we were in
          7  the yard of the zinc factory and nearby factories.
          8  People came there simply -- I don't know why, but we
          9  somehow thought we would not go any further because the
         10  UN base was there.  So we somehow thought we should put
         11  up there for the night, that we should make the best we
         12  could.  And everybody, whatever personal effects he had
         13  with him, looked where he would spend the night.
         14            So it was kind of a plateau, an area where we
         15  gathered.  I found a cover of a container that they
         16  used to zinc plate in that factory, so we used that,
         17  covered it, and that was our bed.  The baby had its
         18  pram, and we left our belongings in the pram and we
         19  simply lied down on the ground.  Or, rather, you
         20  couldn't lay down, you simply had a corner where you
         21  waited what would happen next.
         22            As we sat there, snipers would fire every now
         23  and then, and all this throng would then move to one
         24  side or the other, screaming.  Above us was the Pecista
         25  village where the Serb soldiers were firing at houses.

          1  The sound of that shell, again we would simply dodge to
          2  one side or the other with frightened cries, and that
          3  is how we spent the night.
          4            Some were throwing up, some were scared.  It
          5  was the area where you lived, even the -- that area,
          6  that small tight space was everything to us, the
          7  bedroom, the bathroom, everything.  We were simply all
          8  crowded there.
          9       Q.   You mentioned the village of Pecista.  Could
         10  you tell the Judges what you saw happening to that
         11  particular village and houses around it?
         12       A.   Above the village of Pecista, along the edges
         13  of the village, the houses were -- around there the
         14  houses were torched.  They were firing shells and
         15  everything was going up in the air.
         16       Q.   Were you in a position where you could see
         17  the soldiers lighting the houses on fire?
         18       A.   I couldn't see the soldiers myself, but the
         19  houses were being put on fire.  You can't see it with
         20  the naked eye but you can see the flames.  You can see
         21  it's burning.
         22       Q.   Now, in and around the zinc factory, how many
         23  people were with you?  Can you estimate the number of
         24  refugees?
         25       A.   The exact number I couldn't really give you,

          1  but there were some several thousand people in that
          2  area.  We were packed close together, and the area
          3  couldn't have had more than one kilometre square, and
          4  yet all people who had arrived from Srebrenica were
          5  there in all those production plants around the zinc
          6  plating factory.  The 11 of March, the zinc plating
          7  unit, and down to the yellow ribbon that separated the
          8  UN base from the rest of the world.
          9       Q.   What kind of food, what kind of water was
         10  available to the refugees?
         11       A.   Only what one happened to bring along, but
         12  mostly people went without food and without water.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Your Honours,
         14  I'm going to now show a film clip that is approximately
         15  47 seconds long, so it is a clip that will be -- you
         16  have to look at very quickly, but it will show the
         17  crowds of people.  If we could have the lights reduced
         18  and we could show this clip.  As I say, it's very
         19  brief, and it's taken from footage that we have
         20  available to us, and we believe it accurately reflects
         21  the number of people in and around at the particular
         22  moment.  It is Exhibit number 51.
         23                 [Videotape played]
         24            MR. HARMON:
         25       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, you've seen this film footage

          1  before, because I've shown it to you, but does this
          2  accurately show in some respects the number of people,
          3  refugees who were in and around the buildings in
          4  Potocari?
          5       A.   Yes, quite, as this film shows.  It describes
          6  accurately the situation in which we found ourselves in
          7  Potocari.
          8       Q.   Now, on the night of the 11th, when you were
          9  in and around the Zinc Factory, can you tell the Judges
         10  the general mood, the general mental state of the
         11  refugees?
         12       A.   People were all frightened, people were all
         13  hungry, people were scared out of their wits.  They
         14  didn't know what would happen next, so that those were
         15  people who were terrified.  I don't know -- I don't
         16  really know how to describe it.
         17       Q.   All right.  Well, let's focus our attention,
         18  then, on the following day, Mrs. Omanovic, because the
         19  next day you were selected to become a representative
         20  of the Muslim people and you were selected to attend
         21  the meeting at the Hotel Fontana.  Can you tell the
         22  Judges how it was that you were selected?
         23       A.   In the morning, when the next morning came,
         24  Ibro Nuhanovic, Zina Civic, and Nesib Mandzic came to
         25  look for me.  And they said, "We have to go to the

          1  Dutch camp to talk about putting some order in this
          2  area where we are."  I was lying down on the ground and
          3  I looked very untidy, so I said, "I have to change
          4  slightly and put myself in order.  Why me?"  "Well,"
          5  they said, "you come from Srebrenica.  Most --
          6  indigenous Srebrenica."  People had left Srebrenica
          7  before the war and there were very few literate
          8  indigenous Srebrenica people left.
          9            So they chose me, as a mother, as a woman,
         10  and a literate person; they asked me to go there as a
         11  representative of women, to go to the Dutch camp to
         12  talk to them, to ask for some relief in food, an
         13  organisation there.  Because the weather was so hot
         14  that after a day or two we would have certainly fallen
         15  ill from one disease or another, because it was so
         16  hot.  And we would have perished simply from the heat,
         17  from diseases, from hunger, from thirst, from that
         18  disorderly life.
         19            So I went with them to the Dutch camp to talk
         20  to people so that we could organise ourselves, with
         21  their help, and try to see how to make our life more
         22  organised in that area.
         23            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Your Honours,
         24  I'm going to now show you Prosecutor's Exhibit 49,
         25  which is a small segment of film footage from that

          1  meeting.  The film is approximately eight minutes
          2  long.  It only represents a part of the meeting.  And I
          3  would ask Mr. Dubuisson to please disseminate to Your
          4  Honours copies of the transcript from that meeting.
          5  The film is Prosecutor's Exhibit 49 and the transcripts
          6  are 49A in English, 49B in French, and 49C in B/C/S.
          7            And I would ask the interpreters to please
          8  translate the film as it's being shown.
          9            Now, if we could dim the lights, please, and
         10  we could start with Prosecutor's Exhibit 49, please.
         11  Could the lights be dimmed, please.
         12            THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover]

         20  is your profession?

         22  We didn't know that this would happen.  And I mean, had
         23  we been politicians, but we were simply citizens.  I
         24  never had an argument with anyone in Srebrenica, never
         25  with anyone.  I just live my good solid life, my life,

          1  and it just happened so that I stayed in Srebrenica
          2  without some [indiscernible].  Here, again, what will

          1  worked in Srebrenica.  But they chose me to come here
          2  with these people.  They invited me.
          3            "MLADIC:  I want to help you but I want
          4  absolute cooperation of the civilian population.
          5  Because your army has suffered defeat, there is no need
          6  for your men to get killed; your husband, your brothers
          7  or your neighbours.  All you have to do is to say what
          8  you want.  And I told that to a gentleman last night.
          9  You can either survive or vanish.  For your survival, I
         10  request that all your men who carry weapons, who
         11  attacked and committed crimes, the men who did commit
         12  the crimes against your people, did they hand over
         13  their weapons to the Army of Republika Srpska.  And
         14  after you lay down your weapons, you can choose to
         15  either stay in the territory or, if that would suit you
         16  better, to go where you wish.  The wish of every
         17  individual inhabitant here will be respected no matter
         18  how many of you there are.
         19            "CAMILA:  How do we get in touch with them?
         20            "MLADIC:  You are in a position to know.  The
         21  rest of the army can be disarmed and lay down their
         22  weapons before my officers in the presence of UNPROFOR
         23  officers.  You can choose to stay or leave if you
         24  wish.  If you want to leave, you can say so and you can
         25  go to the four corners of the world. After the weapons

          1  are laid down, every individual can go where he says he
          2  wants to go.  That is why it is necessary to provide
          3  the fuel.  I'll provide vehicles.  You can provide the
          4  fuel.  You can pay for it.  If you cannot afford to pay
          5  for it, then UNPROFOR should bring in four or five
          6  tanker trucks to fill up the trucks, because there are
          7  a lot of people, and that should be solved. If you
          8  choose to leave, and I do not want to influence you in
          9  any way, I have nothing against you, I have nothing
         10  against the innocent and guiltless.  You can choose if
         11  you want to go east across Serbia or -- I don't mind.
         12  If you want to go west, you can say where you want to
         13  go.

         15  Bratunac, to the stadium.
         16            "MLADIC:  Right.  Who said that?
         17            "VOICE:  The people.
         18            "MLADIC:  Are they coming here?  Let them go
         19  to the stadium and one of their representatives from
         20  here will be with those people there to see them board
         21  on.
         22            "CAMILA:  Could I ask you if my daughter and
         23  her child could go?
         24            "MLADIC:  Well, yes.
         25            "CAMILA:  She shouldn't leave her here.  I'd

          1  rather stay here myself.
          2            "MLADIC:  If necessary, madam, you and your
          3  daughter and granddaughter will be transferred in my
          4  vehicle.  Don't worry."
          5            MR. HARMON:
          6       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, that film clip is only a
          7  portion of the meeting; is that not correct?
          8       A.   Yes, it is.  It is only a fragment of the
          9  meeting at which I was present.
         10       Q.   Describe the meeting, when you came in, what
         11  happened once you came in.
         12       A.   I entered the room, and that is when I saw my
         13  schoolfellow Miroslav Deronjic.  I was really
         14  terrified.  Then at some point I turned to him and I
         15  said, "Miroslav, dear, what are you doing to all those
         16  people.  Help us.  They're all bare handed, hungry,
         17  barefoot, driven to the stadium like cattle, left at
         18  the mercy of those men.  They're firing, targeting at
         19  them."
         20            Then Mr. Mladic told us to sit down, because
         21  we knew one another.  And he said that he had
         22  experienced the greatest success of his life during
         23  those days, the conquest of Srebrenica.  And my feeling
         24  was that he had prepared it all as a form of theatre,
         25  as a stage to show it all to us.

          1            He just indicated to somebody with his hand
          2  to bring something, and he brought a broken vase from
          3  the municipal hall in Srebrenica, and he said, "This is
          4  my trophy, the greatest moment in my life, the conquest
          5  of Srebrenica.  I know how many people were born
          6  there."
          7            And they brought the Registry of Births, and
          8  then they brought in the Registry of Deaths and the
          9  Registry of Marriages, and he said, "I know the last
         10  person who had got married in Srebrenica."  He said,
         11  "You can go anywhere you want or you can stay here or
         12  just vanish."
         13            Then I knew that if we agreed to leave there,
         14  then perhaps we might survive, and if we tried to stay,
         15  that we would simply exist no more.
         16       Q.   Now, you mentioned at the beginning of the
         17  meeting that you had a conversation with Mr. Deronjic.
         18            MR. HARMON:  If I could have the next exhibit
         19  which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 52 disseminate, and if I
         20  could have it also placed on the ELMO.  Just a little
         21  lower, please.
         22       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, this is a still image taken
         23  from the film we just saw, and let me ask you if you
         24  can identify in Prosecutor's Exhibit 52 Mr. Deronjic.
         25       A.   He was sitting across the table.  This is him

          1  [indicates].
          2       Q.   The record should reflect --
          3       A.   The man with whom I went to school.
          4            MR. HARMON:  The record should reflect that
          5  Mrs. Omanovic has pointed to the man in the far
          6  right-hand corner of the image, the man in the black
          7  jacket holding a glass in his left hand.
          8       Q.   Now, you mentioned that you made a request at
          9  the beginning of the meeting or a plea of some sort to
         10  Mr. Deronjic.  What did Mr. Deronjic say to you after
         11  you made that request?
         12       A.   He was trying to explain that he too had had
         13  victims in that war, but Mladic interrupted him.
         14  Mladic wouldn't let anyone discuss, and I had the
         15  feeling that he wanted to have the main say in the
         16  meeting.
         17       Q.   Did anybody else have any say in the meeting
         18  or was General Mladic the person who was conducting the
         19  meeting alone?
         20       A.   It was General Mladic who conducted the
         21  meeting alone most of the time.
         22       Q.   Let me show you the next exhibit, which I'd
         23  ask also to be placed on the ELMO, which is
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibit 53.  I'd also ask that that be
         25  disseminated to the Court and to counsel.

          1            This also, Mrs. Omanovic, is a still
          2  photograph, an image taken from the film we just saw.
          3  Do you recognise anybody in this particular image other
          4  than General Mladic?
          5       A.   I know this man here [indicates].
          6       Q.   You're pointing to the man with the green
          7  shirt, civilian shirt, on the left-hand side of the
          8  image.  How do you know that man?
          9       A.   Yes, I'm pointing at him.  I just know him.
         10  I don't know what his name is.  We used to run into
         11  each other in town.  He lived in Bratunac, and I would
         12  often go to Bratunac to visit my sister.  Bratunac was
         13  the town that was closest to Srebrenica, and we used to
         14  meet each other.  We used to know a lot of people from
         15  Bratunac.  And I went there, when I went to see about
         16  the situation, about the evacuation, I saw that man.
         17  He was standing somewhere near the buses.
         18       Q.   What did he say, if anything?
         19       A.   He said, "Mrs. Camila, where are your
         20  children?"  But I lied to him.  I told him that my
         21  children had already left by bus.  He said, "No one can
         22  help you.  Your fate has been determined."
         23            At that moment, I simply knew that nothing
         24  would go well, that we didn't have many chances of
         25  survival, myself and my family, because my children

          1  were still in front of the transport company.
          2       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, after the meeting concluded,
          3  where did you go?
          4       A.   We were taken back to the UN base.  As we
          5  were going out, as we were going towards the UN camp, I
          6  saw that the Serb soldiers had already mingled with our
          7  population.  They were armed and they were walking
          8  around.  So I asked the driver to take me back to the
          9  location where my children were and he did that.  So
         10  instead of going to the UN base, I went to my
         11  children.
         12            I was waiting for Nuhanovic and Mandzic to
         13  join us, because we had an agreement in Bratunac that
         14  there was supposed to be a list and the evacuation was
         15  supposed to begin with elderly people, women and
         16  children, and I thought that this would happen, but
         17  they never showed up.  They never came back to do
         18  that.  We simply saw trucks and buses arrive after that
         19  and there was no order whatsoever.  People started
         20  boarding buses and the evacuation started.
         21       Q.   Now, on the 12th, did you also see
         22  General Mladic in Potocari?
         23       A.   Yes, I did.  He was standing behind the
         24  yellow ribbon and he was accompanied by his soldiers.
         25  They distributed several bars of chocolate to the

          1  people who were standing next to that yellow ribbon.
          2            They walked around a little amongst the
          3  people who had been amassed there, and then after that
          4  he simply left somewhere.
          5       Q.   Now, you said that people started to go
          6  toward the buses.  Did that include families with male
          7  members, with fathers and sons?
          8       A.   Yes.  All of the families started boarding
          9  those trucks, and again there was a big crowd of people
         10  and the atmosphere was the same as the one in
         11  Srebrenica before that.  People felt that they would be
         12  saved if they boarded trucks.  Everybody was yelling.
         13  Children were crying.  Everybody at the same time
         14  started moving towards the entrance where the buses
         15  were.  Everybody together, including women and men and
         16  children.
         17       Q.   Did you see anything happen to the men and
         18  the boys who were with the families moving toward the
         19  buses?
         20       A.   Yes, I did.  They were being separated.
         21  Between buses and along the street where the buses were
         22  lined up for transport, there were lots of soldiers and
         23  civilians who had the right to separate people.  It
         24  seemed that everybody had the right to separate people
         25  from the line.

          1            We didn't know the reason.  We didn't know
          2  why.  They were simply singling out people whom they
          3  didn't like, but I couldn't conclude anything as to the
          4  basis for that separation.
          5       Q.   Now, where did the men and the boys who were
          6  separated go?
          7       A.   They went towards the White House.  It was an
          8  uninterrupted column of people, very quiet, very calm,
          9  and you had the feeling that it would never stop, it
         10  would never be interrupted.  New people were coming,
         11  and the people at the end of the column would disappear
         12  behind the White House.
         13       Q.   Can you tell the Judges the range of ages of
         14  these males who had been separated and were queuing up
         15  in front of the White House?
         16       A.   All of them were above 13 years of age.
         17  There were lots of young boys who looked older, but
         18  those who were above 13 were separated.
         19       Q.   Did you see anybody -- any boy who happened
         20  to be disabled amongst the males who had been
         21  separated?
         22       A.   I saw Mirza Mehmedovic.  He was a totally
         23  handicapped person.  He couldn't communicate at all.
         24  He was mentally retarded.
         25       Q.   And was he in line as well, going toward the

          1  White House?
          2       A.   Yes, he was.  He was trying to say something
          3  to them, but they simply pushed him aside.  He was also
          4  separated, together with others.  He was completely
          5  mentally retarded.  He was unable to explain anything
          6  to anyone, but he was still separated.
          7       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, do you know if he survived?
          8       A.   No, he did not survive.
          9       Q.   Now, the men who had been separated, did they
         10  have with them personal effects, bags of their
         11  possessions?
         12       A.   They had their personal effects, but they
         13  couldn't take them into the White House.  There was a
         14  huge pile of things and people were told to leave their
         15  personal belongings on that pile, that they couldn't
         16  take anything with them.
         17       Q.   Now, after you saw this, Mrs. Omanovic, where
         18  did you go?
         19       A.   I went back to my family, and at that
         20  point -- you mean after Bratunac?
         21       Q.   After you had seen the separation of these
         22  men and boys and you'd seen General Mladic in and
         23  around Potocari, did you return back to the Zinc
         24  Factory and did you move to another location?
         25       A.   I went to the Zinc Factory where my family

          1  was, and I noticed there and all around the camp a
          2  number of armed people walking around.  Next to my
          3  family, there were between five and ten soldiers
          4  standing.  They were looking at my daughter and
          5  cursing, and I was really afraid to spend the night
          6  there.
          7            There was a little wood not far from there,
          8  and I was afraid that me, my daughter, my son, and the
          9  grandchild would be taken there.  So I crossed over to
         10  the other side of the street, and we stood on a little
         11  clearing next to some buses.  We put a blanket down and
         12  we sat there.  There were lots of people around us.
         13  The transport was going on, but there was a number of
         14  people who were standing actually near where we were.
         15       Q.   Now, when you say that the soldiers were
         16  cursing, were they cursing at your daughter or were
         17  they cursing at other refugees?
         18       A.   They were cursing my daughter.  They were
         19  really very vulgar.  "You're so young and you have a
         20  child."  And it's true, she was very young, she had a
         21  child, but they were glancing at her with hostility,
         22  and I was really afraid for her.
         23       Q.   Now, you say you moved.  Did you move to the
         24  bus compound across the way from the Zinc Factory?
         25       A.   Yes.  This is where I moved and this is where

          1  we stayed, on the following day as well.
          2       Q.   Now, how many other refugees were in and
          3  around the bus compound where you had relocated
          4  yourself?
          5       A.   Everybody except for those who were not able
          6  to board the buses.  Everybody was there and the space
          7  was getting narrower.  We were crowded next to each
          8  other so as to be as close as possible to the
          9  transport, to the buses.
         10       Q.   Are you able to estimate the number of people
         11  in and around the bus compound?
         12       A.   Again, it must have been several thousand,
         13  because in the evening, we learned that only 1.000
         14  people had been able to leave.  So everybody who
         15  eventually went to Tuzla was there, but we were all
         16  very crowded because people were in a hurry to board
         17  the buses.
         18       Q.   Now, I'd like you to describe what you saw
         19  and what you heard the night of the 12th and the early
         20  morning of the 13th while you were at the bus
         21  compound.
         22       A.   The second night was even worse than the
         23  first night, and I think it was the worst night I ever
         24  had in my life.
         25            In the evening and throughout the night, Serb

          1  soldiers and Serb population were moving around on
          2  buses and trucks, and they were shouting, they were
          3  firing, they were going to Srebrenica and back.  The
          4  Serbian soldiers would come to us with flashlights.
          5  They were singling out people, individuals, taking them
          6  away, and we would hear screams coming from behind the
          7  buses.  A woman was giving birth.  She was screaming.
          8  She had no one to help her.  Another one was going
          9  completely crazy.  This influenced other people as well
         10  and, in fact, the atmosphere in general.  So we would
         11  move all of a sudden in waves, and then shortly after
         12  that we would be calm again.
         13            Then they threw some kind of sand on all of
         14  us and people started coughing.  So people said that
         15  those were some kind of poisonous gases.
         16            We put the child in the pram and we covered
         17  the pram with something so as to help the baby.  People
         18  were throwing up.
         19            But the night was very, very calm and some
         20  people started falling asleep.  But from a nearby
         21  slaughterhouse, we all of a sudden heard a voice of a
         22  man who resembled the voice of Fikret Hodzic, whom we
         23  all knew very well, and it sounded as if he was being
         24  tortured.  He would cry, "Nesib, Nesib."  Then
         25  everybody else would start crying and yelling, and then

          1  everything would stop again.  We didn't have enough --
          2  we didn't have time to fall asleep or to keep quiet
          3  because screams would start all over again.  It was a
          4  night of horror.
          5            And I was just trying to figure out how to
          6  save my children.  I was not interested in living
          7  anymore.  I just wanted to save my children.  I wanted
          8  to cut my daughter's hair and to put a scarf on her
          9  head and to take her child away to try and make it on
         10  her own.
         11            I was talking to my son.  But there was a man
         12  next to us.  He was laying unconscious.  He looked
         13  paralysed.  And I told my son, "Go and sit by that
         14  man.  Try to think of a fake name.  Tell the people
         15  that this man is your grandfather, that you have to
         16  help him."  But my son just simply sat next to me and
         17  he wouldn't listen to me.  He didn't want to do that.
         18  And I spent all the night thinking how to save my
         19  children.  And I moved towards the entrance where
         20  everybody else was.  I really don't know how I was able
         21  to muster all that courage, because at the same time I
         22  witnessed this terrible scene of separation of people.
         23            They took their rucksacks and I took the
         24  baby.  We put some food -- we took some food for the
         25  children and we grabbed each other.  We took each

          1  other's hands and we were trying to make our way
          2  through the crowd.  I no longer had any force left.  I
          3  could not fight what was happening to me.  So we came
          4  close to that white ribbon -- I'm sorry, yellow ribbon,
          5  yellow tape, where UNPROFOR buses were.
          6       Q.   Let me interrupt you there for just a
          7  minute.  I'm sorry.  But when you said -- I'd like to
          8  stay focused, if we can, for just a few more minutes,
          9  on the night before you attempted to board the buses
         10  yourself.  So if we could stay focused on that for just
         11  a minute.
         12            You said that people would come into the
         13  compound and they would take refugees out of the
         14  compound.  Who were those people who were coming into
         15  the compound and how were they dressed?
         16       A.   Serb soldiers came.  They were wearing
         17  Serbian uniforms and UN uniforms, and they mingled with
         18  the population.  They were walking amongst us and they
         19  were looking for people -- on what basis, I don't
         20  know -- using flashlights, and they would point to
         21  certain individuals, who would then be taken away.
         22       Q.   And do you know a man by the name of Sefik
         23  Mustafic?
         24       A.   Yes, I know him.  He's a neighbour of mine.
         25  He was sitting next to us all that time while we were

          1  in Potocari.
          2       Q.   Tell the Judges what happened to that
          3  gentleman.
          4       A.   Sefic Mustafic was taken away, and after a
          5  while he returned.  He was frightened.  And we wanted
          6  to know what had happened, where he had been.  But he
          7  said he didn't dare tell us everything, that he
          8  couldn't tell us everything, that perhaps one day he
          9  would tell us what had happened.  So he spent some time
         10  sitting next to us and then he left.  We thought he had
         11  just gone for a walk, but he hanged himself.
         12       Q.   Now, let me ask you if while you were in the
         13  compound you had heard women being raped by Serb
         14  soldiers.
         15       A.   Everything that took place in the camp we
         16  could see or hear, because we were sitting next to each
         17  other.  Rumours were spreading quickly.  We could hear
         18  about rapes, murders, people being taken away.  We
         19  were all in the know, because we were all amassed at
         20  one place and news would spread quickly.  So whoever
         21  saw something would tell it to his neighbours, so we
         22  knew exactly what was happening where in the camp, at
         23  all times.
         24       Q.   Now, what effect did the separation of males,
         25  boys and husbands, from their families, what effect did

          1  the rumours of rapes, what effect did the cries of
          2  torture that you could hear in and around the bus
          3  compound have on the refugees who were in the bus
          4  compound?
          5       A.   All the while while we were staying there in
          6  the camp, we were just trying to figure out who would
          7  be next to be killed or to be taken away.  We were just
          8  waiting for that to happen.  And that's why people were
          9  in such a hurry.  That's why people wanted to leave as
         10  quickly as possible.  People were losing patience.
         11  They wanted something to happen.  They couldn't handle
         12  the uncertainty.  And that was the effect on the
         13  population.  We simply wanted to get away from there as
         14  quickly as possible.
         15       Q.   Now, did you subsequently learn that your
         16  young son had seen something while you were at the bus
         17  compound, and can you explain that to the Judges,
         18  please.
         19       A.   My son went to fetch some water, and he saw
         20  five or six human bodies that had been slaughtered near
         21  the river bank.  He wouldn't leave me after that.  He
         22  didn't talk about it anymore, but he wouldn't be
         23  separated from me after he had seen that terrible
         24  scene.
         25       Q.   Now, Mrs. Omanovic, I'd like to turn now to

          1  the morning of the 13th of July.  Did you attempt to
          2  leave?  Did you attempt to get on a bus or a truck?
          3  And can you explain to the Judges what happened?
          4       A.   On that morning, I decided to leave.  I took
          5  my children.  We were holding each other's hands.  I
          6  took the baby and I went to the -- up to the yellow
          7  ribbon.  It was very difficult.  Everybody was trying
          8  to leave.
          9            So I went to a vehicle which was a personnel
         10  carrier.  I thought it was an ICRC vehicle.  A lady was
         11  there who was acting as an interpreter.  She was
         12  telling people to calm down.  I tried to contact her.
         13  I tried to ask her to take the children and that I
         14  would come back, but she obviously didn't understand
         15  what I was saying.  So I went to the first vehicle, but
         16  some people were standing there who wouldn't let us on,
         17  and we were not allowed to board any of those buses.
         18  But there were a lot of people behind us.
         19            Again, a separation was taking place.  Some
         20  people were let on those buses, some were put aside.
         21  We were taken to the first truck, and near each truck
         22  there would be some kind of rock, or a stool, with
         23  some -- there was some jewellery on it.  And one person
         24  asked -- one person gave me several rings and a medal,
         25  and I didn't know -- I couldn't figure out why he was

          1  doing so.  And so he said, "You might need it in
          2  Bratunac."  But we were afraid, because there were
          3  rumours that on the way to Bratunac, or where people --
          4  where people would reach the Bosniak territory, that
          5  they were also being separated and their belongings
          6  were taken away from them.
          7            I started shouting, "Help, help."  I thought
          8  it was the ICRC.  I thought they would help us.  And
          9  then the Serb soldiers said, "Just start the engine and
         10  leave."  I had my two children on my sides and my
         11  daughter said, "Please, mother, don't cry.  Let us just
         12  throw away this jewellery.  No one will know that we had
         13  thrown it away."
         14            My children stayed on the truck and I jumped
         15  out of the truck, so they left in the direction of
         16  Bratunac.  And there was an armed Serb soldier coming
         17  towards me, and he stopped me and he told me, "You will
         18  now see what's going to happen in Bratunac."  And I
         19  told him, "Just kill me.  I don't care about my life.
         20  Just leave my children alone."
         21            I managed to run away, and I went up to the
         22  barbed wire, which was very high.  I couldn't jump over
         23  it, but there was a hole underneath, and I crawled
         24  through that hole and I managed to reach the UN base.
         25       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, let me ask you:  You mentioned

          1  Bratunac.  Had something happened in Bratunac in 1992
          2  or 1993 that you're aware of?
          3       A.   Again, people were separated in Bratunac.  It
          4  was at the very beginning of the war.  This took place
          5  on the Bratunac playground.  Lots of people had been
          6  taken away on that occasion, and we haven't heard of
          7  them ever since, and they must have been killed.
          8       Q.   Now, after you crawled under the fence that
          9  you just described, what happened, Mrs. Omanovic?
         10       A.   I ran to the UN base and I called the
         11  interpreters.  I told them that people should be helped
         12  and I told them that people were being taken off the
         13  buses on the way to Bratunac.  And I told them that
         14  people were being separated elsewhere, not only in
         15  Potocari, and something should be done to help them.
         16            Then a brother of mine -- my brother came and
         17  I asked him to try to help me kill myself.  I was
         18  afraid of falling into the hands of Serbian soldiers,
         19  because there were terrible stories that were being
         20  told about them.  And at that moment I could only think
         21  of those rumours, those stories.  There were stories
         22  about rapes, slaughters, and I was afraid that my
         23  daughter would be raped in front of my own eyes, that
         24  my grandchild would be slaughtered, and I couldn't
         25  simply face it.  And this man, he had already prepared

          1  a rope --
          2            THE INTERPRETER:  I'm sorry, but it's very
          3  difficult to follow the witness.  The interpreter
          4  apologises.
          5            MR. HARMON:
          6       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, would you just slow down a
          7  bit?  I've received a word from the interpretation
          8  booth that they're having difficulty because of the
          9  pace of your testimony.  Could you slow down a bit.
         10       A.   Very well.  And my brother showed me the
         11  noose he had prepared for himself, and I pulled it out
         12  of his hand and I climbed to the upper floor of the UN
         13  base.  There were lots of people, and children were
         14  standing at the window and watching those trucks moving
         15  away.  And I asked them to go away from the window,
         16  because it was -- I had heard that a body of a person
         17  who hangs himself is very ugly.
         18            So that is what I tried to do.  I climbed a
         19  chair and I saw two Serb soldiers with UN soldiers
         20  coming up, and I felt -- I must have been so terrified
         21  that I thought they were looking for me.  So I climbed
         22  up on that rack which was there for drying and I laid
         23  there, and they walked up and down, were looking what
         24  was going on.  They went around, they went back.  And
         25  as they were climbing down the stairs I sat on that

          1  drying rack, on top of that drying rack, and I
          2  tightened the noose which I had already prepared, I put
          3  it around my neck, and I jumped down.  And I woke up in
          4  the hospital and I really don't know what happened
          5  next.
          6       Q.   Mr. Omanovic, thank you very much.
          7            MR. HARMON:  I've concluded my direct
          8  examination, Your Honours.  Thank you.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         10  Mr. Harmon.  Before we move on to cross-examination,
         11  perhaps it would be good to make a break, so that now a
         12  20-minute break.
         13                 --- Recess taken at 10.30 a.m.
         14                 --- On resuming at 10.55 a.m.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         16  Mrs. Omanovic, you will now be answering questions
         17  which the Defence counsel for General Krstic, that is,
         18  Mr. Petrusic or Mr. Visnjic, will ask you.
         19            Mr. Petrusic, you have the floor.
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         21  Your Honours; good morning, my learned friends from the
         22  Prosecution.
         23                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         24       Q.   Good morning, Mrs. Omanovic.  Before I ask
         25  you some questions, I should like to tell you that it
          1  is not our intention to take you back to that period of
          2  July 1995 and all that you went through.  We do not
          3  wish to revive all those memories.  We hope that as an
          4  educated woman and emancipated woman, you will
          5  understand that the principal objective of the defence
          6  is the establishment of the truth and all that happened
          7  in Srebrenica, and that is all we have in mind.  Now I
          8  should like to move on to some specific questions.
          9            Mrs. Omanovic, at the beginning of your
         10  testimony, you said that on the 10th of July, men were
         11  separated from the rest of the Muslim population, next
         12  to the petrol station in Srebrenica.  Could you please
         13  tell us if that separation was spontaneous or did
         14  somebody invite people to split into two groups?
         15       A.   I could say that it was spontaneous.  As they
         16  came out of the town, men and women headed for Potocari
         17  and men towards Kazani, and, yes, it was next to the
         18  petrol station.
         19       Q.   Among the men, were there some wearing
         20  uniforms?
         21       A.   I don't know when I should begin to answer.
         22  If I could know only when to start answering.  If
         23  somebody could tell me.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours,
         25  we seem to have the problem with the language because

          1  we speak the same language.
          2       A.   No, no.  Somebody told me --
          3            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] If I may, at
          4  the end of each of my questions, should I say, "This is
          5  the end of my question," so that the witness knows that
          6  she can begin with her answer?  Could I do that?
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon
          8  perhaps will explain.
          9            Yes, Mr. Petrusic.  Just a moment.
         10            MR. HARMON:  I explained to the witness,
         11  because counsel speaks the same language as the
         12  witness, that she needed to pause so that we didn't
         13  have overlap and create a problem for the interpreters,
         14  and I think that is the source of the problem.  She is
         15  inquiring when she needs to commence her answer.  So
         16  that, I think, is the problem.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Thank
         18  you, Mr. Harmon, very much for this clarification.
         19            Mr. Petrusic, Mrs. Omanovic, as you know,
         20  when we speak the same language, then there is always a
         21  risk of speaking too fast and not making a pause so the
         22  interpreters can keep up, because the interpreters are
         23  always a couple of seconds behind of what was being
         24  said.  So could you just wait a little.
         25            So Mr. Petrusic, if you just make a pause

          1  after you finish your question.
          2            When you hear the end of Mr. Petrusic's
          3  questions, just make a short pause.  I believe you
          4  understand really when the question has ended.  You do
          5  not have to hear, "This is the end of the question."
          6  Just wait for a while after you've heard the question
          7  to give the interpreters time.  Simply remember that
          8  there's always one person between you, which is an
          9  interpreter.
         10            So I believe that -- of course, Mr. Petrusic,
         11  you can also do as you suggested, "This is the end of
         12  my question," but do I not think there is any need for
         13  this.  I'm quite sure that we shall have a very good
         14  communication even without that if you only make this
         15  short pause.
         16            Yes, Mr. Petrusic, move on.
         17            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         18       Q.   So Mrs. Omanovic, would you please answer my
         19  questions.  Among those men, were there any wearing
         20  uniforms?
         21       A.   Yes, there were some uniformed men.  Not very
         22  many, but here and there.  Some of them had weapons.
         23       Q.   They formed a column, didn't they?
         24       A.   Well, no, they didn't form a column.  All I
         25  could see was only the beginning.  Whether they formed

          1  a column further on, I wouldn't know.  But from the
          2  street, men simply separated and they came together in
          3  groups.  There were groups like ours, except they were
          4  groups of men on that other side, but they were not
          5  columns.
          6       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, I should like to move on to
          7  the meeting on the 12th of July, at the Fontana Hotel
          8  in Bratunac around 10.00.
          9            We saw the footage.  Did General Mladic
         10  introduce each one of the participants in the meeting?
         11       A.   Yes, he did.  General Mladic did introduce
         12  all the participants of the meeting.
         13       Q.   As he introduced General Krstic, did he say
         14  anything about him?
         15       A.   I don't remember.  I don't remember him
         16  saying anything.  I was too frightened, and I can't
         17  recall quite a number of details.
         18       Q.   Did General Krstic take an active role in the
         19  meeting?
         20       A.   Again, I don't remember him saying anything.
         21       Q.   And any one of the other participants in the
         22  meeting, did he take part in the discussion?
         23       A.   No, I don't think so.
         24       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, could you tell us:  What were
         25  the conclusions of that meeting?

          1       A.   It is a rule that a meeting reaches some
          2  conclusions and that the record is made or something
          3  like that, but our meeting ended in a rather unusual
          4  way.  Somebody came in and said that people had broken
          5  into the stadium, as if all this crowd had broken in,
          6  so that we stood up, simply.  Nobody was taking
          7  minutes, nobody signed anything, nothing that should be
          8  a normal routine at a meeting, some items on the agenda
          9  or something.  It was all incidental, that somebody
         10  needs to provide trucks, that somebody needs to take
         11  fuel or something, but there was nothing that would
         12  make it look like a proper meeting.
         13       Q.   And would you know if some minutes were made
         14  later on, or a record?  Was it made later on?
         15       A.   I know when a woman -- I don't know what her
         16  name was -- some foreign television crew arrived to
         17  make an interview with me to shoot something, and then
         18  somebody -- his name was Mila.  He was an interpreter.
         19  I believe he was a Slovenian.  He showed me something
         20  which was supposedly the record of that meeting, and it
         21  figured my -- made a name, but it was not my
         22  signature.  So that was the first thing that I saw as a
         23  can kind of a record of that meeting, but I did not see
         24  anyone taking it during the meeting or anyone preparing
         25  it for signature when the meeting ended.  The meeting

          1  ended just out of the blue.
          2       Q.   And after that meeting did you see General
          3  Mladic in Potocari?
          4       A.   I saw him when he arrived with a group of
          5  soldiers.  He walked around the compound and he
          6  distributed some chocolates to the children.  But I
          7  think he's a great actor and he was doing this only
          8  because there were some cameras shooting him.
          9       Q.   Just for a moment, I should like to go back
         10  to the previous night, between the 11th and the 12th of
         11  July.  Was there any gunfire around the compound then?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   And between the 12th and the 13th, during
         14  that night?
         15       A.   No.
         16       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, in your testimony you said
         17  that you heard rumours about rapes.  Was it anything
         18  more than rumours, or did it end there; that is, did
         19  you receive any more reliable, any more trustworthy
         20  information?
         21       A.   I said in my testimony that I did not see a
         22  single murder, I mean with my own eyes.  I did not
         23  witness a rape.  I heard all those sounds and
         24  everything, but I did not see it with my own eyes.  But
         25  in that compound, in that place where we were, the

          1  rumour of any evil deed, of anything that happened,
          2  yes, spread around, but I did not witness any of that.
          3       Q.   On the 13th of July, you and your family were
          4  not allowed to board the buses that were parked there,
          5  were you?
          6       A.   Quite right.  They did not allow us.  And I
          7  think that during this meeting with Mladic I did ask
          8  not to transport us as cattle, because I must again
          9  repeat what I'd heard:  that so many babies suffocated
         10  in that crowd, the first group that was transported to
         11  Bratunac.  And I asked him to treat us properly as
         12  human beings.  And he knew that I had a baby of three
         13  months, and he said, "At some point I'll take you in my
         14  own bus."  But he would not allow it.  I wasn't asking
         15  for myself.  He wouldn't allow my baby to board the
         16  bus, but the truck, and then they stoned the truck and
         17  did all sorts of things that they were not to do.
         18       Q.   And who, then, boarded those parked buses
         19  which were standing next to those trucks?
         20       A.   Well, again, people; again, the crowd -- I
         21  don't know how to explain it to you.  Next to every bus
         22  there were standing men who were selecting.  I don't
         23  know what method they used, because there are always
         24  some selection methods.  Somebody says, "You can
         25  board," or "Just let him through."  Or other people

          1  they wouldn't allow it, because there were very many
          2  men among those buses and were they simply selecting
          3  it.  And they would simply put their shoulder, put
          4  their elbow out, and would simply prevent him from
          5  boarding the bus if they thought that that person
          6  shouldn't board the bus.
          7       Q.   Those men who were making the selection who
          8  would and who would not board the bus, were they in
          9  uniforms?
         10       A.   Some were uniformed and some were in civilian
         11  clothes.
         12       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, perhaps this is asking you to
         13  do too much, in view of the state that you must have
         14  been in at the time, but please allow me to ask you if
         15  perhaps you noticed the patches, the insignia, the
         16  flashes of the military or the police or some other
         17  units there.  Do you have any recollection of that?
         18  Can you tell us something about it?
         19       A.   Believe me that at that moment, whether I
         20  simply didn't want to or whether I didn't dare look at
         21  any man, but I cannot bring back to my mind any single
         22  face.  I merely held my children next to me and I was
         23  trying to board it.  Nobody, except that man who was at
         24  the meeting and who said that my fate was sealed, I did
         25  not recognise anyone.  Was that fear?  Was it

          1  something -- I don't know.  But I wasn't really
          2  looking at any one of them in the face; I was simply
          3  trying to board as soon as possible, to get my children
          4  on board.  No, nobody.  Insignia, no.  I simply didn't
          5  look at those men who were there.  I knew they wouldn't
          6  allow me to board, but who and why, I don't not know.
          7  I simply cannot remember and I cannot bring back to my
          8  mind any of the flashes, any of the insignia, and I
          9  really don't know who that was or what they were.
         10       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, thank you.  I have no further
         11  questions.
         12            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         13  Your Honours.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         15  do you have any additional questions?
         16            MR. HARMON:  I do not, Mr. President.  Thank
         17  you.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         19  very much.
         20            Judge Riad.
         21                 Questioned by the Court:
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Mrs. Omanovic, good morning.
         23  Can you hear me?
         24       A.   Yes.  Good morning, Your Honour.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  I don't want to prolong your
          1  difficult situation of testifying to these very sad
          2  events.  I just would like to understand two more
          3  things.
          4            You mentioned that General Mladic reiterated
          5  that you have either to leave or perish.  Leave what?
          6  What is the area which he meant by "to leave"; to leave
          7  the area of Srebrenica or to leave a bigger area?  In
          8  your opinion, what was this area which he meant?
          9       A.   I think he meant the area of Srebrenica,
         10  because that is the only point not held by Serbs.  We
         11  were encircled as if we were in a camp, because the
         12  whole territory, all the hills around my town were held
         13  by Serbs.  And so if we left, then this whole territory
         14  would be Serb.  Because in the Drina Canyon, we were
         15  from all sides surrounded by Serbs, and only that
         16  enclave, Srebrenica, was the territory which the Serbs
         17  had not captured yet.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  But also you could not go to any
         19  other Serb part of Bosnia?
         20       A.   Nobody.  It was only -- I don't really know
         21  why, but nobody asked us, nobody made any lists, nobody
         22  talked to us to reach some understanding, or anything.
         23  They simply brought the buses.  And they knew, because
         24  such chaos reigned in Srebrenica, so they knew if they
         25  brought those five buses, or any number of vehicles,

          1  that people were simply set off.  Because before that,
          2  they had passed such horrible nights that each one of
          3  us wished to be dead.  The ordinary death would have
          4  been a blessing for us, and we suffered so much.  We
          5  simply wanted to get away, to get away, only not to
          6  stay there.  And we didn't even have any other
          7  possibility.  It was, I think, a mere formality.
          8  Nobody asked us anything.  Those buses were brought
          9  there and people were crowded, and that is how the
         10  transport started.  We had no say in the matter.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Good.  You also mentioned more
         12  than once that -- I can almost repeat what you said:
         13  People would -- anybody could come to the compound and
         14  point out to any person, to any individual, to be taken
         15  away.  What do you mean by, "Anybody could come and
         16  point out"?  You meant soldiers, Bosnian Serb soldiers,
         17  or you meant even individuals, any Serb would come and
         18  choose a prey to take out?
         19       A.   Yes.  They were only Serb soldiers, Bosnian
         20  Serb soldiers.  They were taking away with those
         21  torchlamps pointed at them.  In daytime they would walk
         22  around people, among those crowds, and people were
         23  gathered there on two sides, and they would just walk
         24  among them and take away those men and never came
         25  back.  They would take one man after another one.  They

          1  would talk to him, walk with him, and then they would
          2  be gone.  Then at night they would once again come,
          3  point their torches at those men and just call out
          4  individual men and none of those men came back again.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned that among these
          6  people there were UN -- people with UN uniforms.  Did I
          7  understand you rightly?
          8       A.   Yes, you did.  The second night, the Serb
          9  soldiers dressed -- because they spoke the same
         10  language, Bosnian, and they had UN uniforms, and they
         11  came wearing uniforms as they came to us and moved
         12  around us.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  So it was Serb soldiers wearing
         14  UN uniforms?  I don't hear you.
         15       A.   Yes.  Yes.  They were Serb soldiers wearing
         16  UN uniforms.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         19  Judge Riad.
         20            Judge Wald, do you have any questions?
         21            JUDGE WALD:  Just a few.  When the people
         22  boarded the buses in Potocari, they were in a great
         23  rush to get on the buses and to get out of there, as
         24  you have told us.  Did the people around you know where
         25  they were going?  Did they know what would happen to

          1  them when they reached a certain place, or did they
          2  simply get on the buses just to get out of Potocari?
          3       A.   In order to put an end to this agony, people
          4  were leaving.  They didn't know where they were
          5  leaving, but they just wanted to put an end to that.
          6  They didn't know whether they would survive or die.
          7  They didn't know where they were going.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  You also mentioned that on one
          9  of the nights there were screams around the compound,
         10  but you could hear them but you didn't know what was
         11  actually happening.  Were any of those screams women's
         12  screams?
         13       A.   Yes, there were women's screams as well.
         14  There was a woman giving birth, which was not far from
         15  me.  She was crying.  There was another woman that
         16  simply went crazy on a bus.  She was -- this was
         17  influencing us all.  It affected the atmosphere and
         18  created the atmosphere of terror that night.
         19            JUDGE WALD:  My last question is:  You said
         20  that you feared very much falling into the hands of
         21  Serbian soldiers or having your daughter fall into
         22  their hands, and you referred to things that had
         23  happened on the buses on the way to Bratunac.  How did
         24  you know what happened to any of the buses after they
         25  left Potocari?  Where did that information come from

          1  that caused you fear that if you got on the buses some
          2  bad things might happen and made you go to the UN
          3  authorities and complain?
          4       A.   I don't know where those stories had come
          5  from, who was the origin of those rumours.  All I know
          6  is that throughout that period which we spent in
          7  Srebrenica, terrible stories about genocide, for
          8  example, were being told, genocide perpetrated by
          9  Serbian soldiers on the civilian population, women,
         10  children.  We were afraid of every single soldier.  We
         11  saw monsters in all of them, monsters who were capable
         12  of most inhumane things.
         13            This is why I was so fearful to end up in
         14  their hands.  Because death is nothing, but the way one
         15  dies is what counts, because we had been hearing table
         16  stories about Serbian soldiers torturing people,
         17  mutilating people, raping women, and I simply couldn't
         18  allow that to happen to my children, because I was, in
         19  a way, guilty for leaving them in Srebrenica, and I
         20  would have been responsible for their fate.  I was the
         21  one who actually made that decision in Srebrenica.
         22  They were much too young to leave on their own.  This
         23  is why I felt so terrible, this is why I jumped out.  I
         24  just tried to see whether any help was possible.
         25            It's very difficult for me to be more

          1  precise.  This is what we had heard, what we had been
          2  hearing all that time.
          3            Sometimes throughout that period we would
          4  either listen to the radio or saw a TV broadcast, but
          5  nothing that we saw on TV or heard on the radio was
          6  very nice.
          7            JUDGE WALD:  But your fears were generated by
          8  these stories of what had happened in other villages
          9  and elsewhere, but you didn't have any specific
         10  information about what had happened to the people on
         11  the bus that had left Potocari; is that right?
         12       A.   They were taking people away.  They were
         13  taking them away from the camp.  We could hear screams
         14  throughout the night.  It was very difficult, because
         15  we felt that something terrible would happen.
         16            During that night we were just sitting there,
         17  and all of a sudden we would hear screams from a man
         18  who was being tortured.  It's a terrible thing to
         19  experience.  Because of such rumours, because of such
         20  stories, we all feared that we would be the next.
         21  Maybe it was only my imagination, I don't know, but if
         22  you keep hearing horrible stories, you cannot be
         23  assured that your life would be spared.
         24            When he said that he would take my children
         25  in a special vehicle, whereas we were actually not

          1  allowed to board the bus at all, and I knew that I
          2  couldn't expect anything good to happen to me in
          3  Bratunac.
          4            JUDGE WALD:  Thank you, Mrs. Omanovic.
          5       A.   You're welcome.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          7  Mrs. Omanovic, I have at least four questions for you.
          8            My first question is the following:  Whilst
          9  you were at the meeting with General Mladic, at one
         10  point he told you that you could choose between
         11  surviving and vanishing, and you said that "vanish"
         12  could, in a way, also include the possibility of
         13  survival somehow.  What I would like to know is whether
         14  this possibility of survival was a conclusion of yours
         15  or was it General Mladic who had actually said that?
         16       A.   Well, he simply said, "You can survive or
         17  vanish."  My conclusion was that if I leave, I would be
         18  saved; and if I stayed, I would die.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well
         20  then.  So the way you understood it was that there was
         21  actually no choice, because if you chose to stay, this
         22  would mean not to survive.  Was that the case?
         23       A.   Yes, exactly.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] My second
         25  question:  There were people who were at the meeting

          1  together with you, and there was someone who told you
          2  at that meeting that your fate had been sealed.  How
          3  did you interpret that particular message?
          4       A.   I thought I would simply disappear.  I
          5  thought that nobody could help me.  I thought I had to
          6  be the one who had to vanish.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you
          8  understood that something had already been prepared or
          9  determined in advance for you?
         10       A.   Yes, exactly, because when he saw that my
         11  fate had been sealed and when we reached the buses,
         12  when we were not allowed to board the buses, when I got
         13  to that truck where I was given this medal, I knew that
         14  something was brewing, something bad.
         15            I had the typical instinct of a mother.  I
         16  wasn't worried about myself.  I felt sorry for my
         17  children.  At that moment, I just jumped out.  They
         18  said I was brave at that moment.  No.  No, I wasn't.  I
         19  was just acting on the instinct of a mother who had to
         20  protect her children.
         21            That is why I jumped off the truck.  I ran to
         22  that soldier who pointed his gun towards me and said to
         23  him, "Kill me, just leave my children alone.  They're
         24  innocent.  They're underage.  My son is there on the
         25  truck."  And this soldier was also frightened of me

          1  although he had a gun.  But my instinct as a mother was
          2  much stronger, and I had enough force to run away.  The
          3  UN base was not very close by.  My children were
          4  leaving to an unknown destination.  I didn't know what
          5  was going to happen to them, but I had enough force to
          6  fight because of this maternal instinct in me.  I
          7  thought that there must be something that can be done
          8  to help my children who had been taken away.  They were
          9  both under-aged.  That's why I jumped out of that
         10  truck.  I wasn't brave, I was just trying to use the
         11  little force that was left in me in order to save my
         12  children.
         13            I apologise for crying.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Please do
         15  calm down.  We have profound respect for you and what
         16  you have suffered, and you are indeed a brave woman,
         17  because you needed a lot of force, a lot of strength to
         18  experience what you have been through.  We also know
         19  you are a brave woman because you have come here to
         20  testify.
         21            May I continue, Mrs. Omanovic?
         22       A.   Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you very much.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         24  Mrs. Omanovic, you described, in very negative terms,
         25  Serbian soldiers.  I would like to know:  What was

          1  their image before the war?  Did they have this
          2  negative image before or was it only the result of the
          3  war?
          4       A.   Let me just have a sip of water and I will
          5  tell you.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Please
          7  relax, Mrs. Omanovic.
          8       A.   Prior to the war, Serbian soldiers were not
          9  behaving that way, or maybe they were simply
         10  pretending.  We lived together, we socialised with each
         11  other, we lived next to each other, we went to school
         12  together, we worked together, and we respected mutually
         13  our traditions, and it was very difficult to understand
         14  where all that hatred had come from on the part of the
         15  people who had lived together with us.
         16            When I think back, I know that I worked
         17  together with four Serbs and two Muslims when I was
         18  working as the chief accountant at that company.  We
         19  lived together very well.  We had a good life.  We
         20  would visit each other.  I would bake typical Muslim
         21  cakes for my Serbian friends for their family reunions
         22  and celebrations, and it was so strange to see such a
         23  sudden change.  We couldn't realise where all that
         24  hatred had come from.
         25            Today, after all that has happened, I'm

          1  simply unable to understand the atrocities, how anyone
          2  could commit such atrocities.
          3            They knew we had problems because of the
          4  concentration of iodine in the factory and there was
          5  some very typical diseases for that area, but we never
          6  received any necessary medicine from them during that
          7  time.  It was also a kind of -- it was a method to
          8  intimidate us.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] This is my
         10  fourth question, Mrs. Omanovic:  We saw several
         11  videotapes, and we saw the confusion which reigned in
         12  and around the base.  You lived through all that, and I
         13  would like to know whether amidst that turmoil -- you
         14  were an educated person -- did you manage to notice,
         15  were you able to observe any signs of organisation?
         16  Could you tell that things had been prepared in advance
         17  in any way?
         18       A.   I did have a feeling, because of what was
         19  going on, that we had been brought to a stage where
         20  everything had been prepared in advance, that there was
         21  a team of people working in an organised manner.  And,
         22  for example, at that meeting, things happened in such a
         23  way that I had the impression that everything was
         24  organised, and then the meeting stopped abruptly, and
         25  that was very strange.  So, well, this is the

          1  impression that I had at the time.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Who do you
          3  think was the chief organiser of all that?
          4       A.   Well, it was General Mladic.  He was a kind
          5  of director there and he was also acting his role in
          6  that scene.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I do have a
          8  fifth question, Mrs. Omanovic.  You know who General
          9  Krstic is, don't you?
         10       A.   I heard a lot about General Krstic.  I met
         11  him for the first time in Bratunac during the
         12  negotiations.  However, I had never seen him before
         13  that meeting, nor did I see him after the meeting.  I
         14  haven't seen him, actually, until I've come here.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You say
         16  that you met him for the first time at the meeting in
         17  Bratunac.  How did you know that the person in question
         18  was General Krstic?
         19       A.   Well, I believe that introductions were made
         20  at the meeting.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So somebody
         22  introduced you, introduced General Krstic to you.  Do
         23  you remember the exact words that were used during that
         24  introduction?
         25       A.   Well, "This is General Krstic."

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Just like
          2  that?  Did they say anything about his function?
          3       A.   I do not remember, Your Honour.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Do you
          5  remember where in the room, where the meeting was being
          6  held, did General Krstic sit?
          7       A.   I believe he was sitting on General Mladic's
          8  left-hand side.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         10  thank you.  Mrs. Omanovic, thank you very much for your
         11  answers to both my questions and questions put to you
         12  by my colleagues.  Mrs. Omanovic, you have completed
         13  your testimony here before the International Criminal
         14  Tribunal, and I should like to express our gratitude
         15  for your coming here.  We do think you were a very
         16  brave person, despite what you may think of yourself.
         17  We can also tell that you're a tolerant person,
         18  reasonable person, and I hope that you yourself can
         19  also make a personal contribution so that your country
         20  may again find peace and safety.  Once again, thank you
         21  very much, Mrs. Omanovic, for coming to The Hague.
         22            THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Your Honours.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         24  I think we should perhaps start with your next witness.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, may I move into

          1  evidence exhibits that were introduced through this
          2  witness:  specifically, Prosecutor's Exhibit 49, which
          3  is the film of the meeting on the 12th of July;
          4  Prosecutor's Exhibit 49A, B, and C, which are
          5  transcripts of the meeting; Prosecutor's Exhibit 50,
          6  which is a video, the first video which I played
          7  showing the people, the refugees; Prosecutor's 51,
          8  which is a 48-second video showing crowd scenes;
          9  Prosecutor's 52, which is a still photograph taken from
         10  the video; and Prosecutor's 53, likewise a still
         11  photograph taken from Prosecutor's Exhibit 49.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         13  Mr. Petrusic, any objections?
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No, Your
         15  Honour.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         17  then.  The exhibits have been admitted into evidence.
         18            Mr. Harmon, perhaps we can begin the
         19  testimony of your next witness.
         20            MR. HARMON:  I'm informed by my colleague,
         21  Mr. Cayley, that this witness will require a closed
         22  session, and we're prepared to proceed with the next
         23  witness once the courtroom is closed.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I'm
         25  addressing the public now.  We are now going to move
          1  into closed session for our following witness.
          2  However, before we do so, I have to ask Mr. Petrusic
          3  whether he has any objections against protective
          4  measures.
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] We have
          6  reached an agreement, Your Honour, and we do not have
          7  any objections to protective measures.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          9  very much, Mr. Petrusic.
         10            Let us prepare the courtroom for the closed
         11  session, during which we will hear our following
         12  witness.
