          2                 [Open session]
          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 9.55 a.m.
          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning, the
          8  technical booth, the interpreters, the legal officers,
          9  the court reporters; good morning to the Prosecution;
         10  good morning to the Defence; good morning to General
         11  Krstic; good morning, Witness.  We have a witness in
         12  the courtroom already.
         13            Before beginning I should like to inform you
         14  that Judge Fouad Riad is unable to be with us today and
         15  we are therefore going to sit in accordance with
         16  Article 15 bis, because there are urgent reasons of
         17  ill-health that are keeping him away and we are going
         18  to continue the hearings.
         19            Witness, can you hear me?
         20            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you're
         22  going to read the solemn declaration which the usher is
         23  going to hand to you, please.
         24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
         25  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,

          1  and nothing but the truth.
          2                 WITNESS:  WITNESS T
          3                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Please be
          5  seated, madam.  Are you feeling comfortable?  You are
          6  now going to answer questions put to you by Mr. Cayley,
          7  whom you see to your right.
          8            Mr. Cayley, the witness is yours.  Good
          9  morning.
         10            MR. CAYLEY:  Good morning, Mr. President,
         11  Judge Wald, my learned friends for the Defence.
         12                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:
         13       Q.   Witness, I'm going to call you "Witness T"
         14  during your evidence in order to protect your
         15  identity.  But first of all could you please look at
         16  the name written on the piece of paper.  Don't read it
         17  out, just confirm that that is your name.
         18       A.   It is.
         19       Q.   Witness, please relax as best you can.  I
         20  know it's not easy speaking about these events, and I
         21  only have a few questions for you, as you know.  Just a
         22  few preliminary questions.
         23            You're of Bosnian nationality; is that
         24  correct?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   You are a Muslim by faith.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  I didn't -- oh, there is a
          4  response on the transcript.
          5       Q.   In July of 1995 I think you were living in a
          6  village that was inside the Srebrenica enclave; is that
          7  correct?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   After the enclave fell in July of 1995, I
         10  think you went to the woods with your children and with
         11  other women from the village; is that right?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Now, I know you spent a number of nights in
         14  the woods and I'm not going to ask you about that, but
         15  I think I'm right in saying that you arrived in
         16  Potocari on the 11th of July of 1995; is that right?
         17       A.   It is.
         18       Q.   When you arrived in Potocari, can you tell
         19  the Judges where you went.
         20       A.   I was in front of a factory.  We got there
         21  and we spent the night there.  On the 11th, in the
         22  evening, UNPROFOR was around us and whoever entered,
         23  they said they couldn't get out again, so it was safer
         24  to stay there, they said.
         25            During the night and the next night in the

          1  evening, the 12th in the evening, the Serbs came and in
          2  the evening they took people away and killed them,
          3  slaughtered, and did all kinds of things.
          4       Q.   If you can just wait there for one moment.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/7.  Mr. Usher, I have a copy.
          7  You can borrow mine.  If you could put it in front of
          8  the witness and then put it on the ELMO.
          9            THE USHER:  Okay.
         10            MR. CAYLEY:
         11       Q.   Witness, do you recognise the building in
         12  this photograph?
         13       A.   I do.
         14       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what this building
         15  is?
         16       A.   This one here.
         17       Q.   Is this the building where you stayed outside
         18  when you arrived in Potocari?
         19       A.   It is.
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  Could it be placed on the ELMO,
         21  please.  Would you move it down, please, and if the
         22  lens could be withdrawn so that we can see the whole
         23  photograph.  That's fine.
         24            Let the record show that the witness has
         25  identified Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/7 as the factory

          1  building where she and her children remained outside
          2  after she arrived in Potocari.
          3            Mr. Usher, that's fine.  You can leave that
          4  on the ELMO.
          5       Q.   Now, Witness, I want you to cast your mind
          6  back to the night of the 12th of July when you and your
          7  children were outside this factory building.  I think
          8  there was a woman nearby to you with three sons.
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   I want you to tell the Judges what you saw
         11  take place on that night.
         12       A.   First, two elderly -- there were two older
         13  boys, they were resisting, and then in the end they
         14  took all three of them away.
         15       Q.   Now, you say that there were two older boys,
         16  they were resisting, and in the end they took all three
         17  away.  Who took the three boys away; do you recall?
         18       A.   Serbs.
         19       Q.   How were these Serbs dressed?
         20       A.   They had on military uniforms.
         21       Q.   If you want to take a break at any time, just
         22  indicate to the President, if you want to just take a
         23  five-minute break, and I'm sure we can do that.  Do you
         24  want to continue?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   How old were these three boys, if you can
          2  remember?
          3       A.   I think the oldest was between 18 and 20.
          4  The next one, between 10 and 15.  Judging by their
          5  height, that is my judgement.  And the young one was
          6  between five and seven.
          7       Q.   Where did these Serbs in military uniform
          8  take these three boys?
          9       A.   Behind the factory, around that second corner
         10  there [indicates], and he killed them there.
         11       Q.   Did you see them being killed behind the
         12  factory building that's on the screen at the moment?
         13       A.   I didn't see them being killed, but I saw
         14  them later.  I saw them dead.  I didn't see them when
         15  they were actually being killed.
         16       Q.   What time had passed between the Serb
         17  soldiers taking them away and you seeing them behind
         18  the building; how much time passed?
         19       A.   About an hour, I think.  She fainted, and she
         20  was looking for her sons.  We went round to see them,
         21  and then she fainted.
         22       Q.   Who fainted?
         23       A.   Their mother.
         24       Q.   Could you describe -- I know this is very
         25  difficult, and we'll move through it as quickly as we

          1  can.  Can you describe to the Judges, when you saw the
          2  three bodies behind the factory, what you saw?
          3       A.   All three were one next to another.  They
          4  were covered up to their waists, and all three had
          5  their throats slit.
          6       Q.   After you had seen these three bodies, what
          7  did you do next?
          8       A.   What did I do?  Nothing.  First, when they
          9  took those three children, she fainted.  When she came
         10  to, she wanted to know where they were.  She first
         11  asked about the youngest one.  Then we told her that
         12  they had taken all three.  We went to look.  Then she
         13  fainted again.  We dragged her back to where she was
         14  before, and that's how it was.  When again she came to,
         15  we gave her some pills to take, and that's how it was.
         16            Later, they came again.  They took another
         17  two, but they were older people.  I don't know exactly
         18  how old they were.  They weren't too old or too young,
         19  maybe about 30 or 35.  They took them too, and they
         20  slaughtered the two of them too right there.
         21       Q.   Witness, if you could just wait a moment.
         22  You said they came again and took two others.  Were
         23  these two others another two Muslim men?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   And who took them away?

          1       A.   The same two.  After having killed the three
          2  children, the same two came to take them away.  They
          3  took two away, and one of them never returned.
          4       Q.   And "the same two," you're referring to the
          5  two Serb soldiers who had originally come to take the
          6  children away?
          7       A.   Yes.  They came back for these two older men,
          8  as I said.
          9       Q.   After those older men had been taken away,
         10  did you see them again?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you saw?
         13       A.   They were only on the other side.  They were
         14  also killed, and both of them had also had their
         15  throats slit in the same way as the three children,
         16  only they were turned around in the opposite direction.
         17       Q.   Whereabouts did you see those two other
         18  bodies?
         19       A.   Again, behind this factory where these three
         20  were, these three children, and then next to them were
         21  these two men.
         22       Q.   Do you recall when you saw those other two
         23  bodies?
         24       A.   I don't know.  I think it was about two hours
         25  later, after we had seen these three, because we had to

          1  carry the woman back.  They took these other two while
          2  the woman was unconscious.  When the woman came to,
          3  then there were two other women whom I saw for the
          4  first time, and they went to see, and they saw the same
          5  thing and a lot of blood.
          6       Q.   Now, I think on the 13th of July, I'm correct
          7  in saying that you and your children left Potocari by
          8  bus, and you were taken eventually to the free
          9  territory in Tuzla; is that right?
         10       A.   Yes.  When I had seen all that, I picked up
         11  my children and headed to the buses.  And about 10 past
         12  2.00, I think -- this was the second set of buses, and
         13  we got on and headed towards Kladanj.
         14            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no further
         15  questions for the witness, and I can now offer her for
         16  cross-examination.  Thank you.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         18  very much, Mr. Cayley.
         19            Mr. Petrusic, you have the witness for
         20  cross-examination, if you wish.
         21            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         22  Your Honours, my learned friends of the Prosecution.
         23                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         24       Q.   Good morning, madam.  I shall really try to
         25  be very brief.
          1            Madam, I wouldn't like to go through the
          2  statement that you gave to the Prosecution in August
          3  1995, but I would have a question for you, and that
          4  is:  Did you see, in Potocari, the separation of men
          5  from women?
          6       A.   Yes, I did.
          7       Q.   On that occasion when this separation was
          8  carried out, did you notice any police dogs?
          9       A.   Yes, I did.
         10       Q.   Madam T, after these events which you have
         11  described to Mr. Cayley, did you see members of
         12  UNPROFOR?
         13       A.   I don't know.  I know I saw some people; I
         14  think they were UNPROFOR.  They may have been Serbs
         15  dressed in their clothing.  But I did see blue uniforms
         16  on them.
         17       Q.   This group that you were in and which was
         18  aware of these events, or perhaps you yourself, did you
         19  inform UNPROFOR members of what you had seen?
         20       A.   We did say these things but they said it
         21  wasn't true.  But everything was visible during the
         22  night of the 12th.  There were so many atrocities.
         23       Q.   Thank you, madam.  During this second arrival
         24  of the two soldiers, are you sure that they took away
         25  two men?

          1       A.   Yes, I saw them.
          2       Q.   Madam, in your statement to the Prosecution
          3  you said you saw a couple, a husband and wife.
          4       A.   No, those were two men.  But later they
          5  separated the husband from a wife, because they had two
          6  children.  UNPROFOR said that nobody else could come
          7  and they took him away, and there was some corn down
          8  there and they took them down there.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         10  I would, after all, like to show the witness her
         11  statement, and I would end my cross-examination with
         12  that.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, if I could assist
         14  my learned friend.  I think it might be an idea in the
         15  case of this witness to actually highlight, if you
         16  haven't done so already, if you could put a highlighter
         17  across the section so that she can go straight to it.
         18  Thank you.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         20  Mr. Petrusic, that is a good suggestion, but I think it
         21  is a method that you have already adopted.
         22            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
         23  Honour, we have already done that for the convenience
         24  of the Chamber, and of course the witness.  So could
         25  the usher please give the witness her previous

          1  statement, the B/C/S version, please.
          2       Q.   Madam T, is that your statement?
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          4  Mr. Petrusic, perhaps we need to wait for the number of
          5  the exhibit so that we can identify it.
          6            Madam Registrar, can you give us a number for
          7  this exhibit?
          8            THE REGISTRAR:  Just one second, please.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] If I may be of
         10  assistance, it is D20, Exhibit D20.
         11            THE REGISTRAR:  D20, yes.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So it is
         13  D20.  Please continue, Mr. Petrusic.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         15       Q.   Madam T, is that your statement?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   On page 3 of that statement, it is
         18  highlighted with a marker, you said, "Later that
         19  evening the same three soldiers returned who had taken
         20  these three boys away.  They took away a man and a
         21  woman."
         22       A.   No, they took away two men.
         23            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         24  that ends my cross-examination.
         25            Madam T, thank you.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          2  very much, Mr. Petrusic.
          3            Mr. Cayley, do you have any additional
          4  re-examination?
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  No, Mr. President, I don't have
          6  any further questions for the witness.  Thank you.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          8  very much, Mr. Cayley.
          9            Judge Wald, have you any questions?
         10            JUDGE WALD:  Just two.
         11                 Questioned by the Court:
         12            JUDGE WALD:  Madam T, your children were with
         13  you in Potocari at the time that your neighbour's
         14  children were taken away by the Serb soldiers; is that
         15  right?  You had your children with you around the
         16  factory.
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  Can you just tell us, were your
         19  children boys or girls, and about what ages were they,
         20  your own children?
         21       A.   One was born in 1992, the other in 1994.
         22            JUDGE WALD:  So they were very young at the
         23  time.
         24       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         25            JUDGE WALD:  Was there any reason that you

          1  could tell why they took your neighbour's children away
          2  but they didn't approach your children?
          3       A.   She wasn't my neighbour.  I didn't even know
          4  that woman; I saw her for the first time there.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  But the woman who was close by
          6  that you saw, you couldn't tell why they took her
          7  children but they left your children alone.
          8       A.   I don't know.  I had two little girls, and
          9  those were boys.  Maybe that was the reason.
         10            JUDGE WALD:  I see.  My only other question
         11  is:  You told us about the sad story of seeing the
         12  boys' bodies and then later on at least one of the --
         13  if I remember correctly, did you see the bodies of the
         14  two men that were taken out later?  Is that right?  Did
         15  you see their bodies too, of the men that were taken
         16  out later than the three boys?
         17       A.   Yes, I did.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.
         19       A.   I saw them later.
         20            JUDGE WALD:  My only question is:  Were those
         21  the only bodies you saw that night, the three boys and
         22  the two men, or were there other bodies around in the
         23  area?
         24       A.   There were but I didn't dare look.  I went to
         25  the buses in the morning and I don't know what happened

          1  afterwards.  There were all sorts of things.
          2            JUDGE WALD:  All right.  Thank you very
          3  much.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          5  very much, Judge Wald.
          6            Witness T, I have only one question.  The
          7  Prosecutor has asked questions, the Defence has asked
          8  questions, and my colleague Judge Wald.  Is there
          9  anything else that you would like to say and that
         10  hasn't been asked of you?  You may say it now.
         11       A.   I have nothing to say.  Who was there could
         12  have seen it all.  I don't know.  Only when I reached
         13  Tuzla, I found my mother, and she told me that --
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Take your
         15  time, Witness T.  We have every understanding for your
         16  suffering.
         17       A.   My mother told me --
         18            THE INTERPRETER:  I'm sorry, we didn't hear
         19  that.  The interpreter apologises.  We think the
         20  witness said that her father had been killed.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Madam, do
         22  you wish to continue or is that all you wanted to say?
         23  We feel very much for you, as I have already said.
         24       A.   I would like to finish there.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Take your

          1  time, please, Witness T.  What did your mother tell
          2  you?  You told us that you wanted to end there with
          3  what your mother told you.
          4       A.   That they had killed my father at Potocari a
          5  day later.  That's what my mother said.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So,
          7  Witness, we do not wish to make you suffer any
          8  further.  I think that you were very brave to come here
          9  and to tell us everything that you have told us, and
         10  therefore that ends your testimony here.
         11            We wish you a safe journey to your place of
         12  residence and that you will be able to recover, because
         13  you have children who need you.
         14            Please don't move, because of protective
         15  measures, so that we are going to have a break, a
         16  20-minute break, after which the hearing will be
         17  resumed.
         18            So thank you very much, Witness T, for
         19  coming.
         20                 [The witness withdrew]
         21                 --- Break taken at 10.30 a.m.
         22                 --- On resuming at 10.55 a.m.
         23                 [The witness entered court]
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         25  Mr. Harmon.
          1            MR. HARMON:  Good morning, Mr. President.
          2  Good morning, Judge Wald.  Good morning, colleagues.
          3            Your Honours, Mr. Ruez, who has testified
          4  previously in this session, in this trial, will be
          5  testifying essentially about two areas.
          6            First, I intend to ask him a number of
          7  questions to connect exhibits that have been introduced
          8  previously by witnesses, to connect them to names and
          9  to locations.  But the principal part of Mr. Ruez'
         10  testimony will be to develop for the Trial Chamber the
         11  evidence that relates to the extensive efforts by the
         12  VRS to remove bodies from primary grave sites and
         13  conceal them in secondary grave sites.
         14            So let me then, with that introduction to
         15  Your Honours -- again, good morning, Mr. Ruez.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         17  excuse me for interrupting you.  I must remind the
         18  witness that he's under oath, or there may be some
         19  doubt as to whether it is necessary to take the solemn
         20  declaration or not.  But to avoid all doubt, Mr. Usher,
         21  perhaps it is simpler for Mr. Ruez to take the oath
         22  once again.
         23            THE WITNESS:  My name is Jean-Rene Ruez.  I
         24  solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the whole
         25  truth, and nothing but the truth.

          1            Due to the origin of the material that we are
          2  going to exhibit today, I will testify in the English
          3  language.
          4                 WITNESS:  JEAN-RENE RUEZ
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          6  very much, Mr. Ruez.  Now things are quite clear as
          7  regards the solemn declaration, and you're now going to
          8  answer questions put to you by Mr. Harmon.
          9                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
         10       Q.   Even though you have testified previously in
         11  this proceeding, there are people in the gallery who
         12  don't know who you are and what you do.  So could you
         13  briefly identify what you do and how long you've been
         14  employed by the Office of the Prosecutor?
         15       A.   My name is Jean-Rene Ruez.  I am the
         16  investigation team leader for the Srebrenica
         17  investigation.  I joined the Tribunal in April 1995,
         18  and I am concerned with the Srebrenica case since 20th
         19  July 1995.
         20       Q.   Thank you very much.  Let me begin by showing
         21  you Prosecutor's Exhibit 28, and I'm going to ask you
         22  to identify a number of individuals in Prosecutor's
         23  Exhibit 28.
         24            Let me begin, first of all, by showing you
         25  Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/7.  Now, that's been placed on

          1  the ELMO.  Mr. Ruez, have you met this individual?
          2       A.   Yes, I did.
          3       Q.   Can you identify him for the Judges, please?
          4       A.   His name is Colonel Cedo Blagojevic.
          5       Q.   And in July of 1995, what was his position in
          6  the Drina Corps?
          7       A.   Colonel Blagojevic was the commander of the
          8  1st Light Infantry Brigade.
          9       Q.   Now let me show you the next Prosecutor's
         10  exhibit, which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 28/9.
         11            Returning briefly to the previous exhibit,
         12  Mr. Ruez, you testified that Mr. Blagojevic was a
         13  colonel in the 1st Light Infantry Brigade.  Was that in
         14  the Bratunac Brigade?
         15       A.   Bratunac Brigade commander.
         16       Q.   Thank you.  Now let's go to the next exhibit,
         17  please, the one that's on the ELMO.  Have you met this
         18  individual?
         19       A.   Yes, I did.
         20       Q.   Who is he?
         21       A.   He is -- he was at the time a major.  His
         22  name is Dragan Obrenovic.  He was the Chief of Staff of
         23  the 1st Zvornik Brigade.  He's currently the commander
         24  of the Zvornik Brigade.
         25       Q.   That was on the 11th of July he held that

          1  position?
          2       A.   On 11 of July, 1995, he was the deputy
          3  commander of the Zvornik Brigade.
          4       Q.   Now can we turn to 28/11.  Now, this
          5  individual, Mr. Ruez, have you met this individual?
          6       A.   Yes, I did.
          7       Q.   What is his name?
          8       A.   His name is Pavle Golic.  He was a Major in
          9  July 1995.  He was a member of the Intelligence Section
         10  at the Drina Corps headquarters.
         11       Q.   Thank you.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Now, let's turn, Mr. Usher, to
         13  28/18, please.
         14       Q.   Mr. Ruez, have you met this individual?
         15       A.   Yes, I did.
         16       Q.   What is his name?
         17       A.   His name is Svetozar Andric.  He was a
         18  Lieutenant Colonel at the time of the events in July
         19  1995.  He was the commander of the 1st Bihac
         20  Sekovici -- he was the brigade commander of the
         21  Sekovici Brigade.
         22            MR. HARMON:  All right.  Mr. Usher, for the
         23  time being I'm finished with the exhibits in
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibit 28.
         25       Q.   I'd like to show you two new exhibits that

          1  the Prosecutor will be introducing.
          2            MR. HARMON:  If I can have given to the usher
          3  and if they can be placed on the ELMO Prosecutor's
          4  Exhibit 185 and 186.  Now, could you place Prosecutor's
          5  Exhibit 185 on the ELMO, please, and if we could have
          6  that properly shown that would be fine.  Thank you very
          7  much.
          8            Now, this, Your Honours, is a still image
          9  taken from a film that has been previously introduced
         10  into evidence.
         11       Q.   Mr. Ruez, who is the man in the foreground in
         12  this particular picture?
         13       A.   This man is identified as being Ljubo,
         14  probably Ljubisa, family name Borovcanin.  He is the
         15  deputy commander of the special police force based in
         16  Janja in July 1995.
         17       Q.   On the far right you can see an image of a
         18  man, at least half of a man's face.  Is that Colonel
         19  Kingori from the Kenyan forces?
         20       A.   Yes.  He was a Major at the time of the
         21  events and he was present in Potocari, indeed.
         22       Q.   Let me show you another still image that has
         23  been taken from another film that has been introduced
         24  previously, Prosecutor's Exhibit 186.  Can you identify
         25  the man standing to the right of the man in the blue

          1  helmet?
          2       A.   The man standing on the right is, again,
          3  Ljubo Borovcanin.
          4       Q.   What was his position on the 11th of July,
          5  1995, if you know?
          6       A.   He was the deputy commander of the special
          7  police based in Janja.
          8            MR. HARMON:  I have two new exhibits I'd like
          9  displayed on the ELMO; one is Prosecutor's Exhibit --
         10  I'm sorry, they are old exhibits -- Prosecutor's
         11  Exhibits 71 and 72.
         12            For reference for Your Honours, this was an
         13  individual who was identified during the testimony of
         14  Lieutenant van Duijn.
         15       Q.   Mr. Ruez, let me put Prosecutor's Exhibit 71,
         16  first of all, on the ELMO.  Referring to the man on the
         17  left-hand side of this image, can you identify him,
         18  please.
         19       A.   Yes.  The man on the left is Mendeljejev
         20  Dzuric.  He is a company commander from the special
         21  police force, based in Janja.
         22       Q.   Do you know who his superior was?
         23       A.   His superior was Ljubo Borovcanin, who was
         24  the deputy commander of that same special police force
         25  in Janja.

          1            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if you could place
          2  the next exhibit on the ELMO, please, Prosecutor's
          3  Exhibit 72.
          4       Q.   Is that the same individual that you
          5  previously identified in Prosecutor's 71?
          6       A.   Yes.  This is again Mendeljejev Dzuric, whose
          7  rank at the time is unknown to us at this moment.
          8            MR. HARMON:  I've concluded, Mr. Usher, with
          9  those exhibits.
         10       Q.   Now I'd like to show you, Mr. Ruez, three
         11  exhibits that have been previously entered into
         12  evidence, Prosecutor's Exhibits 170, 171, and 172.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Again, for point of reference to
         14  Your Honours, these three exhibits are exhibits that
         15  were introduced through Mr. Erdemovic.  Mr. Erdemovic
         16  identified a location where he and his colleagues went
         17  on the 16th of July.  From Vlasenica they arrived at a
         18  particular location; these are the images of that
         19  particular location.  From that location they were
         20  taken to the Branjevo Military Farm.
         21            There should be three images, 170, 171, and
         22  172.  Why don't we start, Mr. Usher, with Prosecutor's
         23  Exhibit 170.
         24       Q.   Mr. Ruez, are you familiar with this
         25  photograph?

          1       A.   Yes.  This is a photograph which I took on
          2  the 7th of June, 1996.  The buildings which can be seen
          3  on this photograph are the headquarters and the
          4  barracks of the 1st Zvornik Brigade, based in Zvornik.
          5       Q.   Was the Zvornik Brigade located at those
          6  structures on the 16th of July, 1995?
          7       A.   Yes, they were located at this location.
          8            MR. HARMON:  Now, Mr. Usher, could you turn
          9  to the next exhibit, Prosecutor's Exhibit 171, and
         10  place that on the ELMO, please.
         11       Q.   Is that an image of the same location but
         12  from a different perspective, Mr. Ruez?
         13       A.   Yes, it is.  This is the entrance gate of the
         14  1st Zvornik Infantry Brigade.  Just at the right of
         15  this picture is the guardhouse of the compound where
         16  the Lieutenant Colonel who met Drazen Erdemovic's team
         17  before going to the Branjevo Farm, he met the team.  He
         18  was coming out from this guardhouse.
         19       Q.   Let's turn to the last image, Prosecutor's
         20  Exhibit 172, and ask you just briefly to identify that
         21  as well.
         22       A.   This is another view of the compound of the
         23  1st Zvornik Brigade, the headquarters of the 1st
         24  Zvornik Brigade.
         25       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Ruez.

          1            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, I've finished with
          2  those exhibits.
          3       Q.   Let me now show you Prosecutor's Exhibit 160,
          4  and I'm going to ask you about the 5th Engineering
          5  Unit.  You should have a copy, Mr. Ruez, of
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 160, and we're going to be
          7  referring to eight exhibits, 160/1 through 160/8.
          8            First of all, let me ask you in respect of
          9  these exhibits, if you would have the map on the ELMO,
         10  could you orient the Judges to the location where the
         11  Drina Corps 5th Engineering Battalion was located.
         12       A.   The location of the 5th Engineering Battalion
         13  is very close to the so-called intersection of
         14  Konjevici, where the red circle is.  It is
         15  approximately 800 metres -- or 600 metres away from the
         16  intersection.  The road on the right is the road
         17  leading towards Bratunac town.
         18       Q.   All right.  Would you take the next exhibit,
         19  please, Mr. Ruez, 160/1, and place that on the ELMO.
         20            I'm going to interrupt you once or twice in
         21  your testimony about this location, but I'd like you
         22  now to use those exhibits, starting with 160/1 through
         23  160/8, and slowly identify the significance of each of
         24  these images, and tell the Judges about each of these
         25  exhibits, please.

          1       A.   This is an aerial photograph taken the 27th
          2  of July, 1995 which shows the large area around the
          3  compound of the 5th Engineering.  The HQ is in the
          4  middle of the photograph.  The surroundings are
          5  buildings, and this is the road going from Bratunac,
          6  which is at the right of the photograph, towards the
          7  intersection of Konjevici, which is just out of the
          8  frame of the picture on the left.
          9       Q.   Indicating the road that starts at the upper
         10  right-hand side of the image, and at approximately a
         11  45-degree angle descends to the left lower portion; is
         12  that correct?
         13       A.   That is correct.  This picture is broken into
         14  three frames, frame A, frame B, and frame C.  I'm going
         15  to show now additional pictures from these frames.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         17  excuse me.  Can I interrupt to ask the technical booth
         18  to give us an overall view of all these photographs,
         19  please, together.  I can't see the top of the
         20  photograph, please.  I should like to see the whole
         21  thing, please.  Put the photograph under the ELMO, and
         22  whenever one puts a document on the ELMO I would like
         23  us to be able to see the whole photograph.  Does the
         24  technical booth understand what I'm saying?  Could you
         25  focus it so that the whole photograph can be seen?

          1            MR. HARMON:  This photograph, Mr. President,
          2  may be too large to -- I think it's an A3-size
          3  photograph.  I'm not sure if this ELMO can show all of
          4  the picture in one shot.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
          6  Thank you.
          7            THE WITNESS:  That way it could work but it's
          8  not very legible.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Please
         10  continue, Mr. Harmon.  We've seen the whole photograph
         11  now and you may continue.  I apologise for interrupting
         12  you.
         13            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         14       Q.   Continue, please, Mr. Ruez.  Why don't you
         15  take the next image and tell Their Honours what 160/2
         16  is.  Did you take this image?
         17       A.   The photograph that I took on the 8th April
         18  1996, this is a photograph of the headquarters of the
         19  5th Engineer Unit.  It is in a former school.  This is
         20  the building in the centre of the photograph, and to
         21  the left of the photograph is the guardhouse.  This
         22  guardhouse is the guardhouse which was identified by
         23  (redacted).  He was taken to that
         24  location.
         25       Q.   All right.  Then continue, please, Mr. Ruez.

          1       A.   The Exhibit 160/3 is a blowup of frame A of
          2  the larger photograph that was the Exhibit 161.
          3       Q.   That has to be better oriented on the ELMO,
          4  Mr. Ruez, and if you can get the whole image in.
          5       A.   This photograph was taken on the 5th of July,
          6  1995.  The markings in white are the original markings
          7  we received on this photograph from the State
          8  Department, the U.S. State Department.  The markings in
          9  yellow are additional markings that we have added on
         10  these photographs according to the knowledge we have of
         11  what can be seen on it.  These vehicles that can be
         12  seen on this photograph, 5 July 1995, are mobile bridge
         13  trucks.
         14            The photograph Exhibit 160/4 shows these
         15  bridge trucks still present there on the 8th April
         16  1996.  It is to enable you to compare ground picture
         17  with aerial imagery in order to have a better view of
         18  what the objects on the photographs represent.  So on
         19  the 5th July 1995, only these mobile bridge trucks were
         20  present in the compound.
         21            The next exhibit, which is 160/5, is a
         22  photograph from the same area taken 27 July 1995, and
         23  one can observe that in addition to the mobile bridge
         24  trucks, a front loader has arrived at the 5th Engineer
         25  Unit.

          1       Q.   When you say "165," you mean "160/5," for the
          2  record?
          3       A.   Correct.
          4            Exhibit 160/6 is a blowup of frame B of the
          5  initial exhibit.  The first photograph is dated July 5,
          6  and one can see on the photograph a tractor and a
          7  trailer.
          8            The Exhibit 160/7 shows the same area on the
          9  27th of July, 1995.  In addition to the trailer and the
         10  tractor still present on the 27th of July, 1995, two
         11  trucks arrived and one additional front loader.
         12            Exhibit 160/8 is a blowup of frame C of the
         13  Exhibit 160/1.  It just shows what was present there on
         14  the 5th of July, 1995.
         15            The next photograph is 160/9.  No equipment
         16  is to be seen on this photograph, no additional
         17  equipment, besides the vehicle which was already
         18  present there on 5 July, but there was some additional
         19  activity in this area due to traces on the ground in
         20  this place.
         21       Q.   When you say "traces," what do you mean?
         22       A.   Vehicle traces.
         23       Q.   Can you point those out to the Judges,
         24  please?
         25       A.   In the centre of the picture, in this area

          1  here [indicates].
          2       Q.   And this particular engineering company, is
          3  this part of the Drina Corps?
          4       A.   It is a Drina Corps unit, absolutely.
          5       Q.   All right.  I've concluded then, Mr. Ruez,
          6  with those particular exhibits about the Engineering
          7  Unit, and if we could now turn to two exhibits that
          8  have been previously entered in through Captain
          9  Egberg's testimony, Prosecutor's Exhibit 87 and 88.
         10            Now, Mr. Ruez, the Dutch soldier who
         11  testified before the Tribunal, Captain Egberg,
         12  testified that he was at this particular location near
         13  Nova Kasaba.
         14            First of all, can you identify in this aerial
         15  image the location of the 65th Protection Regiment?
         16       A.   Yes.  The 65th Protection Regiment was
         17  billeting in a school just on the outskirts of the
         18  hamlet of Nova Kasaba, and the school building, which
         19  is the headquarters of the 65th Protection Regiment in
         20  July 1995, is the building at the bottom of this
         21  picture.  In front of it one can see that three buses
         22  are present 13 July 1995 at 1400 hours, and the path
         23  that exits the compound is the straight line going
         24  toward the road which is on the upper right corner of
         25  the photograph.

          1       Q.   In which direction is Nova Kasaba when you're
          2  on the road in the upper right-hand corner?
          3       A.   Nova Kasaba is in the direction of the road
          4  which exits the photo at the top of the picture.
          5       Q.   Now, can we take a look at the next exhibit,
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 87 -- 88, I'm sorry.
          7            Captain Egberg identified this particular
          8  location.  What is this location?
          9       A.   This is the same school that shall be seen on
         10  the aerial imagery.  It is the compound of the 65th
         11  Protection Regiment.  It's a photograph which was taken
         12  in April 1996.
         13       Q.   Did you take this photograph?
         14       A.   Yes, I did.
         15       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much.
         16            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, I've finished with
         17  that.
         18       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, I'm going to show you a video
         19  film.  It will be brief.  It will be -- it's Exhibit
         20  66, and it is an interview with General Krstic.  I'm
         21  going to ask you some questions after you've had an
         22  opportunity to look at the film.
         23            MR. HARMON:  So if we could dim the lights,
         24  please, and if we could show Prosecutor's Exhibit 66.
         25                 [Videotape played]

          1            MR. HARMON:
          2       Q.   Mr. Ruez, do you know when this film was
          3  shown publicly and where it was shown?
          4       A.   This film was broadcasted on Serbian news,
          5  which is VRS Television, the 13th of July, 1995.
          6       Q.   Now, we've had another witness in this court
          7  look at this film, Colonel Kingori, and Colonel Kingori
          8  concluded that that film was taken in Potocari.  Do you
          9  agree with Colonel Kingori's conclusion?
         10       A.   Yes, I do agree with Major Kingori's
         11  conclusions.
         12       Q.   How many times, approximately, have you been
         13  to Potocari?
         14       A.   I did not count them, but I would say
         15  probably ten times.
         16       Q.   I would like you to use four exhibits, and
         17  show the Court, if you would, why you agree with
         18  Colonel Kingori.
         19            MR. HARMON:  And if we could have
         20  Prosecutor's Exhibits 5/4, 5/19 [realtime transcript
         21  read in error "5/15"], 5/5.  We need them in an
         22  ensemble so we can go through this testimony fairly
         23  quickly.  You can place 5/4 on the ELMO.
         24            We won't start your testimony yet, Mr. Ruez.
         25  We'll wait until we have the exhibits before us.

          1            MR. FOURMY: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
          2  Mr. Prosecutor.  You mentioned "5/19" or did you say
          3  "5/15"?
          4            MR. HARMON:  I said, "5/5, 5/19, 5/4," and
          5  then we have a new exhibit, which is Prosecutor's
          6  Exhibit 184.
          7            MR. FOURMY:  Because the transcript says
          8  "5/15".
          9            MR. HARMON:  And there's a new exhibit, 184.
         10  If that 184 could be distributed, then I'll start the
         11  examination of Mr. Ruez.
         12       Q.   Mr. Ruez, if you would identify, by number,
         13  the exhibits when you testify about them.  I would like
         14  you to take the Chamber through these exhibits, and
         15  tell them why this last interview of General Krstic was
         16  taken in Potocari, why you have reached that
         17  conclusion.
         18       A.   This is a photograph dated 13 July 1995,
         19  taken at 1400 hours.  It shows the situation in
         20  Potocari at that time.
         21       Q.   The exhibit number on that, please?
         22       A.   The exhibit number of this one is 5/4.
         23            In the centre of the picture, one can see in
         24  the circle a crowd of people.  These are people waiting
         25  to board the buses and have to go through the

          1  separation line before doing so.  The separation line
          2  is here [indicates], more or less in the middle of the
          3  photograph.
          4            On the film where General Krstic can be seen
          5  giving his interview, at one point a blue building is
          6  visible in the frame.  The blue building is the
          7  building which is marked on the photograph, with the
          8  arrow, "Blue Building."  The approximate location of
          9  the interview was just before reaching the separation
         10  line, when coming from Bratunac, which is in the
         11  direction of the bottom of this photograph.  The area
         12  where the interview took place is approximately here
         13  [indicates] on this photograph.
         14       Q.   Which is below the oval and to the right of
         15  the word that says "Trucks"?
         16       A.   This is correct.
         17            MR. HARMON:  May we have the next exhibit,
         18  please, 5/19.
         19       A.   This is another view of the area seen from
         20  the west.  In the centre, a bit to the right, is the
         21  so-called blue building [indicates].  Just behind this
         22  blue building is the asphalt road that goes right off
         23  the picture towards Srebrenica town [indicates].  Just
         24  outside the frame of this photograph is the area where
         25  the separation line was [indicates].  And behind the

          1  house which is at the right of the photograph centre
          2  picture is the approximate area where the interview was
          3  taken, due to the angle where the building can be seen,
          4  the blue building.
          5            MR. HARMON:  If we could now turn to
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/5.  Place that on the ELMO,
          7  Mr. Usher.
          8       A.   This is again another view from Potocari, but
          9  seen from the east.  The blue building on this
         10  photograph is now on the top right of the photo
         11  [indicates].  It is not blue on this digital
         12  photograph.  The building is here [indicates].
         13       Q.   You're indicating, for the record, the top
         14  right-hand corner?
         15       A.   Yes, just before the so-called "white house,"
         16  which was the detention centre for the men who were
         17  separated.  On the left of this blue building, one can
         18  see a big group of trees.  Just behind these trees is
         19  the approximate area where the interview took place.
         20  This interview, which was broadcast on 13 July, was in
         21  fact given 12 July, 12 July, probably around noon or
         22  very early -- around noon, probably.
         23       Q.   Could you take a look at the last image,
         24  which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 184, and explain this
         25  image to the Judges.

          1       A.   This is a photograph extracted from a video
          2  that we took in Potocari, the 1st of June, 1996.  If
          3  one would extract from the video of the interview given
          4  by General Krstic a still photograph, one could notice
          5  on that photograph the top right windows of this blue
          6  building, as well as the electrical pylons which are
          7  visible behind the building.  The approximate area
          8  where the interview took place is on this dotted line
          9  where these two arrows are at the right of the
         10  photograph.  Most probably where the arrow is, which is
         11  closest to the right frame of the photograph, was the
         12  interview.
         13       Q.   Let me show you a still image from that
         14  interview.  It's Prosecutor's Exhibit 158.
         15            Mr. Ruez, over General Krstic's left shoulder
         16  there's an image of a man in the background with a full
         17  front face.  Can you identify that man, please.
         18       A.   Yes.  The man that can be seen just behind
         19  General Krstic is Colonel Vujadin Popovic, the Chief of
         20  Security for the Drina Corps.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, thank you very much.
         22       A.   Also, sorry, this is a picture also where one
         23  can see on the top right, you can see a bit of a blue
         24  structure with -- on top of it, it's very shady on this
         25  photograph, but this probably should be one of the two

          1  pylons which were visible on the previous exhibit.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Could you keep that photo on the
          3  ELMO, please, Mr. Usher, and if you could now get
          4  Prosecutor's Exhibits 28/8 and 28/8.1 [Realtime
          5  transcript read in error "128 and 128/8.1"].
          6       A.   On this still there is a truck just behind
          7  General Krstic that hides the view of the building.
          8       Q.   The man you have identified as Popovic in
          9  this particular image, which is Prosecutor's Exhibit
         10  58, I'd like to show you two new exhibits -- two older
         11  exhibits, 28/8 and 28/8.1, and ask you if this is the
         12  same man who appears in Prosecutor's Exhibit 58.  So if
         13  we could place 28/8 on the ELMO.  Is that the same man
         14  who appeared behind General Krstic on the 12th of July
         15  in Potocari?
         16       A.   Yes, this is the same man.  He looks a little
         17  bit younger on this photograph, which was extracted
         18  from news footage dated 1993.
         19            MR. HARMON:  If we could now put the next
         20  image on the ELMO, please.
         21       Q.   This is an image that was taken on the 11th
         22  of July in Srebrenica.  The man on the left-hand side,
         23  in a brown T-shirt, carrying what looks like an
         24  automatic weapon in his left hand, is that the same man
         25  who appeared behind General Krstic in the interview on

          1  the 12th of July in Potocari?
          2       A.   Yes.  The man on the left of the photograph,
          3  in a T-shirt, carrying an AK-47, is again Lieutenant
          4  Colonel Vujadin Popovic.
          5       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Ruez.
          6            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, thank you.
          7       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, we've covered the first part
          8  of your testimony, which is essentially to connect
          9  various pieces of evidence with your knowledge.  I'd
         10  now like to turn to the principal part of your
         11  testimony and the reason why you were called back to
         12  testify.
         13            During the first part of your testimony,
         14  which was extensive, you identified for the Trial
         15  Chamber a number of locations that were relevant to
         16  this particular indictment.  Now we're going to go to
         17  the second chapter, if you will, in respect of many of
         18  those sites; that is, I'm going to ask you to identify
         19  various locations where mass graves are located, where
         20  people who were executed were buried.  I'm going to ask
         21  you to first of all orient the Judges by using
         22  Prosecutor's Exhibit 187 to those locations and then
         23  I'm going to ask you some additional questions after
         24  you orient the Judges and the gallery to these
         25  locations.

          1            If you would, Mr. Ruez, would you identify
          2  the primary mass grave sites and the secondary mass
          3  grave sites.
          4       A.   Yes.  So this map is another map of the crime
          5  scene of the Srebrenica case which has the specificity
          6  to have the relief marked on it.  The relief is fairly
          7  accurate with the exception that Udrc Mountain on this
          8  map doesn't seem as high as it is.  For the rest, it is
          9  an accurate representation of the relief of the area.
         10  The relief is a very important aspect in this
         11  operation.  A normal map would be less clear in terms
         12  of showing how remote some of these places can be.
         13            Going from north to south -- the symbols also
         14  are different from the first map that you got as an
         15  exhibit during my initial testimony -- going from north
         16  to south, the primary mass graves on this map are
         17  marked with a triangle and two bodies in it.  This is
         18  the marking for a primary mass grave.
         19            So in the north we have the Branjevo Farm.
         20  There is another symbol with an excavator in it meaning
         21  that the site is a disturbed site.
         22            In this area north, the second mass grave
         23  that was identified is the mass grave of Kozluk.  That
         24  is marked with a triangle with two bodies in it.  It is
         25  also a site that has been disturbed which is the reason

          1  why the excavator symbol is next to the mass grave.
          2            The site of Petkovci is also marked on this
          3  map as an execution site, mass grave, and disturbed
          4  mass grave, with the symbol of the excavator.
          5            The situation is the same for the Orahovac
          6  mass grave which has also the symbol of disturbance
          7  next to it.
          8            In the area south are also several mass
          9  graves.  The primary mass grave at Glogova, here on the
         10  map, has also been disturbed.  The symbol of the
         11  excavator is next to it.  But in the area of Konjevici,
         12  there is a cluster of several graves.  None of these
         13  graves have been disturbed.  The reason could be the
         14  release of the aerial photographs in August 1995 to the
         15  United Nations and the public.  The other additional
         16  reason could be also the limited amount of bodies that
         17  could be found -- that are in these locations.  We
         18  found out later, having completed the exhumations, that
         19  just above 100 bodies were exhumed in the three graves
         20  in the area of Nova Kasaba.
         21            The grave in the valley of Cerska is also a
         22  non-disturbed site.  The reason could be similar to the
         23  one for the no disturbance of the Nova Kasaba sites,
         24  due to the proximity of the Cancari valley site.  An
         25  additional explanation could be also the limited

          1  amount -- the relative limited amount of people that
          2  were present in this grave, since about 150 bodies were
          3  recovered in this one which is not a huge number
          4  compared with the number of people executed in the area
          5  north.  The third explanation could be that this area
          6  is a very remote valley, as you could see on the video
          7  film from the helicopter which was presented during my
          8  first testimony.
          9            The symbols for the secondary mass graves,
         10  which are the result of a disturbance of primary ones,
         11  are yellow triangles with only one individual inside.
         12  You can clearly notice on this photograph, on this
         13  exhibit, that in the area north are three clusters of
         14  secondary sites:  One along the road that we call the
         15  Hodzici road; we name it according to one of the
         16  villages, destroyed villages, which is along this dirt
         17  road.
         18            Another cluster is in the area of the village
         19  of Liplje, which is also an area of destroyed villages
         20  which were previously occupied by a Muslim population
         21  in 1992.
         22            The third cluster of secondary sites in the
         23  area north is the so-called Cancari road.  We picked
         24  the name "Cancari" because it is also one of the names
         25  of the villages along this road.  The main village in

          1  this area is Kamenica so everyone would refer to that
          2  by the name Kamenica.  We couldn't do that for the
          3  reason that we already had used this name to name the
          4  ambush that took place south of Kravica on the 13th of
          5  July, 1995.  So we did not use that name twice and
          6  called this valley the Cancari Valley.
          7            The last cluster of secondary sites is to be
          8  found just at the south of the Srebrenica former
          9  enclave, in the area of Zeleni Jadar, which is at the
         10  bottom of this exhibit.  The only little problem with
         11  this exhibit is that the approximate boundary of the
         12  enclave is marked on it, as well as the observation
         13  posts which are in yellow colour and can create a
         14  little confusion with the cluster of sites in Zeleni
         15  Jadar.  So please just disregard these OPs for the sake
         16  of understanding this exhibit.
         17       Q.   Mr. Ruez, you used the word "disturbance" in
         18  your testimony.  Do you mean that bodies were taken
         19  from the primary mass grave sites, dug up, transported,
         20  and reburied in the secondary sites which are marked
         21  with yellow triangles?
         22       A.   Absolutely.  The secondary sites are the
         23  result of a disturbance of the primary ones, and the
         24  bodies which were inside the primary graves, except
         25  those that were forgotten during this transfer process

          1  and that were later found in the primary sites, all the
          2  rest of these bodies have been scattered in these
          3  numerous secondary sites, most probably with the intent
          4  that we would not find them, and even if we would find
          5  just a few of them, the content of these sites is
          6  always between 80 -- approximately 80 and 180
          7  individuals.  Therefore, it would never be a
          8  representation of the number of people who had been
          9  assassinated in cold blood during all this process.
         10       Q.   Before we end with this particular exhibit,
         11  let me ask you:  Are all the primary mass grave sites
         12  and the secondary mass grave sites depicted on this
         13  exhibit located within the Drina Corps area of
         14  responsibility?
         15       A.   Yes, indeed.  All these sites are within the
         16  area of responsibility of the Drina Corps, and later on
         17  this map will have to be, in a way, overlaid on top of
         18  a map that will represent the areas of responsibilities
         19  of the various units that were present in this zone in
         20  July 1995.
         21       Q.   You can have a seat, Mr. Ruez.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, my colleague has
         23  inform me that the record may be inaccurate insofar as
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibits 28/8 and 28/8.1, the pictures of
         25  Lieutenant Colonel Popovic.  I think it may show on the

          1  record that it was 128 reflected, and the proper
          2  reference, so the record can be corrected, of the two
          3  images I showed Mr. Ruez are 28/8 and 28/8.1.
          4       Q.   Mr. Ruez, now I'd like you to develop for the
          5  Trial Chamber the evidence showing that the primary
          6  mass grave sites were disturbed and the possible dates
          7  of those disturbances.  I would also like you to
          8  develop the dates when the secondary grave sites were
          9  created.
         10            You should have before you a series of
         11  exhibits from 161, ending with 169, and if you would
         12  start with the primary -- let's start with the primary
         13  sites, Mr. Ruez.  Let's start with the primary site of
         14  Glogova, and if you would use those exhibits, please,
         15  and give the Judges of this Trial Chamber the evidence
         16  that relates to that particular site.
         17       A.   Yes.  Exhibit 161/A is the map of the area of
         18  Bratunac and Glogova.  The two red dots on this map
         19  mark the location of the Glogova sites.  The Glogova
         20  site is, in fact, separated in two; one that we name
         21  Glogova 1 and the second one that we called Glogova 2.
         22  These are grave sites.  It doesn't mean that on each
         23  site is only one grave.
         24            Exhibit 161/1 shows the situation on the
         25  ground in the village of -- former village, I mean,

          1  destroyed village of Glogova, the 27th of July, 1995.
          2  We already showed the photographs linked with the
          3  creation of this mass grave site.  This is the
          4  situation on the ground on the 27th of July, 1995 where
          5  the exhumation is completed on both sites.
          6            Exhibit 161/2 is a view of the site
          7  code-named GL-1, Glogova 1.  This is after the
          8  exhumation has been conducted.  I mean, this is a
          9  picture of 1996 when everything is already over there.
         10  But this is the --
         11       Q.   Mr. Ruez, when you say "after the exhumation
         12  has been conducted," are you referring to the
         13  exhumation by the Office of the Prosecutor or are you
         14  referring to an exhumation by the VRS?
         15       A.   This photograph is dated 1996, so it is in
         16  fact the area after the initial burial and then after
         17  the disturbance.  So this one is just to indicate how
         18  the area looked like at the site Glogova 1, and the
         19  destruction also of the village.
         20            The Exhibit 161/3 is the ground view of the
         21  site Glogova 2, which, as one can see, is close to a
         22  former Muslim cemetery.  That photograph was already
         23  shown.
         24            The Exhibit 161/4 shows the site Glogova 1.
         25  The photograph on the left is dated 27 July 1995, and

          1  all the parts which are white versus all the rest of
          2  the picture which is dark black is the area of
          3  disturbed soil after the initial burial.  The picture
          4  on the right of this photograph is dated 20 October
          5  1995.  It is quite dark, but one can see on this
          6  photograph an excavator present on the site, as well as
          7  a deep trench which is going across this site.  So
          8  there was an open pit created there on the 20th of
          9  October, 1995.
         10       Q.   So this is an aerial image of the
         11  disturbance, in other words, the removal of bodies that
         12  were initially deposited in this site being removed.
         13       A.   Yes.  At this date, 20 October 1995, either
         14  the work is still in progress since the excavator is
         15  still there, or the bodies have already been taken out
         16  of this site and the excavator is probably soon going
         17  to redump soil inside this empty hole and recreate a
         18  flat surface there.
         19            Exhibit 161/5 is an aerial photograph, dated
         20  30 October 1995, that shows that the site Glogova 1 is
         21  finished in terms of disturbance, or the disturbance of
         22  that site is done, but the site Glogova 2 is still
         23  under disturbance.  The same situation: either the
         24  disturbance is already over and the bodies have already
         25  been taken away but the presence of the front loader in

          1  the hole could indicate there is still work ongoing, or
          2  that this excavator, front loader, is now going to
          3  redump the soil in the hole in order to reflatten all
          4  this area.
          5            The Exhibit 161/6 is a photograph of this
          6  same area showing the two sites.  On the right of the
          7  photograph is the site Glogova 1 and on the left, the
          8  site Glogova 2.  This is a photograph in wintertime,
          9  the ground is covered by snow, and there is nothing
         10  that could indicate to anyone that something had
         11  happened here if we did not have the previous
         12  pictures.
         13       Q.   Now, when the Office of the Prosecutor
         14  conducted exhumations at these sites, did they also
         15  find evidence that these sites had been disturbed?
         16       A.   Yes, absolutely.
         17       Q.   We won't go into detail, that will be the
         18  subject of additional testimony by witnesses who will
         19  be testifying after you, but I just wanted to have you
         20  confirm that fact.
         21       A.   Yes.  My colleague Dean Manning will give you
         22  all the details about the findings inside these graves,
         23  disturbed or not disturbed, and will provide all the
         24  details regarding the connection of these sites, each
         25  with another.

          1       Q.   Mr. Ruez, have you finished your development
          2  of the evidence in respect of this particular site?
          3       A.   Yes.  For Glogova, the presentation is done.
          4       Q.   Let's turn to Prosecutor's Exhibit 162,
          5  please, which is the primary mass grave site at
          6  Orahovac.  Again, Mr. Ruez, if you would take the
          7  exhibits in sequence and develop for the Trial Chamber
          8  the history of that particular site.
          9       A.   Exhibit 162/A is the map of the area, and the
         10  circle marks the approximate location of the Orahovac
         11  primary mass grave site.
         12            The Exhibit 162/1 is a photograph that I took
         13  on the 26th of April, 1997 in the hamlet of Lazete.  It
         14  shows two things:  One, the aim of this photograph is
         15  to show this sign where, at the bottom of it, is
         16  written in Cyrillic, "Orahovac," so that confirms the
         17  name of this area.  It will have some importance in the
         18  future.  In fact, the sign invites people in fact to go
         19  to a restaurant which is on the right-hand side of this
         20  photograph.
         21            Just behind that sign is a white building
         22  which is what one witness thinks is a railway station,
         23  and he hid in this railway station just after having
         24  escaped from the execution alive.  He walked on the
         25  railway tracks and reached that location.  This is just

          1  very close to the Grbovci school.
          2            Exhibit 162/2 shows the Orahovac execution
          3  sites and mass grave sites.  The photograph at the left
          4  is dated 5 July 1995.  There is nothing special to be
          5  seen on it.  At the left of the picture is the road
          6  that, if one exits the picture at the top, leads to the
          7  Grbovci school.  That was the detention site for the
          8  prisoners.  The little path that turns right is the
          9  dirt track that then goes under the underpass of the
         10  railroad and reaches the execution site which was used
         11  initially.
         12            On the photograph dated 27 July 1995, one can
         13  see the result of the burial activity of the victims of
         14  these executions, with one massive disturbance at the
         15  bottom of the photo.  That was the first execution site
         16  used for the prisoners that were kept at the Grbovci
         17  school.  At the top of the photo is the second
         18  execution area, and most probably also a burial site,
         19  where a disturbance is clearly noticed.
         20       Q.   On the 27th of July, this shows where the
         21  victims of this mass execution were buried; correct?
         22       A.   Yes, this is the initial burial location.
         23            Exhibit 162/3 is a helicopter view of these
         24  two sites.  At the bottom of the photograph is the site
         25  number 1.  This area here, it was a disturbed area on

          1  the aerial imagery.  The other site, which is site
          2  number 2, is just at the top right of the house that is
          3  in the middle of the picture, and it is the area where
          4  the second area of disturbed soil can be seen on the
          5  aerial photograph.  That marks the presence of a
          6  secondary mass grave there.
          7            Exhibit 162/4 shows the site 1.  The picture
          8  at the left is dated 7 September 1995; it shows how the
          9  ground looks on that date.  The photograph on the right
         10  is dated 27 September 1995; it shows the same spot of
         11  the ground and one can notice that the area of
         12  disturbance has changed.  The area of disturbed soil is
         13  larger than on the photograph dated the 7th of
         14  September.  So on 27 September, the exhumation of the
         15  primary site was completed and the bodies have been
         16  removed from this site.  As you will hear later on, not
         17  all of the bodies had been removed.  Some were
         18  forgotten.
         19       Q.   And this is the smaller of the two sites at
         20  Orahovac?
         21       A.   We cannot say that.  It is the first site
         22  that was used, so most probably it is the bigger one.
         23       Q.   All right.
         24       A.   At some point, the meadow was completely
         25  covered with bodies, so the execution was switched to

          1  the other site, which is LZ-2.
          2       Q.   All right.
          3       A.   Exhibit 162/5 is aerial imagery of the second
          4  site of Orahovac which we call LZ-2.  So the photograph
          5  on the left shows the ground at the date of 7 September
          6  1995.  At the top of the picture, one can see the
          7  railroad line.
          8            I made a mistake.  I mixed the two, in fact.
          9  The comment that I was making for the previous one is
         10  for this one.  This is the site number 2.
         11       Q.   So this is the larger?
         12       A.   Yes, because site number 2 on the markings,
         13  in fact it is the reverse in terms of the happenings
         14  for the executions.  The executions first happened on
         15  the site that we mark LZ-2 and then continued on the
         16  site that we mark LZ-1.  We discovered, in fact, this
         17  change of chronology when we brought the witnesses back
         18  on the crime scene.
         19            The reason is that the victims inside the
         20  gymnasium never refer hearing about -- hearing the
         21  shooting that is happening approximately 800 metres --
         22  only 800 metres away from the gymnasium.  We realised
         23  the reason why when we went on the spot with the
         24  survivors.  The reason could be that there is a very
         25  quite high elevation of ground to support the railroad,

          1  and this makes a kind of natural sound barrier.  So
          2  most probably if you add the fact that the people were
          3  talking a little bit in another -- in the gymnasium,
          4  all this would come as rumours.  And the soldiers were
          5  shooting from time to time above their heads, hitting
          6  the windows.  This was probably also making their ears
          7  buzzing, and they probably didn't hear what was going
          8  on during the executions on the first site.
          9            But unfortunately once the execution was
         10  switched on the second site, most probably those inside
         11  the gymnasium could hear what was happening, and then
         12  probably this had some consequences on their conditions
         13  of detention.
         14       Q.   What is the significance of this photograph,
         15  Mr. Ruez?
         16       A.   This photograph, which is the LZ-2 site, but
         17  that is the first execution site used on the 14th July
         18  1995.  On the left photograph, dated 7 September, one
         19  can see the disturbed soil which is of a white colour
         20  on this photograph, and on the right is a photograph
         21  dated the 27th September, and the area of disturbance
         22  is clearly larger than the one dated 7 September,
         23  indicating that something happened there.  The
         24  exhumation confirmed, indeed, that disturbance happened
         25  here.

          1       Q.   All right.  Now, do you wish to say anything
          2  else, Mr. Ruez, about the Orahovac site or should we
          3  move to --
          4       A.   No, we are moving on to the next one.
          5       Q.   Okay.  Now, again if you develop the evidence
          6  about the disturbances that took place at the Dam at
          7  Petkovci, the location of the mass execution.
          8       A.   Exhibit 163/A is the map of the area nearby
          9  Zvornik town and Kakanj, and the circle marks the
         10  location of the plateau of the Dam where the execution
         11  took place and the burial of part of the victims;
         12  probably not all of the victims, since we don't know
         13  what happened with the victims that were -- corpses of
         14  the victims that were transported away by the little
         15  trailer.
         16            Exhibit 163/1 is a helicopter view from the
         17  Dam, and the arrow at the right of the photograph shows
         18  the location of the disturbed soil where a mass grave
         19  was.
         20            Exhibit 163/2 --
         21       Q.   Now, this is a before-and-after shot, is it?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Explain the "before" and explain the "after."
         24       A.   So 5 July 1995, the photograph at the left of
         25  this picture shows the Dam, the plateau of the Dam, and

          1  5 July is before events, so there is nothing specific
          2  to be seen there.
          3            We know that the execution at the Dam took
          4  place on 14 July 1995.  The photograph at the right of
          5  this picture is dated 27 July 1995, and it shows an
          6  obvious area of recently-disturbed gravel.  In fact,
          7  there is no soil there.  It is rocks.  That was the
          8  creation of the primary mass grave.
          9       Q.   So that's where at least some of the victims
         10  of that mass execution were initially buried?
         11       A.   Yes, the initial burial site.  And on Exhibit
         12  163/3, one can again see how the ground looked like on
         13  the 7th of September, 1995.  That is the part -- the
         14  left part of this picture.
         15            And for comparison, the right part of the
         16  picture dated 27 July 1995 shows that the area looks
         17  slightly different.  The fact is that here the
         18  photograph is obviously not taken at the same moment of
         19  the day.
         20            The photograph at the left is probably taken
         21  around noon, and the one on the right, later in the
         22  afternoon, so the shadows are very different on these
         23  two photographs.  That weakens the comparison, but we
         24  can confirm that indeed the disturbance took place
         25  there because an exhumation was conducted, and the

          1  results showed that indeed it was a mass grave.  And it
          2  was no more a mass grave when we did the exhumation
          3  because the bodies had been taken away, but body parts
          4  were forgotten.
          5       Q.   Sometime prior to the 27th of September,
          6  1995, the bodies were removed from each location; is
          7  that correct?
          8       A.   Yes.  From this photograph, the only
          9  conclusion we can draft is that the disturbance took
         10  place at some point between 7 September 1995 and 27
         11  September 1995.  I must add also that all this is work
         12  in progress and that we might be able, in the future,
         13  to narrow down a bit better these dates.
         14       Q.   All right.  Why don't we turn to another
         15  primary mass grave site, the primary mass grave site
         16  found at Kozluk.  If you would start with exhibits
         17  found in tab 164.
         18       A.   Exhibit 164/A is the map of the area of
         19  Kozluk, and the red circle marks the position of --
         20  approximate position of the mass grave -- of the
         21  execution site and mass grave of Kozluk.  In fact, it
         22  is very close to the Drina River, so it is not a very
         23  accurate marking on this exhibit.
         24            The Exhibit 164/1 --
         25       Q.   This is a before-and-after shot, is it not?

          1       A.   It is a before-and-after shot of the area of
          2  the execution site and initial burial site.
          3       Q.   Would you explain, Mr. Ruez, the "before" and
          4  the "after"?
          5       A.   Umm-hmm.  The left part of these photographs
          6  shows -- completely on the left, the Drina River.  And
          7  on the right part, it's an area of sand creeks.  So
          8  there had already been disturbed soil, but this
          9  disturbed soil is linked with the dumping of garbage
         10  and broken glass from the Betinka [phoen] factory, as
         11  we know, but also because people go in this location to
         12  take gravel out of these sand creeks.
         13            The photograph dated 17 July 1995 shows that
         14  the area has significantly been changed.  We know that
         15  the execution took place on this location, and here the
         16  burial of the victims is completed.  There is an open
         17  trench that is visible at the left of the photograph
         18  [indicates], the photograph that is on the right of
         19  this picture.  Again, you can see, just at the left
         20  edge, the Drina River and one open pit [indicates].  In
         21  fact, this open pit is not there to put bodies, but it
         22  has been used to take soil and cover the bodies which
         23  are, in fact, buried to the right of this open pit.
         24       Q.   So on this image, on the 5th of July, the
         25  executions had not yet taken place, and therefore there

          1  is no major disturbance of the soil.  And on the
          2  right-hand side, after the executions took place, one
          3  can see on this image the soil has been disturbed and
          4  it's significantly different; is that correct?
          5       A.   Yes, it is.
          6            Exhibit 164/2 is a helicopter view of the
          7  area.  That was -- that photograph was presented during
          8  my first testimony, and I present it again to make a
          9  correction.  This is, in fact, not the mass grave
         10  site.  The mass grave site is just at the left of this
         11  photograph.  If one exits from the path that is just
         12  here in the middle of the picture at the left
         13  [indicates], then just a few metres after this, one
         14  hits the mass grave area.  This area here [indicates]
         15  is in fact disconnected from the execution burial
         16  site.  It is an area of gravel.  Just a confusion on
         17  the very precise location.  But that photograph still
         18  gives a very good view on how close the river is and
         19  also of how the terrain looks like and the cornfields
         20  around.  That also matched the information that we got
         21  on site.
         22       Q.   Let's go to the imagery that shows the
         23  disturbance of this primary mass grave, which is in
         24  Prosecutor's Exhibit 164/3.
         25       A.   That exhibit again shows, at the left of this

          1  photograph, the situation on the ground dated 7
          2  September 1995, so after the initial burial was
          3  concluded.  And the photograph on the right, dated 27
          4  September 1995, shows that the soil has significantly
          5  changed at that location.  That change on the ground is
          6  linked with the disturbance of the site where
          7  excavators came and unburied a certain number of bodies
          8  there.  The usual amount was forgotten, as my colleague
          9  will explain when he will testify.
         10       Q.   Without going into any detail, there was
         11  evidence, then, at the subsequent exhumation conducted
         12  by the Office of the Prosecutor that this site had been
         13  disturbed?
         14       A.   Yes.  The exhumation conducted there
         15  confirmed that indeed it was an execution site, an
         16  initial burial site, and that then the site was
         17  disturbed and bodies taken in an unknown direction.
         18       Q.   Right.  Mr. Ruez, let's turn to Prosecutor's
         19  Exhibit 165 and the subsequent sub-parts of that
         20  exhibit.
         21            MR. HARMON:  This deals with the Branjevo
         22  Military Farm, and Your Honours have heard testimony
         23  about a mass execution that took place at the Branjevo
         24  Military Farm through the testimony of Drazen Erdemovic
         25  and survivors.

          1       A.   Exhibit 165/A is the map of the area.  Right
          2  in the middle of the right circle are the buildings of
          3  the Branjevo Farm.  We can see three dots that mark the
          4  buildings.
          5            Exhibit 165/1 is a helicopter view photograph
          6  taken in 1996 of these buildings.  So in the middle of
          7  the photograph is the Branjevo Farm, and that picture
          8  shows also the surroundings.  The execution site is at
          9  the right of the photograph just after passing the
         10  little shed behind which the executioners were
         11  staying.  And on the right part of the photograph is
         12  the execution field.  The area where the initial burial
         13  took place is also visible on the photo.  It is the
         14  little white area completely at the right of the
         15  photograph, more or less in the middle [indicates].
         16            Exhibit 165/2 --
         17       Q.   This photograph is taken the day after the
         18  executions took place at the Branjevo Military Farm; is
         19  that correct?
         20       A.   Yes.  The execution there took place 16 July
         21  1995, and this is the picture that we already showed
         22  taken 17 July 1995, where bodies can be seen on the
         23  ground; not all the bodies, because many of them have
         24  already been taken away by that time.  One can see the
         25  traces of the excavator that collected these bodies on

          1  the soil, and one can see also the burial area where
          2  the exhumation is ongoing at that moment.
          3       Q.   Can you point out the area where the bodies
          4  are located?
          5       A.   Yes.  Where it is written at the left of the
          6  picture:  "Access ramp to mass grave," just underneath
          7  is the area where the grave was.  Just at the edge of
          8  the grave is also a certain number of dots that are
          9  suspected bodies [indicates].
         10       Q.   And where are the principal killing fields?
         11  Can you point that out.
         12       A.   Yes.  On this photograph, the area that is
         13  encircled here only shows where the bodies are.  The
         14  execution -- the site of the execution field was larger
         15  than that.  It covers, in fact, all the area where
         16  vehicle traces can be seen.
         17            MR. HARMON:  And the Court has heard
         18  testimony from Mr. Erdemovic that approximately 1.200
         19  people were killed at this location on the 16th of
         20  July, 1995.
         21       Q.   All right.  Mr. Ruez, please, will you
         22  continue.
         23       A.   The photograph of the same farm taken the
         24  21st of September, 1995, shows that the burial area
         25  that we had just been pointing at, which is more or

          1  less at the same location on this photograph
          2  [indicates] at the bottom left, is untouched.  So this
          3  is the situation on the ground on the 21st September
          4  1995, after everything is completed there.  The initial
          5  burial is over, and for the moment the situation here
          6  is stable.
          7       Q.   This photograph, Mr. Ruez, is the "before"
          8  image, then, of the disturbance from the primary mass
          9  grave?
         10       A.   That is correct.
         11       Q.   Now, this next image, what does this show,
         12  Mr. Ruez?
         13       A.   The next picture shows the situation after.
         14       Q.   And the next picture is 165/4.
         15       A.   It is dated 27 September 1995.  It again
         16  shows the farm, and at the location where the grave is
         17  to be found, there is a newly-excavated trench.  So
         18  most probably 27 July 1995, the bodies have already
         19  been taken out of that initial burial location.
         20       Q.   So sometime, Mr. Ruez, between the 21st of
         21  September and the 27th of September, there was a
         22  disturbance at that mass grave site?
         23       A.   Absolutely.  We cannot conclude that the
         24  excavation is completed at that moment, but it is the
         25  best frame of the date that we can have at this

          1  moment.
          2            On this photograph also, there is a blowup of
          3  the central part of the picture.  The site is small,
          4  but there is a backhoe and a front loader present at
          5  the Branjevo Farm at that moment.  So probably the
          6  equipment that was used to do the disturbance and take
          7  the bodies away from the Branjevo Farm.
          8       Q.   So a backhoe and a front loader are heavy
          9  construction equipment that would be used to excavate
         10  the soil, and collect the bodies, and put them into
         11  trucks to transport them; is that correct?
         12       A.   It is correct.  It is two types of equipment
         13  that we will constantly see again in action on these
         14  areas.
         15       Q.   All right.  Now, Mr. Ruez, I think that
         16  completes our tour of the primary mass grave sites.  Is
         17  that correct?
         18       A.   That's correct.
         19       Q.   Now what I would like you to do is focus your
         20  attention on the secondary grave sites, in other words,
         21  the locations where bodies were taken from these
         22  primary sites, concealed, and reburied.
         23            Why don't we start --
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Perhaps
         25  this is a good time for the break.  In that case, we'll

          1  have a 20-minute break.
          2                 --- Recess taken at 12.15 p.m.
          3                 --- On resuming at 12.42 p.m.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We will
          5  resume the hearing.
          6            Mr. Harmon, please continue.
          7            MR. HARMON:
          8       Q.   Mr. Ruez, just before the break you had
          9  concluded your discussion about disturbances at the
         10  primary mass grave sites, and I'd now like to turn your
         11  attention to disturbances or the creation of the
         12  secondary mass grave sites and the clusters of those
         13  sites.
         14            I'd like you to first of all turn your
         15  attention to Prosecutor's Exhibit 166, the cluster of
         16  secondary mass grave sites as Zeleni Jadar.  Before you
         17  begin your testimony, using the large map to your
         18  right, using the pointer, could you just point out that
         19  particular cluster about which you're going to be
         20  testifying.
         21       A.   The cluster of secondary sites of Zeleni
         22  Jadar is just at the south of the former Srebrenica
         23  safe area, and it is just at the bottom right of the
         24  map exhibit.
         25       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, using the exhibits that are

          1  found in Prosecutor's Exhibit 166 and following, could
          2  you testify about the creation of those sites, each
          3  specific site, and if you can identify before-and-after
          4  shots as "before" and "after" shots and if you could
          5  also identify the dates that are relevant to each of
          6  these images.
          7       A.   Yes.  The first exhibit is number 166/A.  It
          8  is the map of the area of Srebrenica.  The green dots
          9  mark the precise position of these secondary mass
         10  graves.
         11       Q.   So there are six in total at this location.
         12       A.   There are six sites in total.  As we will
         13  see, one of these sites is, in fact, consisting of two
         14  graves.
         15            Exhibit 166/1 is a large photograph, an
         16  overview of all the area of Zeleni Jadar.  It cannot go
         17  completely under the ELMO so I will have it like this.
         18  This shows the terrain in Zeleni Jadar.  It is a rough
         19  terrain of hills.  It is a very remote area; nearly no
         20  one is living in this place.  It's a complete trashed
         21  zone; it was a former combat zone.  There is no one
         22  living there.
         23       Q.   It looks heavily wooded.
         24       A.   It is heavily wooded, and it is also heavily
         25  mined.  There are several Bosnian Serb army minefields

          1  in this area, and the choice of this area is probably
          2  linked with the presence of these minefields since even
          3  locals would probably be deterred to go wandering in
          4  this area.
          5            So this map shows the position on the ground
          6  of all these secondary mass graves, and we will now
          7  present them one by one.
          8       Q.   Will you just, while you have that image
          9  before you and before the Judges, just indicate ZJ-1.
         10  I take that is the location of the first secondary mass
         11  grave side.
         12       A.   This is correct.  The coding "ZJ" stands for
         13  Zeleni Jadar, and "1" is the site number 1 which is the
         14  most north, and then the numbering goes from north to
         15  south.
         16       Q.   Could you just move that image completely
         17  across the ELMO so all of the sites can eventually be
         18  seen.
         19       A.   Site number 6 is the most south.
         20       Q.   Please continue, Mr. Ruez.
         21       A.   Exhibit 166/2 is a before-and-after
         22  photograph of the area where the site Zeleni Jadar 1 is
         23  located.  On the left of the picture one can see the
         24  shape of the ground at the date of 7 September 1995,
         25  and on the picture on the right one can see that there

          1  is an open pit, which is marked with a yellow arrow,
          2  and that is Zeleni Jadar 1.  The photograph is dated 2
          3  October 1995, so at that date there was just an open
          4  pit created there but nothing inside.
          5            A bit further down on this photograph -- that
          6  is the reason why I said that in this location there is
          7  probably more than one site -- you can also see that
          8  there is an open pit a bit more south of the Zeleni
          9  Jadar 1 grave.  We cannot count this site as a grave at
         10  this moment because we could not access this place due
         11  to the mine threat in this location, so it will be
         12  probably done but at a later stage.
         13       Q.   Mr. Ruez, so what we know from this image is
         14  sometime between the 7th of September, 1995 and the 2nd
         15  of October, 1995 these secondary mass grave sites were
         16  created.
         17       A.   Between this time frame, an open pit is
         18  created.  For the moment it is still not a mass grave.
         19  For the moment it is just an open pit.
         20            One can notice also the size of these pits.
         21  There is no reference in size, but it's approximately a
         22  tank size.  You could probably enter this position with
         23  a tank.  So there is no reason to suspect such a hole
         24  there.  That could be very well something like a
         25  defensive position.  The fact is at that time there was

          1  no need at all to create defensive positions in this
          2  location since on the 2nd of October, 1995 the enclave
          3  was already eradicated.
          4       Q.   Why don't you show the next image and show
          5  the Judges what happened at this location at a later
          6  date.
          7       A.   Exhibit 166/3 shows again the same area, but
          8  now the picture on the left is dated 18 October 1995.
          9  The same open pit is visible on the photograph.  So the
         10  situation between 2 October 1995 and 18 October 1995 is
         11  unchanged.  The same open pit south of Zeleni Jadar 1
         12  is also still open.
         13            On the right of the photograph, at the date
         14  20 October 1995, Zeleni Jadar 1 is now a filled grave
         15  and the suspect hole south of Zeleni Jadar 1 is filled
         16  as well.  The site had been probed, and it is indeed a
         17  mass grave.
         18       Q.   Which site has been probed?
         19       A.   The Zeleni Jadar 1 site has been probed only
         20  so far.  So one can conclude from these photographs
         21  that between 18 October 1995 and 20 October 1995 the
         22  site was filled with bodies.
         23            Now we're moving on to Zeleni Jadar 2 site,
         24  which is Exhibit 166/4.
         25       Q.   Exhibit 166/4.

          1       A.   "/4."  It is also a before-and-after shot.
          2  The "before" shot is dated 24 August 1995.  It shows,
          3  in fact, only the gravel road.  At the bottom of the
          4  picture is a wooded hill, at the bottom of which is a
          5  little river flowing.  The picture on the right is
          6  dated 7 October 1995, and one can observe that between
          7  24 August and the 2nd of October, an open pit was
          8  created there as well.  At this moment the pit is
          9  probably filled with water which is coming from the
         10  little brook which is running there.
         11            Exhibit 166/5 is a more fuzzy photograph but
         12  it still shows that at 20 October 1995 the Zeleni Jadar
         13  2 site is still an open pit, it is not filled.  So the
         14  situation has not changed between 23 October -- sorry,
         15  between the previous one, between the 2nd of October
         16  and the 20th of October.  But between 20 October and 23
         17  October 1995, that is the picture on the right of this
         18  present exhibit, that one can see that the Zeleni Jadar
         19  site 2 is filled.
         20            An additional comment on this site is that we
         21  found out during the exhumation of this site that it
         22  was a disturbed site.  This is the only disturbed
         23  secondary site that we have encountered so far.  We
         24  have no reasonable explanation that could explain what
         25  happened.  There is still something that could be

          1  double-checked.  There could be a pumping station in
          2  this location of Zeleni Jadar using the water from that
          3  brook and then this water is allegedly pumped to bring
          4  water to Srebrenica town.  So it might very well be
          5  that these bodies here will have polluted the water
          6  table and therefore they had to be taken away at a
          7  later stage.  But we do not have the explanation of why
          8  this secondary site was later on disturbed, and we do
          9  not know when the disturbance took place.
         10       Q.   So by "disturbed," you mean the bodies in
         11  this secondary site were removed and located some place
         12  else.
         13       A.   Yes, absolutely.
         14       Q.   Please continue, Mr. Ruez.  Go to the next
         15  before-and-after shot.
         16       A.   Exhibit 166/6 is a before-and-after
         17  photograph of the site that we name Zeleni Jadar 3.  On
         18  the picture dated 7 September 1995, on the left of the
         19  screen, one can see the ground before a change occurs,
         20  and at 2 October 1995, one can see that there is an
         21  open hole which is marked on this photograph with
         22  yellow markers "Zeleni Jadar 3."
         23            The next photograph is the same site.  It is
         24  the Exhibit 166/7.  The photograph is a bit fuzzy but
         25  still shows that at 20 October 1995 the hole does not

          1  exist any more; it has been filled.  The site has been
          2  probed and contains multiple remains.
          3       Q.   So between the 2nd of October, 1995 and the
          4  20th of October, 1995 the hole was filled with human
          5  remains.
          6       A.   With human remains, absolutely.
          7            The following exhibit is 166/8.  It shows two
          8  sites that are in the vicinity of each other.  The
          9  photograph at the top of this picture is dated 7
         10  September 1995 and shows nothing special.  Compared
         11  with the photograph dated 12 October 1995, one can
         12  observe that there are two open pits created in that
         13  location, so created between 7 September and 12
         14  October.  One is code-named Zeleni Jadar 4 and the
         15  second one is Zeleni Jadar 5.
         16            We will mark on the picture 7 September where
         17  these sites are because the photograph is taken from
         18  another angle and this transforms the landscape a bit.
         19  The Zeleni Jadar 5 site -- this does not work -- the
         20  Zeleni Jadar 5 site is in that location and Zeleni
         21  Jadar 4, on the photograph dated 7 September, would be
         22  where I put the second arrow, which is here.  So a
         23  slightly different perspective than the photograph
         24  dated 2 October 1995.
         25            In 12 October 1995, so we have open pits in

          1  these locations, and the next exhibit, which is 166/9,
          2  is also a photograph that is a bit fuzzy but one can
          3  still see on this one that both the site Zeleni Jadar 4
          4  and the site Zeleni Jadar 5 are now filled.  These
          5  sites were -- Zeleni Jadar 4 site was probed and
          6  contains multiple human remains, and Zeleni Jadar site
          7  5 has been fully exhumed and the results of this
          8  exhumation will be developed by my colleague Dean
          9  Manning, as well as the connection between this site
         10  and some primary one.
         11            The next exhibit is 166/10 and shows a
         12  before-and-after photograph of the site number 6.  One
         13  can see that at 7 September 1995 there is nothing
         14  special on the ground, but at 27 September 1995 there
         15  is a big trench, big open trench, that can be seen in
         16  that location.  So that site was created -- that open
         17  pit was created between 7 September and 27 September.
         18            Exhibit 166/11 shows the same terrain, this
         19  time dated 12 October 1995, the picture on the left
         20  side.  It is quite unclear to determine at what stage
         21  this site is at this moment.  It is obvious that the
         22  site is no more an open trench but it is still not --
         23  the work is still not completed there, since at 18
         24  October 1995 one can see that there is a large area of
         25  disturbed soil on that same spot where previously there

          1  was an open trench.
          2            So the conclusion we can draw here is that it
          3  is only for sure 18 October 1995 -- at some point
          4  between 12 October 1995 and 18 October 1995 that the
          5  work was completed on this site.
          6       Q.   Now, has that site been probed or exhumed?
          7       A.   The site has been probed and the presence of
          8  multiple remains was found there.
          9       Q.   Mr. Ruez, does that complete your review of
         10  the secondary sites at Zeleni Jadar?
         11       A.   This is correct.  So we have six confirmed
         12  secondary sites in Zeleni Jadar, and a potential number
         13  7 grave which could be, in fact, the one just south of
         14  the site number 1.  We will determine that probably
         15  this year.
         16       Q.   Mr. Ruez, I'd like you to focus your
         17  attention on the cluster of secondary sites now at the
         18  Hodzici road.  Would you again begin by pointing out on
         19  the large map where that cluster of secondary grave
         20  sites is located.
         21       A.   The Hodzici sites are just at the west of
         22  Zvornik town.  It is a dirt road that goes from Zvornik
         23  to the national road that then goes to Tuzla.  It's a
         24  dirt road.  It's an area of destroyed villages formally
         25  occupied by Muslims in 1992.

          1       Q.   Now, is this also an isolated area that's
          2  heavily wooded?
          3       A.   Yes, the same situation, with a difference
          4  with the others, which are mainly in valleys.  This one
          5  is along a road which follows a hill line.
          6       Q.   All right, Mr. Ruez, thank you.
          7       A.   So regarding these sites, the Exhibit 167/A
          8  is the map of the area, and the green dots mark the
          9  precise position of seven sites which have been found
         10  and probed and confirmed as mass graves containing
         11  human remains.  Some of them have been fully exhumed.
         12            Exhibit 167/1 is an aerial photograph -- a
         13  mosaic of several photographs reconstructing the
         14  so-called Hodzici road.
         15       Q.   Can you explain the coding, please, on the
         16  exhibit?
         17       A.   Yes.  So all the sites we have worked on are
         18  marked on this photograph, starting with HZ-1 -- that
         19  stands for Hodzici 1 -- through Hodzici 7, with very
         20  precise spot marking where these graves are.
         21       Q.   Mr. Ruez, on the caption on the lower
         22  right-hand image, it says "Cerik Road Segment."  The
         23  other two captions say "Hodzici Road Segment."  Just
         24  for the record, will you explain the difference,
         25  please?

          1       A.   The difference comes from the titles that
          2  were given to these photographs from the US State
          3  Department, who provided us these pictures.
          4       Q.   But for purposes of this testimony, all of
          5  these sites are referred to as the Hodzici road?
          6       A.   Yes.  Cerik is the village closest from the
          7  graves Hodzici 6 and Hodzici 7.  The reason why?  On
          8  that photograph initially, the area was not just Cerik
          9  but was also closer to Hodzici, which is why they were
         10  named "Hodzici."  For us, we named the entire road
         11  "Hodzici."
         12       Q.   All right.  With that clarification, please
         13  continue.
         14       A.   Exhibit 167/2 is a photograph of soil, dated
         15  7 September 1995, where a grave will be created later
         16  on.
         17       Q.   For the record, Mr. Ruez, this is a
         18  location -- a "before" shot of the location where
         19  Hodzici 1 or 2 is located?
         20       A.   This is a photograph where the site 2 will be
         21  located.
         22       Q.   All right.
         23       A.   The site 1 -- I have to confirm -- correct
         24  something.  Site 1 has been trenched, probed, and was
         25  negative.  The site 1 does not exist.

          1       Q.   All right.  With that clarification, then,
          2  please continue.
          3       A.   So the second exhibit is number 167/3 and
          4  shows the same terrain but dated 7 October 1995,
          5  showing that in between the 7 September 1995 and that
          6  date, 7 October 1995, an area of disturbed soil can be
          7  seen here.
          8       Q.   You mean "2 October 1995," not "7"?
          9       A.   2 October 1995.  And this is the site of
         10  Hodzici 2.
         11            The next exhibit, 167/4, showed the area
         12  where the site 3 will be created.  This photograph is
         13  dated 7 September 1995.  It just shows the dirt road
         14  and the hills around it with trees.
         15            And the second -- the Exhibit 167/5 shows the
         16  same terrain 2nd October 1995, where there is a clear
         17  disturbance of soil that marks the position of the
         18  Hodzici 3 site.
         19       Q.   So between the 7th of September, 1995, and
         20  the 2nd of October, 1995, the Hodzici Road 3 site --
         21  secondary grave site was created?
         22       A.   That is correct.
         23            Exhibit 167/6 shows a cluster of destroyed
         24  houses.  The photograph is dated 7 September 1995.  And
         25  in the vicinity of this cluster of destroyed houses,

          1  two sites will be created between the 7 September 1995
          2  and the 7 October 1995.
          3            The Exhibit 167/7 shows that same terrain at
          4  the date of 2nd October, where --
          5       Q.   Mr. Ruez, let me correct the record.  The two
          6  sites were created, according to your testimony just a
          7  moment ago, between the 7th of September and the 7th of
          8  October, 1995?
          9       A.   Sorry, a misspelling for me.  It is the 2nd,
         10  not the 7th.  It's my spelling that makes the
         11  confusion.
         12       Q.   They were created between the 7th of
         13  September, 1995, and the 2nd of October, 1995?
         14       A.   Yes, absolutely.
         15       Q.   All right.
         16       A.   The next exhibit, 167/8, is a photograph
         17  again dated 7 September 1995 --
         18       Q.   Mr. Ruez, I'm sorry.  Could you go back to
         19  the previous exhibit, the one on the 2nd of October,
         20  1995.
         21       A.   Yes, where now one can see two areas of
         22  disturbed soil that are, for us, the site of Hodzici 4
         23  and Hodzici 5.
         24       Q.   And have both of those sites been probed?
         25       A.   Yes, and they both contain remains.  There

          1  has been exhumation also conducted there, full
          2  exhumation.
          3            I represent the Exhibit 167/8.  It is another
          4  area along that so-called Hodzici road, also a cluster
          5  of destroyed houses.
          6            On that same terrain, the Exhibit 167/9, that
          7  is a photograph dated 7 October -- 2nd October 1995,
          8  where the site Hodzici 6 is clearly visible on that
          9  picture, a clear area of disturbed soil present there.
         10  That is also a confirmed secondary site.
         11            The Exhibit 167/10 shows the terrain in a
         12  location nearby the village of Cerik.  That is still,
         13  for us, the Hodzici road.  That photograph is dated 7
         14  September 1995.  There is nothing specific to see on
         15  this one.
         16            But on the Exhibit 167/11, that shows the
         17  same terrain at the date of 2nd October 1995, one can
         18  see that there is an area of disturbed soil.  This is
         19  the site Hodzici 7, which is a confirmed secondary mass
         20  grave.
         21       Q.   So between the 7th of September, 1995, and
         22  the 2nd of October, 1995, HZ-7 was created?
         23       A.   Absolutely.
         24       Q.   Would you just keep that picture on the ELMO
         25  for a minute, Mr. Ruez.  These are aerial images taken

          1  from a particular elevation above.  Have you been to
          2  this particular series of secondary grave sites?
          3       A.   Yes, I've been to this series of graves.  But
          4  I didn't -- I was not part of the mission that we
          5  conducted to pinpoint them.  I went to them after that,
          6  that is, another case for the other one we are talking
          7  about where -- was on the mission where we actually
          8  found them.  These ones were found during another
          9  mission.  We found these ones with the assistance of
         10  the aerial imagery.  Without this aerial imagery
         11  provided by the US government, never ever would we have
         12  found this site south of Zvornik.
         13       Q.   Why is that?
         14       A.   Because, as you will see on a film that we
         15  show later, vegetation grows very fast, and with the
         16  normal means of observation and probing, we would never
         17  have been able to find these places.  The methods we
         18  used -- we used in 1996 to find graves and probe graves
         19  was not fairly sophisticated enough to enable us or
         20  give us a chance to find these sites with normal
         21  techniques.  Without the assistance of imagery
         22  analysts, we would never have found these places south
         23  of Zvornik.
         24       Q.   All right.  Mr. Ruez, have you finished now
         25  the testimony about the secondary sites along this

          1  particular road?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Let's turn now your attention to the third
          4  set of secondary mass graves, those at Liplje.  Again,
          5  if you would kindly approach the large exhibit, using
          6  the pointer, and indicate where that cluster of
          7  secondary mass graves is located.
          8       A.   The cluster of Liplje sites is just where the
          9  village of Liplje is marked on the map just south-west
         10  of Zvornik town.  It is also a former Muslim village
         11  and is completed destroyed.
         12       Q.   Can you give a general description of the
         13  terrain at that location?
         14       A.   All the area south-west of Zvornik is an area
         15  of hills and valleys.  They just continue one after
         16  another.  One could quickly get lost on all the paths
         17  which one can travel on with four-wheel drive vehicles
         18  in this area.  There are a lot of hiding places there.
         19       Q.   I take it this is not a heavily populated
         20  area where this set of secondary graves was located.
         21       A.   Before 1992, it was populated.  But during
         22  the war, I mean, just after the ethnic cleansing
         23  campaign of 1992, there were no Muslims left living in
         24  this area, and no one lived there during the last
         25  years.

          1            Now refugees, Muslim refugees, are returning
          2  in these areas and are trying to reconstruct their
          3  homes and their lives in this place.  The problem is
          4  that all these secondary sites in their vicinity will
          5  have to be exhumed also before they can quietly
          6  resettle there.
          7       Q.   Mr. Ruez, please make your presentation in
          8  respect of these Liplje secondary mass graves sites.
          9       A.   The Exhibit 168/A is the map of the area of
         10  Zvornik that shows the precise location of the Liplje
         11  secondary graves, where we have four sites.  The green
         12  dots numbered from 1 to 4 mark the locations of these
         13  graves.
         14            The next exhibit is 168/1, and it's an
         15  overview of the area of Liplje, where all the graves
         16  can be seen.  From the right to the left, the right of
         17  the picture being the north on the ground, is Liplje 1
         18  through Liplje 4.  There is an additional problem now
         19  in this area.  It's that the town of Zvornik is using
         20  the area in between the Liplje site 4 and the Liplje
         21  site 3, and has a garbage dump site for Zvornik town.
         22  The situation started in 1996, and now the garbage is
         23  at the edge of these graves.
         24       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, LP-1 is the code for Liplje 1,
         25  and all the way through --

          1       A.   Yes, it is.
          2       Q.   -- to LP-4?
          3       A.   Yes, it is. "LP" is the code name for
          4  "Liplje."
          5       Q.   All right.  Please proceed with your
          6  before-and-after images.
          7       A.   The next image will focus on the first site,
          8  which is Liplje 1.
          9            Exhibit 168/2 shows an area of completely
         10  destroyed houses where, aside from these destructions,
         11  nothing specific is to be observed.  The photograph is
         12  dated 7 September 1995, so it is a "before" shot for
         13  the sites Liplje 1 and Liplje 2.
         14            Exhibit 168/3 is a photograph of the same
         15  location, with two differences on it -- really three
         16  differences.
         17            The first one is an area of disturbed soil
         18  behind a house, a destroyed house, and this is the
         19  location of grave Liplje 1; probed, confirmed presence
         20  of multiple remains in this site.
         21            On the same picture, one can see, more south,
         22  right, on the photograph, the location of the site of
         23  Liplje 2.  That site had been fully exhumed.  But one
         24  can also notice on that photograph that there is an
         25  area of disturbed soil at the top of the picture above

          1  Liplje 2 [indicates], which does not appear on the
          2  previous exhibit.  Therefore, this is a location that
          3  we will still need to check.  It might add one site in
          4  this area.  Again, unfortunately, the investigation is
          5  far from being over on that topic, and the disclosure
          6  of all of these elements is going to put at risk all
          7  the people who will be doing the job there.
          8            The next exhibit is 168/4, and there is no
          9  "before" shot for this site.  But one could assume
         10  that if we had a photograph dated 7 September 1995 to
         11  show you, we would see that there is nothing specific
         12  in that location.  This one is dated 7 October 1995 and
         13  shows an area of disturbed soil.  That is, for us, the
         14  site Liplje 3 which had been probed and confirmed as a
         15  secondary mass grave.
         16       Q.   For the record, to clarify the record again,
         17  your testimony reflects a date of the 7th of October,
         18  1995.  I think you had meant the 2nd of October.
         19       A.   2nd October 1995.  On this photograph, also
         20  the title says "Snagovo."  Again, it's just a question
         21  of naming the place.  We call all these sites Liplje,
         22  even though this is not exactly Liplje village.  It's
         23  just that Liplje is the main village in this area.
         24            The next exhibit is 168/5.  It is again a
         25  photograph dated 7 September 1995, where there is

          1  nothing specific to be observed aside from destroyed
          2  houses.  For your information, the garbage dump site I
          3  was talking about has now invaded all the area south of
          4  this photograph and is now at the edge of this gravel
          5  road [indicates], not immediately threatening the
          6  secondary sites, but they are in a very close vicinity
          7  of the sites.
          8            The next exhibit is 168/6.  It is a
          9  photograph dated 2nd October 1995, and shows that
         10  behind one of these destroyed houses is an area of
         11  disturbed soil, and this site has been checked and
         12  confirmed also as being a secondary mass grave
         13  containing multiple human remains.
         14            The following photograph is Exhibit 168/7.
         15  It is a colour photograph taken from a helicopter on 15
         16  June 1996.  It is designed to show you how the ground
         17  looks from the air, but in colour.
         18            I'm going to point on the picture the
         19  locations of two graves which are in the frame of this
         20  picture, which are Liplje 1 and Liplje 2.  The other
         21  sites are out of the frame.
         22            The circle I've just marked here is the
         23  location of Liplje 1 and then can be compared with the
         24  aerial photograph to have a better reference on the
         25  ground; and the second site, that is Liplje 2 has been

          1  fully exhumed, and it's located where I'm going to
          2  circle now [marks], just here on the photograph.
          3       Q.   Mr. Ruez, would you put an "LP-1" and an
          4  "LP-2" so the record is clear.
          5       A.   [Marks].  Done.
          6            The last photograph is Exhibit 168/1 [sic]
          7  and it shows the result of a quick probe that was
          8  conducted there when we first went to this area.  That
          9  was in 1997.  That is a very shallow grave with human
         10  remains inside.  Many bones are scattered around.  All
         11  these bones have attracted a lot of attention these
         12  last weeks in the area and things will have to be done
         13  this summer to solve this situation.
         14       Q.   Just to clarify the record, the record
         15  reflects that this exhibit that's on the ELMO, in the
         16  record is 168/1 and it should be 168/8.
         17       A.   This concludes the presentation for the
         18  Liplje sites.
         19       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, let's go to our final location
         20  and final cluster of secondary mass grave sites on the
         21  Cancari road.  Using the pointer, please indicate on
         22  the large map the location of the Cancari road.
         23       A.   The Cancari road is located south of Zvornik
         24  again.  It is a valley which is quite long.  It's a
         25  10-kilometre-long valley entering this area, and there

          1  is a possibility to exit this valley also, to hit
          2  another road that then goes through Sekovici to Tisce,
          3  or then going north one can go towards Zvornik.
          4            This is a difficult area to access which is
          5  possible with normal vehicles.  It would not be the
          6  choice of a truck driver.  The entrance of the valley
          7  is just at the Drina, where the Drina River is, and it
          8  is a main road that goes from Vlasenica to Zvornik.
          9       Q.   Can you describe the terrain, please.
         10       A.   It's a long and narrow valley at some point
         11  but larger at other ones.  It's an area completely
         12  destroyed also.  Again, it's an area which was in the
         13  majority populated by Muslims, but not only probably.
         14  Combat also has taken place in all this area in 1993
         15  and 1994, so the destruction here is a mixture of
         16  dynamiting houses and combat activities.
         17            This is the main cluster of graves that we
         18  have.  There are 12 secondary graves along a stretch of
         19  eight kilometres of dirt road there.
         20       Q.   All right.  Mr. Ruez, continue with your
         21  presentation about the secondary graves at Cancari
         22  road.
         23       A.   Exhibit 169/A is a map of the area that spots
         24  the precise location of all these graves, starting from
         25  the east to the west with number 1 through number 12.

          1            I show on the map the location of the site
          2  number 1, and you can see that then the road heads
          3  north.  This one will not appear on the next exhibit
          4  which is an overview of all the sites, with the
          5  exception of number 1 which will be out of the frame of
          6  the aerial imagery.
          7            The next exhibit is a photograph of that same
          8  road, so a mosaic of several pictures to reconstruct
          9  the road.  I will have to flip it through the ELMO,
         10  starting from west towards the east, in reverse order.
         11  So Cancari 12, and continuing along the road.
         12       Q.   Mr. Ruez --
         13       A.   The site number 1 will be just at the bottom
         14  corner of the last photograph on the right.
         15       Q.   So the record is clear, "CR" is the code
         16  designation for Cancari road.
         17       A.   Absolutely.
         18       Q.   And the numbers designate the specific
         19  secondary mass grave sites.
         20       A.   Yes.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, our next exhibit
         22  is going to be a film.  It will be approximately ten
         23  minutes.  It's Prosecutor's Exhibit 169/2.
         24       Q.   Mr. Ruez, would you explain to the Judges
         25  what they will be seeing on this particular film, and

          1  the purpose for showing it.
          2       A.   Yes.  In reality there is not much to be seen
          3  on that film, and this is the purpose of showing it.
          4  The film was filmed while we were conducting the
          5  exhumation -- I mean, Professor Richard Wright was
          6  conducting the exhumation at the Cancari 12 site.  We
          7  used the opportunity of his presence to pinpoint for
          8  him the location of all the other sites.  So I used the
          9  opportunity to take very brief video footage of all
         10  these sites, with the exception of 12 where the
         11  exhumation was ongoing, in order to show how the
         12  terrain looks like after a couple of years of
         13  vegetation growing in these places.  So in reality
         14  there will be nothing to be seen on the film aside from
         15  vegetation, but this is the interest of the film.
         16       Q.   The vegetation shows that -- conceals, in
         17  fact, the --
         18       A.   Shows that it is very well-concealed, and if
         19  someone has not very, very precise information -- in
         20  fact, from an aerial photograph there is nearly no way
         21  that you would find the place except if he knows where
         22  he dug the hole.
         23       Q.   All right.
         24            MR. HARMON:  If we could dim the lights,
         25  please, and if we could show Prosecutor's Exhibit

          1  169/2.
          2       Q.   Mr. Ruez, please feel free to make comments
          3  during the transmission of this film.
          4                 [Videotape played]
          5       A.   So this site is the site of Cancari 11.  The
          6  site, in fact, was just at the right when I started to
          7  film, and here I'm doing kind of a 360-degree tour.
          8  Just at the left here is a Muslim cemetery.  The film
          9  is dated summer 1998.  So the location of the grave is
         10  just there, right in the middle of the picture.  No one
         11  would notice any difference in the soil if he would not
         12  know that there is a grave here.  And here I'm zooming
         13  on a few other gravestones.  So here the site has been
         14  obviously created on purpose in a former cemetery.  No
         15  steady shot of the camera, I'm sorry.  This is why the
         16  picture is moving so much.
         17            This is now the Cancari 10 site which is
         18  here, just in front.  No difference with the rest.  And
         19  here you can see the shape of the houses in this
         20  environment.
         21            Now the site number 9.  Site number 9 is now
         22  here where these -- just here, where these white stones
         23  are, just alongside the road.
         24            Now Cancari 8.  Cancari 8 is just here where
         25  these bushes are visible.  The only thing visible are

          1  bushes.
          2            Cancari 7 is just in front of a destroyed
          3  house.  Woodcutters were operating there and strangely
          4  never dumped any wood there, on the site, but always
          5  just next to it.  That could give the feeling that they
          6  knew what was there.  Just here.  A very, very shallow
          7  grave; less than 10 centimetres of soil on top of the
          8  bodies, before reaching the bodies, the body parts.
          9  That's another view of the same site.  Just in between
         10  this destroyed vehicle and the house in the background
         11  is the site.
         12            Now site number 6 which is just where the
         13  film starts.  Here, as you can see, the valley is
         14  larger than in the other locations.  It's a very
         15  deserted area; no one was living there during the
         16  years.  Also, there are a certain number of mine signs
         17  in this area, either for real mines or for deterrence
         18  of people to wander in the area.  The signs I'm talking
         19  about are generally pots that are hanging on branches
         20  and that indicates to locals that there are potential
         21  mines around the houses.
         22            Site number 5 is just here where this group
         23  of bushes are, just alongside the road, just where
         24  these bushes are growing on top of it.  One indication
         25  of the presence of a grave is sometimes the vegetation

          1  grows faster than on other spots, but it's not enough
          2  for someone to be able to be sure that there is
          3  something there.
          4            Number 4, that is very nearby number 5 and
          5  has been fully exhumed.  It's just here.  So here you
          6  have some indication still because -- there are some
          7  spots where there is no vegetation, but even that would
          8  not be enough to indicate the presence of a grave.
          9  Someone would not know precisely where to find it.
         10  This is the site.
         11            This is now the Cancari 3 site.  Sorry.  It's
         12  this one that has been fully exhumed, Cancari 3.  And
         13  here is the site, just where the camera showed it now.
         14  So just on the opposite side of this dirt road is the
         15  site.
         16            Now it's Cancari 2, but it's even more
         17  concealed because it's even a little side path that
         18  cuts the main path, so this one is even more
         19  concealed.  And the site is in front of this house, on
         20  the other side where the logs are, on the left of the
         21  picture.  I don't film it straight but at that time I
         22  thought it was another place.
         23            Here you have an example of a pot hanging on
         24  a branch.  That would deter any local to approach this
         25  place.  It might be a genuine mine threat.  There are

          1  many of these pots in the area; I just filmed a few as
          2  an example.  That's a way to indicate the presence of
          3  mines.  Putting stones like a pyramid is also a way to
          4  indicate mines.
          5            This is not a site.  This is a mosque.  It
          6  was a mosque.  That was the minaret before it was
          7  apparently fully destroyed.  That is to indicate that,
          8  indeed, it was a Muslim-populated area.  There is no
          9  randomness also in the choice of these locations.  The
         10  fact that they are all Muslim villages is certainly not
         11  a random fact.
         12            The last, the first or the last, is Cancari
         13  1, just in front here, in the fork of the main path and
         14  the subpath.
         15            MR. HARMON:
         16       Q.   Mr. Ruez, now would you take us through the
         17  before-and-after images --
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   -- of Cancari 1 through Cancari 12.
         20       A.   The first site, Cancari 1, it will -- for all
         21  these series of photographs, they will all be framed
         22  between 7 September 1995 and 7 [sic] October 1995.  So
         23  the first one, the Cancari 1 site --
         24       Q.   Mr. Ruez, let me again correct the record.
         25  They will be framed between 7 September 1995 and, the

          1  record says, "7 October 1995."  Do you mean 2 October?
          2       A.   Yes, 2 October.
          3       Q.   All right.  Thank you.
          4       A.   So the photograph dated 7 September 1995,
          5  where the site Cancari 1 will be created later, so
          6  Exhibit 169/4 --
          7       Q.   And the previous exhibit is 169/3 that's on
          8  the ELMO --
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   -- the "before" picture.
         11       A.   Correct.  It shows the same area but with a
         12  date of October 2nd, and it shows clearly the area of
         13  the disturbance.  This site was probed.  All of them
         14  have been probed.  Some of them have even been probed
         15  twice; once when we found them and another later on by
         16  Professor Wright to ensure that the assessment is 100
         17  per cent certain.
         18       Q.   When you say "probed," the conclusions of the
         19  probing was that there were multiple human remains
         20  found at each of these locations.
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   Thank you.
         23       A.   I could have also shown you photographs of
         24  these remains for each of these sites, but it would
         25  have been much more lengthy, and you will see more of

          1  these things later on anyhow so it would have been a
          2  bit useless.
          3            Exhibit 169/5 is a photograph dated 7
          4  September 1995 showing where the Cancari 2 site will be
          5  created, and the photograph dated October 2nd shows
          6  where the site, indeed, is, just in front of a
          7  destroyed house, so quite a way from the main road.
          8  Here the concealment effort has been even pushed
          9  further.
         10            Exhibit 169/7 is a photograph dated 7
         11  September showing the location where the Cancari 3 site
         12  will be created, and Exhibit 169/8 shows the location
         13  of this site.  It is marked on the picture "CR-3,"
         14  where the disturbed soil is visible.
         15            Exhibit 169/9, a photograph dated 7 September
         16  1995, and this is the area where, at 2nd October 1995,
         17  there will be present two sites: Cancari 4 and Cancari
         18  5.  This is the Exhibit 169/10, a photograph dated
         19  October 2nd, with two areas of clear disturbed soil;
         20  probed and confirmed secondary mass grave sites.
         21            Exhibit 169/11, a photograph dated 7
         22  September.  Again, on the titles, the names change.
         23  This one is Redzici.  The reason is that the closest
         24  village is Redzici.  We call all this valley Cancari.
         25            The next photograph shows the location of the

          1  CR-6 site in this area, and that will be Exhibit
          2  169/12, a photograph dated 2 October, showing the spot
          3  where the Cancari 6 grave has been created between 7
          4  September and 7 October -- 2 October 1995.
          5       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, let me just stop you on that
          6  image right there.  Are there traces of heavy
          7  engineering equipment being used at this location in
          8  this image?
          9       A.   Yes, definitely.  All these traces of
         10  disturbance are not done by manual digging but by heavy
         11  equipment.
         12       Q.   All right.
         13       A.   Exhibit 169/13 is a photograph dated 7
         14  September and shows the site number 7 just in between a
         15  destroyed house and the road, nearby a destroyed
         16  vehicle.
         17            And 2 October 1995 is the Exhibit 169/14.
         18  The site is marked on the photograph and the vehicle
         19  that you could see on the film dated 1998 was already
         20  there in 1995.  I'm going to circle it on the picture
         21  [marks].  This gives you another reference of objects
         22  viewed from the air.
         23            Exhibit 169/15 is a photograph dated October
         24  2nd.  There is no "before" shot for this one, not in my
         25  possession at this moment anyhow.  It shows where the

          1  Cancari 8 site has been created.  A photograph dated 7
          2  September certainly exists -- I don't have it in my
          3  possession -- but it would show that there was nothing
          4  there at that time.  It was created between 7 September
          5  and 2 October.
          6            Exhibit 169/16 is a photograph dated 7
          7  September 1995.  The area where something will appear
          8  is where I will put a circle [marks], more or less in
          9  the centre of this picture dated 7 September.
         10            We have another one dated 27 September 1995.
         11  That is the Exhibit 169/17.  That shows that in between
         12  7 September and 27 September 1995 an open pit was
         13  created on that spot.  You can clearly see the open
         14  trench here which is not filled yet.
         15            Exhibit 169/18 will show that between 27
         16  September 1995 and 2 October 1995 the grave was filled,
         17  and this is Exhibit 169/18, where now you can see the
         18  disturbed soil.  That is, in fact, an indication that
         19  the trench has been filled with one, two, or three
         20  truckloads of human remains and then closed.
         21       Q.   That's site CR-9.
         22       A.   This is the site CR-9.
         23            The next exhibit is 169/19.  It will show
         24  where the CR-10 site has been created.  It will be just
         25  in front of the destroyed house, on the opposite side

          1  of the path.  I will circle it [marks].  This will be
          2  the location.
          3            Exhibit 169/20 is a photograph dated 27
          4  September 1995 and shows that, indeed, between 7
          5  September and 27 September, an open trench has been
          6  created on that spot.
          7            Exhibit 169/21 is a photograph dated 2
          8  October 1995.  It clearly shows that between 27
          9  September and 2 October the site has been filled with
         10  human remains.  This is CR-10 site.
         11            Exhibit 169/22 is dated 7 September 1995.
         12  There is on this one still nothing to be seen.  I'm
         13  marking with a circle the area where something will be
         14  visible [marks].
         15            The 27 September 1995, this will be the
         16  Exhibit 169/23, is a photograph dated 27 September 1995
         17  showing that in between the 7th and the 27th, again an
         18  open trench has been created here.  It is clearly
         19  visible on the photograph [marks].  I'm circling this
         20  open trench [marks].
         21            The Exhibit 169/24 shows that between 27
         22  September and the 2nd of October, this open pit has
         23  been used and filled with what we know are multiple
         24  human remains.  This is the site CR-11.
         25            Exhibit 169/25 is a photograph dated 7

          1  September, and it shows the terrain where later on also
          2  a trench will be opened in the area I have just circled
          3  [marks].
          4            The next photograph is Exhibit 169/26, dated
          5  27 September 1995, and shows the creation of a trench
          6  [marks].
          7       Q.   Again on that particular image, Mr. Ruez, are
          8  there traces of heavy construction equipment evident?
          9       A.   Yes.  You can see large tyre tracks which
         10  most probably had been made by an excavator on wheels,
         11  UNT-type, UNT machine.
         12            The following exhibit is 169/27 and is a
         13  photograph dated 7 -- 2nd October 1995, showing that
         14  the trench that existed the 27th has been filled
         15  between the 27th September and the 2nd of October.
         16  This site has been fully exhumed in 1998 and
         17  contained -- I don't have a precise number in my head,
         18  but --
         19       Q.   You don't have to worry about that,
         20  Mr. Ruez.  There will be subsequent testimony about the
         21  number of bodies that were exhumed from that particular
         22  site.
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Let me turn, Mr. Ruez, because our next
         25  exhibit is going to be a film, Prosecutor's Exhibit

          1  169/28 --
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
          3  perhaps we need to have a break, because to continue
          4  until 2.30 without a break, I think, it will be too
          5  much for the interpreters.  So maybe we should have a
          6  15-minute break now, and then we'll go on until 2.30.
          7                 --- Recess taken at 1.50 p.m.
          8                 --- On resuming at 2.07 p.m.
          9                 [The accused entered court]
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         11  please continue.
         12            MR. HARMON:
         13       Q.   Mr. Ruez, we're now going to see a film,
         14  Prosecutor's Exhibit 169/28.  And as we usually do,
         15  will you please inform the Judges and the public
         16  gallery what will be seen on this particular piece of
         17  evidence.
         18       A.   This film will show the exhumation in
         19  Cancari 12 site.  It was the first full exhumation of a
         20  secondary site, so it will be only an example of that
         21  kind of activity that we will present to you visually
         22  in film format.
         23            MR. HARMON:  If we could reduce the lights,
         24  please, and if we could play Prosecutor's Exhibit
         25  169/28, please.

          1                 [Videotape played]
          2            MR. HARMON:
          3       Q.   Mr. Ruez, please feel free to comment during
          4  the course of this viewing.  I think we have a re-run.
          5  Is this a film we have previously seen or is this --
          6       A.   No, this should be the good one.
          7            We initially saw the location of the site,
          8  and this is the surroundings.  This is a film that I
          9  had filmed at the time of the exhumation.
         10            This is the path leading towards Cancari 11
         11  and the exit of a valley.
         12            This is a 360-degree tour of the environment
         13  of this site.  There is a mixed resettling there.  Some
         14  Serbs were settling in the area in 1998, and now
         15  Muslims are returning in the area.
         16            These are two surveyors who are, in fact,
         17  creating a very precise map of the grave area, and you
         18  will see them later on plotting every single object
         19  inside the grave.
         20            This is Richard Wright seen from the back,
         21  and the little backhoe is now scooping the soil in
         22  order to identify the perimeter of the grave.  That's
         23  the first activity that Professor Wright does on a
         24  grave site.
         25            So the first part of the process is to scoop

          1  the surface.  At one point, we'll see that there is a
          2  difference of colour in the soil.  And here Richard
          3  Wright just marked this, and now he's putting flags on
          4  this perimeter.  Here you can see on the left and the
          5  right there is already a difference.
          6            This is now making the tour of the grave.
          7            This is already the end of one side of the
          8  grave.  Due to the way the digging machine initially
          9  created that grave, in fact, there were remains beyond
         10  the initial separation line of the two types of soils.
         11  This gives you already here the beginning of the shape
         12  of the grave.  The excavator is used only during the
         13  hardest work, but after that, everything turns manual.
         14            The blank is normally -- no, it's not
         15  finished yet.  It's a normal blank, because we changed
         16  days.
         17            So here they are doing the tour of the grave,
         18  and all the mound in the middle is already the content
         19  of the grave.  They are currently narrowing down the
         20  size of it, and here the first human remains start to
         21  appear.
         22            Since it is a secondary site, there are very
         23  few complete bodies in it, due to the way the initial
         24  burial was conducted using heavy equipment, then the
         25  unburial using again heavy equipment, then the

          1  transportation in trucks, the dumping from the trucks,
          2  the refilling of the hole with heavy equipment.  All
          3  this destroys the bodies under.  You end up only with a
          4  mixture of body parts.
          5            This was a -- this is a hand popping out of a
          6  mound of soil, which is now being protected with
          7  plastic.
          8            These are skulls popping out of the soil.
          9            Here is a shoe.
         10            Here you can see a colleague using a metal
         11  detector in order to find shell casings mixed with the
         12  bodies.  As we said, we had collected an amount of
         13  shell casings on every execution site, and now here the
         14  aim is to collect also shell casings.  The aim is then,
         15  later on, to compare these shell casings and make
         16  connections between execution site, primary mass grave,
         17  and later on secondary mass grave.
         18            Here the members of the exhumation team are
         19  on top of the grave, and they are cleaning the surface
         20  of it.
         21            This is the first shell casing found.  Due to
         22  the style of the executions, the shell casings were
         23  mixed with the bodies, so then when the bodies were
         24  taken away, the shell casings were taken away as well.
         25            Professor Wright will be able to provide you

          1  with detailed explanations regarding his methodology,
          2  but you can already observe that this is real
          3  archaeological work.  The aim is not to pull the bodies
          4  outside of the soil but to make sure that nothing is
          5  missed and every part is properly preserved.
          6            This is how the grave looks like once the
          7  surface of it has already been cleaned.  This site
          8  probably contained -- I mean the measurement unit for
          9  this site is truckload, so this would probably be two
         10  truckloads or three truckloads.  Professor Wright might
         11  have more details on this.
         12            Every evening the site is covered, filmed,
         13  refilmed the next morning to ensure that nothing
         14  happened during the night, and it is guarded during the
         15  night.
         16            It's not finished.
         17            This is again the hand that was protected
         18  with the plastic bag.  That day they continued the work
         19  around it.
         20            The little noise means a positive reaction to
         21  metal.
         22            This is the grave filmed from above.  There
         23  are often changes in the concentration of all these
         24  body parts probably linked with dumping from the truck
         25  which transported all these remains from the primary

          1  site to this secondary one.  Just for an indication,
          2  these bodies are coming from the Branjevo Farm.
          3            Once this phase was completed, the process of
          4  retrieving the body parts started.
          5            These are the surveyors plotting every object
          6  before it is retrieved from the grave, every object and
          7  also every body part.
          8            The element missing on the film, for sure, is
          9  the smell.
         10            This is an example of the difficulties these
         11  experts encounter when they have to retrieve body parts
         12  in such a mixture of bodies.  I made this piece short
         13  but it lasted probably an hour, to retrieve just this
         14  one part; the problem being to follow the part to make
         15  sure that it won't get disconnected with what is
         16  attached to it in the process of retrieving the body.
         17  It was a leg.  It took them a long time to retrieve
         18  this part.
         19            This is three years after the events and one
         20  can see that some of the parts are still
         21  well-preserved.
         22            I don't think that was supposed to be the end
         23  but -- it was not the end.  Could we be informed about
         24  the reason why it's finished.
         25            THE REGISTRAR:  I spoke with the technical

          1  booth and they said that was all that was on the tape.
          2            THE WITNESS:  Okay.  No problem.
          3            MR. HARMON:  We can raise the lights.  We've
          4  finished with the exhibit.
          5            Mr. Ruez, I have concluded my examination.
          6            Mr. President, Judge Wald, that concludes the
          7  presentation of Mr. Ruez on direct examination.  Thank
          8  you.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So we will
         10  resume perhaps tomorrow with the cross-examination of
         11  Mr. Ruez.  For today we cannot continue.
         12            We will meet again tomorrow, here, at 9.30.
         13                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
         14                 2.30 p.m., to be reconvened on Friday,
         15                 the 26th day of May, 2000, at 9.30 a.m.
