 3                          [The witness entered court]
 4                          --- Upon commencing at 9.35 a.m.
 5                          [The accused entered court]
 6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good morning, ladies and
 7    gentlemen; good morning to the technical booth, to the interpreters.  I
 8    see they're all there.  Good morning to the court reporters, legal
 9    assistants, Madam Lawyer, Mr. Harmon, Mr. McCloskey, Mr. Cayley; good
10    morning, Mr. Petrusic and Mr. Visnjic; good morning, General Krstic; good
11    morning, Witness.  Mr. Richard Butler, good morning to you.
12            We are all assembled to continue with the proceedings.  Let me
13    remind you are continuing under oath.  You will still be answering
14    questions put to you by Mr. McCloskey.
15            Mr. McCloskey, your witness.  You may continue.
16            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
17                          WITNESS:  RICHARD BUTLER [Resumed]
18                          Examined by Mr. McCloskey: [Cont'd]
19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I will start off by reminding myself and
20    Mr. Butler about the pace, that we need to keep it slow and steady.  I
21    believe we left off -- if you could put OTP Exhibit 424 on the ELMO.  That
22    is the list of some of the main players from the VRS Main Staff, some of
23    the units of the Main Staff, and some of the Ministry of Interior people.
24       Q.   And if you could just start from the top and give us, like you did
25    yesterday, just a little background on each of the folks and where they

 1    fit in but brief, thank you.
 2       A.   The first name on the list, General Ratko Mladic, of course, is
 3    the Commander of the Main Staff of the VRS.  We see him in that context.
 4    He shows up at the Srebrenica area on 10 July 1995.  We see his presence
 5    in Potocari.  We see his presence up and around the road along the
 6    Bratunac-Konjevic Polje highway through 12 July and 13 July.
 7            The next person, Lieutenant Colonel General Milan Gvero.
 8    He is the Main Staff Assistant Commander for Morale, Legal, and Religious
 9    Affairs.  He is referred to in several messages on both the 8th of July,
10    1995 and on the 10th of July, 1995 related to Srebrenica.  We don't have
11    any physical sightings of him in and around the area.
12            Colonel Radislav Jankovic is an officer assigned to the Main
13    Intelligence Administration of the Main Staff of the VRS.  We note his
14    presence in the meetings between the VRS, the Dutch, and Muslim
15    representatives in Potocari on the 11th and the 12th.  We further note his
16    involvement dealing with the issue of the transportation of the Muslim
17    population from Potocari, and we'll see his involvement also in the
18    following days, the 13th and the 14th, in dealing with issues pertaining
19    to wounded Muslims held or at the Bratunac military -- or at the medical
20    facility.  I'm sorry.
21            The next individual is Colonel Ljubisa Beara.  He is the head of
22    the Main Staff, Main Security Administration.  We see his involvement
23    starting as early as the 13th and the 14th and subsequent days.  He's
24    responsible for many of the aspects of the movements of male Muslims out
25    of the Bratunac area where they were held to the main execution sites in

 1    the zone of the Zvornik Infantry Brigade.  Of note, he is involved in a
 2    rather important conversation with General Krstic pertaining to that issue
 3    on the morning of 15 July.
 4            General-Major Miletic is the chief of operations during this
 5    period of the Main Staff.  We don't see him physically noted in
 6    Srebrenica.  However, his name comes up in several references as the Main
 7    Staff in the Drina Corps deal with the Muslim column which is now fighting
 8    its way from Srebrenica towards the Tuzla area, and in several instances
 9    on the 12th, 13th, and 14th, he will be in contact with those units to
10    determine what the military situation is.
11            Turning to the next name, Milorad Pelemis, he is the Commander of
12    the 10th Sabotage Unit or 10th Diversionary Unit.  As you're aware from
13    previous testimony, that unit was involved with the executions at the
14    Branjevo Military Farm.
15            The next unit, the 65th Protection Regiment -- the Military Police
16    Battalion is the sub-unit -- there are two names.  The first one is
17    Lieutenant Colonel Milomir Savcic.  He is the Commander of the 65th
18    Protection Regiment, which is not in and of itself subordinate to the
19    Drina Corps but is directly subordinate to the VRS Main Staff.  He -- one
20    of his units is the Military Police Battalion, which we'll talk about
21    next, but his physical presence is noted on the 13th by one survivor who
22    notes that he was interviewed or interrogated by a man named Cica, which
23    is the nickname for Colonel Savcic.
24            The next individual is Major Zoran Milanovic.  He is the Commander
25    of the Military Police Battalion of the 65th Protection Regiment.  So he

 1    is directly subordinate to Colonel Savcic.  That Military Police
 2    Battalion, in general, and Major Malanic, in particular, show up on the
 3    12th and the 13th of July, 1995, first involved in the apprehension or
 4    detention of Dutch UN soldiers escorting the convoys out past Nova Kasaba,
 5    and later his units are responsible for guarding collected Muslim
 6    prisoners from the column on the football field at Nova Kasaba.
 7            The next series of individuals belong to the Ministry of the
 8    Interior or what we call the Ministry of the Interior Special Police
 9    Units.
10            The first individual is named Dusko Jevtic, nickname of Stalin.
11    He is seen in Potocari on 12 July 1995.  We believe he's one of the
12    company commanders of the MUP Reserve Battalion that deployed to that area
13    initially as part of the Drina Corps operation.
14            The next name is Lieutenant Colonel Ljubisa Borovcanin.  He is the
15    Deputy Commander of the MUP Special Police Brigade headquartered in Janja,
16    just south of Bijeljina.  His physical presence is noted in Potocari on
17    the 13th of July, and we see him frequently in the Petrusic video as he
18    filmed the scenes there in Potocari on 13 July.  He's also further
19    referenced in an interview with Petrovic, who wrote an interview with a
20    Belgrade magazine pertaining to that long video stretch.
21            We also see Colonel Borovcanin active that same day, on the 13th,
22    up and down the road from Bratunac to Konjevic Polje as he's essentially
23    visiting the army troops and his MUP troops that are along that road.
24            The last name from the MUP is Mandeljev Mane Dzuric who is a
25    Battalion Commander in that same special police brigade.  His physical

 1    presence is noted in many aspects accompanying Colonel Borovcanin on the
 2    13th of July.  We also see several references in the intercepts to
 3    operations with MUP units which we believe are under his command.
 4       Q.   Mr. Butler, I just want to correct one thing for the record.
 5    Under Mandeljev Mane Dzuric, I believe we have spelled his name
 6    incorrectly.  We have left out the diacritic on the "D" there.  There
 7    should be a slash across that "D", just for the record.
 8       A.   The last two individuals, also members of the Ministry of the
 9    Interior, however, they're municipal police individuals.  They're not
10    associated with the Special Police Brigade.  The first one is Dragomir
11    Vasic, who is the chief of the Zvornik police department.  And when I say
12    that, as the police department, that is not just encompassing the actual
13    city of Zvornik, but it's the general CSB of Zvornik.  It's a regional
14    police area which includes Srebrenica.
15            And the final name is Mane Dzuric who is the Deputy Police Chief
16    of that same area.
17       Q.   Can you tell us a little bit more about the difference between the
18    MUP Special Police and the MUP Municipal Police, especially as it may
19    regard to that law we reviewed yesterday about using MUP outfits in
20    combat?
21       A.   Dealing with the municipal police aspect first, their functions
22    and roles are traditional police and law enforcement type of functions:
23    investigations, traffic control, criminal protection, those type of
24    aspects.  At times, those municipal police officers are involved in combat
25    operations, but very rarely and not as very large, organised units per

 1    se.  We will actually see as the heart of this operation, in the context
 2    of it we will see municipal police units in the combat operations on the
 3    14th and 15th in the zone of the Zvornik Brigade as the units tried to get
 4    every available man who could carry a gun into the battlefield.
 5            The MUP Special Police Brigade is more organised as a military
 6    fighting unit in the form of regional battalions.  Again, while they have
 7    traditional police functions, it is a higher-level organisation that
 8    operates more as a paramilitary or military force.  And when you look back
 9    at the historical context of the war, in many aspects during major
10    military operations, these battalions were involved to supplement the army
11    forces on the ground at critical points in the battlefield.  So the
12    Special Police Brigade as organised fought more as a military force than 
13    as a law enforcement entity.
14       Q.   You mentioned the term paramilitary.  Now, there is perhaps an
15    historical Bosnian connotation to this term, paramilitary.  Does that
16    apply, can you tell us -- clear up that issue for us about how
17    paramilitary is used in Bosnia and whether the MUP units resemble that in
18    any way?
19       A.   The MUP units that we're talking about, the Special Police
20    Brigade, are bona fide members of the armed forces of the Republika
21    Srpska.  They are not in any way a paramilitary irregular formation that
22    is normally associated within the Bosnian context.  This is a codified
23    legal unit established under the command of the government, the Ministry
24    of the Interior to be exact, and by law it is a part of the armed forces.
25    So it is an organisation that operates within the framework of the RS law.

 1            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  So what do you call a codified legal
 2    unit?
 3       A.   In my sense when I discussed the issue of a paramilitary, that is
 4    a unit that is operating outside the legal framework of the laws which
 5    establish the army, the laws which establish the military interior units,
 6    and things of that nature.  Paramilitaries within that context of the
 7    Bosnian conflict were operating outside of that law and outside of
 8    military control.  In this aspect, in 1995, with the Ministry of the
 9    Interior units, they're operating within the context of the legal
10    framework of the government of Republika Srpska.
11            JUDGE RIAD:  Which means that the paramilitary are not under
12    military control, they're on their own?
13       A.   In the period context of 1995, sir, there were no paramilitaries
14    as we understand them in the previous course of the years.  I don't feel
15    I'm qualified to be able to answer the issue of paramilitaries in 1992 and
16    1993.  That's not necessarily my field of expertise, sir.
17            JUDGE RIAD:  1995?
18       A.   In 1995, sir, relative to Srebrenica, we see no activity which in
19    any way, shape, or form we can say belongs to any paramilitary formation.
20    All of the formations that were involved in that operation were under the
21    command and control of either the army forces or other entities of the
22    Republika Srpska government.  We don't see any formations of that nature
23    operating outside of that control.
24            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
25            MR. McCLOSKEY:

 1       Q.   You've reviewed many of the statements in this case, and some of
 2    the witnesses make reference to Arkan's Tigers and other paramilitaries
 3    that became infamous in 1992 and 1993.  In your view of the materials,
 4    were you able to substantiate the presence of any of these infamous
 5    outfits?
 6       A.   No, sir.  Looking at the volumes of material, documents, orders,
 7    things of that nature, I'm not able to substantiate any presence of any of
 8    those criminal organisations or paramilitaries at Srebrenica in 1995.
 9       Q.   Okay.  Let's go on to a different area now that we've set the
10    scene.  Let's go to the period of time between March of 1995 and July,
11    early July right before the operation at the enclave occurred.  Can you
12    give us a brief background of the military situation of those months, and
13    then we'll get into some of the particular documents that you have
14    referred to.
15       A.   In the larger context of early 1995, to set the framework for the
16    military operation, the general military strategy of the Republika Srpska
17    at this point in time is best described as being on the strategic
18    defence.  The government of the entity for the most part had achieved all
19    of the territorial gains that it had wanted and was, for the most part,
20    conducting military operations, not for the gaining of additional
21    territory, but to set the framework for a negotiated peace which would
22    allow them to achieve their war aims.
23            They realised in the context of looking at the material that came
24    out at that time, that 1995 would be for them a decisive year in the
25    conflict.  They were just coming off of, in the January and February time

 1    frame, a regional cease-fire, and from the military and political context
 2    of the Republika Srpska, they realised that the Muslim and Croat
 3    federation forces that were operating in conjunction at the time were
 4    gaining in strength and getting stronger, while their own ability within
 5    the Republika Srpska to get stronger from a military perspective was
 6    limited.  They had essentially reached the end of their manpower pool.
 7    And one of the consistent things throughout the war with the Republika
 8    Srpska that you will note is because of this manpower shortage, units were
 9    rushed from various points on the battlefield, essentially robbing other
10    units, because they did not have enough manpower to meet their military
11    requirements.
12            The enclaves as they existed, particularly in Eastern Bosnia,
13    played into this because of the military forces required to surround and
14    guard the enclaves, because while they existed, they were in no way
15    demilitarised per se, and Muslim forces continued to operate militarily
16    out of the enclave.  As such, the Serbs, or the Republika Srpska army,
17    felt a compelling need to continue to have to maintain units around the
18    perimeters of the enclave, those units that were needed in other places on
19    the battlefield.
20            Coupled with these events, in the spring of 1995, the Republika
21    Srpska army received very clear indications that the HV, the Croatian
22    army, and Croatia proper would enter the war sometime that summer, and
23    again we see the early manifestations of that with Croatian military
24    operations in Western Slovenia.
25            So it is within this framework of knowing that 1995 will be a

 1    decisive year, and that they need to be able to get more forces on the
 2    battlefield, that the Republika Srpska Supreme Command issues a series of
 3    military policy documents which outline the war aims and goals of the
 4    Republika Srpska through the end -- or through the fall, at least, of
 5    1995.
 6       Q.   All right.  Well, let's go to that very interesting document.
 7    It's Exhibit 425.  If you could put the front of that on the ELMO.
 8            Tell us just briefly about this front page and then -- and how we
 9    got the document.
10       A.   The front page of this document is the cover letter or memorandum
11    passing it down from the Main Staff to, in this case, the command of the
12    1st Krajina Corps.  This document and many of the other corps-level
13    documents that we'll see in the next few days were obtained when the
14    Office of the Prosecutor searched the offices or searched the headquarters
15    of the 1st Corps of the army of the Republika Srpska pursuant to a search
16    warrant in January of 1998.
17       Q.   All right.  Let's go to the next page then, the -- what is marked
18    as page 2 in the English translation, but it's the first page of this
19    document which is referred to as "Operations Number 7," dated March 8th.
20            Who signs this document?
21       A.   At the end, this document is signed by President Radovan Karadzic
22    as the President of the republic and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed
23    forces.
24       Q.   And before I get into some of the specifics of the document, this
25    is -- Karadzic is doing what in sending out this document and who is he

 1    sending it to?
 2       A.   This document, as you can tell from the paragraph, is essentially
 3    sent out to the major army commands, and within this framework, this is
 4    the political guidance to the army for the broad conduct of the war for
 5    the next series of months.
 6       Q.   All right.  Then I would like to take the Court and counsel to the
 7    section that is specifically addressed to the Drina Corps, and I want to
 8    read briefly a section here because I think it's a very important session,
 9    and I will try to keep it slow.  It's page 10 of the English translation,
10    but it's under the "Drina Corps" heading.  In any other translation you
11    will see that each of the corps has a various heading on it.
12            I will go down to the Drina Corps section:
13            "Enemy breakthroughs along selected operative tactical lines
14    should be prevented by extremely persistent and active defence in
15    cooperation with part of the forces of the SRK on the north-west part of
16    the war front and around the enclaves.  As many enemy forces as possible
17    should be tied down by diversionary and active combat operations on the
18    north-west part of the front using operational and tactical camouflage
19    measures."
20            Now, that part of it, Mr. Butler, that sounds like a military
21    directive in nature; is that correct?
22       A.   That is correct, sir.
23       Q.   Let me continue reading:
24            "While in the direction of the Srebrenica and Zepa enclaves,
25    complete physical separation of Srebrenica from Zepa should be carried out

 1    as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in
 2    the two enclaves.  By planned and well thought out combat operations,
 3    create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further
 4    survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica and Zepa."
 5            There were many thousands of non-military inhabitants of
 6    Srebrenica at the time that this was written, were there not, Mr. Butler?
 7       A.   Yes, sir.
 8       Q.   Now, I want to direct the Court's attention to what is now page
 9    4.  It's under paragraph 6, "Support for Combat Operations".  It's page
10    14 on the English version, paragraph 6.1, "Moral and Psychological
11    Support."
12            Again, I would direct your attention, Mr. Butler, to the fourth
13    paragraph, which should be highlighted.  Can you tell us what this
14    paragraph is basically saying?
15       A.   Essentially what this paragraph is doing is directing the relevant
16    state and military organs, most probably in this aspect the security and
17    intelligence organs, to put together and basically execute a plan to block
18    the UNPROFOR and to block the International Community from adequately
19    supplying the enclaves, to restrict the UN's movement, to essentially
20    create all of the conditions for not supplying the enclaves and to cutting
21    off all physical communication, but more so doing it in a way where it's
22    not seen as obviously obstructing the process.  It's just to tie it up to
23    such a point where -- through almost a bureaucratic process to achieve the
24    military goals.
25            JUDGE WALD:  Could I ask you one question, Mr. Butler?

 1       A.   Yes, ma'am.
 2            JUDGE WALD:  Sorry to interrupt.  I won't do it very often, but it
 3    would help me at this point in light of what you said previously, that is
 4    that the impetus in early 1995 was a shortage on the part of the VRS of
 5    military manpower, as it were, and they didn't -- they were worried about
 6    what was necessary to keep the enclaves -- to keep the military aspects of
 7    the Muslim population in the enclaves.  What would have been the strategic
 8    advantage to them at this point of getting rid of all the civilians by
 9    evacuation or any other possible means?  I mean how would that have fitted
10    into this strategic -- of just getting as happened, just getting rid of
11    all the inhabitants as opposed to just, you know, cutting down the need
12    for military?
13       A.   In theory, if you were to remove the military threat, I couldn't
14    envision a strategic advantage or disadvantage for the RS.  What happens
15    after the fact is by depopulating Srebrenica, in turn, as part of the
16    Dayton agreements, many Serbs displaced from Sarajevo move there, but at
17    this point in time, they don't know that yet.
18            JUDGE WALD:  All right.  Thanks.
19            MR. McCLOSKEY:
20       Q.   Just briefly on that same vein, did Muslim civilians pose a great
21    threat to the Serb army?
22       A.   Muslim civilians per se should not have posed a great threat to
23    the Serb army or the army of Republika Srpska, to be more accurate.
24       Q.   Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to the last page of that document
25    where we have the signature of the Supreme Commander, and I note the point

 1    that says "submit reports as follows."
 2            Now, can you tell us a bit about the reporting requirements that
 3    were in place at the time both in the Main Staff units, the corps units,
 4    and the brigade units, and how seriously that was taken by the VRS?
 5       A.   Just like every military organisation, for the most part there's a
 6    standard reporting process, which is the mechanism by which senior
 7    commanders use to ensure two things.  The first that their orders and
 8    directives are, in fact, being carried out; and second, to keep them aware
 9    of the status of all of their subordinate formations.  Not just from an
10    operational point of view per se, but even for routine administrative
11    things such as fuel usage, logistics, casualties, things of that nature.
12            So when you look at these reporting requirements, they are, in
13    fact, codified throughout the entire VRS.  Battalions had a fixed
14    reporting chain to the brigade levels; the brigade level had a fixed
15    reporting chain up to the corps command; the corps command had a fixed
16    reporting chain to the Main Staff; and the Main Staff had a fixed
17    reporting chain and network to the supreme command, the Ministry of
18    Defence.  So this was more or less an unbroken chain where information is
19    passed from lower to higher so the decision-makers in the army at the
20    political level could make, you know, the best informed decisions that
21    they had to.
22       Q.   All right.  Let's go on to the implementation of this directive,
23    and our next exhibit, 426.  Could you just tell us what this is and what
24    it's about?
25       A.   This is Main Staff -- this is, of course, the cover letter, but

 1    this is, in fact, Main Staff directive 7-1, again to the command of the
 2    1st Krajina Corps, a document that we had when we seized the documents
 3    from the corps.
 4            This document, for the most part, provides amplifying and, in some
 5    cases, more specific information based on the strategic vision as outlined
 6    in operations directive 7.  In effect, this is amplifying instructions.
 7       Q.   And this is signed by General Mladic.
 8       A.   In this instance, the cover letter is signed by General
 9    Milovanovic, the Deputy Chief of the Main Staff.
10       Q.   But at the end of the --
11       A.   At the end of the document it is, in fact, signed by
12    General Mladic.
13       Q.   Okay.  What's the first -- can you tell us briefly how the Drina
14    Corps is responding, how you can tell they're responding from the
15    documents to these two directives?
16       A.   As based on these broad directives and the more specified ones
17    coming from the Main Staff, the next series of that is at the point of
18    time of execution, the Drina Corps itself will put together the series of
19    operations orders and operations plans to do that.
20            The first manifestation that we see in that is a series of
21    military operations which occur in early June of 1995, one of them that
22    results in the capture of a UN checkpoint south of Srebrenica and the
23    takeover of Zeleni Jadar.  Those military operations in June create the
24    conditions for the next stage, which will be larger scale military
25    operations against the Srebrenica enclave in July.

 1       Q.   And could you tell us the first document that you have that helps
 2    us actually see this process happening?
 3       A.   The first document that we have is a 2 July preparatory order from
 4    the command of the Drina Corps to units of the Drina Corps, instructing
 5    them to start conducting the planning aspects and the gathering of the
 6    necessary military forces for military operations in the zone of the Drina
 7    Corps.
 8       Q.   Could you take that July 2nd document, Exhibit 427, and put it on
 9    the ELMO.
10            This is a document that is by Major General Milenko Zivanovic as
11    Commander of the Drina Corps; is that correct?
12       A.   Yes, sir.
13       Q.   And paragraph 2 on the front page it says:
14            "Based on directives OP number 7 and 7/1 of the RS army."
15       A.   Yes, sir.
16       Q.   Those are the two directives that we've just heard about.  Now,
17    since this is the first document we have from the Drina Corps, can you
18    tell us about, up in the left-hand corner, the numbering system?  We see a
19    numbering system that says "Strictly confidential, 01/04-156."  What
20    significance is that number as you've been able to make out in your
21    study?
22       A.   In this aspect, the way that the series of numbers worked was that
23    the first series of numbers, in this case 01/04, designated the staff
24    organ that was primarily responsible for the creation of the document.
25    The second number, -156, is a broad category of documents or orders which

 1    it is related to.
 2            Based on that 156 number, it's rather -- since we don't have a
 3    complete set, obviously, it's hard to go back and determine what the
 4    parent document is, whether there's something or whether 156 is, in fact,
 5    the operations directive 7-1.
 6            The last number, the suffix number, indicates that it is the first
 7    order or directive of that series.  Going back to the prefix number, and
 8    again based on a very limited amount of documents, the 01 through 04
 9    categorisations generally refer to documents that come out of the
10    commander shop, the Chief of Staff shop, or the operations division.
11       Q.   Can you, by knowing that specific prefix number 01, identify
12    whether or not the Commander -- the person was a Commander at the time or
13    Chief of Staff or some other job?
14       A.   Because we have so few of the documents and the documents that we
15    do have with this aspect on the signature don't show a pattern, I can't
16    say that 01, in fact, equals Commander in the sense of the documents or
17    that 02 equals the Chief of Staff or 03 equals somebody else.  It is
18    close, but by virtue of the lack of number of documents, I can't say that
19    definitively.
20       Q.   All right.  We'll get to that issue again when we get to some
21    other documents.
22            Now, this document 427, where would the Chief of Staff -- what
23    kind of role would he be playing in these initial planning stages?
24       A.   Clearly by position as the Chief of Staff, being the individual
25    who manages and coordinates the entire planning process, he would be

 1    deeply involved in this process, first with respect to the Drina Corps
 2    staff process of putting together the order; and secondly, in the act of
 3    querying of the units involved to determine whether they would be able to
 4    fulfil the requirements of the order.  Within a staff and planning
 5    context, it doesn't make sense to issue orders to units without first
 6    ensuring that they're able to comply with those directives.  And as you
 7    look down through the preparatory order here, they're starting to alert
 8    units to have resources and personnel made available.
 9       Q.   And on page 2 of that document, paragraph 4, the deadline for
10    forming all above-mentioned units is 2 July 1995?
11       A.   That is correct, sir.
12       Q.   And the forward command post is to be in operation on 4 July
13    1995.  That's in paragraph 5.
14       A.   Yes, sir.
15       Q.   Okay.  Now can we get to Exhibit 428, the actual formal operation
16    plan for the takedown of the Srebrenica enclave, and can you tell us about
17    that, and what role you would expect General Krstic to have played in that
18    development of this plan?
19       A.   As the preparatory order alerts units to be prepared to conduct
20    combat operations and to make moves accordingly, this is what I refer to
21    as the base operations plan, that being, this is the order which lays out
22    in detail the actual military operation, code named Krivaja-95, against
23    the Srebrenica enclave.  As in the case of the planning or preparatory
24    order, as the Chief of Staff, General Krstic would have been very deeply
25    involved in the actual production of this operations order.  I mean, this

 1    is the manifestation of the entire work of the corps staff.
 2       Q.   In developing this order, would General Krstic and his staff and
 3    General Zivanovic make specific reference to the directive 7, and 7/1?
 4       A.   I don't believe in this order they did specifically.  It might be
 5    in here.  I don't recall at the moment.
 6       Q.   Okay.  Well, let me direct you to page 3 and paragraph 2.
 7       A.   Clearly it, in fact, references both of those orders, yes, sir.
 8       Q.   And does it basically lay out the objective of the plan?
 9       A.   The order does lay out the objective of the plan very clearly.
10       Q.   And what is that?
11       A.   The objective of the plan as written is to reduce the Srebrenica
12    enclave to the physical area of the urban city of Srebrenica.
13       Q.   Okay.  And for the record, I'll just read briefly, beginning in
14    the middle of paragraph 2.  "The task of carrying out offensive activities
15    with free forces deep in the Drina Corps zone as soon as possible in order
16    to split apart the enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica and to reduce them to
17    their urban areas."
18            Now, in your opinion, what does the term "reduce the enclaves to
19    their urban areas" mean?
20       A.   Essentially to push the boundaries of the enclaves to the town of
21    Srebrenica -- or in this case for Srebrenica, to push it into Srebrenica
22    proper, the physical boundaries of the city or town.
23       Q.   And what would that mean where the people of the outer -- of the
24    enclave would be?
25       A.   Essentially for many of the people living in the surrounding area,

 1    they would have either lived under then the occupation of the Republika
 2    Srpska, or they would have been forced to move into the urban area of
 3    Srebrenica.
 4       Q.   And you've seen the July 10th video of all the many hundreds and
 5    hundreds of people crowded into the urban area of Srebrenica on July 10th?
 6       A.   Yes, sir.
 7       Q.   So in your view, do the objectives in this Krivaja-95 plan mirror
 8    any of the objectives of Radovan Karadzic in his directive number 7?
 9       A.   They follow well into sequence essentially what the plan is, is to
10    create the conditions for the UN and the international community to
11    evacuate the enclave.
12       Q.   And I would point out middle of paragraph 4, page 3, under
13    "objective":  "By a surprise attack, to separate and reduce in size the
14    Srebrenica and Zepa enclaves, to improve the tactical position of the
15    forces in the depth of the area, and to create conditions for the
16    elimination of the enclaves."
17            Now, let's go further on in this report.  Does the report
18    designate the various units that are to take part in this plan?
19       A.   Yes, sir, it does.
20       Q.   And could you go to page 5, which is sort of the end of the list
21    after it lists various Drina Corps Brigades such as the Milici Brigade and
22    the Bratunac Brigade and the Zvornik Brigade, there's a section about
23    reserves in the middle of the page, and let me read this.  "Reserve forces
24    of a size of two or three companies of the MUP and one company from the
25    first Vlasenica Light Infantry Brigade."

 1            Can you first tell us what a reserve force is, what its purpose
 2    is, and then tell us what you think this means in this particular order?
 3       A.   By doctrine, and in this sense not just the doctrine of the former
 4    JNA and VRS, but by most military doctrines a reserve force is an
 5    established and dedicated force for the Commander to use to, one, deal
 6    with any unanticipated military situation, or for a lesser role, to be
 7    able to deal with an unanticipated success like a breakthrough or an
 8    exploitation.
 9            Generally speaking, though, the primary role is they're,
10    they're -- in a sense they belong directly to the Commander for him to use
11    for any unanticipated requirement.  No other person within the corps, per
12    se, can deploy them without the Commander's approval.
13       Q.   Okay, that's generally to reserve forces.  Now specifically, what
14    are the reserve forces for the Drina Corps operation Krivaja-95 as you
15    understand it?
16       A.   Based on this operations order, the reserve forces are identified
17    as two or three companies of the MUP and one company of the Vlasenica
18    Light Infantry Brigade.
19       Q.   Are you able to make out whether this is a MUP Special Police or
20    MUP Municipal Police from this order?
21       A.   I would say that clearly in this case we're referring to the MUP
22    Special Police forces.
23       Q.   Why?
24       A.   For the most part, the municipal police aren't organised in
25    traditional combat company sense.  It wouldn't make sense to refer to the

 1    MUP Municipal Police unit as a company, and it wouldn't be the right type
 2    of formation to use as a military infantry company, which is essentially
 3    what we're doing here.
 4       Q.   What do you make of this, this phrase, "reserve forces of a size
 5    of two or three companies"?  That's not very specific.  It doesn't seem to
 6    be finalised.  What do you make of that?
 7       A.   Looking at this in context, what we're seeing here is at a
 8    minimum, at the time this order is published, that the command of the
 9    Drina Corps understands that at a minimum, there are now two companies of
10    the MUP Special Forces that have been resubordinated to them and that will
11    operate under their control.  They're anticipating perhaps getting a third
12    company, but they don't know that yet, for whatever reason.  Either it's
13    not available or there are other commitments.
14            So essentially, they're designating these units as their reserve.
15    They know, of course, they have the company of the Vlasenica Brigade.
16       Q.   So based on Krivaja-95, this order in front of us, who would these
17    MUP units be under the command of?
18       A.   In this case, they'd be directly under the command of the Corps
19    Commander, the Drina Corps Commander.
20       Q.   And at this time that would have been --
21       A.   General Zivanovic.
22       Q.   And in your opinion, would the rule regarding using MUP Special
23    Police in combat operations had to have been invoked in order to use MUP
24    in the way that it's anticipated in this order?
25       A.   Yes.  And in fact, we know that in mid-June of 1995, President

 1    Kardic did in fact declare an imminent state of war which would have
 2    further made all of that possible.
 3       Q.   Now, let's go to page 7 and to the highlighted section mentioning
 4    that, "Security organs and military police will indicate the areas for
 5    gathering and securing prisoners of war and war booty."  Is that usual?
 6       A.   Yes, sir.  That is a standard security organ and military police
 7    function.
 8       Q.   And I would also note the order mentions that they will be dealing
 9    with prisoners of war in the civilian population, to behave in every way
10    in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.
11            Now, we have seen the Main Staff directives -- excuse me, the
12    President Kardic directives, the Main Staff implementing orders, a Drina
13    Corps orders implementing it.  Do we have a brigade order to show us that
14    you can talk about also implementing this plan?
15            And if you could go to Exhibit 429, and we don't need to go
16    through this in detail, but if you could just tell us briefly what this
17    is.
18       A.   What this document is, again, based off of the preparatory order
19    of the Drina Corps, this is the order of the Zvornik Infantry Brigade that
20    it issued to its own formations to organise itself for combat operations.
21    It, again, references the Drina Corps order, and in very specific detail
22    designates all of the military things which have to occur, when they have
23    to occur by, and very clearly designates the command chain for the
24    military organisation as it deploys to Srebrenica.
25       Q.   And do these series of orders show a normal chain of command

 1    working the way it ought to?
 2       A.   In a broad sense, the series -- the last four series of orders or
 3    the last five series of orders we've seen demonstrates a standard practice
 4    within almost any army where you see orders coming from the political
 5    leadership, and how they manifest themselves down from the highest levels
 6    to the lowest levels, from the strategic echelon to the tactical echelon.
 7            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And at this point I would direct the Court to
 8    another exhibit that was originally a video, but I believe you've seen
 9    that video, so I don't think we need to play it.  I will just briefly give
10    you the very short transcript of it, and I can read that.  It's an
11    interview of President Kardic we believe in August of 1995.
12            THE REGISTRAR:  Can we have the number of the exhibit of this
13    video, please?
14            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I've just been informed that that video has not
15    been played, but it's number 99, but I don't think we need to see
16    President Kardic's face.  Let me just read you what he said and we'll
17    provide that video as an exhibit if you need to see it.  It's also being
18    undertitled at the moment, so we hope to give you some videos for your
19    review with subtitling.
20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. McCloskey, I think it is
21    Exhibit 430, is it not?
22            MR. McCLOSKEY:  That is the transcript is 430, and the video is
23    99.  And as you have that in front of you, I'll just, for the record, read
24    it.  It's very short.  And this, again, is President Kardic on a news
25    interview on RSTV.  "We wanted to turn Mladic into a legend and we did for

 1    we know that our people want legends.  We failed, however, to bring up the
 2    successes of individual corps commanders.  Now Krstic, for instance, who
 3    planned it in front of me and I approved that task for Srebrenica, who did
 4    it exceptionally well.  Of course, the Main Staff, Mladic and all others
 5    help, but it should be known that Krstic is a great army commander."
 6            Now, Mr. President, we're going on to our next chapter, the attack
 7    and the fall of Srebrenica.  If we could take a break, or we could get
 8    right into it.  It may be a good time to take a break.
 9            JUDGE WALD:  I just have one question, I'm sorry.
10            Mr. Butler, I'm still having trouble -- this is sort of a
11    follow-up of the last question.  Within the limits of your report and the
12    information that you analyse, you said that, at least in reading parts of
13    Exhibit 328, that reducing the size which they said was there of the
14    enclaves, and reducing the communication between them or reducing the size
15    of them, would end up making the UN either evacuate its role there or stop
16    making it a safe enclave, and I haven't figured out what the logic of that
17    is.
18            I mean, in other words, if they got them down, and I know that
19    meant they might attack or engage some of the outlying DutchBat posts, but
20    why would reducing them, the enclave to a smaller size, necessarily mean
21    the UN would get out of making it a safe enclave?
22       A.   In that respect, what you have to do is go back to the situation
23    which first created the enclave.
24            JUDGE WALD:  Yes, I'm familiar with that.
25       A.   Again, in this sense, the VRS looked at the Srebrenica enclave and

 1    the ensuing population that was in it for the most part, at a military
 2    perspective alone, as an unacceptable drain to them.
 3            JUDGE WALD:  I understand.
 4       A.   What they wanted to do, in essence, is by compressing all of the
 5    people into the urban area, essentially force, because of a humanitarian
 6    crisis similar to what occurred in 1993, the UN to give up on the concept
 7    of the safe area, in particular that one, and evacuate the population.
 8            JUDGE WALD:  Okay, thank you.
 9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So we're going to have a break
10    of 20 minutes.
11                          --- Recess taken at 10:39 a.m.
12                          --- On resuming at 11.03 a.m.
13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. McCloskey.  You may
14    continue, please.
15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
16       Q.   Mr. Butler, before we get to the attack on Srebrenica, I want you
17    to make one point very clear.  Was the objective, the initial objective of
18    Krivaja-95, to take the entire enclave or just reduce it to its urban
19    areas?
20       A.   Based on the operations order for Krivaja-95 and the preceding
21    documents, it's clear that the objective was not to take the city of
22    Srebrenica as the initial objective.
23       Q.   Now, could you briefly summarise the situation, beginning with the
24    attack on Srebrenica and how that led to the fall and the deportation.
25    Again, very briefly so we just get the high points, and then we'll go

 1    through some of the documents and materials that tell the military story
 2    of the fall and the removal of the Muslim citizens.
 3       A.   I think the easiest way to do this is if I could use the map,
 4    sir.  Thank you.
 5            The operation, as it is specified in the operations order for
 6    Krivaja-95, kicked off on schedule with the major effort of the army of
 7    the Republika Srpska coming in from the south along the road towards
 8    Srebrenica.  The units of the Drina Corps that we saw involved there, both
 9    as part of the operations plan and in the subsequent videos, reflect the
10    fact that the Drina Wolves, subordinate to 1st Zvornik Brigade, were
11    present, as well as other Zvornik Brigade assets, specifically tanks and
12    armoured personnel carriers.
13            We see elements of at least company light battalion strength from
14    the 2nd Romanija Motorised Brigade, another Drina Corps asset.  In that
15    case, also tanks.  We see elements of the 1st Birac Brigade, another Drina
16    Corps asset involved.  We see elements of the 1st Milici Light Infantry
17    Brigade.  And the main thrust of the attack for most of the units is
18    pushing up south towards -- from the south towards the north towards the
19    Jadar River in an effort to push the Muslims out of this area right here
20    within the enclave, known as the Bandera Triangle.  The army of Republika
21    Srpska views this area as the stronghold reserve of the 28th Division and
22    the area where they believe that the division will try to defend from the
23    most.  It is very hilly and rugged terrain.
24       Q.   And for the record, we need to point out that the area you pointed
25    to was in the south-western of the enclave.  Thank you.  Continue.

 1       A.   The main effort of the attack along the road past the
 2    UN checkpoints was conducted by the battle groups or the battalion of the
 3    Zvornik Brigade, those outlined in the previous order.  And their job,
 4    essentially, was to push through and beyond the UN outposts whereas much
 5    as possible not engaging the UN but surrounding them and forcing them into
 6    a position where they felt compelled to evacuate the outpost and either
 7    return back to Srebrenica or place themselves in the custody of the army
 8    of the Republika Srpska.  And without going into the actual tactical
 9    detail of that, over the course of the 6th through the evening of the
10    8th and through the 9th, they successfully accomplished that.
11            Sometime in the afternoon-early evening hours of 9 July, based on
12    the successes of all the units pushing towards Srebrenica from the south,
13    the supreme command of the Republika Srpska re-evaluated the operation and
14    decided, at that point, to expand the goal of the operation to include the
15    actual capture of Srebrenica town.  At that point, from the 10th of July
16    to the 11th of July, a few additional forces come in, and we see some of
17    the changes in the planning in order to accommodate now the new
18    objective.  The previous objective being just to force them into the area;
19    now they're having to restructure the plan in order to take the urban area
20    itself.
21            We see the successful conclusion of that with the capture of
22    Srebrenica on the afternoon of 11 July.  At the same time, we see the
23    evacuation of the Muslim population, first those who resided in
24    Srebrenica, as well as the considerable number of Muslim refugees who were
25    residing south, in this area, under the sponsorship of the Swedish Shelter

 1    Project.  Those refugees trek, under UN escort, up the road to the UN main
 2    base at Potocari, where they are arriving through the evening of the
 3    11th.
 4            The next subsequent series of events that we see that the army is
 5    involved in are along two separate axes, if you will.  As the 28th
 6    Infantry Division, the Muslim force inside the enclave, was ordered to
 7    break through the lines and trek towards free territory in Tuzla, as they
 8    called it free territory, the first thing that happened was, from a
 9    military perspective, they broke contact with the VRS forces in this area
10    south of Srebrenica where they were defending.
11            So essentially from that period until the early morning hours of
12    the 12th, from approximately the evening of the 10th to the early morning
13    hours of the 12th of July, the army of Republika Srpska did not have a
14    good idea where the Muslim military was.  And we see that manifested both
15    in the activities of the army and at the meetings with both the Dutch and
16    the Muslim representatives where the VRS officials, specifically
17    General Mladic, are asking for representatives of the army, and the Dutch
18    and the civilians are replying that they don't know where they are.
19            What is happening at that time frame is the army column is
20    starting to assemble at Jaglici and Susnjari starting the evening of the
21    10th.  For the VRS's perspective, they don't know this at this time.
22    Their assumption is that the army is heading into the southern part of the
23    enclave, to the south-east -- south-west, I'm sorry, of Srebrenica into
24    the Bandera Triangle, and when you look at the military operations that
25    occur on the 12th, you see most of the combat formations of the Drina

 1    Corps pushing into the Bandera Triangle, looking for the 28th Division
 2    which is not there.
 3            So on the 12th, most of the combat formations of the Drina Corps
 4    are conducting sweep operations south of Srebrenica.  Very few of the
 5    actual combat formations make it up to Potocari.  The only combat
 6    formations that do make it to Potocari are those first of the 3rd Bratunac
 7    Brigade, which had the mission of cutting off the north of Srebrenica and
 8    moving up, and the 2nd Battalion of the Bratunac Brigade, which was
 9    deployed to the north and then pushed south.
10            As we see the operation unfold into the 13th or the 12th and 13th,
11    by the early morning hours of the 12th of July, the lead elements of the
12    Muslim military civilian mixed column at this point is pushing past army
13    and police checkpoints and ambush sites at the road.  Some of our first
14    occurrences occur as early as 0300 in the morning on 12 July.
15            So throughout the morning hours of 12 July, first at the lower
16    levels and then as the information travels up the chain of command to the
17    higher levels, there is a growing awareness that the Muslim 28th Division
18    is not here where it was expected to be, it is not surrendering, which is
19    what the army of Republika Srpska wanted, but is instead attempting to
20    make a mass breakthrough on the other end of the enclave, and from a
21    tactical perspective, doing something that the army of Republika Srpska
22    did not anticipate.  Certainly not in the scale and strength that we see
23    later.
24            So throughout the day of the 12th, while we see a lot of activity
25    related to the evacuation of the women and children who had assembled at

 1    Potocari, the Muslim women and children, we also see a series of military
 2    directives as the Drina Corps command and staff start to put together a
 3    defensive line, if you will, or perimeter running from the Glogova,
 4    Kravica, Sandici, Konjevic Polje, Nova Kasaba, and as far south as Milici
 5    area to try and contain this large column of men.
 6            At the same time that all of these events are occurring, the Main
 7    Staff, taking advantage now of the successful capture of Srebrenica, is
 8    starting to put together the pieces of another plan which entails the
 9    capture of the Muslim enclave at Zepa.  So while all of this is going on,
10    at the same time you start to see also the planning aspects of military
11    forces being moved to the absolute southern part of the enclave here in
12    small numbers to begin advancing from the north towards the enclave of
13    Zepa, which is unfortunately off this map.
14            So over that period of days, you have a variety of military and
15    militarily-related civilian aspects which the command and staff of the
16    Drina Corps have to keep fully apprised of and coordinate.
17       Q.   Can you point as best as you can where the enclave of Zepa would
18    be if there was a map there?
19       A.   I believe the enclave of Zepa would be in this area right here
20    [indicates].
21       Q.   Okay.
22       A.   Because when you look at the main access of advance, one, from
23    Krivace down, and the smaller access from this area known as Bracan
24    towards this direction.
25       Q.   Would that be within 10 to 20 kilometers of the southern part of

 1    that map?
 2       A.   I think it roughly comes out about 10 to 15 kilometers, yes, sir.
 3       Q.   And Krivace was the initial forward command post for the Drina
 4    Corps for the Zepa operation?
 5       A.   Yes, sir, it was.
 6       Q.   Can you give us a little summary of the commanders, where they
 7    were, and then we'll go over the documents that help us show that, from
 8    the early period as we work into the Potocari deportation?
 9       A.   At the beginning of the operation, the Drina Corps forward command
10    post overseeing the operation was established in the village of
11    Pribicevac, which when you look at -- it doesn't show on the map, but when
12    you look at the mountainous terrain, it offers a fairly down-the-valley,
13    clear line of sight to most of the operation.  It was an established
14    command post for several years; it was a logical place to put it.  That is
15    where during the conduct of the operation, the actual takedown of the
16    enclave, General Krstic and the command staff of the Drina Corps in that
17    case, or the command group would be a better word, not command staff,
18    operated and coordinated the entire operation.
19            The other commanders involved, Lieutenant Colonel Vinko
20    Pandurevic, the Commander of the elements of the Zvornik Brigade; Colonel
21    Mirko Trivic, the Commander of the elements of the Romanija Brigade;
22    Colonel Svetozar Andric, the Commander of the 1st Birac Infantry Brigade,
23    all were operating generally along this road and as evidenced, would come
24    from time to time either to the command post at Pribicevac, or would
25    receive instructions from the command post down to their units.  But for

 1    the most part, these three commanders did in fact remain with their units
 2    through the period up to the capture of Srebrenica.
 3            Once the enclave or once Srebrenica fell, in many cases we saw
 4    many commanders, to include General Krstic, move from the forward command
 5    post at Pribicevac to another forward command post which had been
 6    established in Bratunac in the headquarters of the first Bratunac Light
 7    Infantry Brigade.
 8            So these people were operating out of Bratunac, which for tactical
 9    reasons, one, gave them better access to Potocari; and it certainly gave
10    them better communications with the rest of the Drina Corps; and third,
11    allowed them to coordinate and manage the evacuation and the military
12    operations that were occurring to the north here.
13       Q.   Mr. Butler, aside from the testimony of Drazen Erdemovic, do you
14    have any credible indications of the 10th Diversionary Unit, the Main
15    Staff unit, taking part in this operation at some point?
16       A.   When we look at the video coverage that was done by the both
17    military and Republika Srpska civil news authorities, particularly one
18    clip showing General Mladic, General Zivanovic, and General Krstic
19    entering the town of Srebrenica on the 11th of July, one of the first
20    checkpoints that they pass at the beginning of the town is, in fact,
21    manned by soldiers of the 10th Diversionary Unit.
22       Q.   Okay, if you could have a seat.  I think we'll go over some of the
23    documents upon which your briefing was based, and at least in the initial
24    documents and material, I want to focus your attention on the roles of
25    General Krstic and the other high command.

 1            And let's now go to the first document, number 431, and that is a
 2    communication from General Zivanovic dated July 8th, urgent, to
 3    Pribicevac, forward command post, to Major General Radislav Krstic
 4    personally, and Main Staff General Tolimir.  Now, can you explain what
 5    this document is?  What's it saying?
 6       A.   Essentially, this order or document is in response to complaints
 7    made by UNPROFOR Command over combat activities in which Dutch members of
 8    the UN were being shot at.  Clearly they had complained, that complaint
 9    had gone through the Main Staff, and this is the manifestation of that
10    back to the command -- or the forward command post of the Drina Corps.
11       Q.   And from this document, can you conclude or provide your opinion
12    where you believe General Krstic is, where General Zivanovic is when he
13    sends this, or where he ought to be?
14       A.   Looking at the header information at the top of the document, I
15    conclude that General Zivanovic is at the main command post in Vlasenica
16    at the time that this document is authored, and that General Krstic is at
17    the forward command post in Pribicevac.
18       Q.   Can you make out anything on the role of General Gvero in this,
19    where he might be?
20       A.   In this specific document, General Gvero is not mentioned.
21       Q.   Okay.  We'll be getting to General Gvero.
22       A.   Okay.
23       Q.   Now, if you could go up into the left-hand corner again, and I
24    just want to go to these numbers again.  Can you make out from this
25    numbering, 04, whether that tells us anything about who wrote this

 1    document or what command position they had?
 2       A.   Again, in the series of numbers, it's unclear.  Certainly when you
 3    read the actual context of this document, it would read in context that
 4    this was something or a document directly authored by the Commander of the
 5    Drina Corps to his Chief of Staff.  However, in the prefix number again,
 6    04, that would not link up to the number that we would expect to see based
 7    on a pattern of 01.  So again, this is the difficulty that -- I have in
 8    being able to conclude that 01 is definitively from the Commander, 02 from
 9    somebody else, 03 from somebody else within that context of 01 to 04.  I
10    can conclude what it came out of somewhere involved with either the
11    operations or the command organs, but I can't say specifically.
12            The second number, the 156, middle series, as described before,
13    the 156 series were those orders and directives related to the Krivaja-95
14    and, initially, preparatory order number 1.
15            And the last suffix again, 5, indicates it is the fifth order or
16    fifth document produced related to the 156 series.
17       Q.   General Krstic, he's present at the forward command post.  What
18    would you expect his leadership role as Chief of Staff would be?  What
19    would be involved in here on this day of July 8th, two days after the
20    attack had started on Srebrenica?
21       A.   At this point in time, based on his rank and based on his
22    position, he is, in effect, commanding the military operation against the
23    Srebrenica enclave.  He is controlling the tactical forces on the ground.
24       Q.   Okay.  Let's go to the next exhibit, 432, which is from the Main
25    Staff of the army, dated July 9th, authored by Tolimir, Zdravko Tolimir.

 1    I'll briefly read the relevant sections.  First paragraph:
 2            "President of the Republika Srpska has been informed of the
 3    successful combat operations around Srebrenica by units of the Drina Corps
 4    and that they have achieved results which enable them to occupy the very
 5    town of Srebrenica.  The president of the republic is satisfied with the
 6    results of combat operations around Srebrenica and has agreed with the
 7    continuation of operations for the takeover of Srebrenica, disarming of
 8    Muslim terrorist gangs, and complete demilitarisation of the Srebrenica
 9    enclave."
10            And various other things including taking care of the civilian
11    population in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.
12            All right.  Mr. Butler, what does that mean?
13       A.   As I indicated earlier, and going back to the theme that the
14    original objective was not the actual takeover of Srebrenica, what this
15    demonstrates is that based on the success of the military operation to
16    date, that the president of the republic, as the Supreme Commander, has
17    authorised the goals to be further set to now take over the town of
18    Srebrenica.
19       Q.   And from this document are you able to glean anything about the
20    role of General Krstic?
21       A.   Again looking at who the message is addressed to, understanding
22    that the message comes directly from the Main Staff, General-Major
23    Tolimir, again the awareness that as far as the Main Staff is concerned,
24    the individual on the ground running the operation is General Krstic.
25       Q.   How do you tell that from the document?

 1       A.   It is, in fact, directed to him at the forward command post
 2    personally.
 3       Q.   Now we have General Gvero.  What can you make of his presence, on
 4    this document?
 5       A.   This part is, for me, analytically speaking, an unanswered
 6    question.  We have no physical evidence or we have no other information
 7    either from sightings or from any other aspect of our information that
 8    indicates that General Gvero was physically on the ground at Srebrenica or
 9    at the forward command post.
10            There are a lot of ways to read this.  I mean, he could, in fact,
11    be there and this is the only indication that we have of it, and I cannot
12    confirm that, or that this message was sent to him at the Main Staff for
13    his benefit as well.  But the short answer is, relative to General Gvero,
14    I don't know.
15       Q.   All right.  Let's continue and go to the next document, 433, which
16    is from the command of the Bratunac Brigade and dated 10 July, the next
17    day.  It's called a daily combat report.
18            Before getting into the substance of this, can you tell us about
19    what a daily combat report is for the brigade level?
20       A.   As we discussed earlier relative to the aspect of a formalised
21    reporting process, these daily combat reports represent how the brigades
22    passed the relevant information to the next higher level for them, their
23    superior command, the command of the Drina Corps.  Every unit published
24    one of these reports every day as a minimum.  That is called the daily
25    one.  Should situations or circumstances dictate additional reports, we'll

 1    see those manifested in what's known as an interim combat report for those
 2    pieces of information that the brigade level -- the Brigade Commander
 3    deemed that the corps command and Commander need to be aware of
 4    immediately and can not wait for the next day's report.
 5       Q.   Okay.  What's the essence of what this report tells us about the
 6    command group?
 7       A.   What this report tells us is that in relation to the three at the
 8    brigade command, that the Brigade Commander physically locates him in the
 9    area of the 3rd Battalion, the Chief of Staff in the area of the
10    1st Battalion, the rest of the commanding officers of the Bratunac
11    Brigade, you know, are where they're supposed to be in accordance with the
12    plan.  It further notes the physical presence of General Mladic for the
13    first time; General Zivanovic, also for the first time; and General Krstic
14    in the zone in the area of the 1st Bratunac Infantry Brigade.
15            So from a chronological perspective, 10 July 1995 is the first
16    indication that both General Mladic and General Zivanovic show up in the
17    zone of the Bratunac Brigade specifically related to the conduct of the
18    military operations ongoing.
19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  All right.  And I would note for the Judges,
20    paragraph 5, just to highlight this to you, this says:
21            "Streten Petrovic, son of Ilija, Deputy Commander of the" -- I
22    believe that's the "3rd Battalion" --
23       A.   3rd Infantry Batallion.
24            MR. McCLOSKEY:  -- "suffered serious injuries in the thigh and the
25    forearm."

 1            You'll be hearing more about Streten Petrovic.  You have heard a
 2    bit about him already from some of the witnesses, including his father
 3    Ilija, who is known for having a very long moustache and being from the
 4    village of Spat.  This is an important person to keep aware of because he
 5    is a Commander that is identified in Potocari and the Bratunac area, and
 6    that's, of course, an important fact for the case.  So I highlight that
 7    for you; remember the name of Streten Petrovic, because it will come up
 8    again.
 9       Q.   All right.  Now, to continue the story, we now have an exhibit, a
10    video exhibit, which is number 145.  You've seen it before, but I'm told
11    we now have a subtitled version of it.  It's very short, and it will show
12    the Commanders coming in to Srebrenica.
13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If we could play that exhibit.  I don't know.  Is
14    there is a transcript to go along with it?
15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
16            MR. McCLOSKEY:  You've got it.  Okay.  And that is exhibit -- the
17    transcript and the video are 145A, and B.  I believe it should be in the
18    booth and be ready to go.  If we could play that.  Thanks.
19       Q.   Mr. Butler, while we're waiting, you've seen this before.  Could
20    you give us a preview?  Here, it looks like it's coming.
21                          [Videotape played]
22            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, I'm advised that should have been
23    Exhibit 145 bis.
24       Q.   Mr. Butler, what date did that scene play out?
25       A.   That scene played out the late afternoon hours of 11 July 1995.

 1       Q.   Did you see Vujadin Popovic on the film?
 2       A.   Yes, sir, I did.
 3       Q.   And was Popovic with General Mladic and General Krstic?
 4       A.   Yes, sir, he was.
 5       Q.   Who else can you recognise there?
 6       A.   Going through the film chronologically, Colonel Vinko Pandurevic,
 7    Commander of the elements of the Zvornik Brigade that were deployed.  We
 8    had, of course, General Mladic, General Krstic, General Zivanovic.
 9    Colonel Popovic, already discussed.  They pass through the checkpoint.
10    Those were members of the 10th Diversionary Unit.  Coming again through
11    the town, Colonel Mirko Trivic, Commander of the 2nd Romanija Brigade
12    assets, 2nd Romanija Motorised Brigade assets.  Later in series of the
13    town, Colonel Svetozar Andric, Commander of the deployed assets of the 1st
14    Birac Brigade.  Further towards the end, Lieutenant Miso Pelemis,
15    Commander of the 10th Diversionary Unit, who was in the middle of the
16    town.
17            I think those are all the major players.  There are probably more
18    out there.
19       Q.   All right.  Now we have a series of exhibits that help us identify
20    some of the players and some of the goings on, and they go
21    chronologically.  So if you could just start with Exhibit 434, which is an
22    intercept, and just place it on the ELMO, and if you could just summarise
23    briefly, and just use your best judgement to get through this.
24       A.   In the case of this intercept, very quickly, it's one part of a
25    discussion between General Gvero, the Main Staff Assistant Commander for

 1    Moral, Legal, and Religious Affairs, back briefing the president of the
 2    Republic on a conversation that he has just had with Dutch General Nicoli
 3    of UNPROFOR.
 4       Q.   And this is an 11 July intercept, and again, we have Gvero coming
 5    in on the scene again.  And let's go to the next exhibit.  This was an
 6    exhibit that's been seen; it's Exhibit 45.
 7       A.   I'm sorry, wrong --
 8       Q.   It should be a video still of General Krstic.
 9       A.   This video still of General Krstic is taken at what we call the
10    second meeting between the VRS, the UN Dutch Battalion, and Muslim
11    representatives that occurred in the late evening hours of 11 July, 1995,
12    in the Hotel Fontana in Bratunac.
13       Q.   Okay.  Let's go to the next -- and that was Exhibit 45.  Let's go
14    to the next exhibit, 435.  It's an intercept from 12 July in the morning
15    at 0735 hours.  Tell us about this.
16       A.   What this intercept represents, and the next series of exhibits
17    that will also come in to play, are the series of actions that occurred
18    sometime after that second meeting when the decision was made to evacuate
19    or to move out, transport, the entire civilian population of Potocari
20    out.  Again, that being an event that was not anticipated, it started a
21    flurry of orders, both verbal ones that were picked up over the telephone
22    and written orders, to military units and to civilian state-owned
23    companies to start assembling the large amount of buses that would be
24    needed to carry out the movement.
25       Q.   And General Krstic as Chief of Staff at this point for this tricky

 1    operation, would you expect him to be involved in it?
 2       A.   Clearly I would expect him to be one of the primary people
 3    involved in it.  And the other personality noted, Lieutenant Colonel
 4    Krsmanovic, is in fact the Drina Corps Chief of Transportation Services,
 5    another person who should be very involved in the programme.
 6       Q.   So this -- it's fair to say this is an intercept with Krstic and
 7    Krsmanovic dealing with buses and getting buses from various places?
 8       A.   Yes, sir.
 9       Q.   Okay, let's go to the next exhibit, 436.  Now, this is a
10    communication from General Zivanovic dated 12 July as Commander of the
11    Drina Corps.  How does this fit in?
12       A.   Again, this is another manifestation of the process of going out
13    and assembling all of the buses and other transportation assets necessary
14    to move the Muslim population out of Potocari.  In this aspect, they're
15    specifically ordering all of the Drina Corps subordinate units to provide
16    the buses.  The order is dated 12 July, 1995.  And again reflecting when
17    that decision might have been made, when you look at the translation of
18    the communication centre received stamp at the bottom, what that indicates
19    is that that order was received by the command of the Zvornik Brigade at
20    0835, the morning of 12 July.  The inference there is, clearly the order
21    was given earlier that morning.
22       Q.   Now, if the Main Staff had taken over direct command of the
23    brigades leaving out the normal authority of the Drina Corps, would there
24    have been any need or any point for General Zivanovic to send this order
25    to his brigades?

 1       A.   No, sir.
 2       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit, 437.  This is a new kind of document
 3    from the Defence Ministry.  What is this?
 4       A.   Within the context of the laws of the army and the laws of the
 5    defence -- on laws on defence, it is the responsibility of the Ministry of
 6    the Defence to deal with those issues having to deal with other aspects of
 7    the government or the state of the Republika Srpska.  What you have here
 8    is, again, referencing a Main Staff order or directive to the Minister of
 9    Defence or Ministry of Defence, for the Ministry of Defence then turning
10    that around and ordering the various civilian agencies and assets under
11    the control of the Ministry of Defence to mobilise buses and send them to
12    Bratunac.
13       Q.   And this is one of many such orders; we didn't put all the other
14    ones on there.
15       A.   We have a total of -- sorry, we have a total of six of these
16    orders: three dated 12 July, 1995, three dated 13 July, 1995.
17       Q.   Is there anything about this that indicates the chain of command
18    involving the various ministries and armies is working anything but
19    normally?
20       A.   This order at face value is consistent with all of the other
21    series that we have of this.
22       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit which is an intercept, 12 July, still
23    in the morning, 0915, and if you could just tell us about this.
24       A.   This clearly is not a verbatim translation of the conversation.
25    It represents notations of one of the operators as to what the context of

 1    the order was.  Again, it demonstrates the involvement of Lieutenant
 2    Colonel Krsmanovic, the Drina Corps Chief of Transportation, dealing with
 3    the issue from various agencies of getting buses assembled.  The
 4    interesting piece here to note is the fact that fuel for all aspects in
 5    July of 1995 in East Bosnia was a very, very precious commodity and
 6    difficult to come by.
 7       Q.   In your review of the various documents, have you seen the
 8    allocation of fuel being dealt with in a certain way?
 9       A.   What they did in order to get past the fuel issue, particularly in
10    the situation in Bratunac -- a light infantry brigade it had very few
11    vehicles therefore very little fuel holdings -- was the buses that arrived
12    on the 12th and the 13th, the fuel was essentially requisitioned from the
13    state-owned Vihor Transportation Company in Bratunac.  And we have
14    detailed lists that are included in the supporting materials where as the
15    buses arrived, buses were given 50 or 100 litres of diesel fuel, D2 as
16    it's referred to; the license plate numbers of the buses were written
17    down; and those buses were then sent to Potocari to start picking up the
18    members of the population.
19            And when you look at the gross count, 60, 70 buses, as well as
20    other military vehicles that were requisitioned into the process, when
21    fuel subsequently was allowed into Potocari from the UN, in order to
22    basically compensate the Vihor Transportation Company and, in effect, the
23    state of Republika Srpska for the fuel, that fuel was reallocated to the
24    Vihor Transportation Company.
25       Q.   All right.  Let's go on to what was Exhibit 55.  It should be a

 1    still of General Krstic at the Hotel Fontana on the morning of the 12th.
 2    We're still going in a chronology now.  And what does this represent?
 3       A.   Again, represents the presence, the physical presence of General
 4    Krstic at what we call the third meeting between the VRS commanders, in
 5    this case now members of the Republika Srpska civilian authorities, Muslim
 6    authorities, and the Dutch Battalion representatives.
 7       Q.   And without getting into the details of this meeting, General
 8    Krstic is the highest ranking officer aside from General Mladic there?
 9       A.   Highest ranking officer of the Drina Corps present, yes, sir.
10       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit, which is an intercept from 12 July,
11    1200 hours, perhaps by the chronology, shortly after the meeting ended or
12    right about that time.
13       A.   Can you give me the exhibit number, sir?
14       Q.   I'm sorry, it's 359A.  And if you don't see it there, I can just
15    read it briefly, and we can go on to the next.
16       A.   I don't have that exhibit here.
17       Q.   We have a copy which we should be able to deliver.  Just before
18    you put it on the ELMO, could you check for initials and just fold it down
19    so those initials can't be seen?
20       A.   This exhibit again discusses the issue of buses being assembled.
21    It further specifies the requests for fuel being forwarded to Krstic.
22       Q.   Now, is there another Krstic that may be involved in fuel issues?
23    My recollection is that there are other documents.  Who do you think this
24    Krstic may be?
25       A.   In this instance, the Krstic that we're referring to is, in fact,

 1    General Krstic.
 2       Q.   Why do you say that?
 3       A.   The only other Krstic that comes up in relation to the military
 4    documents and the fuel-related issue is a Private Krstic functioning as a
 5    Captain Krstic in logistics in the Zvornik Brigade.  It's unlikely that
 6    this conversation would have involved him.
 7       Q.   Is fuel important enough to have the Major General, the Chief of
 8    Staff, involved in it like this?
 9       A.   In the context of Eastern Bosnia in July of 1995, it would be safe
10    to say that diesel fuel was the equivalent of liquid gold.  It was one of
11    the embargoed items that had to be smuggled in, and the fuel records were
12    very meticulously kept from the individual operator level all the way
13    through the major commands.  Fuel usage was a mandatory reporting
14    requirement as part of every brigade's daily combat report to the corps.
15       Q.   All right.  Could we go to the next exhibit, 440, another 12 July
16    at 1210 hours.
17       A.   I'm sorry, this is the wrong exhibit.  440.
18       Q.   Tell us about this.
19       A.   Clearly this is not a verbatim transcript of an intercept.  It's
20    the synopsis notes of the individual collector noting that Krstic wants
21    the buses to start moving right away.
22       Q.   In your opinion, who should this be in the context of the overall
23    situation?
24       A.   Again, in the context of who the conversation correspondents are,
25    this would be General-Major Krstic.

 1       Q.   We have Krsmanovic again, who you've already described.
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   Let's go to the next one, 441, 12 July, 1212 hours.  Is it fair to
 4    say this is Krsmanovic involved with trailer trucks, the same issue?
 5       A.   Yes, sir.
 6       Q.   Let's go on to 442.  Sorry, that's the same one.  Let's go to 443,
 7    12 July, and we see -- what do you make of this conversation?
 8       A.   Again, what we're seeing here is between two unidentified
 9    correspondents, the discussion pertaining to the movements of large
10    scale -- or large numbers of trucks.  Miletic.  The name, I believe, is
11    General-Major Miletic, the Chief of Operations of the VRS on the Main
12    Staff, and clearly they're discussing the movements of vehicles from the
13    major municipalities.  He's also noting one of the correspondents, "X",
14    that he's received an order from Krsto, a nickname of General Krstic, and
15    he's ordered it directly, and again we're talking the issue here of fuel.
16       Q.   We've heard the name Krle.  In fact, General Mladic just used it
17    coming into Srebrenica, but we have not seen Krsto before.  Why do you
18    believe this is a reference to General Krstic?
19       A.   Looking through the context of the intercepts that we have, we see
20    other high-ranking Serbian officers, at least at his level, will call him
21    that as a nickname, and again, in correspondence between the lower
22    subscribers, where the presence of the General isn't there, they'll, of
23    course, call him by his slang nickname as well.
24       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit, 444, 12 July, 1240 hours.  And
25    Panorama is one of the participants.  What's Panorama?

 1       A.   Panorama is the radio telephone, which is the network that we're
 2    seeing intercepted here, nickname or code name for the Main Staff
 3    headquarters.
 4       Q.   So this --
 5            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me just again.  The nickname of General Krstic
 6    did not appear on the transcript.  Could you repeat it, please,
 7    Mr. Butler, the nickname of Mr. Krstic?
 8       A.   In the intercept it's referred to as "Krsto."  K-i-r -- I believe
 9    it's K-r-s-t-o.
10            JUDGE RIAD:  Krsto, yes, but there is another one.  If you look
11    here, "called him by his nickname," the other one.
12       A.   Krle, K-r-l-e.
13            JUDGE RIAD:  So "Krle" and "Kristo" are both used?
14       A.   Are nicknames we have associated with Major-General Krstic, yes,
15    sir.
16            MR. McCLOSKEY:
17       Q.   While we're on the nickname topic, we hear Krsmanovic also
18    referred to as Krle in one intercept, don't we?
19       A.   That is correct.  And again, as part of what I did in analysing
20    the intercepts, part of that clearly is not going and taking names at face
21    value, it's looking within the context of the intercepts, the context of
22    the conversation and the correspondence, to make those assessments whether
23    we're talking about Krle, the Chief of Transportation, and Krle, the Chief
24    of Staff at this time of the Drina Corps.  So it's not a face value
25    judgement of a name equals a person.

 1       Q.   Back to Exhibit 444.  This is another discussion about buses, but
 2    this time the Main Staff Panorama seems to be interested.  So the Main
 3    Staff is now involved.  Is there anything unusual about that?
 4       A.   Nothing unusual at all.  It would be expected that the Main Staff
 5    would be very involved in this, particularly in the acquiring of assets
 6    outside of the zone of the Drina Corps, which the Drina Corps would not
 7    normally be empowered to do on its own.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Let's go the next intercept, 445, 12 July, 1250 hours,
 9    General Mladic and unidentified person talking about buses and trucks.
10    What can you make of this?
11       A.   Again, General Mladic, as the Commander of the Main Staff,
12    querying an unidentified correspondent as to whether or not the trucks and
13    buses are on their way as directed.  Further, when you go into the text,
14    he's telling that unidentified correspondent to continue to monitor the
15    situation; "Don't let small groups of them sneak in."  I would be very
16    hesitant, at that point, to try and speculate what that meant in relation
17    to the overall context.
18            Going further into that, again General Mladic makes the point that
19    they've all capitulated and surrendered and, "We'll evacuate them all,
20    those who want to and those who don't want to."  Clearly, in this case,
21    we're discussing the civilian population at Potocari.
22       Q.   Now we just saw on the video General Mladic ordering people to
23    take flags, to take Bratunac, to do this, to do that.  We've seen him try
24    to pull a Dutch APC out of a ditch in a former video.  Now we see him
25    involved in some detail with the buses.  Are those indications that

 1    General Mladic has taken over command of the brigades directly and has
 2    pushed out the Drina Corps' authority?
 3       A.   No, sir.
 4       Q.   Why not?
 5       A.   Taken in context, General Mladic, as the Commander of the Main
 6    Staff of the VRS, will be making the major decisions, clearly.  In the
 7    cases where he's on camera, he'll make them very publicly.  And in the
 8    sense of dealing with Generals, one of the facets of command and
 9    leadership is to be publicly seen being in command and leading, and a lot
10    of what General Mladic does, clearly, is for the benefit of the cameras
11    and for the benefit of all of his soldiers to be seen being in command.
12            Commanders at all levels, Generals, be it brigade Commanders, even
13    battalion Commanders, they don't have -- I mean, one of the most precious
14    resources is time.  They don't have the time to do everything themselves.
15    That's why, within a military context, they have staffs to perform all
16    these functions and subordinate Commanders to perform all of these
17    functions.
18            For General Mladic to issue an order and then exercise that order
19    outside of the chain of command when there is a perfectly functional staff
20    at his disposal, the Drina Corps command and the Drina Corps staff, does
21    not make military sense per se.  The normal portion of that or the normal
22    way that would occur would be for General Mladic to give the orders to his
23    subordinate commanders.  And in the case we saw that in Potocari, him
24    informing his subordinate commanders that he wanted to go from -- I'm
25    sorry -- from Srebrenica to Potocari, informing them what he wanted to

 1    do.  It's the responsibility of the staff and the subordinate commanders
 2    to figure out how to do that, how to put all of the hundreds and hundreds
 3    of pieces together which are implied and inferred in a single order in
 4    order to make something happen.
 5            So it doesn't make very much military sense for things like that
 6    to happen where you would have a Commander lopping off elements of the
 7    chain of command and dealing with units directly in that sense.
 8    Specifically when you look at the JNA regulations pertaining to command
 9    and staff, it very clearly articulates that things like that are abnormal
10    and, in effect, represent a very poor and undisciplined army.
11       Q.   Do you get the impression that the VRS was a poor and
12    undisciplined army?
13       A.   No, sir.  They are a very well-organised army.
14       Q.   Thank you.
15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, this would probably be a good time
16    to take a break.
17            JUDGE WALD:  Can I ask one question?  Sorry.  Between Exhibit 444,
18    which was Panorama, although we don't have the identified participants,
19    they're only "X" and "Y", but it's clear between them they're saying -- Y
20    is saying:  "We'll accept all the civilians who want to stay.  Those who
21    don't want to can choose where to go," and approximately an hour later
22    we've got 445 which says they're going to go whether they want to or not.
23    I mean, evacuated.  Is there something out of your analysis that can
24    bridge that gap?
25       A.   Clearly in the context, that falls out of the general chain of

 1    events that we see.  One of the parts, when you analyse communications
 2    intelligence information, which this is, especially when you deal with
 3    issues of reliability, well, obviously the processing of the product is a
 4    reliability issue.  The one thing that an analyst has to be aware of is
 5    the fact that while you may have a perfectly good intercept, there's no
 6    guarantee that the correspondents know what they're talking about or are
 7    as informed of the situation as anybody else.  It does fit out of context,
 8    it does not go in sequence, and I cannot explain it.
 9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So we're going to have a
10    20-minute break now.
11                          --- Recess taken at 12.18 p.m.
12                          --- On resuming at 12.44 p.m.
13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. McCloskey, we may continue.
14            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
15       Q.   Mr. Butler, if we could go to Exhibit 446, it should be an
16    intercept 12 July, 1305 hours, and I want to ask you a few questions about
17    this, and I want to read a bit of it.  And "K" appears to be Krstic where
18    it says:
19                "Put me back to the switchboard.  Miss, put me through to the
20                Vlasenica Brigade."
21            And there's an answer "yes".  And then,
22                "This is Krstic.
23                Can I help you General?
24                Give me Kosoric."
25            Who is Kosoric again?

 1       A.   Lieutenant Colonel Kosoric is the Chief of Intelligence for the
 2    Drina Corps.
 3       Q.   And can you point to the map where the Vlasenica Brigade should
 4    be?
 5       A.   The Vlasenica Brigade is located, almost physically located with
 6    the headquarters of the Drina Corps in Vlasenica.
 7       Q.   Okay.  Now, I'll continue to read.  General Krstic is told,
 8                "He's not in.  He went somewhere.
 9                Give me Savo, put me through to Savo.
10                How are you general?  This is Savo.
11                Srpski!, fuck it, how else?
12                Congratulations."
13            Then Krstic:
14                "Get in touch with these guys from the MUP.  That means you,
15                your brigade and them."
16            What do you make of this sentence, who is he talking about, "Get
17    in touch with these guys from the MUP, that means your brigade"?
18       A.   To start with, first I'm not yet able to identify who Savo is;
19    however, clearly from the context of the conversation, the correspondent
20    Savo is someone with the Vlasenica Light Infantry Brigade, again, a Drina
21    Corps asset.  And what he -- what General Krstic at this time is
22    instructing him to do is coordinate with the Ministry of the Interior
23    police units, as well as with people in his own brigade, to accomplish
24    something.
25       Q.   Okay.  And then Savo responds:  "I gave everything there is."  And

 1    then Krstic:
 2                "Wait, slow down, man, secure the road first, from the
 3                crossroad below from where you are, 12 kilometres/?Drava/, and
 4                up to the tunnel."
 5            Geographically, can you make out anything from that sentence?
 6       A.   The crossroad intersection I'm presuming to be the major crossroad
 7    from the road south from Vlasenica.  Drava is the radio telephone callsign
 8    for the Birac Infantry Brigade headquartered up in Sekovici, which is not
 9    located on the map but is in this area right here.  So putting that
10    together, what they're being instructed to do is secure the road from
11    Vlasenica up past Tisca -- or up towards Tisca in the direction of Drava,
12    the Sekovici Brigade, or Birac Brigade it's known alternatively.
13       Q.   Now, do you know of a tunnel that exists just west of Luke?
14       A.   There is a tunnel along the road from Luke to Kladanj which the
15    survivors of the transportation out of Potocari discuss having gone
16    through as part of their trek where they were let off at Luke towards
17    Kladanj.
18       Q.   So if we start off in Vlasenica, assuming that's where this guy is
19    from, and we go 12 kilometers in the direction of Drava but then over
20    towards the tunnel, where does that roughly put us?
21       A.   That puts us along the road from Vlasenica through Tisca to Luke.
22       Q.   And then we have another line that says "To the tunnel," and then
23    Krstic says, "Of Course."  And then "S" says "okay".  And then Krstic
24    says, "That's where they'll be disembarking."
25            Now, on 12 July at about 1301 hours, who would be disembarking

 1    around that area on that day?
 2       A.   That would clearly, by the timing of when the first convoy left
 3    Potocari, that would be the lead elements of the buses that were moving
 4    the people out of Potocari to Luke.
 5       Q.   That would have been the women and children mostly?
 6       A.   That is correct, sir.
 7       Q.   And then the next line, "okay" by "S", and then Krstic says, "Take
 8    care, nothing must happen to any of them."  Who do you think Krstic is
 9    referring to when he says, "Nothing must happen to any of them"?
10       A.   Presumably he's talking about the women and children on the buses.
11       Q.   And then he says "Is that clear," so he's making a point of it?
12       A.   Emphasising that, yes, sir.
13       Q.   What do we know, militarily speaking, what happens at that
14    disembarking place in the afternoon of July 12th?  Do we have any military
15    officers there that you recall from previous testimony?
16       A.   One of the witnesses identifies a Drina Corps officer, Major
17    Sarkic, who he had previously identified as being a member of the Milici
18    Light Infantry Brigade at that location doing the physical separations in
19    the event of the Muslim men who had managed to sneak on the buses.  As
20    other witnesses testify, those Muslim men were then placed in a school at
21    the Tisca facility, and were later taken to an execution site.
22            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And to clarify, the testimony of the protected
23    witness who we referred to as the Tisca survivor, to give you
24    recollection, he was separated, as best I recall, on the 13th of July in
25    the early morning and was -- sat all day at that school, and then was

 1    taken out in the evening hours where he survived an execution.
 2            And one other piece of information that may be relevant is that
 3    that witness recalls hearing that one of the soldiers that he was with ask
 4    where should they be taken and was told to take them the same place they
 5    took the others.
 6            All right.  I think that fills us in on the situation at the
 7    disembarking.
 8       Q.   Mr. Butler, aside from the obvious difficulty the women and the
 9    children had surviving in the heat and without water and food, is there
10    anything in the record that it's part of the command or any orders that
11    there was any hostility directed towards the women and children during
12    this process?
13       A.   Within the framework of the orders and other documents, there is
14    not.
15       Q.   All right.  Let's go to the next exhibit, number 58.  We are still
16    in a chronology in the afternoon of 12 July.  It should be a photo of
17    General Krstic leading Popovic in the background.  Exhibit 58.
18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me for interrupting you,
19    Mr. McCloskey.  We don't seem to have Exhibit 447.
20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, 447 should be a photograph of --
21    and you should have it -- of a Bratunac Brigade officer, with a video
22    attached to it.  We're not quite there yet.  I hope that's not a problem
23    we have.  The exhibit immediately right in front of it is the one that
24    is -- I now see it on the ELMO.
25            It's my understanding that prior court exhibits, I'd asked them to

 1    be put in the binders.  However, I was told that since they are part of
 2    the court, we couldn't just take them and put them in the binders and that
 3    they would have to get them from the Registry.  So if that's the rule,
 4    that's ...
 5       Q.   Mr. Butler, this is from a previous -- a still from a previous
 6    video exhibit that was an interview of, the Court will recall,
 7    General Krstic in the afternoon of July 12th in Potocari, and can you
 8    identify the people that you know in that photo?
 9       A.   Clearly General Krstic is the main subject of the still
10    photograph.  Behind him, and if I can use the pointer, this individual
11    here is Lieutenant Colonel Vujadin Popovic, the Assistant Commander for 
12    Security of the Drina Corps.
13       Q.   Now, this exhibit, it's a bit fuzzy and his face on this
14    particular exhibit is not exactly clear.  Have you had a chance to see
15    this video and play it several times to get a good look at who this fellow
16    is behind General Krstic?
17       A.   Yes, sir, I have.  It is Lieutenant Colonel Popovic.
18       Q.   Popovic who we also just saw on the video coming through
19    Srebrenica on the 11th with General Krstic, and General Zivanovic and
20    others?
21       A.   That is correct, sir.
22       Q.   All right.  Let's go on to the next exhibit, which is 447, the
23    still.  If you could -- it should be a still of the Bratunac -- well,
24    there's also a video, which is 136.
25       A.   I don't have that.

 1       Q.   Let's not worry about the still.  We've got the video.  Thanks.
 2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If we could play the video 136.  Again, this is an
 3    interview of a Bratunac Brigade officer, shot, we believe, about the same
 4    time as the interview with General Krstic, and it should be subtitled.
 5                          [Videotape played]
 6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we play that back, and could you try to see
 7    if you can try to catch the man with the moustache that comes behind him?
 8    We'll just give it one try.  If not, we'll go on.  For the booth, there's
 9    a fellow with a bald head and a big moustache that comes up for a second
10    or two behind the person giving the interview.
11                          [Videotape played]
12            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Okay.  Thank you.  If you can go slowly, I'll let
13    you know where he is.
14                          [Videotape played]
15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Sorry, we passed it.  I didn't see it.  There he
16    is.  Stop.  That's the back of his head.  If you can follow the fellow on
17    the right-hand side of the screen very slowly, he'll give us a facial
18    shot, I think, unless he's already done it.  Okay.  Keep going.
19                          [Videotape played]
20                     MR. McCLOSKEY:  Okay.  Right there.  Stop.
21       Q.   All right.  Mr. Butler, this fellow that appears to be behind a
22    rifle at the moment, do you recognise that fellow?
23       A.   That individual is Lieutenant Colonel Svetozar Kosoric, the Chief
24    of Intelligence for the Drina Corps.  The primary subject of the video is
25    identified as Zoran Kovacevic who is further noted in Bratunac Brigade

 1    records as a Lieutenant and the Commander of the 4th Infantry Company,
 2    2nd Battalion of the Bratunac Light Infantry Brigade.
 3       Q.   Okay.  We can leave the video.  How does the presence of that
 4    Bratunac officer fit in with what you know about the plan and who should
 5    be where at the time?
 6       A.   As discussed within the context of the military units that we
 7    physically see entering Potocari on the 12th and 13th of July, the
 8    Bratunac Brigade units involved from the south and from the north the
 9    3rd Battalion of the Bratunac Brigade and the 2nd Battalion of the
10    Bratunac Brigade.  So his physical presence in Potocari on the 12 July
11    would be consistent with that.
12       Q.   Now, I want to ...
13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I think it should fit right over that.  It looks
14    like there's enough room.  I'm sorry.  If we could put that right over the
15    top.
16       Q.   Now, the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Vujadin Popovic and the
17    presence of Colonel Kosoric in Potocari at that time, and again, could you
18    point out where they are on the command chart?
19       A.   Lieutenant Colonel Popovic, again, Assistant Commander for
20    Security of the Drina Corps.  Lieutenant Colonel Kosoric, the Chief of
21    Intelligence of the Drina Corps.
22       Q.   And what is going on in Potocari on that day that would involve
23    their job descriptions, if anything?
24       A.   On that day, you have the physical process of the transportation
25    of the Muslim population from Potocari through or out to the Muslim free

 1    territory.  Considering the large civilian and suspected male military
 2    members who were there, it's a logical function for both the Chief of
 3    Security and the Chief of Intelligence for the Drina Corps to be present
 4    there as part of the organisational and oversight function.
 5       Q.   Where would they fit, if anywhere, into the planning on what to do
 6    with the inhabitants of Srebrenica?
 7       A.   Clearly in an aspect from the security role, the planning for the
 8    aspects or the security aspect of moving them for the chief -- you know,
 9    the security aspect, I guess, for moving them and securing them, making
10    sure that none of them pose a threat to the Drina Corps.  Further, from a
11    security aspect, you have the function of screening people who are accused
12    by the VRS or by the Republika Srpska for war crimes.
13       Q.   So you're now talking about the male population of Potocari would
14    be a specific security situation.
15       A.   In one aspect it would be a security situation.  Further, an
16    intelligence perspective, clearly members of the male population of
17    Potocari would presumably have information which would be of value for the
18    command of the Drina Corps relative to the location, the identities, and
19    the personalities of members of the Muslim 28th Infantry Division, and it
20    would be a logical function for the Chief of Intelligence and his people
21    to be involved in identifying Muslims who would have such information and
22    to interrogate them accordingly.
23       Q.   Okay.  Let's continue with our chronology and getting back to an
24    intercept.  It's Exhibit 448, 12 July, at 1648 [sic] hours.  Panorama is
25    noted as one of the participants.

 1       A.   Exhibit 448?
 2       Q.   Yes.  Make sure there's no initials or anything on that.  And if
 3    I'd said 1648, I should have said 1848 hours is the time of this.
 4            What can you tell us about this conversation and how it fits in
 5    your analysis, if at all?  And I would note that on the bottom of page 2
 6    there is a mention of Krle, but is there anything specifically you can
 7    glean from this?
 8       A.   The conversation as depicted, clearly the primary correspondents
 9    are between two people of the Main Staff, Panorama and an individual going
10    by the code name of Panorama-03.  They're looking for the big boss, who we
11    presume to be General Mladic.  They're unable to find him, and they pass
12    him to an individual named Rajko.  We believe, but I'm not sure, that
13    Rajko, is the name of a military officer who serves the function as the
14    aide to General Mladic.
15            What is happening is that the individual identified as 03 is
16    discussing back and forth with this individual what steps both the Main
17    Staff and the forward command are taking, and essentially Rajko is passing
18    on the instructions or the intent of his superior.
19       Q.   Now, on the bottom of page 2.  Is there enough information to
20    determine Krle, who that may be?
21       A.   Again, in the context of knowing who is in the discussion being at
22    the level of the Main Staff, Krle, in this context, is referring to who --
23    I believe General Major Krstic.
24       Q.   Do you know who this Kocic might be who is referred to also?
25       A.   No, I do not, sir.

 1       Q.   All right.  Let's go to now Exhibit 449 -- excuse me -- 450.  That
 2    is a July 13th conversation.  Now we've come over onto the early morning
 3    of the 13th at 0700 a.m.  What can you tell us about this conversation?
 4       A.   This conversation occurs, again, early morning hours of 13 July.
 5    The correspondent "X" is looking for whom I believe, the first indication
 6      of the name Nikolic, as Captain First Class Momir Nikolic, the Chief of
 7    Intelligence and Security for the Bratunac Light Infantry Brigade.
 8       Q.   Why do you think that?  Nikolic is a fairly common name.
 9       A.   Well, again going into the aspects of the rest of the
10    conversation, we know that Captain First Class Nikolic is, in fact,
11    involved in dealing with the aspects of Muslim people in Potocari on both
12    the 12th and 13th.  Additionally, he's specifically dealing with issues of
13    Muslim wounded males in Bratunac on the 13th.
14       Q.   And how about the reference to the other people there?
15       A.   Jankovic, I believe when we look at it in context with other
16    material, the individual referred to is Colonel Radislav Jankovic, the
17    chief or a member of the Intelligence Administration of the VRS Main
18    Staff.  We make that conclusion -- I make that conclusion in so much as we
19    have his involvement on the meetings with the 11th and the 12th, and we
20    have other messages and orders by him showing his dealing with the actual
21    movement of the population from Potocari out through to Kladanj.  So we
22    know that Colonel Jankovic is extremely well involved in this.
23       Q.   I note in the middle of the page on this conversation that he is
24    introduced as:  "Here's Police Commander Jankovic."  Would that be a MUP
25    guy and not the Main Staff Jankovic?

 1       A.   It is a possibility, yes, sir.
 2       Q.   Okay.  Now, getting closer down to the bottom of the page, maybe a
 3    third down, there's a discussion about:
 4                "About one-third of them have probably been transferred,
 5                about as many as there are."
 6                One-third have been transferred, around about 70 vehicles have
 7                left."
 8            Then:
 9                "Around 5.000?
10                Yes.
11                And you'd say there's another ten?
12                Two-thirds more.
13                10.000."
14            Is that roughly consistent with the numbers and the times and the
15    dates of the people being sent out of Potocari?
16       A.   Certainly within the context of the times it is consistent.  We
17    know that the bus movement stopped in the evening hours of the 12th of
18    July to the hours of darkness and resumed at about 0700 on the morning on
19    the 13th.
20            As for the numbers, I'm not sure that anyone's ever been able to
21    come up with an accurate number of just how many people who were at
22    Potocari and who went through the evacuation or movement process, so I
23    don't know if that's an accurate number or a reflection of the numbers or
24    not.
25       Q.   All right.  Going to page 2 of that conversation, there's more

 1    references to:  "Where's Nikolic," on the third line, and a response is:
 2    "Nikolic went home this morning at half past 3.00."
 3            Does that still appear to be consistent with Momir Nikolic from
 4    the Bratunac Brigade?
 5       A.   Considering the work load and his function, that would be
 6    consistent.
 7       Q.   Now, there's also a general talking in this.  After a while it
 8    says, "Anything else, General?"  And the "Y", who is perhaps the general,
 9    says, "Where is my squad commander?"  Then the conversation goes on, and
10    the person that is the general says, "All right, Jankovic, send me what
11    you have up here since the Main Staff has been to me every six minutes."
12            That is a General.  Who might that be, or what can you tell us, if
13    anything, about that?
14       A.   Clearly on something like this there are many interpretations that
15    could be given.  Looking at this one in context, I believe that the
16    General in question that we're discussing is one of two possibilities.
17    The first one would be General Krstic, and again, the reference to the
18    Main Staff has been bothering "him".  The second would be General Miletic
19    of the Main Staff, who would use the phrase the colloquial phrase "Main
20    Staff" to refer to other individuals of the Main Staff or beyond.  It is
21    very unclear who the General is.
22       Q.   This is the morning of the 13th under your -- by your opinion,
23    General Zivanovic is still the corps commander.  Could this not be General
24    Zivanovic?
25       A.   Again, that is a possibility.

 1       Q.   Sometimes you just can't tell from these things?
 2       A.   That is correct, sir.
 3       Q.   Let's go to 452, 13 July conversation at 1110 hours.  What can you
 4    tell us about this?
 5       A.   In this conversation, clearly Lieutenant Colonel Krsmanovic is one
 6    of the subscribers, we see where we've discussed earlier the aspect of
 7    Krsmanovic having the same nickname as General Krstic did, that nickname
 8    being Krle, K-r-l-e.
 9            Going beyond that, clearly you see Colonel Krsmanovic is the Chief
10    of Transportation deeply involved in the staff work and in the monitoring
11    of the movement of the transportation and the bus fleet for movement from
12    Potocari out.
13            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me, Mr. McCloskey, you said the 13th July
14    conversation?
15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  That's correct.
16            JUDGE RIAD:  Is there no indication?  There's no indication of
17    that.  It says 11 -- is it written down?
18            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I believe, while I know I missed out on that week
19    of intercepts, I believe you should have a binder of the two or three
20    volumes of intercepts that are organised by date and by time and with a
21    large reference sheet.  As you recall from your week with intercepts, many
22    of these intercepts did not have the actual date on them, and so we did
23    not write in the date as we go over the exhibits; but I have my notations
24    from the final conclusions that the operators made, so that's what I'm
25    referring to, but you should have a record of that.

 1            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
 2            MR. McCLOSKEY:
 3       Q.   So looking at the bottom of the page, "Listen, we'll ask UNPROFOR
 4    for fuel, you can count on that."  So they're still low on fuel?
 5       A.   That is correct, sir.
 6       Q.   All right.  Now, that ends the intercept section of Potocari, and
 7    I would like for you to go to Exhibit 453.  And if you could --
 8            MR. McCLOSKEY:  This exhibit has been, Your Honours, has been
 9    developed by the Prosecution as just a wrap-up to help make it clear who
10    some of the main players were that we're seeing in Potocari at the various
11    times on the 12th and 13th, and I would just ask Mr. Butler to make some
12    brief comments on any military aspects of their presence.
13       Q.   So, Mr. Butler, from your review of the videos and witness
14    statements, what can you tell us briefly about the first person that's
15    seen, General Ratko Mladic?
16       A.   Clearly with respect to his presence in Potocari, he is identified
17    by numerous witness [sic] and video as being present in Potocari those
18    dates.
19       Q.   And you've already mentioned General Mladic's -- seemingly his
20    habits with the camera.  Aside from that, can you tell anything from the
21    military command and control function about what his presence on those two
22    days means?
23       A.   Clearly his physical presence there and his engagement there
24    lends, lends the position that this is done under his direction.  Of all
25    the events that are occurring, he is still in command.  He is in command

 1    of the army.  Everything that is happening is happening on the basis of
 2    his instructions.
 3       Q.   And how about Colonel Radislav Jankovic?
 4       A.   Colonel Jankovic, we don't have a physical presence of him in
 5    Potocari on the 12th and 13th.  His physical presence is noted by a
 6    witness, and I'm not sure if he's a protected witness or not, so I won't
 7    identify him.  But he is noted on the 14th by a witness as being involved
 8    with dealing with the UNPROFOR members in diverting fuel that had arrived
 9    and essentially taking the fuel from UNPROFOR.
10       Q.   Perhaps related to the previous intercept where the participants
11    in the conversation said that they would get fuel from UNPROFOR?
12       A.   Yes, sir.
13       Q.   Now, the Drina Corps, and if you could just -- we have five senior
14    officers from the Drina Corps.  If you could go over briefly each one, and
15    could you, again, circle for us on the exhibit that's up there where they
16    are, and then tell us a bit about what their presence there means in a
17    military command context.
18       A.   Again, with the case of General-Major Krstic functioning at that
19    time as the Drina Corps Chief of Staff/Deputy Commander, it would have
20    been his role to essentially coordinate and control and manage the entire
21    process of the assembly of the buses, the movement of the personnel from
22    Potocari all the way up through and out.  And again, all of those duties
23    would have been consistent with his functions as the corps Chief of
24    Staff.
25            General-Major Zivanovic, still performing as the corps commander,

 1    again, his physical presence noted by a witness on the 12th, again giving
 2    guidance and direction but not getting involved in the absolute details of
 3    that.  So again, the corps commander there, the primary two people in
 4    charge of the Drina Corps.
 5            Colonel Svetozar Kosoric, his physical presence noted again on the
 6    12th related to the intelligence collection functions that would be
 7    normally associated with a capture of a large amount of prisoners.
 8            Lieutenant Colonel Popovic as the assistant commander for
 9    security, again, his presence physically noted on the 12th, again
10    performing in his role with the security aspects, management of prisoners,
11    and also further, dealing with the issues of war crimes.
12            Lazar Acimovic as the head or the Assistant Commander for Rear
13    Services, his physical presence noted on 13 July.  The transportation
14    people, who we've discussed earlier, worked directly for him within the
15    confines of that staff, and it's logical, certainly, that he would have
16    been very much involved in the process of the assembly of the buses and
17    all of the other logistical related aspects to make that movement
18    operation of 15.000 people occur.
19            So within the context of the Drina Corps staff, we see the
20    Commander, the Chief of Staff, and two of his three primary Assistant
21    Commanders physically on the ground during the actual movement of the
22    Muslim population from Potocari.
23       Q.   How about Drina Corps units now?
24       A.   Within the context of the Drina Corps units, we have witness
25    testimony that puts elements of the Drina Wolves sweeping through

 1    Potocari, one of the first actions that occurs, on 12 July, from a
 2    security aspect.  And as previously discussed, the Drina Wolves are a
 3    subordinate unit of the Zvornik Infantry Brigade.  We further have
 4    additional footage of elements of the Drina Wolves in Srebrenica on 13
 5    July proper.  Further, looking at the Bratunac Brigade --
 6       Q.   Let me interrupt you for one second.  We'll go into more detail on
 7    the Bratunac Brigade in a few exhibits, but if you could just make your
 8    conclusions on them.
 9       A.   Clearly within the aspect of the Bratunac Brigade, we see the
10    elements of the 2nd and the 3rd Battalion of the Bratunac Brigade as well
11    as at least one member of the command of the Bratunac Brigade present in
12    Potocari on the 12th and 13th as well.  Again, on the ground, considering
13    the military situation, that would have been where they would be expected
14    to be.
15       Q.   And if you could now just talk briefly about the Ministry of
16    Interior people, and then we'll get into some of the exhibits that show
17    their presence and other soldiers in the area.
18       A.   The first individual listed, Dusko Jevic, is identified as a MUP
19    individual by witnesses, and his role is amplified in the interview by
20    Zoran Petrovic pertaining to the move there as a Company Commander of one
21    of the MUP special police companies.  His physical presence is noted on
22    12th July.
23            Lieutenant Colonel Ljubisa Borovcanin is identified as the Deputy
24    Commander of the special MUP Brigade, the Special Police Brigade at Janja,
25    and his physical presence is noted in the Petrovic video in Potocari and

 1    along the road on 13 July.
 2            The individual named Mendljev, nickname Mane, Dzuric, who is
 3    identified as a battalion commander of that same police brigade,
 4    subordinate to Colonel Borovcanin, and his physical presence is also noted
 5    in Potocari on 13 July.
 6       Q.   Okay.  Let's go to some of the video stills that will help
 7    solidify some of this testimony.  Could you go to Exhibit 74 which should
 8    be a still of a fellow with a moustache, I believe to be Jevic.
 9            Could you take your pointer and point out Mr. Jevic or --
10       A.   This individual, Mr. Jevic, who's also nicknamed Stalin, and
11    identified as such by some of the witnesses.
12       Q.   What date is that believed to be taken, that still from the video?
13       A.   This still video was taken 12 July, 1995.
14       Q.   All right.  And do you have another exhibit of Jevic?
15       A.   That would be Exhibit 73.
16       Q.   Thank you.  Same person with General Mladic, same general area,
17    same general time?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   Okay.  Let's go to the next exhibit, should be an Exhibit 185, and
20    it should be a still of Borovcanin?
21       A.   That's marked as Exhibit 185.
22       Q.   Okay, good.
23       A.   This is Lieutenant Colonel Borovcanin.  This is taken on 13 July
24    from the Petrovic video.  It is, in fact, Potocari.  You can see on the
25    extreme right-hand portion partial face of Colonel Kingori, one of the

 1    UNMOs who was present.
 2       Q.   The patch on his left arm, what is that?
 3       A.   That is the very distinctive, we call it in the US army, a
 4    brassard, shown the insignia of the special -- of the Ministry of the
 5    Interior police.
 6       Q.   And has that helped -- that patch helped you identify other
 7    soldiers of the Ministry of Interior in other parts of the video footage?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Okay.  Could you go to the next exhibit which should be 71 and
10    perhaps 72?
11       A.   Exhibit 71.
12       Q.   Can you tell us, do you know who these people are?
13       A.   The individual on the left is the individual identified as the
14    Battalion Commander subordinate, and I just confess his name has escaped
15    me.  If I can go back and review my notes here.  I'm sorry, yes, this is
16    Mendljev Dzuric, D-j or "D" with the diacritic across, who is identified
17    as a Battalion Commander.  Witnesses have also identified that his
18    nickname is Mane.
19       Q.   And that's --
20       A.   I'm sorry.
21       Q.   And that's the same name as the Deputy Municipal Police Commander
22    in Zvornik?
23       A.   That is correct, sir.
24       Q.   Mane Dzuric?
25       A.   That's correct.

 1       Q.   All right.  Do we have another exhibit, I think 72?  Just another
 2    quick shot, perhaps, of Mane the police person, special police person.
 3    Okay, thank you.
 4            Now, I want to take you back just briefly to Krivaja-95, the plan
 5    that designated MUP -- special MUP units as reserves.  You've described
 6    what reserves were, and the Court has seen some of these people on the
 7    stills working in Potocari involved in the deportation aspect of the
 8    case.  Is the work around Potocari that we see the military police -- the
 9    MUP, excuse me, the MUP special police doing, is that consistent or
10    inconsistent with their reserve function?
11       A.   Given the set of circumstances at the time, and as we previously
12    discussed, the issue of most of the army forces being deployed south of
13    Srebrenica on the 12th through the 13th, the fact that the MUP were
14    functioning as the corps reserve and were available to deal with this type
15    of issue, it's very logical to conclude that what this was was, in fact,
16    the use of the corps reserve, those MUP forces, to assist in the dealing
17    with the issues at Potocari.
18       Q.   And again, under Krivaja-95, the Special Police reserves would
19    have been under the command of who on July 12th and 13th?
20       A.   They would have been under the command of the Commander of the
21    Drina Corps.
22            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, this may be a good time to break,
23    because we'll be getting into some six soldiers from the Bratunac that
24    were identified by various witnesses.

 3                          --- On resuming at 2.00 p.m.
 4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. McCloskey.  You may
 5    continue.
 6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
 7       Q.   We were just about to get to the -- discussing the various
 8    Bratunac Brigade officers and soldiers that were witnessed in and around
 9    Potocari on the 12th and 13th of July.  And if we could go to Exhibit 454,
10    which is basically a compilation of the witness testimony that have
11    identified various people.
12            Mr. Butler, if you could just start with the first person and tell
13    us about that person and what you can and what you know about him.
14       A.   Streten Petrovic, according to the roster of the 1st Bratunac
15    Light Infantry Brigade in July of 1995, is the Deputy Commander of the
16    3rd Infantry Battalion.
17            As you will recall from earlier, he is identified on 10 July 1995
18    as being injured in the combat leading up to the capture of Srebrenica on
19    the 11th.  Subsequent information that we have indicates that while on the
20    10th his injuries are described as severe, subsequent to that, information
21    indicates that they were not severe injuries at all and, in fact, they
22    were relatively minor injuries.  He was observed by individuals, as well
23    as in the Petrovic interview he was discussed by name with Petrovic noting
24    his presence in Bratunac, walking around with a sling and a leg bandage.
25            Further to that, on the 17th, as part of what most militaries do

 1    for wounded personnel, there is a medical review board.  In this case, the
 2    Bratunac Brigade one was held weekly, his injuries were not severe enough
 3    to go before that board to determine whether or not he needed to be
 4    medically evacuated to Serbia or needed medical convalescence, leave, or
 5    anything else.  So all of our information indicates the injuries were not
 6    severe and the fact that he returned to duty or at least limited duty
 7    almost immediately.
 8            The second individual --
 9       Q.   Hold on one second.  I want to ask you what, if anything, we can
10    conclude from the presence of a Deputy Commander being present in Potocari
11    on July 13th, militarily.
12       A.   Militarily, his presence there certainly infers that members of
13    the 3rd Battalion, other members subordinate to him, are present as well.
14    Again, Commanders being wherever the bulk of their troops are.
15       Q.   All right.  Let's go to the next person then, Momir Nikolic.
16       A.   Captain First Class Nikolic, again off of that same roster, is
17    identified as the Assistant Commander for Intelligence and Security for
18    the Bratunac Brigade command in the month of July of 1995.  Again,
19    witnesses identify him in Potocari on that date, a representative of the
20    brigade Commander.
21       Q.   Now, what military reason would the Security Intelligence Officer
22    have for being in Potocari on the 12th of July?
23       A.   Essentially the same military applications that the presence of
24    Colonel Popovic and Colonel Kosoric would imply, those being security and
25    intelligence aspects related to the Muslim population there.

 1       Q.   All right.  And how about the next person?
 2       A.   The next person is identified as Sergeant First Class Zoran
 3    Milosavljevic.  He is identified as a member of the Reconnaissance Unit of
 4    the 2nd Battalion, and again as we've discussed earlier, the 2nd and the
 5    3rd Battalions would be the units, based on their positions on the
 6    battlefield, that we would most expect to see in the environment of
 7    Potocari on those days.
 8       Q.   Okay.  And how about the next person?
 9       A.   Individual Slavoljub Grujicic, again a member of the 3rd Infantry
10    Battalion.
11       Q.   And the next one?
12       A.   Soldier Goran Rakic, a member of the brigade Artillery Unit.  A
13    very small unit but, nevertheless, he's identified on that list as a
14    member of the Artillery Unit.  That falls under the brigade command.  So
15    again, it's consistent with what units would be there.
16       Q.   And the last person?
17       A.   I lost my list.  I'm still using it.  The last person is Zoran
18    Spajic.
19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  We're okay with that document.  We've checked it.
20            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  Mr. Butler, you mentioned earlier that we
21    should remember carefully Streten Petrovic.  You mentioned that his father
22    had the biggest moustache.  That's the one?
23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, sir.
24            JUDGE RIAD:  Then why did you ask us to remember him carefully?  I
25    took a note of that.

 1       A.   His physical presence as a member of the Command of the
 2    3rd Battalion, particularly the Deputy Commander for the events that are
 3    happening there, again as an individual soldier, what occurs, and further
 4    for them as a Deputy Commander, his responsibility to control his
 5    subordinate troops.
 6            When we discussed the issue of remember him, it was in context of
 7    his notation that he was injured on 10 July, as we went back to that
 8    10 July 1995 daily combat report.  The issue of remembering him was the
 9    fact that he would show up again, despite his injuries, in Potocari on the
10    12th and the 13th.
11            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
12       A.   Yes, sir.
13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And, Your Honour, in addition, proving Streten
14    Petrovic's presence in Potocari is putting together quite a few dots,
15    which I think we can probably do it in argument, but it depends on at
16    least two different witnesses that remember first names, names of fathers,
17    moustaches, this kind of thing, and I also bring that to your attention
18    because unlike the other identifications, this one relies on a fair amount
19    of circumstantial evidence being put together.
20            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
21       A.   The last individual, Zoran Spajic, again, a member of the 2nd
22    Battalion, 2nd Infantry Battalion, consistent with who we would expect to
23    see there.
24            MR. McCLOSKEY:
25       Q.   Now you've mentioned the roster for the July 1995 Bratunac Brigade

 1    is how you've identified these people.  Was that roster something that was
 2    captured in one of the search warrants of the Bratunac Brigade?
 3       A.   Yes, sir, it was.
 4       Q.   And is that attached as supporting material to your narrative?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I don't have that exhibit number for the
 7    supporting material right now, Your Honours, but we can come up with it,
 8    but it's there.
 9       Q.   Now, Mr. Butler, if -- we have some more exhibits about Potocari
10    and identifying military units.  If you could go on to the next exhibit,
11    which should be 460.  Put that on the ELMO, and tell us what that is.
12       A.   This still is derived from the video, the Petrovic video taken in
13    Potocari on 13 July, 1995.  It is a side shot of an armoured personnel
14    carrier, and what you can see from that number is what they call, the
15    army, the Republika Srpska army, called a Bort number, which essentially
16    is a vehicle identification number.  That number, 10864, matches up from
17    records of the Bratunac Brigade as being -- belonging to their unit.
18            In addition, when you look at the Petrovic video segment of that,
19    one of the individuals on this armoured personnel carrier is, in fact,
20    engaged in a discussion with at least one of the members of the Muslim
21    population in Potocari at the time.
22       Q.   Now, the records that identify this with the Bratunac Brigade, are
23    those, in addition, records captured in the search of the Bratunac
24    Brigade?
25       A.   Yes, sir.

 1       Q.   And are those records also attached to your narrative?
 2       A.   Yes, sir.
 3       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit; I believe it is 461.  If you could
 4    put that on the ELMO.  What's this?
 5       A.   In time sequence, this is off of the same video, literally within
 6    a few seconds as the vehicles pass.  This vehicle is in front of the -- I
 7    believe in front of the armoured personnel carrier.  This is one of the
 8    two TAM rocket launchers that is assigned to the Bratunac Light Infantry
 9    Brigade.
10       Q.   How do you know that?
11       A.   The license plate, even on digital imaginary or digital show, is
12    unclear, but we know from, again, the Bratunac Brigade records that there
13    were two TAM rocket launchers assigned to the brigade.
14       Q.   All right, let's go to the next exhibit.  This should be Exhibit
15    455, and do you know the date of this still, and what it depicts?
16       A.   As with the other two previous stills, this is an extract from the
17    Petrovic video taking in Srebrenica on 13 July, 1995.  The individual in
18    the middle is clearly wearing that arm brassard of the Drina Wolves,
19    subordinate to the Zvornik Infantry Brigade.
20       Q.   All right, let's go to the next exhibit, 456, and I believe this
21    exhibit is to be discussed in combination with 457 which appears to be a
22    patch.  Can you tell us about these two exhibits?
23       A.   Yes, sir.  This still, again extracted from the Petrovic video in
24    Srebrenica on 13 July, the larger sequence seen is the filming of a T55
25    tank going through the town.  As the tank rolls past, for a brief fraction

 1    you are able to see the tank commander in the turret, and what we're
 2    looking at here is the unit patch on his right shoulder.  While it is a
 3    fuzzy photograph and the video does not come in well, the patch design and
 4    shape, particularly with the colouring, is consistent with the patch of
 5    the 2nd Romanija Motorised Brigade of the Drina Corps.
 6            Along a similar vein, going back to the Krivaja-1995 Op plan, the
 7    July Op plan, two units were instructed to bring armoured personnel and
 8    tanks.  One of them was the Zvornik Infantry Brigade; one of them was the
 9    2nd Romanija Motorised Brigade.  On 13 July, 1995, we're able to account
10    for the tanks and the vehicles of the Zvornik Infantry Brigade.  We do not
11    have the detailed records of the Romanija Brigade, so our ability to
12    actually track them on the ground is limited.
13       Q.   Can you just point out where that patch is?  The photo is a bit
14    fuzzy from here.
15       A.   I'll just -- [indicates].
16            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Indicating the right shoulder of the guy in the
17    vehicle.
18       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit, 457.  It should be the patch.
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Now, how does this fit in with the last photograph?
21       A.   If I can put both of them up, the key visual indicator that I use
22    -- there are essentially two.  One of them the white line -- or the black
23    line going up here consistent with the slope of the mountain or hill; and
24    the second, what I refer to as the Pacman phenomenon where you have this
25    pie-shaped slice here, again, consistent with this pie-shaped slice here

 1    on the colouring.
 2       Q.   All right, thanks.  Thank you.
 3            Now, we've gone back to some intercepts on the 13th of July; we're
 4    getting towards the evening.  Exhibit 458, what do you -- what can you
 5    tell us from this intercept, if anything?
 6       A.   What this intercept discusses, and again, we don't know who the
 7    correspondents are, is an issue where somebody is looking first for
 8    Colonel Lazic, who we believe to be Colonel Milenko Lazic, an operations
 9    officer of the Drina Corps.  And further, that same correspondent is
10    asking if Krstic is there, and is being told, "He's in front of the
11    building."  Later on in the conversation it's made clear by the person
12    talking to him that Krstic is here with Mladic.
13       Q.   Sorry, it's not clear where Krstic and Mladic are, but you do
14    believe the message of this intercept is that they are together?
15       A.   That is correct, sir.
16       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit, 459.  This is a document authored by
17    Colonel Jankovic, the person we remember from the meetings, the Main Staff
18    Colonel.  It's dated July 13th, and can you tell us who it's to and what
19    it's about?
20       A.   This order or this report dated 13 July, 1995, is to both the
21    command -- it's to the command of the Drina Corps Intelligence Department,
22    identifying himself as, you know, from the Main Staff or intelligence
23    sector of the Main Staff.  This report essentially is a wrap-up report
24    that discusses the conclusion of the evacuation, as they call it, of the
25    Muslim population; discusses the status of the wounded, and where they

 1    are, and who is with them.
 2       Q.   Okay.  I want to reference you specifically to near the bottom of
 3    the paragraph where it says, "The MUP is stealing on a massive scale from
 4    UNPROFOR.  Today they openly stole their PUH.  They wanted to participate
 5    in the search of their base after the departure of the refugees which I
 6    categorically refused."  What do you take the meaning of that to be in a
 7    military command sense?
 8       A.   In a military command sense, I take that statement to be
 9    indicative of the fact that the MUP is under the command of the army
10    during this aspect.
11       Q.   And this also points out in the beginning right at paragraph 1 the
12    actual time, 2000 hours, date, July 13th, when the evacuation or
13    deportation of the entire Muslim population was completed; is that right?
14       A.   Yes, sir.
15       Q.   All right.  You have described today a bit about the plan that
16    went into the attack on the Srebrenica enclave, Krivaja-95, General
17    Krstic's -- what role he should have played in that as Chief of Staff, and
18    the continuing attack on July 9th of the overall enclave.  What can you --
19    briefly tell us what role General Krstic as Chief of Staff should have
20    played in that.
21       A.   As we previously noted when I gave that briefing at the map,
22    during the period of the operation, on or about the evening of 9 July, the
23    goal of the operation changed from the actual pushing of the Muslims back
24    into the urban area to the actual accomplishing of taking the urban area
25    of Srebrenica.

 1            From a military aspect, while they had most of the base planning
 2    finished, there would have been a planning operation that would have had
 3    to occur to now take into account the actual capture of an urban area,
 4    which is a little bit different militarily than operating over open or
 5    mountainous terrain.
 6            As the Commander on the ground, as General Krstic at the time was,
 7    it would have been his responsibility to ensure that planning aspect took
 8    place by the members of his deployed staff there.  So he would have been
 9    part of that actual operation going into the city.
10       Q.   All right.  And the next subject of the military operation,
11    dealing with all the men and women and children that have crowded around
12    the Potocari base, the period from the evening of the 11th to the 12th and
13    13th, General Krstic, as Chief of Staff, through the afternoon of the
14    13th, what planning role would you expect him to take in dealing with all
15    these people?
16       A.   Certainly when you look at all of the military aspects of things
17    that we know happened or had to have happened to get to the things that we
18    know happened, and then when you put them across the staff functions of a
19    corps command, it is very evident, you know, the planning and the overall
20    coordination process which the Chief of Staff would have had in that
21    specific to the management and movement of the Muslim population, the
22    broad aspects of security and intelligence falling again directly as part
23    of his staff.
24            The physical assembly, the logistical refuelling, the movement,
25    the traffic planning, all of those things which militarily have to occur

 1    to get from point A to point B taken care of by the Rear Services Command,
 2    the Assistant Commander and staff of the Drina Corps, all of these things
 3    have to occur in coordination and in conjunction with the guidance of the
 4    Commander.  So clearly within that process, that falls squarely within the
 5    roles and functions of the responsibility of the corps Chief of Staff.
 6       Q.   From the intercepts that you've discussed today, is it consistent
 7    or inconsistent with General Krstic taking part in the planning and the
 8    execution of the movement or deportation of the people out of Potocari?
 9       A.   They are consistent, sir.
10       Q.   Now, the next military objective on the screen of the Drina Corps
11    after or during the deportation process would be what?
12       A.   In time sequence, the very next one would have been as the Army of
13    Republika Srpska and the Drina Corps command became aware of the 28th
14    Infantry Division moving from Sandici and Jaglici towards Tuzla, would
15    have been the military preparations and coordinations necessary to deal
16    with amounted to a significant military threat.  That manifested itself in
17    many aspects with the coordination with all of the military units and the
18    Special Police Units deployed along those roads.  And the coordination
19    particulary important in ensuring in a very confused military environment
20    like that, absolute criticality of knowing where the friendly soldiers
21    are, your soldiers are, to ensure you do not have incidences where your
22    forces are firing on forces which are yours as well.
23            And in the environment that you had here, moving up along the
24    road, you had units -- two battalions of one unit, you had Special Police
25    forces, you had a Drina Corps Engineer Battalion, you had elements of the

 1    Military Police Battalion of the 65th Protection Regiment, which is
 2    outside the scope of the command of the Drina Corps, going back around you
 3    have elements of the Milici Light Infantry Brigade.  And as the scope and
 4    scale of the Muslim column and the threat became more evident to the VRS,
 5    the additional resources now to include members of the municipal police
 6    quickly being mobilised to deal with that threat.
 7       Q.   Mr. Butler, we'll get into some of the details of that tomorrow.
 8    My question is:  Could we expect General Krstic to have been involved in
 9    the planning and dealing with that issue?
10       A.   Absolutely he would have been.
11       Q.   In addition, the VRS had their sights on other areas at this time,
12    did they not?
13       A.   That is correct.
14       Q.   What's that?
15       A.   While all of this was occurring, they were also starting to plan
16    for now the operation against the UN enclave at Zepa.
17            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, I have one exhibit related to Zepa
18    and then we'll be into an a whole other topic.
19       Q.   Would you have expected on -- well, the days perhaps preceding the
20    attack on Srebrenica or at least at the time of the attack and takedown of
21    Srebrenica, that General Krstic would have been thinking about Zepa and a
22    plan to take Zepa?
23       A.   Yes, sir.
24       Q.   Do we know whether he was involved in the planning aspect of that
25    Zepa operation?

 1       A.   Yes, sir, we do.
 2       Q.   Could you go to Exhibit 483.  It should be the 13 July --
 3       A.   I'm sorry.  Are we at --
 4       Q.   We've got --
 5       A.   Okay.  That's the one.
 6       Q.   -- one that will work.  What is this document?
 7       A.   This document is the Drina Corps command order pertaining to the
 8    base OP planning for setting up of military operations against the Zepa
 9    enclave.
10       Q.   And it's dated 13 July 1995?
11       A.   Yes, sir.
12       Q.   And it's authored by Major-General Krstic, Chief of Staff?
13       A.   Yes, sir.
14       Q.   Are you able to determine anything related to the time that this
15    document was done on the 13th or received or shipped or anything?
16       A.   This document, unlike a lot of the other documents, does not have
17    a date sent or date received stamp on it.  What I've done in examining the
18    document in detail, tried to infer what time it would have been published,
19    and there are, in fact, several indicators in the context of the document
20    where there are clues as to when that could have occur.
21            The first one, if I can direct your attention, will be -- in
22    paragraph 10, command and communications, noted that it's establishing
23    that work at the command post at Krivajic shall begin at 1800 hours on
24    13 July, 1995.  Using that as a start point, we can presume that the order
25    was not published after 1800.

 1            Further, going back in time, if I can direct your attention to the
 2    issue in paragraph 7 of page 3 of the English-language translation, it
 3    discusses, as part of the task allocations, that the 1st Bratunac Light
 4    Infantry Brigade shall allocate a company to join the Milici Infantry
 5    Brigade along an axis of advance and when it was supposed to be available
 6    at a given location.
 7            What we have are documents dated 13 July, as early as 1500 hours,
 8    of the Bratunac Light Infantry Brigade responding to that directive and
 9    informing the command of the Drina Corps that those units will be moving
10    as of 1600 that day.
11            So again, in essence, putting it back in time when you look at the
12    units starting to respond to it and everything else, it is evident that
13    this order was probably published no earlier or, sorry, no later than
14    approximately noon on 13 July 1995.
15       Q.   Do you have an opinion on when this document would have been first
16    begun and the work that went into it established?  Could this have been a
17    last-minute thing?  Does it look like there's planning involved?  What's
18    your opinion on that?
19       A.   There was, in fact, advance planning done on this document.  We
20    start to see initial indications as early as 11 July 1995, as the Main
21    Staff, now aware that successful operations should be occurring in
22    Srebrenica, is starting to plan ahead to the next military operation being
23    Zepa, and we see a series of orders, starting 11 July, where the Main
24    Staff first and then later the command of the Drina Corps is issuing
25    orders to units surrounding Zepa, those primarily the 1st and 5th Podrinje

 1    Light Infantry Brigades, that they should assume maximum combat readiness
 2    to be able to take advantage of the situation now occurring at
 3    Srebrenica.
 4       Q.   I note on page 3 of the document, paragraph 6, there's a mention
 5    of "in coordination with the Protection Regiment," and then it talks about
 6    other things.  What is that about?
 7       A.   As -- when you look at the force layout on the ground, the actual
 8    military or the UN enclave at Zepa is located very close physically to the
 9    Main Staff headquarters in Han Pijesak.  One of the primary functions of
10    the 65th Protection Regiment was the protection of facilities associated
11    with the Main Staff.  Clearly what this order is doing at this stage is
12    it's directing the subordinate brigades of the Drina Corps to coordinate
13    their plans and operations with the battalions of the 65th Protection
14    Regiment that are also surrounding the enclave of Zepa.
15       Q.   From this order, can you tell whether or not the Protection
16    Regiment that's mentioned here would be under the command of the Drina
17    Corps or would be under its own command?
18       A.   Under the terminology of paragraph 6 where it says "in
19    coordination," I can't say that that would be a hard command link.  In
20    fact, in the JNA doctrine in regulations, it discusses the issue of what
21    coordination is, and in this effect, coordination is not command.
22       Q.   All right.  Now if you could go to page 4, paragraph 9(C).  In the
23    middle of it it mentions:  "In coordination with the MUP, all units shall
24    be ready to control and search the field."  So we get this term "in
25    coordination" again with the MUP.

 1            Now, we've heard about the MUP regulations.  Is that any
 2    different, in your analysis?  Does that -- where do you fit in the MUP in
 3    your analysis of whether or not they're under the command of the Drina
 4    Corps or themselves or someone else?
 5       A.   Again, in the context of this paragraph and looking at the
 6    operation order in its entirety, again it's clear that they're discussing
 7    coordinating the security issues with the MUP.  It does not, in this
 8    sense, envision the MUP forces at Zepa as being under the command of the
 9    Zvornik or -- I'm sorry -- the Drina Corps.
10       Q.   All right.  So, finally, you've concluded that General Krstic was
11    obviously involved in the planning of the Zepa operation as well as all
12    the other details that you've talked about; is that correct?
13       A.   Yes, sir.
14            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Your Honour, this is a good time to close, I
15    believe, for the upcoming day tomorrow.
16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, we agree, Mr. McCloskey.
17            As you know, it would be convenient or at least we should seek to
18    finish with the examination-in-chief on Friday.  In relation to this goal
19    and in your judgement and estimation, where do we stand?
20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Well, I'm a little worried, Your Honour.  I wanted
21    to get through a book and a half a day, and I think we got through a half
22    a book, though I'm through a third of my outline.  So perhaps there's some
23    hope, though, as you could tell today, these were some of the most
24    fundamental documents of the case.  We'll see some more tomorrow.  Then
25    we'll be getting into lots of records, but records that perhaps don't need

 1    as much detailed discussion.  So I'm hoping for Friday, but it's hard to
 2    tell.
 3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] It's difficult to finish on
 4    Friday?
 5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  It's difficult to give you a very good estimate.
 6    I would love to finish by Friday, and we'll certainly give it our best
 7    effort.
 8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] How much time would you need to
 9    finish on Friday in order to be able to finish on Friday?  How much more
10    time would you need?  Perhaps I could go a little further.  The Chamber
11    cannot sit on Friday after 2.00, which means, and I'm asking
12    Madam Registrar to take note of this, that we must sit as from 9.00 on
13    Friday to make up for the difference.  Another possibility is to sit for
14    longer hours tomorrow afternoon, a little later tomorrow afternoon.  So
15    the time that you need can be perhaps envisaged for tomorrow afternoon.
16            So I think it is really time -- it is really desirable for us to
17    finish on Friday because we're going on to another case.  We are not going
18    on holiday; we're continuing to work.  Therefore, perhaps we should really
19    do everything to finish with the examination-in-chief this week so that
20    the Defence can prepare for its cross-examination.
21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  I absolutely agree with
22    that.  I'm -- unfortunately, I think realistically and I know the
23    documents that we have to go through and I know how important they are in
24    the case, I think it's probably more realistic to look to finishing the
25    direct in our next session.

 1            I know we don't have a real crowded next session, as far as I'm
 2    aware, and so there'll be plenty of time to finish the direct, I believe,
 3    and finish the entire case in that next two-week session.  We have General
 4    Danitt [phoen], and perhaps another citizen witness, but -- and perhaps
 5    something I've forgotten.
 6                          [Prosecution counsel confer]
 7            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And some victim impact witnesses, as recall us
 8    mentioning.
 9            So it doesn't look like a real full two weeks.  So I hate to
10    get -- I don't want to get the anticipation that we can finish on Friday.
11    I wish we could, but the documents that are here are so important that I
12    think we're going to have to go through them slowly.  When I find myself
13    hurrying a bit, I find that I miss some things.
14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] All right.  You are quite
15    right.  We will keep this objective in mind, and I will ask the registrar
16    to be ready to extend hearing time tomorrow if after re-evaluation we
17    consider there is a possibility of concluding on Friday.  If we see that
18    that is not possible at all, then we will work according to regular
19    working hours.
20            But in any event, on Friday we will be sitting from 9.00 rather
21    than 9.30, and we will finish at 2.00 instead of 2.30.
22            Madam Registrar, is there any problem with these working hours?
23            THE REGISTRAR:  A priori there will be no problem.  We just need
24    to take rather strict measures to ensure the transfer of the accused to
25    the Tribunal at 9.00.

 1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Can we have your response
 2    tomorrow?
 3            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] We have to know also until when
 4    you intend to sit tomorrow.  We'll see tomorrow.
 5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] No.  For the moment, Friday is
 6    sure that we want to sit from 9.00 to 2.00.  Can we have the response from
 7    you tomorrow?
 8            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes.  You will have the reply
 9    tomorrow, Mr. President.
10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.  Thank you very
11    much.  We will do our best to make progress with this case.  That is
12    always our concern, as you know.  So we will meet again tomorrow at 9.30.
13    If we come to the conclusion that it is realistic to complete the direct
14    by Friday, then we can envisage the possibility of working a little longer
15    in the afternoon.  If not, we will stick to our regular hours.  Until
16    tomorrow.
17                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 2.37 p.m.
18                          to be reconvened on Thursday, the 29th day of
19                          June, 2000, at 9.30 a.m.
