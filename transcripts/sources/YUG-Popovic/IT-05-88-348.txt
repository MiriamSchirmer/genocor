 3                          [The accused entered court]
 4                           --- Upon commencing at 9.06 a.m.
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  Madam Registrar, good morning to you.  If you could
 6    kindly call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Good morning, Your Honours.  This is case number
 8    IT-05-88-T, the Prosecutor versus Vujadin Popovic et al.
 9            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you, ma'am.  And of course good morning to all
10    of you.  For the record, all the accused are here.  From the Defence
11    teams, I only notice the absence of Mr. Ostojic.  The Prosecution is
12    Mr. McCloskey and Ms. Janisiewicz.
13            And when we are in closed session, I also put on the record -- I
14    will put on the record other presences.
15            Now, after a busy weekend, we are pleased to give you some good
16    news.  And that is basically that I can see the blissful anticipated
17    sensation on the part of Mr. Meek.  I'm not referring to that, Mr. Meek.
18    Later on this week, we will be handing down our decision on the
19    admissibility of the Borovcanin statement.  The other good news is that
20    tomorrow, instead of sitting in the afternoon, we will be sitting in the
21    morning, and the same applies for Thursday.  I've just -- when I say I,
22    it's we -- we just succeeded in having the Thursday sitting moved to the
23    morning, so basically this afternoon -- this week, from an afternoon
24    sitting week, we have transformed it into a fully morning week.
25            That's all.  We are still thinking on the -- your request about a

 1    break, which you say you need between when we finish with this witness and
 2    when we start with the other one who is equally going to engage us in --
 3    we are having difficulties, to be frank with you, but we are also doing
 4    our utmost to try and accommodate you knowing that, as Mr. Meek put it,
 5    this is not for the purpose of having a holiday.  But we do have
 6    difficulties.
 7            So I'll come back to you, the first or the second break.  Thank
 8    you.
 9            So let's -- one moment, please.
10                          [Trial Chamber confers]
11            JUDGE AGIUS:  Are there any preliminaries?  None.  Okay.  Let's go
12    into closed session, please.  And bring the witness in.
