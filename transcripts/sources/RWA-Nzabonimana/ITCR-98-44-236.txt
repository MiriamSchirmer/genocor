P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 17th of February 2006 for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Can we simply say that the appearances are the same?
MR. MORLEY:
May I also add to the record Mr. Lombardi, who was not here yesterday, but he is here today?  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  Unfortunately, my client is not able to be here with us because he is unwell.  I would like to say -- make some clarifications. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  You may proceed.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
The situation, Mr. President, is that my client has been ill for a fortnight or so, because when I came to Arusha, I found that he was ill.  Since this week and a little before -- before last -- before this week, with the help of Mr. Hometowu, we have tried to find him a doctor, in vain.  Yesterday Mr. Hometowu tried to reach a neurologist, but, unfortunately, he was unable to do so.  The fact, however, is that apparently the efforts that he made to be present at Court couldn't be continued today, which is why I discovered this morning that he was unable to be here.  And I believe Mr. Hometowu has been informed by UNDF that my client is unwell and he cannot be here this morning. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, indeed, the registry received a telephone call, as well as an e-mail, from the UNDF, informing us that Édouard Karemera is sick, and he will be unable to attend today's Court proceedings.  The registry is also taking all necessary actions to ensure that he sees the doctor.  And, unfortunately, he insisted that he wanted to meet Dr. Epée, who we are told is not at the duty station at the moment.  He also wants to see a neurologist, and we are doing all we can to ensure that he sees the neurologist.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Ms. Diagne, would you be willing to continue the proceedings in his absence?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Unfortunately, no, Mr. President.  I'm sorry to say this.  Since I have not been able to speak to him and since I just found out this morning that he's not able to attend Court, I think I would be going beyond my duties if I were to proceed to represent him in his absence.  I believe that the Trial Chamber will understand perfectly the situation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we would like you to take instructions because the Trial Chamber can sit in the absence of the Accused persons, under certain circumstances.  And -- but we would prefer if you -- we'll give you some time, if you will consult with him, as we would think that his interests can be adequately protected in a matter of this nature.  So I don't know -- Mr. Registrar.  

Yes.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I shall do as you ask.  I shall try to contact my client and get instructions from him, but I should like to recall the provisions of Article 24(D) of the Statute of the Tribunal.  I mention this because you said that nothing should -- can prevent the Trial Chamber from continuing to sit in the absence of my client.  This is not how I see -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne --
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, to display my goodwill, I shall consult with my client. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, I did not say that nothing can prevent the Trial Chamber from sitting in the absence of your client.  I said that that there are certain circumstances under which we can sit in his absence.  It is quite different to how you heard it.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, perhaps it may have been a translation problem, because this is what I heard.  However, thank you.  And I shall consult my client and report back to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
If it assists Your Honour, and perhaps my learned friend defending, could the witness take off his headphones for a moment, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And close his microphone.  
MR. MORLEY:
And could he also switch off his microphone?  It may be that Your Honours will have to make a decision about proceeding this morning, and it would be of assistance to know that this witness is going to give material evidence against Karemera.  He's not oblique; he is directly on point in respect of Karemera's involvement within the MRND, his later appointment to the ministry of the interior, and I anticipate that much of that evidence is going to come out today.  It may help the Trial Chamber to know that this witness is directly relevant to the ears of Mr. Karemera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you for that information, Mr. Morley.  

But, Ms. Diagne, we will still give you some time.  How much time will you need -- we will rise now.  About what -- how much time do you think you would require?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, with the assistance of CMS, I will try to see how I can reach my client as quickly as possible, because I may not need to go to UNDF.  I do not know whether the telephone will be sufficient for me to consult with my client.  So I wonder exactly how I should proceed, which means that, for the time being, I cannot tell the Trial Chamber how long it will take.  But I shall contact CMS immediately, to see how we can save time.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, it is possible to reach the UNDF by telephone, so I would propose that I would assist lead counsel to do so, as soon as the trial -- the Chamber adjourns.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, in view of the information provided by Mr. Morley, we think that the better course would be to adjourn until Monday morning.  So we will not be -- we will take the adjournment now until Monday morning.  We would expect you to continue liaising with Mr. Hometowu, registry, so that we could be fully informed of your client's condition.  We would want to get information about what his condition is.  But we will take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning -- until Monday morning.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I thank you.  I was hoping you would have -- take that decision, but I did not wish you to think that I was not willing to go and consult with my client.  But when the Prosecutor made his remarks, I thought -- I wondered whether it would be wise to seek to have my client here.  I thank you for your wisdom.  

The second request I'd like to make of the Court is that -- is to ask -- I want to ask whether it is possible for you to do something because it's been a fortnight since the client is trying to see a specialist to help him in his health problem.  I have tried to intervene at the level of the UNDF command, but I'm afraid I haven't had much influence, and I would really like to us make some progress there.  So I was wondering whether it was possible, or welcome, for the Bench to do its own bit so that Mr. Karemera will be able to see the specialist that he requires to address his health problems.  And that is a special request that I make of you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have already spoken with the registrar and indicated our concern that the best care is provided immediately, and we will continue to monitor the situation and see to what extent we could use our good offices to assist.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, thank you very much again for your assistance in this matter.  We think this probably is the wisest course to adopt now, and we take the adjournment until Monday morning.  
(Court adjourned at 0919H)
