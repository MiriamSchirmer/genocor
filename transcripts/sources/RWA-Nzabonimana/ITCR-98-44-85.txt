Examination-in-chief by Mr. Webster (continued).............................................................................11



P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber is now in session.  Good morning to the parties. 

We can bring the witness in.  There are no motions.  Yes, let's bring the witness in. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, before we bring the witness in.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I have some motions that I would like to take probably no more than ten minutes to run through seven items before we start. 

The first item -- the first two items, I just want to make a very clear record for the Appeals Chamber, so I want to indicate that we object to continuing the trial until the resolution of the preliminary motions, and the motions for disqualification.  That's point No. 1. 

Point No. 2, just to be clear so that there is no doubt, I would like it reiterated that I did make a request to make a supplemental opening statement.  I don't believe the Trial chamber explicitly denied that request, but obviously I wasn't given the opportunity to make one and the witness started.  So I think it should be clear for the record for the Appeals Chamber that I made that request and the request was denied.  If I am in error on that, you can so inform me. 

The third matter is I would like to make a request for certification to appeal your decision denying my motion to dismiss relating to the competence of the Trial Chamber and the jurisdiction under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, and that was a motion that you decided on the 29th of March.  I am making this oral request for certification because I understand that it's the rule in this Trial Chamber that while the trial is in session you don't want any written motion.  And I only seek certification of one aspect of this decision, which is the imposition of sanctions against me pursuant to Rule 73(F).  

With respect to the substance of your decision, I believe I have a right to an appeal pursuant to 
	Rule 72 without asking your permission, and I'll be taking that appeal directly to the Appeals Chamber.  But on the issue of the sanctions, it's unclear whether that can be part of a jurisdictional appeal, and so I ask that you certify that issue for interlocutory appeal.  And I simply want to note my position that those sanctions are unwarranted and that the same motion was made in the Kanyabashi case, the very same argument was ruled on, without any sanctions or any indication that such a motion was frivolous, and in that case they elected not to bring the matter to the Appeals Chamber and to appeal, so the matter has never been decided by the Appeals Chamber.  But I think that the penalty, to me, by your decision was unwarranted, and I would like to appeal -- have the opportunity to appeal that. 

With respect to the criteria of certification for appeal, I suggest that a resolution of this appeal is necessary before the final judgement because it affects the ability of Mr. Nzirorera to have a fair trial.  The imposition of unwarranted sanctions against counsel diminishes the rights of the Accused to a vigorous defence and it puts the financial interest of counsel in conflict with the interests of the Accused.  Mr. Nzirorera wants me to make motions such as disqualification of the Trial Chamber, and if I have to weigh my own financial situation versus his rights, I think that puts me in an impossible position, and that's an issue that goes to the right of a fair trial, and it should be decided by the Appeals Chamber.  I believe that it would also materially advance the proceedings to have the matter determined before the judgement, because this appears to be a recurring problem.  There's been five times now that the Trial Chamber has imposed sanctions against me, none of which I believe are warranted.  I believe that the matter has to be ruled -- decided before we spend another two years in which I have to worry about my bills.  So that's my motion. 

My next request is for certification of your appeal in which you decided that the motion I had filed concerning the status of the ad litem Judges and their ability to review an indictment, that was denied also on the 29th of March.  And I simply -- I ask again that you allow me to appeal this issue before the trial is concluded, an interlocutory appeal.  I have to say that it will -- it's the kind of issue that, if you're wrong, then the confirmation or the review of this indictment and this whole process that's going on now will be a nullity.  And I contend, respectfully, that you are wrong.  

And if you had given me a chance to reply to the Prosecutor's response before you decided the motion, I think I could have drawn your attention to three decisions of different Trial Chambers and Judges which are in conflict with your interpretation that Article 18 doesn't apply to review of an amended indictment.  And those decisions begin with the Milosevic case, the decision of 
Judge David Hunt on the 29th of June 2001, upon confirmation of an amended indictment, in which he invoked Article 18 as the Statute that applies to his review of the amended indictment.  And I again remind you that Article 18 says that under Rule 12 quarter -- Article 12 quarter of the Statute, ad litem Judges are not allowed to review indictments.  

And the second authority is the decision of Prosecutor v. Casimir Bizimungu, a decision of 12 February 2004, and in the separate opinion of Judge Pocar, he also says that the confirmation of an indictment, an amended indictment, is pursuant to Article 18 of the Statute. 

And then the decision of Prosecutor v. Kabiligi on the 8th of October 1999, in which the separate opinion of Judge Dolenc concludes also that the procedure for an amended indictment is a review pursuant to Article 18 of the Statute.  

And so I ask that you allow an appeal of this issue and an appeal of the sanctions that you imposed upon me because you thought this was a frivolous motion, and I would simply say that if I'm frivolous in bringing this argument, I'm at least in good company, since Judges Hunt, Dolenc and Pocar have the same view as I, and I would ask that this be reviewed by the Appeals Chamber at the earliest opportunity. 

My next point is to ask what indictment we are being tried on in this case.  I note that corrections were suggested at the initial appearance, by Mr. Webster, on the 23rd of February.  I received yesterday a document in French which appears to be some kind of another amended indictment of -- dated in March.  I haven't received anything in English, and I would like it clarified just exactly which indictment it is that this trial is proceeding on. 

My next point is I would like to ask for time to prepare the cross-examination of Witness GFA before I begin.  You've indicated earlier, yesterday, that we would have -- that some accommodation would be made for the disclosure problems that exist with respect to Witness GFA, and it's not clear to me what you have in mind.  Because I believe that -- I've indicated that there are nine statements in this witness's file in Ruhengeri that have not been disclosed, and perhaps they're in the box in 
Mr. Webster's office that just arrived, or perhaps they're in the box that's on its way, but in any event, I believe those are essential to my cross-examination, and I would ask that this disclosure be made first and my cross-examination commence after I have complete disclosure, as is envisioned by the Rule. 

And, finally, my last point is a problem that occurred in the last session that I would like to just -- like to address, and that is my view that I have an obligation to confront a witness with information I have from other people which I will bring -- who I will bring as witnesses before this Trial Chamber, when the Defence case commences.  I tried on several occasions in the last session to confront these witnesses with the information from others so that the witness could have a fair opportunity to comment on that information before I brought it in the Defence case.  And you consistently sustained objections to that procedure and didn't allow any of the questions to be answered. 

I would just like to point out that in the Kajelijeli case judgement on December 1st, 2003, at paragraph 157, the Trial Chamber said that "The Chamber finds that there were many instances in which the Defence made no reference to these allegations about Prosecution witnesses during 
cross-examination of these witnesses, thus not giving the witness an opportunity to answer on the record.  This factor has been taken into account by the Chamber in making its findings on the Defence attack on the credibility of Prosecution witnesses."  

And they went on to indicate that because of the lack of ability of these witnesses to comment on the allegations, they rejected the Defence's attack on the credibility.  And I would like to have -- and I intend to ask these witnesses -- continue to ask these witnesses things so that I'm able to confront them about materials which I know I'm going to bring evidence about.  And I just want to point out the jurisprudence of this situation so that, when I do that, you have that in mind before making your ruling. 

And thank you for listening to me this morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Robinson.  

Now we give the floor to the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'd like to respond to a few of the points made by Mr. Robinson.  In reference to his argument under Article 18 of the Statute, my recollection is that the Government II decision that he refers to where Judge Pocar filed a separate opinion, Judge Pocar was not addressing the principles articulated under Article 18; he was simply addressing the issue of providing supporting materials for the amended indictment prior to the initial appearance of -- with the Prosecutor's application.  So it's a very different argument.  The Judge may have been referring to Article 18, but he was not making a very broad statement about which Article governs the amendment of an indictment.  It was really a procedural issue and it had to do with how the Prosecutor goes forward with making an application to amend the indictment.  

So while I acknowledge that there was that separate opinion, which certainly is not binding on this Court, it was a very different argument.

With respect to the other decisions, I would like the Court to allow me to look at some of the references that the Defence made and perhaps complete my argument after the morning session or tomorrow morning.  But I would maintain that the argument is the same:  A mere reference to Article 18 certainly is not a ruling by the Court or an indication of a split in the jurisprudence of the separate Trial Chambers or the Judges that Article 18 prevents an ad litem Judge from participating in the decision to amend an indictment.  

Fundamentally, what is at issue is whether an ad litem Judge would have the power to cause the arrest of a suspect, and I think that's really the issue that this Court needs to be concerned with.  My argument is that the Security Council did not want ad litem Judges to participate in procedures that would lead to the arrest of individuals, to usurping the freedom of movement of suspects.  That is a power that is reserved to the permanent Judges of the ICTR, and that's the issue that this Court needs to concern itself with.  

As we all know, these four defendants were already in custody.  This Trial Chamber has simply reviewed Prosecutor's application to amend.  There is nothing in the decisions that were issued by this Trial Chamber that disturbs the jurisprudence that is already in place.  I would argue that there is no appellate issue and there is no reason to certify that application for appeal.  It is not going to determine a fundamental issue at trial.  There is a two-pronged test under Rule 73 bis, I believe.  But in any case, the application made by the Defence does not meet the test of whether it would determine an issue in the trial or expedite the delivery of justice in this case. 

With respect to the indictment that was filed yesterday -- excuse me, or I believe it was actually two days ago; Mr. Robinson may only have received it yesterday -- that is a French translation, a revised French translation, of the 18th of February.  It's the same indictment that was read in open court on the 23rd of February.  There is no new amendment.  Certain corrections were made orally during the initial appearance.  Those corrections were entered into the record.  The registrar was ordered to read the indictment in open court with the corrections.  Those corrections were incorporated in the French text that was served on the Defence.  

When we engaged in that initial appearance, I made it clear that the language section had been rushed in their translation of that indictment and that we wanted to revise the translation for stylistic revisions.  It had nothing to do with the substance of the allegations, with any of the text itself of the indictment; it was simply to generate a much more elegant translation of the English.  It is the English text that governs.  That is the original indictment.  That is the indictment that was signed by the Prosecutor.  That is the indictment that governs this trial.  And if there is ever any question of interpretation between the English original and the French translation, of course it will be the English original that governs.  

So there is no new indictment.  It is simply a translation that has been revised to make it more elegant.  I made a special application to the language section to do that because I took note of the fact that this Court works primarily in French and I wanted the best available French translation so that it would be made available to the Court and to the parties. 

On the issue of the questions that can be put to a witness in cross-examination, my recollection is that during the first trial session, I made a number of objections.  Those objections were because there was not enough foundation laid for the questions that were being raised or put to the witness by the Defence.  If the Defence asks appropriate questions, even if I object, the Court will overrule them.  The Court has done that in the past. 
There is -- in regard to the comments that Mr. Robinson made concerning the Kajelijeli judgement, I would state that they are not apposite, they are not on point.  If appropriate questions are being asked in cross-examination, the witness will be allowed to answer; I'm sure the Court will instruct the witness to answer.  And we have to take each question on a case-by-case basis.  I think it is improper to ask the Court to make a blanket ruling at this stage, and I'm sure, when the witness is on the stand, 
Mr. Robinson will ask whatever questions he wants and then the Court will rule appropriately. 

I believe I've addressed the issues that were raised, and having done that, if the Court needs further discussion on the issue of Article 18, I would be happy to complete my submission later on this afternoon or tomorrow morning, but with that, I am ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Roach, you had something to say? 
MR. ROACH:
Just briefly, Madam President. 

I should like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague, Mr. Robinson.  In particular, I want to express my agreement with his position that, in cross-examination, a witness should be -- and should be allowed -- we should be allowed to confront the witness with any testimony that we have, and that we know, so that the witness would have an opportunity to comment on it.  This is a usual procedure in criminal law and this is one that is required in -- at least in my jurisdiction.  

I am not asking at this time for any blanket kind of decision.  I agree with my friend the Prosecutor that we have to deal with matters on a case-by-case basis.  But generally, the principle is that if Defence knows about a particular event or is going to be calling a witness to contradict the witness under cross-examination, that that should be disclosed during the time of the cross-examination. 

Those are my remarks, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, Your Honours, just two very brief matters.  First of all, a question of notification for the Court.  I would just like to draw the Court's attention to one fact.  The Court will know that on the 24th of March the Defence team for André Rwamakuba submitted a preliminary motion on lack of jurisdiction relating to the applicability of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise to the crime of genocide. 

On the 29th of March, which was Monday, the Prosecution submitted a response to that motion.  I would just like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that we are submitting a reply to that response, which we intend to submit today.  It's just so that the Court is aware that there's another document on its way.  That's the first matter. 

Secondly, we are grateful to the Prosecution for going to the trouble of producing this list of names which can perhaps assist us post facto on spelling.  Of course, the difficulty is that it is just a list of names, and I would like to remind the Court that, Madam President, you, yesterday, suggested that when testimony is given, that the names of persons who are not obviously known by all of us are spelt out.  It's extremely difficult when taking a note to take down a name properly, and even with this list post facto, we may have taken down a name so improperly that we can't actually associate it with the list.  So I would request that the Prosecution please resume the procedure of taking the question of names more slowly and spelling -- asking the witness to spell the names out. 

Those are the two matters.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, there's just one other matter.  Could I add to, very briefly?  Quite a different matter, and that is that we have observed from time to time that Mr. Robinson has been subjected to penalising costs orders.  Now, it may well be that we all recognise Mr. Robinson as Monsieur Enquête.  There have been a large number of motions but, talking to him, I'm aware that in fact those motions have been put in in good faith on his part, and even if the Court strongly disapproves -- or disagrees, rather, with the arguments that are raised, it might be that it should only be in the most exceptional circumstances that financial penalties should follow.  

There is no such penalty, for example, for what is essentially seen, I suppose, as wasted time.  I suppose that's where it comes from, from the Prosecution, anyway.  I know that point's already been made.  But we're also aware that it's very difficult for Mr. Robinson really to argue his own corner in respect of this.  It places an unfair burden on him.  And I know I speak for all Defence counsel here that we have perhaps felt that there has been an overuse, with respect, of a penalising costs order in respect of Mr. Robinson, given that we recognise that he has been acting in good faith and also recognising his particular position in the case.  And we feel that it's appropriate that these words are mentioned, and I hope you appreciate the reasons for doing so.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, just one question regarding the nine witness statements; Witness GFA, I mean.  You did say something, but according to Mr. Robinson, you did not disclose these statements. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We're simply relying on Mr. Robinson's representation on that point, Your Honour.  He made an application to obtain nine statements that he claims were mentioned in a previous Defence motion in the Kajelijeli trial.  At that time Witness GFA was anticipated as a rebuttal witness for the Prosecution.  That application was denied, so he never testified in the Kajelijeli trial.  But in the course of arguing the Prosecutor's application to bring GFA as a rebuttal witness, I believe it was the Defence in the Kajelijeli trial that created a list of nine previous statements that this witness is alleged to have made in Rwanda. 

We have disclosed everything that we have in relation to GFA.  We have disclosed, I believe there are six, if I'm not mistaken, six statements that he made to the OTP.  He also made a plea in the Rwandan justice system.  That statement was disclosed both in French and in English and in the original Kinyarwanda, but Mr. Robinson is still looking for the nine statements that he saw listed in a Defence motion from another trial.  

This office has gone to great pains to try to obtain all of the previous statements that our witnesses have made to Rwandan authorities.  This Court ordered us to do so, and we took that order quite seriously.  I myself travelled to Ruhengeri, to the prosecutor's office, in an effort to obtain these statements.  I was in an office in Ruhengeri with files all around me, but I was not allowed to go through these files because the local prosecutor in Ruhengeri wanted that procedure to be authorised from Kigali.  So while I was in Ruhengeri, I was assured of the cooperation of the Ruhengeri prosecutor, but they were awaiting some sort of authorisation from Kigali.  So I was not able to go through those files at that time, but I was assured that copies of the files would be sent to me.  I've made numerous attempts to remind the Rwandan prosecutor general of our obligation to comply with the Court order, which was to make best efforts to obtain these statements, which we have done.  

After numerous phone calls, e-mails and official correspondence from the deputy prosecutor to the Rwandan prosecutor general, we finally have received a box of materials.  My understanding is that it took three days of work around the clock to make copies of these materials.  There are two boxes of these materials, one of which has already arrived in Arusha.  It arrived on Friday.  I called the head of general services on Saturday.  He sent someone into the office on Saturday to make sure that that box was delivered to me.  When I opened the box, I expected to find files that were organised, alphabetised, that would allow me to fish in the files and find what I was looking for.  That was not the case.  

I've tried to look for the statements of Witness GFA.  It is going to take some time to do that.  I will continue with my efforts this afternoon, and whatever I find, I will disclose to the Defence.  I'd like to remind the parties and the Trial Chamber that all of this material is in Kinyarwanda.  It's difficult to even understand what document is referring to what witness because, unlike an OTP statement where the name of the witness is at the top of the page, you have to read into the statement in Kinyarwanda in order to find the name of the witness.  So we are working on it.  

I've requested assistance from Kinyarwanda speakers in my office to go through these files, and as soon as we locate the statements of GFA or any other Prosecution witness, they will be made available to the Defence in the original language, Kinyarwanda.  We cannot undertake an obligation to provide those materials in French or English at this time.  It is simply impracticable.  But we are doing everything we can to comply with our disclosure obligations as ordered by this Court. 

Now that I have the floor, I would like to make one additional comment.  I didn't want to extend these arguments unnecessarily before, but since I'm standing up, in response to Mr. Roach, I quite agree that if the Court rules on objections to -- that there should be no blanket ruling in terms of how this Court should approach cross-examination of witnesses.  It should be done on a case-by-case basis.  But if we were to follow the arguments advanced by Mr. Roach and Mr. Robinson, this Court would have to listen to any question put by the Defence if it's premised or couched as, "Well, this is something that a witness told me, and this witness is coming to Court."  How would this Court be able to examine that without a list of witnesses that are being called by the Defence or without some foundation?  So I'm saying that it's simply not enough to say, "I have a statement or I have information that is coming from a prospective Defence witness and I'm going to put a question to a Prosecution witness on that basis."  There has to be a foundation.  And that was the basis of my objection during the last Court session.  As long as there is such foundation, and that foundation may be an offer of proof or a list of witnesses that is handed up to the Court or something, not simply an assertion that "I have information from somewhere," without identifying the source of the information or any indicia of reliability about the information, and take the cross-examination of a witness in areas that are -- that may not be probative for this Court.  

But as both Mr. Robinson -- excuse me, Mr. Roach and I agree, this is something that the Court can handle on a case-by-case basis when the witnesses are put -- when the questions are put to the witness.  This Court will have an opportunity to make specific rulings to specific questions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Mr. Robinson, very briefly, please.  Very, very briefly. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  Two points:  No. 1, I was unaware of the efforts that Mr. Webster had made to obtain the statements in Rwanda, and I want to express that I appreciate those efforts and I thank him for undertaking those efforts to obtain these statements. 
No. 2, apart from the issue of fault, delay, just look at the circumstances.  To have nine statements of a witness not disclosed before cross-examination just is not practical, and so I'm asking the 
Trial Chamber to postpone the cross-examination of this witness until Mr. Webster has had a chance to go through his boxes.  Then we can bring him back for cross-examination, maybe next week or whenever these materials are obtained, and in lieu of that, let's bring in the next witness and have the direct testimony of the next witness taken instead of requiring us to cross-examine a witness when we don't have the materials.  

And I would further represent that these statements are from 1995 through 1999, at a time when this witness was denying many of the events which he's now claiming took place, and so the impeachment value is very strong.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, please, how much time do you still need for your cross-examination in chief of Witness GFA? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I expect the direct examination to be completed today, Your Honour.  We will not go into tomorrow.  But I can't -- it depends on how long it takes to review the videotapes and certain photographs that I would like to place before the witness.  But I have at least another hour or so of questions, and then to admit certain exhibits.  I would think -- yes, I was hoping that we would finish by the first half of the morning, but clearly that's not going to happen since we're already at ten to ten. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Very well.  We are going to proceed and then we shall see, if need be -- requiring the need for more time regarding the nine statements which apparently have not yet been located by the Prosecutor, despite his searches.  You said that you're going to proceed with your searches, and that if you find any, you will disclose them.  

Nonetheless, it is obvious that we need to proceed and that we shall see, towards the end of the examination-in-chief, concerning the other problems that have been raised, and we shall see the matter concerning certification of the appeal and what has been said also today, but that does not inhibit us from proceeding, as we have said yesterday, with the examination-in-chief of this witness.  

And we are asking you, Mr. Prosecutor, can we have your witness ushered in?  Is he ready? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would assume that he's in the waiting room.  I have no contact with the witness after he starts his testimony, but I would imagine that he's waiting to be called in.  So we can proceed if the registry goes and looks in the waiting room. 

But just to add a final comment to the response of the Court, there is no guarantee that this witness has made nine previous statements to Rwandan authorities.  That is what the Defence represents.  Mr. Robinson is getting that information from another Defence motion.  No one has said, not even the Rwandan authorities, that there are nine previous statements of this witness.  So it would be a mistake if I went along and sort of acquiesced in that representation so that this Court would expect me to produce nine statements.  No one knows how many statements this witness has made to Rwandan authorities.  If there's one statement in this huge box, that's all I have -- that will be all I have, and that will be what I disclose to the Defence.  I can only produce what has been delivered to me.  

The obligation on the Prosecutor is to make best efforts.  I don't think my efforts could have been any better.  Whatever we have, we will serve on the Defence, but there's no guarantee that, after going through all these materials, we will have nine statements of GFA to disclose. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber has taken due note of what you have said and invites you to continue with your search.
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  We remind you what we told you yesterday, and we also wish to remind you that you're still under oath. 

Mr. Prosecutor, please proceed with your examination-in-chief of this witness.  Mr. Prosecutor, over to you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you. 
WITNESS GFA, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I'd like to begin today by clarifying a couple of points from your testimony yesterday.  You mentioned yesterday that certain authorities had participated in a meeting at the Mukingo bureau communal after the second Inkotanyi attack; you had described a meeting and the gathering of the population.  Of those authorities that you saw at this meeting, can you tell us which ones were associated with the military and which ones were associated with the government?  If you could name them, please. 
A.	Yes, I can repeat those names.  As for the soldiers, I can mention Colonel Ntibitura, 
Colonel Bizimungu -- at least at the time he was a Colonel.  There was Major Bizabarimana.  As for the bourgmestres, there was Bourgmestre Kajelijeli; there was Préfet Nzabagerageza; there was Joseph Nzirorera; there were also conseillers of secteurs, in particular, Ndisetse.  I do not know the names of the other conseillers.  As for the other authorities present at the meeting, I was unable to know their names. 

There was also Jean-Damascène Niyoyita, who was headmaster of the Mukingo primary school.  At the time, he was also the MRND chairman in Mukingo commune.
Q.	Would you mind giving us the spelling of Jean-Damascène Niyoyita?
A.	N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A, Niyoyita, Jean-Damascène. 
Q.	Did Jean-Damascène Niyoyita have any other status in Mukingo commune, aside from being the headmaster of the school? 
A.	I said that he was an inspector of the primary school in Mukingo, but at the same time he was also chairman of the MRND in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	You mentioned a Corporal Bizabarimana.  Can you tell us -- Major Bizabarimana, yes. 
A.	It was Major Bizabarimana.  He was the one who was the commander of the Mukamira military camp.
Q.	You also mentioned a Colonel Ntibitura.  Can you tell us what his responsibility was, if you know?
A.	What I know is that Colonel Ntibitura was a member of parliament at the time.  He was a soldier, but I no longer recall whether he was a reservist or whether he was a retired soldier or an active member in service in the army. 
Q.	And then you mentioned Augustin Bizimungu.  Can you recall what you remember of his responsibilities in 1993 and then in 1994?
A.	At the time, he had the rank of colonel.  He was the commander of military operations in Ruhengeri area. 
Q.	Was that in 1993 or 1994, or both?
A.	At that time it was 1993.  Later on, in 1994, after the death of President Habyarimana, he became the chief of general staff of all the Rwandan Armed Forces.  It was therefore from 1993 to 1994, on the 7th, that is the day the President died, he was the one who replaced the general -- the deceased general -- chief of general staff.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Ephrem Setako?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Tell us where you know him from?
A.	I know Ephrem Setako.  He hailed from Nkuli commune and he was a lieutenant colonel.  Sometimes he came to Nzirorera's mother's house.  Each time he would come, we would be able to see him, just as we saw Nzirorera come to his mother's house.  I also know that he was a soldier because, at a certain point in time, he was attached to GOM (phonetic), the OEU -- OEU force. 
Q.	Would you spell his last name for us, please? 
A.	S-E-T-A-K-O, Setako.
Q.	Do you know if Ephrem Setako participated in this meeting at the Mukingo bureau communal?
A.	I do not recall very well, but it is indeed possible that he was present at the meeting.  What I'm certain of is that he, too, was amongst those persons who had promised us assistance in regard to the establishment of the Amahindure force.  I know that his name was amongst those who were to help us. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you made a statement to the investigators of the ICTR in regard to Mr. Ephrem Setako, did you not?  You've spoken to investigators of the Tribunal concerning Ephrem Setako?
A.	I have.
Q.	If I were to give you a copy of your witness statement, would that assist you in remembering whether or not Ephrem Setako was present at the meeting in the Mukingo bureau communal?
A.	Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
On an evidentiary point, I object to the placing of any materials that were not made by this witness contemporaneously with his actions, or shortly thereafter, to refresh his memory.  Any documentation placed before this witness to refresh his memory should be documentation that was created contemporaneously with the act in which he was involved or which he records  and not documentation that was made several years or a considerable time afterwards. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
This is going to be one of those very rare occasions on which I am on the side of Mr. Webster and I respectfully disagree with one of my colleagues, and I apologise to Mr. Roach for doing that.  But I believe that a witness should be able to be shown documents, even if the witness himself was not the author, and in fact I intend to do that on many occasions during the course of this trial, if it's necessary.  

I think it's of note to the weight in which the Trial Chamber will eventually assess this witness's credibility if it's necessary for the Prosecutor to do an exercise such as this to refresh the witness's memory, but nevertheless I do believe what Mr. Webster is doing is proper, and I respectfully disagree with my colleague. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I'm afraid I'm going to have to very strongly disagree with the -- my last colleague who was on his feet, Mr. Robinson, in respect of this.  

May I say, first of all, that I'm not aware of any rule of practice in this Tribunal relating to previous statements and the tendering of them to the maker of that statement, other than by way of 
cross-examination, when that maker of the statement is giving evidence.  I don't have the statement, I regret, because I've left them in the office downstairs.  But my recollection is that this witness's statements were all made, in fact, a long period of time after the events to which they relate.  To that extent, I ally myself with the practice that would be recognised by Mr. Roach in his jurisdiction in Canada, and also that which I am familiar with in the United Kingdom, which I pray in aid -- it seems to me that largely common law rules are being applied in this area in this Tribunal.  It would be, in our submission, a dangerous departure from what would be, in fact, normal practice, as I recognise it to be, in any event.  

There's nothing wrong with a witness refreshing his memory from statements before he comes into the Tribunal Chamber.  That is a practice which is certainly recognised within my jurisdiction.  Once he entered the witness box to give his oral testimony, then there is necessary restrictions on the documents that, in fact, he can look at.  

Now, it may well be that Mr. Robinson has something up his sleeve -- I don't know --  looking to the future.  But I think before we just generally accept it, we should perhaps have some little reflection on the practice that is being suggested.  I just add this.  Mr. Robinson's point was that it may be, with certain witnesses, you can provide them with statements, perhaps, and that may be done, even statements made by others, but the difficulty is with a statement made by the witness, that it is, in its way, a self-serving position.  That's where the danger arises, putting into the hands of a witness something that may or may not be true or accurate, that he's made and is the author of in the past.  There's where the danger lies. 

Just one moment.
MR. WEBSTER:
I really didn't realise --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't realise that something so simple would generate 15 to 20 minutes of debate.  A witness can 
be -- a witness's recollection can be refreshed with anything.  It doesn't even have to be a witness statement.  I can take a cup and put it before the witness, and if that assists him in refreshing his recollection, it passes muster.  

I don't think Mr. Hooper can speak for the entire common law tradition.  I know that Mr. Robinson and I come from a part of the world where the common law governs and it is entirely appropriate to put anything in front of a witness, even his prior witness statement, to refresh his recollection.  So I would like to proceed on that basis. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can we have some authority for that proposition, please? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Some things are of such common knowledge that they don't -- that they don't need to be so reported.  I do not have a case for that proposition.  If the Court requires authority for that point, I will come back this afternoon with authority.  But, to me, it seems very straightforward.  

Furthermore, the rules of evidence in this Tribunal are relaxed compared to the common law traditions, so we have much more liberal rules of evidence before this Tribunal than we have before any American court or any British court.  And under Rule 89(C) -- excuse me.  Under 89(C), "A Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value."  

And it's not even a question of admission  of evidence at this point.  I'm simply trying to elicit probative evidence from this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach.  Apparently, you don't agree with the different common law jurisdictions and the systems.  We must remind you that we don't follow strictly common law here, nor do we strictly follow civil law.  We have our own Rules and we refer to those.  Counsel Roach, you have the floor. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  If there is consent, of course, there's no problem, but in a case where there's no consent, the problem arises, and we should like to address this at this time, even though my friend thinks it's a long discussion on a brief, simple matter.  But it's going to arise in the future.  And in any recurring problem, we should try to deal with it up front. 
Now, technically, if we allow a witness in his examination-in-chief to use a document that was prepared years after or decades after his -- the action or the event to which he is going to testify, then nothing prevents this witness or anyone making up a statement for him the day before his testimony and giving it to him so that he can parrot it off in the Court. 

The importance of allowing witnesses such as officials, police officers, and so on, to use notes is that those notes were made almost contemporaneously with the action and their reliability is greater than in a situation where it is made some considerable time after.  

Of course, nothing prevents Mr. Robinson or any cross-examiner from using that document to impeach the witness's credibility or memory of the facts.  But it always remains that, in chief, you cannot lead the witness by showing him any document, unless that document was one that was prepared by him, or for him, at a very early time, a very soon time or contemporaneously with the action.  And that is a common sense rule; it's not just a common law rule but it's a common sense rule.  And I urge the Court to abide by that common sense rule. 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect to my friend across the room, I am not trying to introduce the statement into evidence.  I'm not moving the statement into evidence; I'm simply using the statement to assist the witness in refreshing his recollection.  

I elicited the necessary foundation by asking the witness if he remembered speaking to OTP investigators.  He said he did.  He said he had forgotten.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, please. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, pardon me, but since we spoke about -- we've only -- there wasn't only the common law but also the civil law system.  I simply want to testify to one thing as a civil law lawyer.  I do not know, in our legal system, of a situation where a witness can have access to the statements that he has made. 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Karen Holm-Porter)






	1015H
MR. WEYL: (Continuing)
Possibly the Judge can ask questions based on those statements but I do not know of any single situation where a witness can receive in front of him a copy of the statement.  The statement belongs to the parties but not to the witness who is not part of the proceedings, as such.  And this I just wanted to bring to your attention as a civil lawyer. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, if I can just finally address you? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  I hope that this will be the last intervention on this issue because we will move on to other items. 
MR. HOOPER:
First of all, of course it's right that this Tribunal has more relaxed rules relating to evidence, and I think there has been a passing reference already in the last ten or 15 minutes of this discussion to effectively Rule 90.  Rule 90 deals with the admission of evidence.  That's not what is going on here.  That is not what is the issue that confronts the Chamber.  Also, we recognise that the rules here are not rooted in any one jurisdiction, and that's not what is being sought.  But what we submit is the Prosecution have failed to recognise quite what they are doing.  

The reference to putting a cup before the witness is, well, a great misunderstanding of this position.  A cup, for example, is real evidence.  What is the object of the exercise that the Prosecution have asked the Court to permit it to undertake?  It's quite plainly this:  It's to refresh the witness's memory.  Now, in respect of that, our jurisdictions do have significant rules and restrictions, and otherwise, we would be in this position:  This witness could come into the Court today and the Prosecution could put its 11 or 15 statements that this witness has made into the witness's hands; we could start at page 1 and work our way through it.  What would be the difference in doing that?  That is not the practice in this Tribunal.  This witness has come to give oral testimony.  If there is, in fact, a document that this witness can have access to, to refresh his memory, then, first of all, it depends on the nature of the document.  One has to stress caution if it's his own statement and one should, in one's submission, only permit that exercise to take place when, in fact, the statement that is made is sufficiently contemporaneous with the facts that it relates to as to minimise inaccuracies and ensure, as it were, a relative degree of validity because of its contemporaneous nature.  In fact, that is an exception to the rule whereby statements cannot be put in the hands of witnesses who are the makers of those statements.  

So it's quite an important principle, and I've said if there is any jurisdiction that I'm unaware of -- and I've been here a lot less time than my learned friend -- then let him refer us to it.  We can't just make casual and generalised comments and pass those off as, in fact, jurisdiction practice.  

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We ask the Prosecutor not to put the document before the witness and to continue the 
examination-in-chief without putting the document before the witness.  

Mr. Prosecutor. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe that yesterday you stated that the reason for the training that you underwent after that meeting in Mukingo was to protect the population, and you went on to describe the population as the good citizens who were not against the government.  In reference to your -- your describing the population as the good citizens, would that ever include the Tutsi, the persons that were to be protected by your training? 
A.	Among the good citizens, the Tutsis did not figure in that group.
Q.	So is it your statement that only the Hutu could be good citizens?  Explain that to us, please. 
A.	Normally, good citizens were those who showed patriotism, who did not attack the country.  Those who were with the enemy were bad citizens.  The others were good citizens.  So the enemy were Inkotanyi, and Tutsis, it was said, were their accomplices.
Q.	Did anything happen after you completed your training?
A.	After the training, weapons were distributed, as well as uniforms.  Thereafter, we were given instructions to go to work, and we worked according to the instructions that were given to us.
Q.	Who gave you the instructions and what work did you do? 
A.	Our leaders, like Minister Nzirorera, Bourgmestre Kajelijeli, they delegated from time to time, and we respected mostly Nzirorera's orders because the other leaders were under him.  He was their boss.
Q.	What in particular did he tell you to do? 
A.	There was a meeting held after the training.  We were told that we had to continue to search for the Inkotanyi everywhere where they were.  At that time, we went to attack the Bagogwes.
Q.	Where did this meeting take place?
A.	It took place at Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	Who attended, among the authorities that you mentioned? 
A.	Colonel Bizimungu was there, Juvénal Kajelijeli, Jean-Damascène Niyoyita, Ndisetse, 
Jean Baptiste Nyabusore and Esdras Baheza.
Q.	Just to clarify, is it your statement that Joseph Nzirorera was also present at that meeting? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How did you attack the Bagogwe? 
A.	We left in the evening.  We wouldn't go in public.  It was secret.  We attacked at night, therefore.  Some of us, since it was night-time, let some Bagogwe get away from us.  And our objective was to capture the men, and Jean-Damascène Gasahani, Gateyiteyi and Kabango were among them, but Gateyiteyi got away from us.
Q.	Would you please spell the last name that you referred to, Gateyiteyi?
A.	G-A-T-E-Y-I-T-E-Y-I.  Gateyiteyi.
Q.	Was there ever a time that roadblocks were mounted in Mukingo?
A.	Yes.  We had erected roadblocks in Mukingo, but even before that, roadblocks were put up, and even after, of course.
Q.	Did you do that on your own or were you ordered to do that? 
A.	We never did anything without receiving instructions.
Q.	Who gave you instructions with respect to the roadblocks? 
A.	All of those men that I mentioned, when they came out of the meeting, they told us that we had to be vigilant because the enemy could attack at any time and so we had to put up roadblocks to counter the enemy. 
Q.	Was that done after this meeting at the Mukingo bureau communal?
A.	Yes.  We erected those roadblocks before that meeting, but also after it.
Q.	What did you do on those roadblocks?  You personally. 
A.	I controlled identity cards, checked identity cards of people coming through.  That's what I did.
Q.	What were you looking for on the identity card? 
A.	In fact, we were looking for the ethnic mention on the identity cards.
Q.	And tell us what you would do in relation to what you saw as the ethnic mention. 
A.	When someone was a Hutu, he could continue on his way.  When someone was a Tutsi, we would ask that person more and more questions.  When we observed that someone was a Tutsi, sometimes we would hold that person.  We did not see many Tutsis at our roadblock.
Q.	Were there ever any killings on those roadblocks right after the meeting in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Except for the roadblock put up before ISAE, that's where people were killed.
Q.	Would you please spell out ISAE for us, please?
A.	I-S-S-A-E (sic).
Q.	Mr. Witness, is that what you referred to as the Institut supérieur de l'agriculture et d'élevage?  Are we talking about the same thing?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You referred to it by its acronym, ISAE; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	All right.  Which roadblocks did you yourself participate in after the meeting in Mukingo bureau communal?
A.	I was amongst the leaders, and, as such, I controlled almost all of the roadblocks.  I controlled the activities, monitored the activities, at all of the roadblocks.  So I went to all of the roadblocks that had been put up.
Q.	How many were there? 
A.	There were three.
Q.	Tell us where each one was. 
A.	The first was put up in front of the ISAE, as I had already said.  The second was at the Petro-Rwanda station.  The third was between Busogo secteur, at the intersection of two roads.  At about 800 metres to one kilometre from the tarmacked road.
Q.	All right.  Were these roadblocks in place in 1994 as well? 
A.	In 1994, we erected these roadblocks during a short period of time.  We set them up near a factory.  But we noticed that there were no problems after about two days and so we removed them.  But at around May, towards the end of May, we re-erected a roadblock in front of the Busogo secteur, and there was a lady whom we were going to kill there.
Q.	And this is in May of 1994? 
A.	When we re-erected that roadblock, it was in May.
Q.	I'm asking you if it was in May of 1994, simply to clarify matters on the record.  Is it in 1994 that you're referring to, or 1993? 
A.	I said that the roadblocks were set up in -- on the 9th of April 1994.  We removed them two days later.  Now, in the beginning of May, we re-erected only one roadblock.
Q.	Turning our attention to the period after the meeting at the Mukingo bureau communal, when you had erected roadblocks at that time, I believe your previous response was that there were -- there were some killings at the ISAE roadblock.  Would you recall how many people were killed at that time? 
A.	I remember that four people died there.  Three people were killed because they were Tutsis, they had Tutsi identity cards, and they came from Gitarama; whereas a fourth person died because that person did not have any identity card, and when we searched that person, he had Ugandan shillings and we believed -- we concluded that he was an Inkotanyi.
Q.	When you say he died, could you distinguish between someone dying and someone being killed?  Tell us what happened to this particular person.
A.	That person was killed.
Q.	Who killed him?
A.	We are the ones who killed him, myself and my colleagues who were manning the roadblock.
Q.	Did you ever inform Nzirorera that you had killed these people at the roadblock? 
A.	No.  We did not see Nzirorera at that time.  But this was included in the instructions that we had been given. 
Q.	With respect to the other attacks on the Bagogwe, and this is after the meeting at the Mukingo bureau communal, were you ever in any circumstance where these killings were reported to Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  He came later on.  We were holding a meeting when he asked us about the situation, and we informed him about it.
Q.	What did you inform him? 
A.	We told him that some of us -- some of them had escaped us and that they had fled to one Munyamvano's home, and that some of the targets had been killed, such as Gasahani, Kabango, and one other person.
Q.	What was his response at that time?
A.	He asked us whether there was no other person whom we could bring into our party.  He encouraged us to continue to be vigilant in order to counter the activities of the enemy.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'm confused when you say "vigilant."  Did he encourage you to continue the killing? 
A.	When you are told to be vigilant, it meant that you were to continue to monitor closely all the activities of the enemy and to inform oneself on the programmes of those who collaborate with the Inkotanyi, as to how they collaborate, and those who found refuge at Munyamvano's house, we were supposed to monitor their movements so that they could not collaborate with the Inkotanyi or enable them to come there and hide them.  This is how we needed to follow the situation closely and follow -- monitor very closely these persons who had sought refuge at Munyamvano's house.
Q.	But was it your understanding that you were also to kill them?  Are you making a distinction between monitoring them and killing them? 
MR. ROACH:
Just a minute, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President.  I think my friend should be cautioned not to put words in the witness's mouth.  He's attempting to do that right now.  The witness should be allowed to give his testimony without my friend forcing words into his mouth. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm simply asking the witness to clarify his response.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, that objection is sustained.  Can you kindly reformulate your question? 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you state you were asked to be vigilant and you were asked to monitor the enemy, did you interpret that to mean that you should kill them? 
MR. ROACH:
Same problem.  Same problem. 

MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I will go on to --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you please recast -- or, rather -- yes, yes, please proceed. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you have an identification card that was issued to you by the government? 
A.	Yes, I did have one.
Q.	What was the ethnic mention on your ID card? 
A.	It said, "Hutu." 
Q.	What about the other members of the Amahindure and the Interahamwe?  Can you tell us if they were Hutu or Tutsi, or both?   
A.	No Tutsi was a member of that group.  There were Hutus and there were persons from the two ethnic groups.
Q.	I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There were Hutus whose mothers were Hutu, or a mixture of persons whose fathers were Tutsis and mothers were Hutu.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm still not clear.  I don't know if it's a problem of the translation or the response.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, maybe we could just take that question again.  Were there any Tutsi members -- as Tutsi are defined in Rwanda -- were there any Tutsi members of the Interahamwe in Mukingo?
A.	No Tutsi was a member of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, did you have any other type of identification card?  Aside from your government-issued identification card, did you possess any other type of identification card? 
A.	No.  You're only issued with one identity card, unless you have a school document or whether you belong to a political party.  There are no other ID cards.
Q.	Well, did you belong to a political party? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you have an identification card from that political party?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What political party? 
A.	The MRND.
Q.	Did it have your name and your photograph on it?
A.	No.  The party membership card only mentioned the member's identification.  There was no photograph on the card.
Q.	But your name was on the card?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you recall if that card contained an authorising signature from anyone connected with the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  The party card which I held bore the signature of Niyoyita, Jean-Damascène, who was the chairman of the party within Mukingo commune.  There was also a stamp of the MRND party.
Q.	To the best of your recollection, did it bear any other signature? 
A.	The bearer obviously would sign the card, yes.  And there was also the signature of the chairman of the party within the region from which you hailed.
Q.	Did you have an identification card as a member of the Interahamwe or of the Amahindure?
A.	Yes.  I had an Interahamwe card.
Q.	Can you tell us what was indicated on the Interahamwe card, to the best of your recollection, what types of things were written on it? 
A.	On the Interahamwe card which I possessed, it was mentioned the youth of the MRND party.  There was also my photograph and, of course, my identity.
Q.	Was it signed by anyone other than yourself? 
A.	Yes.  There was another.
Q.	Whose signature?
A.	There was also the signature of the chairman of the MRND at national level.
Q.	Do you recall the name of the person that signed under -- as the president? 
A.	It was Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.
Q.	How did you come to receive this card?  And I'm referring to the Interahamwe identification card. 
A.	We had provided a list of persons, which we submitted to the chairman of the MRND, and he promised that he would transmit that list to Nzirorera.  The list was given to Niyoyita.  After a few days, we also provided photographs.  Some days later, we received our cards as members of the Interahamwe.
Q.	When you say "we," Mr. Witness, you are saying "we requested them," tell us who you're talking about.  In addition to yourself, who else was involved?
A.	I'm referring to myself and my Interahamwe colleagues.
Q.	Tell us some of their names. 
A.	There was Niyigaba, Michel; Gato, Abdul Karim; Nzambonimpa, Saidi; who was generally known as Gakuru; Jean-Damascène Habarymana; Rwihandagaza; Noel Ndayisabye; Théoneste Barebereho; Mazimizi, Bakary (phonetic); Théoneste Mwambutsa; and many others.
Q.	Okay.  With respect to Noel, would you kindly spell his name, please? 
A.	Ndayisabye, Noel.  Ndayisabye is spelt N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-Y-E, Ndayisabye.
Q.	And you mentioned a certain Barebereho, I believe.  Did you give us two names or one name?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Yes.  Did you mention two names in relation to that person or only one?
A.	I spoke of Théoneste Barebereho.
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe all of the other names are indicated on the list that I provided to the Court this morning.  So I will not go into the spelling of the others.  
  BY MR. WEBSTER:
  Q.	Do you recall when it was that you received this identification card?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Prosecutor, with regard to the names which do not appear on the list, which certainly regards the names mentioned by the witness yesterday, you -- as the witness provides names, you need to have them spelt out so that the stenographers may be able to take down the names correctly, because I believe that there is a time lapse between the time he speaks about these persons and the time at which he's asked to spell them.  The best method would be to have him spell the names as and when he brings them out. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you answer any other of my questions, as you mention the name, would you pause for a second and then spell it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you recall when it was that you received this Interahamwe identification card?  If you can remember. 
A.	I received this card in 1992. 
Q.	Did this card afford you any privileges?  What was the benefit of having a card like this? 
A.	The Interahamwe member card could be showed at a roadblock; for instance, a roadblock which is being manned by soldiers.  If you don't have your normal identity card, you could show your Interahamwe membership card, and then you would be allowed to move, move on.  Someone who held such a card was someone who was respected, because not everybody had it.  There were places where one would not be able to have access if one did not have such a card.  There were places to which other people did not have access if they did not have such a card.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, I would like to make an objection at this time, and a motion to strike all of the testimony relating to the Interahamwe card, and my motion is based upon the fact that this is new material that has not been disclosed to us.  In any of this witness's statements, five or six that he made to the OTP, there is no mention of a Interahamwe card, especially one signed by Mr. Ngirumpatse or any connection with Mr. Nzirorera. 

Now, I realise that there are times when, in preparation for a witness's testimony, new material will come into the possession of the Prosecutor, but in that situation, it's incumbent upon the Prosecutor to disclose that information in advance of the testimony, not for the defence to hear this for the first time on the witness stand. 

And so, because there has been no disclosure of any information about the Interahamwe card, either in the statements or by the Prosecutor recently, I ask that all testimony concerning this subject be stricken. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  It also is a great surprise to us to hear our client's name mentioned.  There is no disclosure of this and it takes us by surprise, and it's unfair.  If my friend is going to give this kind of evidence or elicit it from the witness, he should let us know in advance, not take us by surprise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Your Honours, I'm suggesting that we have to have a flexible standard on issues such as this.  Clearly, at times, witnesses do provide us with information that goes beyond their witness statements, but it is impossible to generate an exhaustive witness statement and take down every bit of information that a witness knows.  Witness statements basically capture the essentials of what a witness can tell us about a particular target.  They are not intended to be an exhaustive narrative of everything the witness knows in relation to the events of 1994.  The indictment in this case charges Mathieu Ngirumpatse with being the head of the MRND.  It explicitly states that the Interahamwe was the youth wing of the MRND.  I believe there is a statement, an allegation, in the indictment, that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the head of the MRND.  So it stands to reason that any member of the Interahamwe organisation would have information or evidence in relation to the structure of the party and its internal organisation which would include its president, or the president of the political party, much less the -- which would also include its youth wing. 

So, on that basis, I don't think this is an issue of unfair surprise. 

All of the witnesses that testify in this case, who have anything to say about the MRND party, are going to be asked questions about the Interahamwe.  Any witness that has anything to say about the MRND is going to be asked about the Interahamwe and vice versa.  We will ask the officers of the organisation; we will explore it fully.  So if the Defence needs to be placed on notice, this is the notice.  Anything concerning the MRND and anything concerning the Interahamwe will be elicited from any witness that testifies in this trial. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, it raises a concern as to the whole nature of disclosure in the case.  And I'm not concerned directly with this issue, but I am with the practice that is being proposed.  These weren't -- this question of the card hasn't been something that has just fallen from the witness's lips.  It was elicited as a result of very careful positioning of questions.  So the Prosecution knew fully well; he's got his notes in front of him and it was a point he wanted to make.  And he'd be aware if, in fact, the Defence had had notice of that.  And it's not just courtesy but essential good practice, surely, to alert the Defence in good time as to this so that the Defence can then take a timely objection. 

In fact, what's happened here is that the evidence has been given and my friends are now applying to retrospectively put the matter right.  And that isn't a manner in which the Prosecution should be proceeding or seeking to proceed.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber would prefer to listen to the Prosecutor.  During the cross-examination, you can come back to the matter, and then we'll be able to make our own assessment regarding the matter during our deliberations as a Chamber.  I think we can proceed because we are wasting a great deal of time with all these interruptions. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall, if need be, come back to this in order to inform you -- in order to retain what was said about the card. 

Mr. Prosecutor, is there someone still on their feet? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I know -- Madam President, I would like to make a motion that requires the Prosecution, whenever it comes into information that it wishes to elicit at the trial that is not contained in the witness statement, that it is a requirement that that information be disclosed to the Defence, and I make this as a formal motion so that if the situation happens in the future, we can have an order from the Trial Chamber, which is the case in every other Trial Chamber besides this one.  This is the only Trial Chamber in which Accused hear things for the first time without what's known as will-say statements.  And it's a practice that has caused us great prejudice, and I ask that it be corrected.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, in fact, on a previous occasion in the first session, you, Madam President, and your colleagues had to rule on this, you may remember, in respect of rape allegations at Butare hospital made against Dr. Rwamakuba.  And you -- with great respect, correctly -- in fact, ruled the matter inadmissible.  It was matters that had come to the attention of the Prosecution which they hadn't, in fact, given the Defence notice of.  This is a very similar position. 

And these are significant matters of principle, in terms of the trial process.  They are of concern, and I ally myself with the motion, the oral motion, that's just been made by Mr. Robinson.  I'm grateful. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd like to follow your instructions and proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm ready to follow your instructions, which I believe were to proceed with the direct examination. 

I'd like to comment, however, that I'm happy that Mr. Hooper raised that as an example, because it just shows us how far afield two arguments can be.  Because if we are talking about allegations of rape in relation to Rwamakuba, rape is substantive crime.  It's charged on the indictment.  It's reasonable to expect the Prosecutor to provide advance notice of additional allegations that are going to lead to evidence of a crime, rape.  With respect to this MRND ID and the Interahamwe ID, unless Counsel is suggesting that it's a substantive crime to possess an MRND ID card or an Interahamwe ID card, I fail to see the parallel.  This is simply a question of evidence.  The substantive issue is the structure of the MRND party and whether the Interahamwe organisation is part of the MRND party.  That is something that is explicitly pleaded in the indictment.  We have gone over that issue numerous times.  That's all we are talking about. 

I'll proceed.  The Court has already stated that it will rule on the issue later.  I'm ready to proceed with this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel. 

We see that it's eleven o'clock.  This is normally the time that we take our break.  We will recommence in 15 minutes. 

Proceedings are adjourned. 
	(Court recessed from 1100H to 1128H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor to continue with your examination-in-chief. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't want to open a Pandora's box, because I really would like to proceed with the taking of testimony, but I do want to make one brief comment, and it refers to the issue of refreshing a witness's recollection, because we did do some research during the break and I have a whole list of cases, a whole print-out from Westlaw, which goes directly to that point. 

Now, there must be some sort of continental divide between common law practice in the U.S. and common law practice in Great Britain, because the case law in U.S. federal courts clearly establishes that a witness's recollection can be refreshed by any writing, including his own previous statements, whether they are contemporaneous or not. 

I'll just cite two cases.  I'm not suggesting that the Court necessarily make a ruling now, but I would like to bring it to the attention of the parties and the Trial Chamber.  I have one citation, where it states that the general principle is that any writing may be used to refresh recollection of a witness, even if that writing -- even if that writing has not been made by the witness himself.  So, I mean, the presumption underlying this general statement is that a statement of the witness can be used to refresh his own recollection.  And this is U.S. v. Schwartzbaum; the spelling is 
	S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z-B-A-U-M.  It's a Court of Appeals case from New York from 1995.  And the citation is 527 F.2d 249. 

In fact, rather than reading these things into the record, I would be happy to put it in a -- in writing and just submit the list of authorities to the Court at a later time, rather than to belabour the point at this time.  But at least in American courts, there is ample precedent for what we regard as a very simple procedure.  But I'm ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to take you to the morning of the 7th of April.  You had mentioned that you had gotten instructions to go out and start attacking the enemy.  This is during the early morning hours on the 7th of April.  Can you tell us if you were directed to attack anyone in particular?  Among the instructions that you received, was anyone singled out for you? 
A.	In the instructions given to us, we were told that we had to kill the Tutsis because the Tutsis had killed Habyarimana.  Consequently, no Tutsi was to be spared. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you familiar with an Ngabire?
A.	Yes.  I know that person. 
Q.	Can you spell the name for us, please? 
A.	N-G-A-B-I-R-E.
Q.	Did you receive any instructions with respect to Ngabire?
A.	Niyigaba, Michel told me that he had been given instructions to kill that child.
Q.	Where did those instructions come from? 
A.	He told me that he had just spoken with Nzirorera on the phone.
Q.	Did he tell you what Nzirorera said to him at that time?
A.	He said, "I've just spoken to him on the telephone.  He said that we have to do our work and that that child must be killed." 
Q.	Can you tell us what Ngabire is in relation to Nzirorera? 
A.	I heard that that child was Nzirorera's.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us the entire content of Michel Niyigaba's conversation with you that morning in relation to Ngabire?  Tell us what he told you. 
A.	I told you what he said to me.  He said that he spoke with Nzirorera and that that child, which was Nzirorera's, had to be killed.  In fact, Nzirorera apparently had that child with a Tutsi woman.  Furthermore, Ngabire was a boy.  Ngabire was a boy.  He had a sister called Bigabare. 
Q.	Do you know the mother of these children? 
A.	Yes.  I know her.  Her name is Kiberwa, Cesire.  I will spell:  K-I-B-E-R-W-A, Kiberwa.
Q.	Where do you know this person from? 
A.	It's a woman from Mabanga, Kwani (phonetic) cellule, Busogo secteur, Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Do you know --
A.	That woman is from Kwani cellule, Busogo secteur, Mukingo commune.
Q.	Would you spell the name of that commune for us, please? 
A.	M-K-I -- rather, M-U-K-I-N-G-O, Mukingo.
Q.	Was Ngabire, in fact, killed that morning?
A.	Yes.  He was killed.
Q.	Do you know the circumstances under which he was killed? 
A.	Yes.  He was killed like the other Tutsis.  Kinyamba (phonetic) killed him with Ndayisabye and Rusisingyo (phonetic).
Q.	Were you present at the time?
A.	Yes.  I was there, and so were others.
Q.	How soon after your conversation with Michel Niyigaba did this take place? 
A.	A few moments.  After he said it, we went to Rudatinya, the residence.  He was killed after we left Rudatinya's house, and then we went to Busogo parish.  We went through Mabanga, we killed people, including that child, and then we continued to Busogo parish.
Q.	Can you spell Rudatinya for us, please?
A.	R-U-D-A-T-I-N-Y-A.
Q.	Was Rudatinya Hutu or Tutsi?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	Do you know if Ngabire was related to Rudatinya in any way?
A.	I don't know if they were related.  I don't know.  What I do know is that Rudatinya was a Tutsi.  His parents were Tutsis, both his mother and father.  As far as Ngabire goes, it was said that his father was Hutu but his mother was a Tutsi.
Q.	With respect to Ngabire's sister, do you know who her mother and her father was? 
A.	Whose father, Counsel? 
Q.	The sister of Ngabire. 
A.	It was said that her father was Nzirorera, and Kiberwa was the mother.
Q.	You mentioned Rudatinya's house.  Is that where they were living or was there another reason why Ngabire was at that location? 
A.	No.  We went to Rudatinya's house and then we went to Mabanga.  Ngabire didn't live in the same house as the others.  It was the same road, the same path, that you would take to go to Busogo parish.  It's close to the road.
Q.	What I'm trying to understand, Mr. Witness, is whether Ngabire was killed in the place where he lived or somewhere else.  Do you know where Ngabire lived?
A.	I know where he lived.  It's called Mabanga.  The place is called Mabanga.  He was chased out of the house.  He ran.  And when he was going to cross the road, he was killed.  But he was chased from his house.
Q.	Do you know the other persons that were living in that house? 
A.	There was another girl, Batamuriza.  She lived there.  Batamuriza's mother lived there but she had died previously.  There was another girl, Nirere.  As regards the others, I don't know their names.  Those are the people whose names I know, who lived with Ngabire. 

Batamuriza is spelt B-A-T-A-M-U-R-I-Z-A.  Nirere is spelt N-I-R-E-R-E.  Canton Nyabuhu, 
N-Y-A-B-U-H-U.
Q.	You stated that after you left that location, you went to Busogo parish.  Can you tell us what you did when you got to Busogo parish? 
A.	At Busogo parish, we went there to attack the Tutsis who had taken refuge in the convent, and also in the priest's houses.  We met soldiers, and all of us together, we did the same work.  We killed all of those people. 
	(Pages 17 to 30 by Mark Porter)



	1145H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The soldiers that you have just referred to, are these persons that you had seen before?  I am referring to the soldiers.
A.	No, except the one who we left with from Mabanga.  There was Corporal Rasheli.  The others, I met them for the first time.  Rasheli is spelt R-A-S-H-E-L-I.
Q.	Do you know where the soldiers came from? 
A.	They were from the Mukamira camp.
Q.	Would you have any idea of how many soldiers there were in that attack on the church? 
A.	There were more than 20. 
Q.	How did you personally and your Interahamwe friends, interact with the soldiers during the course of that attack? 
A.	We used grenades, firearms.  Those were the weapons used to kill.  They were given over to the Interahamwe.  They came over to us.  We threw the grenades through the windows and we shot at those people through the windows, because the people had taken refuge in the room inside.  The assailants included Interahamwe and soldiers.  During the massacre, other people were looting the convent and the store -- the dispensary, rather.  There were people who stole medicine out of the dispensary. 
Q.	Was the attack directed in any manner? 
A.	The person who seemed to be the leader was Corporal Rasheli.  He is the one we met at Mabanga.  He told us that in the convent there were Tutsi.  He said, "Let's go."  When we arrived, we found two of the soldiers that I spoke of, and so he seemed to be the leader of the attack.
Q.	Had you ever met with Corporal Rasheli before? 
A.	We could see him come by, leaving his house in the morning.  He would go to work in a military uniform with the rifle.  And in the evening, he would come back because we knew that he was an instructor in Bigogwe camp.
Q.	Did he attend any of the meetings that you referred to earlier, the one in Mukingo commune in 1993, or any of the meetings that took place at Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No, I never saw him at any of those meetings.
Q.	Were there any other military figures that were present that morning during the attack that you did see at those previous meetings? 
A.	I spoke to you of those soldiers.  There were more than 20 of them, as well as Corporal Rasheli.  I didn't see any others.
Q.	Well, with respect to those 20 soldiers, had you ever met with them at Nzirorera's mother's house before or in any other context with those authorities? 
A.	No, I never met them anywhere else.  All that I know is that there was a captain who came to transport those people from Mukamira.  His name was Hasengeza. 
Q.	Would you spell that please?
A.	The others, I had met them before.  That name is spelt H-A-S-E-N-G-E-Z-A.  He was a captain. 
Q.	Did you ever see Captain Hasengeza at any of the meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house? 
A.	No, I never saw him at that place. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in addition to the killings that went on, were there any other types of attacks against the persons at the church or in Busogo secteur? 
A.	There were no other major attacks except we were looking for another person who hadn't been killed in Busogo.
Q.	And, who was that? 
A.	For example, there was a woman who was killed on Busogo hill with her three children.  Her vehicle was taken and her brother in-law Kanoti took the vehicle; he was driving it.  That woman was from Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you observe any attacks on women in particular that morning? 
A.	Except for a girl called Joyce, her father was Karasanima.  On that morning she was living in Rudatinya's family.  That girl was raped by some Interahamwe and thereafter she was killed.  The other person Nyraburanga, she was undressed, her breast was cut and those other women who were aggressed that morning. 
Q.	Were you present when these two things happened?
A.	Yes, I was there.
Q.	Did you see who did these things to these women? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	Were the perpetrators of these acts persons that were associated with your group of Interahamwe? 
A.	They themselves were Interahamwe.
Q.	Were these the same persons that had attended meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house during the course of the events leading up to that day? 
A.	They were Interahamwe.  They participated in the same activities just like we did, as Interahamwe.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if I were to give you a blank piece of paper, would you be able to write down the names of those persons that you saw engaged in those activities? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to object to this procedure and ask that these names be part of the court record.  If someone is a rapist, and I don't see any reason that they be protected.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to proceed on this basis or I would like to go into closed session.  If we go into these events and if this witness testifies to who he saw and the circumstances under which he saw them, his identity is going to be revealed and he would be placed at risk.  

Furthermore, the victims of these attacks really should not be mentioned on the public record.  In order to fully go into the details of these incidents, we either have to do it in an indirect manner, by placing these names on a piece of paper, or we have to go into closed session.  I would move that we actually go into closed session for this portion of the witness's testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, again, I object to that.  I think, first of all, the names of the victims have already been mentioned, and Mr. Webster was the one who elicited those names.  This is not the real reason for why we are proceeding here.  I suggest to you that the real reason for Mr. Webster's request is that the rapists are people who will be witnesses, other witnesses for the Prosecution.  And he is attempting to shield these rapists from public scrutiny so that when he calls in his witnesses, they have a greater air of credibility.  And I don't believe that the reasons for going into a closed session to protect this witness's identity are manifest by trying to protect the identity of people who have committed crimes.  One of the principles of this Tribunal is accountability, and unless it involves the safety of this witness, we should not be going into a closed session.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Clearly for us, the issue at hand is the protection of this witness's identity.  These particular crimes took place under circumstances where, if this witness goes into the details and mentions the specific names of individuals, his identity will be revealed in the process.  So that is our basic concern.  

With respect to the victims -- the victims that were just mentioned earlier are victims who have died.  There are other victims that may be mentioned during the course of this witness's testimony who are not dead.  So in terms of protecting the identities of these victims, that also is my concern.  

My suggestion was that we do this in open session, and that we do this by having the witness write down the names on a piece of paper which could then be displayed to the Court and displayed to the parties and then the testimony would proceed in a public forum.  But if that's objectionable, we can go into closed session.  This is an issue that the Trial Chamber has to resolve at this point, because when we go into cross-examination, at that point as well, the Defence would have to be directed that these questions or any cross-examination on this issue be conducted in a manner that is not going to expose the identity of this witness.  So I do suggest that this is a matter that the Court has to take a very firm position on whether it is favourable to the Prosecutor or favourable to the Defence's objection.   
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I respond?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, briefly.  I hope that we are not going to spend another half an hour on this issue.  I hope that we can make this short. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  The question  -- the objection that is before the Chamber right now is whether this witness should be allowed to write down on a piece of paper rather than reveal in open court the identity of the persons who raped Joyce at the Rudatinya compound and who raped Nyraburanga also, I believe, at that location.  This witness has already testified that he was among the Interahamwe present at those locations.  There is no showing by the Prosecutor that by revealing the identity of the other Interahamwe who committed these rapes, that this would, in any way, provide further information that could be used to identify the witness who is present in the courtroom.  And in order to go into closed session or to even perhaps protect sealed exhibits, there should be a legitimate showing that the information would reveal the identity of the witness.  And so far, what's before you, the request to put the names of the rapists on a piece of paper instead of revealing them publicly, the Prosecutor has not met the heavy burden it has of having sessions that are not available to the public.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber allows the Prosecutor to have these names written down and this information will be disclosed to the Defence.

Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, not necessarily for the record, but I had understood that the Prosecutor had requested whether he could produce a blank sheet, and I do realise that this sheet was not blank. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the sheet contains two columns, simply -- well, he has indeed prepared his case very well, apparently so, yes.  He was able to do that because he was authorised to do that.  But he did indeed prepare himself beforehand. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the clarity of the record, I have requested to be placed before the witness, a paper which is numbered on the left-hand side, numbered 1 to 18, and on the right-hand side, it is listed serially, alphabetically A to R. 

For the side of the paper where there are numbers, there is a heading "Perpetrators."  For the side of the paper where there are letters, there's a heading "Victims."  But in respect of the content, there is no substantive content on the paper.  So in that regard, the paper is blank. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, directing your attention to the paper that has been placed before you, where you see the numbering, I would like you to take a few moments and write down the names of the persons that were present with you when Joyce was attacked, and I would like you to include those persons that you saw attack Joyce that morning.  Have you done that? 
A.	Yes, I am done.
Q.	May I see it, please?  Could you show this to the Court and to the Defence, please? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can you place the document in front of the witness, please?  Can you place the list in front of the witness?
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, it seems that you have listed four names on the right-hand -- excuse me, on the left-hand side, numbered one to four.  As you continue your testimony with respect to these incidents, please identify who you are speaking about by referring to the number.  Just tell us the number of the person that you are talking about and what they did.  If you talk about the incident concerning Joyce, tell us what you saw.  Who did what?  What did No.1 do?  What did No. 2 do?  What did No. 3 do, and what did No. 4 do? 
A.	Regarding Joyce, those who attacked her were Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  All three stripped her naked and raped her.  They raped her in turns.  Subsequently, No. 2 killed her.  

Now, with regard to Nyraburanga, No. 4, struck her with a knife and cut off one of her breasts.  When he had done that -- this was in the presence of Niyigaba, Gato, Abdul Karim; Jean Damascene Habyarimana ********.  I do not remember the names of the others, the other persons present. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just mentioned three additional names that were not on your list.  Would you like to amend your list and have those names?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  First all, I would like to object to this protection of rapists that the Trial Chamber is allowing, because, for example, No. 2, that name has already been mentioned as one of the attackers, as one of the killers of people, in other testimony of this witness, as I believe as No. 1.  And so what we are doing here is, we are shielding from the public the identity of people who committed heinous crimes and I see no justification for that.  

Now, in addition, we are going to amend a secret list of names that the witness has just stated publicly.  That means that there is no purpose for it to then put under seal names of people who have been stated publicly.  Once again, I would ask that this procedure be open to the public, and that the names of perpetrators of crimes such as this be made public.  There is no justification whatsoever from anything you have heard that relates to this witness's identity, and that is, I believe a subterfuge for keeping this information secret.  So I ask that this document be made part of the public record and not be under sealed papers, and that the information be given in all testimony and not by sealed papers. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, one of the -- if I may respond briefly.  I am starting to agree with Mr. Robinson that this procedure is becoming a bit cumbersome, and what I would like to do is to move into closed session or I can go into the substance of these incidents in detail without the cumbersome procedure of going back and forth with lists.  

I would like to expand upon my application that I would like to do so in closed session, and in that way, I can fully apprise the Court and the parties of why I think it is appropriate to take testimony in closed session.  But to make that application in open court is going to compromise the very issues that -- the identity of the witness that I am trying to protect.  So with the Court's indulgence, if you could just allow me three or four minutes to explain the situation in closed session and then make a decision on that.  But at this time, my application is simply to take this portion of the witness's testimony in closed session, and I will motivate that application.  I will go into the reasons of why I am requesting that, if we can just take two or three minutes in closed session.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have no objection to the closed session request for Mr. Webster if he feels he needs a closed session to explain to you why this has to be closed or under seal.  I think that's appropriate.  But I do continue to object to any testimony or substantive information being provided in closed session.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We apologise to the public but we are going to sit in closed session to allow the Prosecutor to provide us with grounds for his request for continuing with the examination-in-chief of this witness in closed session. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would ask that the witness be excused from the courtroom during the discussion in closed session. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We ask that the witness withdraws.
