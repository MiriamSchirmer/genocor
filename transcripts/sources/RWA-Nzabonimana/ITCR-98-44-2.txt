Thank

 Mr.

 Mr.
 Nzirorera
was
 Executive
 Secretary
 of the
 MRND
 and
this
 was
 before
 and
 during
 events
 of
 1994
in
 Rwanda.
 If I were
 te base
 myself
 on
the
 affidavits
 filed
 by Mr.
 Maxwell
 Nkole
on Rule
 40 Bis
 (f)
 the
 grounds
 for
 our
request
 are
 as follows:
 First
 of all
the
 complexity
 of the
 investigations
against
 this
 suspect
 which
 are
 mentioned
in
 paragraph
 5,
 7 and
 8 and
 I
particularly
 draw
 your
 attention
 to
paragraph
 8 of
 Mr.
 Nkole’s
 affidavit
 then
there
 is
 the
 need
 to
 analyse
 the
 whole
set
 of
 documents
 and
 unfortunately
 once
again
 the
 precarious
 security
 situation
obtaining
 in
 Rwanda.
 These
 are
 elements
which
 are
 mentioned
 in the
 affidavit
 and
on
 which
 I am
 basing
 my
 request.
 Once
again
 the
 work
 which
 has
 to be
 done
 in
regard
 to Mr.
 Joseph
 Nzirorera
 did
 begin
even
 before
 his
 arrest
 in
 Benin
 and
 his
transfer

time
 necessary
 to
 conclude
 this
investigation
 and
 to
 complete
 the
 drawing
up
 of the
 indictment
 which
 is
 the
 basis
of our
 request
 for
 an extension
 of
 the
provisional
 detention
 for
 a further
 30
days.
 I would
 wish
 to
 make
 a small
clarification
 Mr.
 President.
 I don’t
 know
if
 the
 suspect
 will
 mention
 this
 as
 I
have
 done
 the
 two
 others
 who
 came
 before
him
 but
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month
 of
May
 under
 the
 request
 made
 pursuant
 to
rule
 40,
 there
 was
 need
 for
 an
indictment.
 At
 that
 point
 in
 time
 we
were
 thinking
 of
 an indictment
 which
included
 29 accused
 which
 was
 presented
to the
 Judge
 but
 the
 Judge
 found
 that
there
 was
 no jurisdiction
 and
 at
 the
office
 of
 the
 Prosecutor
 we
 had
 to
renounce
 that
 decision
 and
 it
 was
 only
 on
the
 8th
 or
 the
 9th
 of
 June
 that
 the
chamber
 of
 appeals
 rendered
 this
 decision
to
 say
 that
 there
 was
 no competence
 for
the
 chamber
 to
 hear
 appeals.
 So
 this
forced
 us
 obviously
 to
 go back
 and
 look
at
 other
 means
 and
 ways
 of
 carrying
 out

our
 duties.
 I am
 mentioning
 this
explanation
 because
 twice
 already
 there
bas
 been
 a sentence
 which
 is
 referred
 to
in
 the
 documents.
 And
 once
 again
 I would
respectfully
 submit
 that
 we need
 to
 be
 a
bit
 careful
 of
 claims
 of
 this
 kind
without
 there
 being
 any
 response
 from
 our
part
 because
 I am
 not
 aware
 whether
 we
can
 agree
 with
 the
 description
 of the
events
 which
 are
 being
 submitted
 by
persons
 before
 the
 court
 to
 day°
 In
 any
case
 this
 is
 a clarification
 I am making
and
 obviously
 the
 situation
 is
 quite
different
 now
 and
 we
 are
 here
 now
 dealing
with
 a new
 indictment
 based
 on
investigations
 and
 the
 difficulties
 which
we are
 faced
 with
 are
 described
 in
 Mr.
Nkole’s
 affidavit
 which
 I am
 using
 in
order
 to justify
 the
 basis
 for
 our
request.
Mr.
 Prosecutor
 before
 giving
 the
 floor
 to
the
 defence
 I wish
 to inform
 you
 that
 the
suspects
 are
 indeed
 of
 good
 faith

it was

 said
 that
 a procedure
of

 indictment
concerning
 them
 was
 on

 They
 were
not

 that
 a collective
 indictment
including
 29
 persons
 was
 being

 is
 in
 good

 that
they
 are
 raising
 these

 and
 it
 is
also
 good
 for
 you
 to

 I think
 we
 are
 all
 doing
this
 in
 good

 because
 they
 were
 not

 they
 were

 that

 However,
 I wish
 to
 inform
 you
that
 since
 I am
 ignorant
 of legal
 matters
I shall
 only
 deal
 with
 some
 reflections
based
 on
 logic
 and
 what
 I have
 noticed
 so
far
 because
 we
 are
 here
 dealing
 with
 an

 hearing
 while
 hoping
 some
others
 have
 said
 things
 which
 are

professional.
 Allow
 me
 therefore,
 Mr.
President
 first
 of all
 to
 go
 back
 in the
matter
 we
 are
 concerned
 with
 to
 day.
When
 I was
 arrested
 in
 Benin
 Cotonou
 by
the
 investigators
 of
 the
 Tribunal
supported
 by
 the
 Beninia
 police
 my
 first
question
 was
 to find
 out
 whether
 there
was
 an indictment
 and
 who
 had
 issued
 the
same
 and
 over
 and
 above
 that
 I wanted
 to
know
 if
 there
 was
 an
 indictment
 or
indictments
 against
 myself.
 My
 question
remained
 without
 answer
 but
 simply
 the
investigators
 informed
 me
 that
 the
charges
 against
 me
 would
 be
 communicated
to
 me
 within
 a 30 day
 period
 following
 my
arrest.
 Mr.
 President,
 despite
 the
 fact
that
 I was
 not
 satisfied
 with

response
 I however,
 accepted
 without
 any
hesitation
 te
 be subject
 te
 the
questioning.
 I was
 a subject
 of
 without
counsel
 because
 at that
 time
 I was
 a
suspect
 and
 I preferred
 net
 te
 keep
 quite
but
 te
 momentarily
 renounce
 the
 right
that
 I have
 te
 counsel
 se
 that
 I could
answer
 questions
 put
 te
 me.
 New,
Mr.
 President
 it
 was
 only
 on the
 i0
 of
July
 1998
 at
 the
 time
 when
 I was
 being
handed
 over
 from
 the
 authorities
 of
 the
government
 of
 Benin
 and
 the
 ICTR
 in other
words
 after
 35 days
 of detention
 that
 at
the
 Cotonou
 airport
 itself
 a copy
 of
 the
order
 for
 transfer
 dated
 26
 June
 1998
 and
at that
 moment
 I was
 able
 te
 become
 aware
of
 the
 letter
 of
 26 May
 1998
 addressed
 te
the
 Minister
 of
 Justice
 and
 the
 keeper
 of
the
 seals
 in
 the
 republic
 of Benin
 by
 Mr.
Bernard
 Muna,
 the
 Deputy
 Prosecutor
asking
 the
 government
 of
 Benin
 te
 proceed
with
 my
 arrest
 and
 te put
 me
 under

 would
seem
 I was
 a suspect.

paragraph
 four
 and
 Article
 18
 paragraph
two
 speak
 of
 the
 manner
 in
 which
 an
arrest
 should
 be
 operated.
 Namely
 by
 the
Prosecution
 providing
 an indictment
 in
due
 form
 in which
 he
 concisely
 lays
 out
the
 facts
 and
 the
 crimes
 alleged
 against
the
 accused°
 The
 same
 Articles
 indicate
the
 procedure
 to
 be
 followed
 through
 the
Judges
 of a trial
 chamber
 in
 order
 to
come
 to
 the
 confirmation
 of
 a Judge.
 Now
the
 question
 that
 I have
 now
 is
 whether
this
 letter
 from
 the
 Prosecutor
 was
replacing
 this
 whole
 procedure
 as
 is
described
 in
 the
 statute
 or
 whether
 it
was
 in
 violation
 of
 these
 Articles
 that
the
 letter
 was
 issued
 by
 the
 Prosecutor.
The
 response
 is
 quite
 clear.
 For
 me
 I
consider
 it
 a flagrant
 violation
 of
 the
statute
 of the
 International
 Tribunal
 by
the
 Prosecutor
 herself.
 And
 this
 is
 why
Mr.
 President
 with
 all
 due
 respect
 I
consider
 that
 Rule
 40 of
 the
 Rules
concerning
 provisional
 measures
sub-paragraph
 (a)
 cannot
 be
 used
 because
this
 is
 much
 more
 strong
 than

which
 is only

 for

application
 of
 the

 So
 no
measure
 in
 the
 Rules
 can
 go
 against
 the
provisions
 of
 the
 statute.
 Now
 let
 us
come
 to
 the
 letter
 by the
 Deputy
Prosecutor
 Mr.
 Muna.
 It
 is
 said
 in
 fine
and
 I quote,
 that
 there
 is
 against
 this
person
 in
 other
 words
 myself
 there
 are
serious
 indications
 which
 are
 concordant
participation
 in crimes
 committed
 in
Rwanda
 between
 the
 ist
 of
 January
 and
 the
31
 December
 1994.
 He
 continues
 by
 saying
that
 in
 fact
 the
 Prosecutor
 of the
Tribunal
 possesses
 evidence
 which
establish
 that
 the
 above
 mentioned,
 in
other
 words
 Joseph
 Nzirorera
 allegedly
committed
 crimes
 under
 the
 jurisdiction
of
 the
 Tribunal
 and
 I quote
 " conspiracy
to commit
 genocide,
 genocide
 and
complicity
 in
 genocide"
 and
 I end
 the
quotation
 there°
 The
 text
 which
 I bave
just
 quoted
 from
 the
 prosecutor
 should
hot
 be
 taken
 lightly
 and
 therefore,
should
 not
 be
 considered
 as
 simply
 mere
words.
 It

 What
 became
 of
 the
 serious
indications
 which
 are
 referred
 to
 in
 this
letter.
 Mr.
 President,
 at
 the
 stage
where
 we
 are
 there
 are
 many
 questions
which
 arise
 at
 least
 as far
 as
 I am
concerned
 on the
 haphazard
 manner
 in
which
 the
 Prosecution
 is
 behaving
 and
this
 is
 a Prosecutor
 of
 an International
Tribunal.
 Firstly
 the
 cavalier
 manner
which
 is
 being
 practised
 by the
Prosecutor
 consisting
 in the
 first
 and
then
 subsequent
 drawing
 up
 of documents
including
 an
 indictment
 should
 not
 be
something
 which
 comes
 out
 of
 this
institution
 which
 is
 defending
 human
rights.
 Secondly
 the
 Prosecutor
 is
saying
 that
 they
 have
 evidence
 and
 this
is serious
 indication
 and
 that
 he is
 not

now
 able
 to formulate
 an indictment.
This
 requires
 that
 I make
 the
 following
comments.
 First
 of
 all
 even
 the
 serious
indications
 and
 the
 evidence
 mentioned
 in
the
 letter
 of
 the
 Prosecutor
 do
 hot
 exist
at
 all
 and
 the
 prosecution
 should
 now
 try
and
 find
 out
 what
 he can
 do
 by
 asking
 for
an
 extension
 of
 the
 detention.
 And
 may
be
 if necessary
 they
 did
 not
 have
 the
evidence.
 May
 be
 they
 did
 not
 have
 the
services
 necessary.
 There
 were
 probably
persons
 in
 Kigali
 who
 are
 inventing
crimes
 and
 wanting
 to place
 them
 upon
persons
 who
 are
 under
 detention.
Mr.
 President
 I wish
 therefore,
 that
 the
Prosecutor
 properly
 executes
 its’
 work
and
 that
 is
 my
 observing.
 Secondly
alternatively
 the
 Prosecutor
 is probably
looking
 at
 the
 documents
 which
 were
ceased
 from
 my
 residence
 so
 that
 they
 can
draw
 matters
 of substance
 which
 will
enable
 him
 or
 ber
 to
 file
 an indictment°
Here
 I have
 received
 a document
 saying
that
 they
 are
 studying
 these
 documents
and

 just
 said
 and
 confirmed
 this.
 But
 do
they
 require
 30
 days?
 Is
 that
sufficient?
 In
 my
 particular
 case
 we
 are
already
 60
 days.
 In
 other
 words
 the
 35
days
 I spent
 in
 Cotonou
 prison
 and
 the
 30
days
 which
 I bave
 spent
 at
 the
 UNDF.
Given
 what
 I have
 said
 Mr.
 President,
 I
believe
 that
 this
 manner
 of doing
 things
on the
 part
 of
 the
 Prosecution
 is
prejudicial
 to the
 rights
 of the
 suspect
or
 detainee
 that
 I am
 but
 I also
 believe
that
 in the
 final
 analysis
 they
 could
 be
detrimental
 to the
 operations
 themselves
of
 the
 Tribunal.
 I am
 therefore,
 calling
upon
 your
 vigilance
 so
 that
 this
artificial
 material
 be
 placed
 aside
 so
that
 there
 should
 be
 a stop
 put
 to
criticism
 which
 is
 often
 levelled
 at
 the
International
 Criminal
 Tribunal
 for
Rwanda.
 Given
 the
 above,
 Mr.
 President,
I can
 request
 the
 Tribunal
 to
 release
me.
 Even
 provisionally
 while
 waiting
 for
the
 prosecution
 to bring
 about
 crimes
alleged
 against
 me
 because
 right
 now
 we
see
 that
 the
 prosecution

Nonetheless,
 Mr.

 if
 for

 another
 you
 were

 by the
 prosecution

 grant
an extension

 I am

 the

 you
 and
 which
 are

 for

 defence

 which

 That

 what

 So
 the

 you
 these

PRESIDENT:
provisional
 detention
 because
 this
 would
imply
 the
 establishment
 of an
 indictment
as
 soon
 as
 possible.
 As
 I have
 said
 it
is a sacred
 right
 for
 any
 person
 who
 is
arrested
 to
 know
 what
 crimes
 are
 alleged
against
 him.
 And
 once
 again,
 more
 than
once
 we drawn
 the
 attention
 of the
Prosecution
 on
 this
 issue,
 the
 need
 to
produce
 an
 indictment
 against
 accused
persons.
 Now
 Mr.
 Prosecutor
 was
 Mr.
Nzirorera
 in
 the
 indictment
 of
 the
 29
that
 you
 mentioned
 because
 you
 said
 to
the
 Benin
 authorities
 that
 there
 was
 an
indictment
 in
 process?
Yes,
 I don’t
 have
 the
 names,
 the
 29
 names
but
 I think
 if mention
 is
 made
 of
 this
 in
the
 letter
 he
 must
 have
 been
 there.
Now
 if
 the
 name
 of
 Mr.
 Nzirorera
 was
 in
the
 joint
 indictment
 should
 I understand
that
 the
 charges
 which
 were
 against
 him
in
 that
 indictment
 still
 exist
 and
 that
you
 could
 reutilise
 them
 in order
 to
 draw
up an
 indictment
 as
 soon
 as
 possible?
