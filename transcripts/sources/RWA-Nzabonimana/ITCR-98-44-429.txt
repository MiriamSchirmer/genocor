MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everyone.  

Could the Registry introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber? 

Registry. 
MS. SALIMO: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Solomy Balungi Bossa, presiding, Judge Bakhtiyar Tuzmukhamedov, Judge Mparany Rajohnson, is sitting this morning, 19th April 2010, in open session, for the continuation of the trial in the case of the Prosecutor versus Callixte Nzabonimana, Case No. ICTR-98-44-D-T.

Thank you, Madam President.

Yes, Registry, are we over the technical problem?

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	I hope you had a restful weekend; did you? 
A.	Yes, I rested well, thank you. 
Q.	Good.  Now we'll continue with our discussion that we left off on Thursday.  Witness, when you got to the French embassy, with your little baby, you were settled in one of the buildings inside the French embassy; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And the only place you could get was in the corridor within the building; that is correct, isn't it?  
A.	No, that is not correct.  I could move inside and outside the embassy, in the gardens. 
Q.	Witness, my question was:  You did not get a room as such, but you were settled on the corridor, inside the building; is that correct? 
A.	Nobody settled us.  We found space anywhere where one could find space within the embassy. 
Q.	The space you found, Madam Witness, was in the corridor of one of the buildings; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	We settled in the corridor.  
Q.	Yes.   And women and children -- and especially women in need, like yourself -- were given first priority to settle in those places; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	I was given priority because I was given a mattress to use with my children. 
Q.	Witness, is it correct that women and children were given the first priority to settle in those places that there was space to settle; is that correct?   That is the question. 
A.	I don't know if women and children were given top priority, but there were quite a few people inside and others were outside. 
Q.	The men were outside in little caucuses and groups discussing politics; do you know of that? 
A.	I don't know if they spent the whole time outside discussing. 
Q.	They were also listening to radio, correct? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	From time to time, there were people coming from outside and bringing information to the men who are in little groups outside; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	I'm not in a position to answer you; I don't know. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, you don't know because you were inside and you did not know everything that was going on; isn't that not correct? 
A.	I could also go out into the garden from time to time, if I could, but I could not know what was happening, whether people brought information or not.  But I didn't spend the whole day on the same spot. 
Q.	Yes.  Witness, the condition at the French embassy was bad:  There was no food -- sufficient food for your children; is that correct? 
A.	Maybe the food was insufficient, but we had enough to eat -- we had something to eat. 
Q.	And, Witness, from the moment your husband was appointed to join the interim government on the 8th of April 1994, he immediately went to Hôtel des Diplomates where the government was meeting; isn't that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct. 
Q.	In fact, you do not know because you are inside the house resting with your children, and you are very tired; isn't that correct? 
A.	At any rate, when he was about to leave he told me that he was going to go out.   So, he told me about it before leaving.  
Q.	And before leaving, you discussed the bad conditions in the French embassy, and you requested him to get you an alternative place to stay; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, later on, towards the 10th, we started discussing about getting out of the embassy. 
Q.	In fact, you did not leave the embassy on the 10th, you left the embassy on the 9th, and you are simply saying you left on the 10th so that to place Callixte Nzabonimana at the embassy; isn't that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, before the witness answers.  Sorry to interrupt, but could we have a complete date, when you say the 9th and the 10th, for the record. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	For the record, Witness, I'm talking about the 9th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	I did not leave on 9th April 1994, from the embassy.  I left on the 11th of the same month. 
Q.	Witness, you are aware that the minister, Casimir Bizimungu, and his family left the embassy on the 9th of April 1994 at about 4 p.m.; is that correct? 
A.	I did not hear the name of the person you mentioned. 
Q.	Sorry, Witness.  The name is, Minister Casimir Bizimungu.  
A.	I did not follow the movements of Mr. Casimir and his family, sorry. 
Q.	Witness, there is a little folder that I gave you yesterday (sic). 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I request Registry to refer to the little folder marked "May 2008"?  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness, you have two small folders, one labelled 2007; can you see that?  And another labelled 2008; can you see that?  And there is also a map of Kigali in it.  Now, I want to refer you to the little folder with -- of May 2007.  There's a document there -- there's a transcript from an open session dated 24th May 2007 and it's both in English and French.  Page 36 is the French and page 31, My Lords, is the English.  And in the French, I want to focus your attention to about line 25 at page 36, and the English version, My Lords, is line 27 of page 31.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, which transcripts are you referring to? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
These are transcripts from the Bizimungu Trial Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, of which date? 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Of 24th May 2007, My Lords.  We have two little folders that I passed on, on Thursday; one labelled May 2008 and the other 2007.  This one is found in the little folder labelled 2007.  

Thank you very much, My Lords. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, this is what happened on the 9th, according to Mr. Bizimungu, and I read:

"On the 9th of April, two things happened:  First, I left in the morning at around 10 a.m. to go for the swearing-in ceremony of the new government.  At that time, my family remained at the embassy of France.  I came back later in the afternoon, at about -- probably in the afternoon, but after 4 p.m.   After 4 p.m. I came back to collect my family from the embassy and move them to the Diplomates hotel, which is not far from the French embassy."

Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see it.  
Q.	And I put it to you that that refers also to you and your family:  All the ministers were moved out from the French embassy to the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th of April 1994 at about 4 p.m.; what do you say to that? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Before the witness answers, I would like her to be taken out of the courtroom because I have an objection to that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, learned counsel wants to raise a legal matter.  Could you kindly leave the courtroom?  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, there is simply no ground for the proposition that Mr. Ng'arua is making to the witness.  The transcript is clear:  Dr. Bizimungu in his testimony refers only to his family.  So to try to stretch the testimony of Casimir Bizimungu to suggest to the witness that this means that Prosper Mugiraneza and his family also moved out of the French embassy is simply going too far in what he's allowed to do in cross-examination. 

He's trying to mislead the witness by putting to him (sic) that these transcripts of Bizimungu support the proposition that Prosper Mugiraneza and his family also moved out of the embassy, and this is not true.  If he wants to use transcripts by people who testified in other cases -- if I may come back.  She indicated, a few minutes earlier, that she had no idea of the whereabouts of Mr. Bizimungu.  So I submit to you that:  First, there is no contradiction between her testimony and the transcripts that the Prosecutor is using right now -- first.   And, secondly, that the proposition that he is putting to the witness is not borne out by the evidence.  And before putting a proposition to the witness with the obvious view of contradicting him or her, this proposition has to be supported by the evidence.  And in this case, it is not, so that the question should not be allowed.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, this is a question that has been asked out of time.  This is a question that should be asked during re-examination.  Now, I'm saying that the government had moved to Hôtel des Diplomates.  If one family was moved there; other families were moved.  And, indeed, Madam President, Your Honours, we'll show that this witness is not only misleading the Court, she's outrightly lying.   They moved out on the 9th.   This is just one of the issues I'm putting to her, that there were some ministers that moved out; she was in a desperate position with a little baby and she should have been moved out at that time.  If she can understand the question, the question should be allowed, and my learned friend directed to ask such questions in the re-examination.  She can read the transcript; I've shown her the position.   I'm not saying that she said so; I'm saying that that is what Bizimungu said.  So there is no misdirection.  The question should be allowed.  This is cross-examination, and the question is not convoluted, it's clear, and the witness should be allowed to answer without counsel appearing to be overprotective.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Madam President, I only accept to take coffees with my learned colleague on the other side of the bench in the cafeteria because I think he's as bright as he puts to you I am.  And he perfectly knows that the government and family members of the ministers that were forming that government are two completely different things.  And he's entertaining here -- I'm sure it's not deliberate -- but he is entertaining here a certain degree of confusion between the fact that, yes, the government was indeed holding meetings at the Hôtel des Diplomates, but the members of their family were still remaining at the French embassy.  And this is no question for re-examination.   The purpose of re-examination is not to clarify questions, which the Prosecutor put to the witness that were not borne out by evidence.  Re-examination is to seek further clarification on such matters.  Here, I repeat to you that the proposition that the Prosecutor is making to the witness is not borne out by the evidence and he should be prohibited from doing so.  I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Yes, this is the ruling of the Trial Chamber:  The Trial Chamber understands the Prosecution to be putting the question under Rule (G)(ii), which provides as follows:  "In the cross-examination of a witness who is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party, counsel shall put to that witness the nature of the case of the party for whom that counsel appears which is in contradiction of the evidence given by the witness."

Yes, I stand corrected.   We are referring to Rule 90 (G)(ii).  So that being the case, we understand the Prosecution to be putting its case, which is in contradiction to what the witness has said, and this is a proper question.  However, taking into account what the witness's answers have been before this, we expect counsel to put this question, have the answer of the witness recorded, and then for the Prosecution to move on to other matters.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, could we have the witness back in the courtroom, please?  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, you can put back your question or remind -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I'm putting it to you that the ministers' families, including that of Bizimungu, were moved out of the French embassy on the 9th of April 1994 at about 4 p.m., and that you have been misleading the Court by saying that you moved out of the hotel in the evening of the 11th of April 1994.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I guess you meant the embassy and not the hotel, because you said that she moved out of the hotel. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	Sorry, embassy.  I'm talking about the movement from the embassy to the hotel.  
A.	I was speaking about what was concerning me.  I can't speak for everyone.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, are you aware that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana is facing charges related to the genocide of 1994 in Rwanda? 
A.	I don't know.  I came here to talk about what I was asked to speak of, but I don't know what he is being accused of. 
Q.	Madam Witness, your husband and Callixte Nzabonimana are charged with similar offences relating to the genocide of April 1994 to July 1994; are you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I know the charges against my husband, but I don't know what Callixte is being charged with. 
Q.	Witness, you have an interest in this case in that you know that your husband and Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana are both charged with matters relating to the genocide of 1994; isn't that correct? 
A.	I don't really have any interest.  What it is is that I was asked to speak about the dates of the 6th and where I saw Callixte up to the 12th of April 1994.  I don't know what you're seeing wrong in what I said, and I'm here as a witness. 
Q.	Yes, your interest further in this matter in coming to support Callixte Nzabonimana's presence at the French embassy, especially in the evening of the 9th and during the whole day of the 10th, is because there is a strong family bond between your family and that of Callixte Nzabonimana and that is the interest from which your bias arises; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is not true.  Even if it was someone else whom I'd witnessed, I don't know why I wouldn't come here to testify about what I saw on that day. 
Q.	Witness, it's because of that interest and the motive to have Callixte Nzabonimana exonerated of the charges of genocide that you have come here to tell the Court that you saw him in the evening of the 9th, and during the day and in the evening of the 10th of April 1994; isn't that correct? 
A.	I said before I started that I was going to speak the truth and nothing but the truth, and the questions that have been put to me are what I saw, and this is what I've said.  So, if that can help Callixte, I don't see why it is bad for me to say what I saw and for me to say what I have said here before this Court. 
Q.	Witness, you want this Court to believe that your husband got accommodation for himself in a five star hotel on the 10th of April 1994, and he slept there leaving you in a deplorable place in the French embassy with a little baby of 15 months old; is that not correct? 
A.	That is what happened, because for him it had been two or three days that he hadn't been sleeping.  He was very tired, and he left to go and sleep on that night while waiting for availability of a room for us. 
Q.	Even though, Witness, the distance between the two places was less than a quarter of a kilometre; isn't that correct? 
A.	I don't know exactly the distance between the two, but it wasn't very far. 
Q.	Witness, it was also a very safe area, the Hôtel des Diplomates was protected by the Rwandanese army, and the route between the hotel and the embassy was safe; isn't that the case? 
A.	What is my answer supposed to be?  I don't know.  I didn't quite understand your question. 
Q.	Never mind, Witness.  Witness, when you tell the Court that you left the embassy on the night of the 11th, to eventually enjoy the comfort of a hotel, did you register out of the embassy? 
A.	I left during the day of the 11th and not the night.  So for me to go out of the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, Madam President, I didn't quite follow that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we kindly request you to repeat your answer; the interpreters didn't follow it.  
THE WITNESS: 
I said that I left the French embassy in the day of the 11th.  So for me to go to the hotel, I had to leave the embassy.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	The question is, Madam:  You did not sign out as you left with your family, did you? 
A.	I remember that we were registered when we entered on the first day, but I didn't sign anything in order to leave.  
Q.	Witness, when you left the hotel, did you see the French ambassador in the compound? 
A.	First of all, I didn't know him physically, and even if he was there I would not be able to tell you who was the ambassador and who was not.  So, I did not see him. 
Q.	Did your husband -- or, rather, let me put it this way:  Your husband spoke to some French officials before you left the embassy; isn't that correct? 
A.	No, that is not true. 
Q.	Witness, you drove the short distance from the embassy to the Hôtel des Diplomates in a military vehicle; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not true. 
Q.	Witness, you did not walk from the French embassy to the Hôtel des Diplomates, did you? 
A.	No, I didn't walk. 
Q.	When you left the embassy enclosure there were soldiers protecting the embassy; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, there were soldiers. 
Q.	And it was during the day, you could see what was happening outside the embassy; isn't it? 
A.	Yes, one could see what was happening outside. 
Q.	You did not see the motor vehicle of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, did you? 
A.	What date are you speaking about, and at what time of the day? 
Q.	The date -- you said you left the hotel on the 11th, during the day, of April 1994. 
A.	No, I didn't see him in the day. 
Q.	Not him, but the vehicle.  
A.	No, I didn't see his car either.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
When the -- the interpretation is that "when you left the hotel".  But what I heard is -- what should have been, "when you left the embassy".  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Precisely.   It's the embassy.  I'm sure that's why my learned friend had reason. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	When you left the embassy, you did not see the vehicle of Callixte Nzabonimana, did you?  And your answer is no; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	You did not see anybody you knew outside the French embassy, did you? 
A.	I wasn't paying attention to the people outside, because there was a lot of people there. 
Q.	Witness, when -- the little distance between the French embassy and the Hôtel des Diplomates was a completely protected area; do you agree with that? 
A.	That is possible.  
Q.	When you got to the hotel, you discovered that the - the interim government of Rwanda was at that time -- you say you went to the hotel on the 10th of April 1994 -- operating from Hôtel des Diplomates; is that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, before the witness answers, your question talks about her leaving to go to the hotel on the 10th of April.  Is that your question?   Is that correctly put?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I'm putting it to her, Madam President.  All right.  
THE WITNESS: 
I said that I went to the hotel on the 11th of April and not the 10th.   So, I didn't see any government working.  I went directly to my room, which was the room allocated to me. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, all I am asking you is this, simply:  When you got to the hotel on the 11th of April 1994, you learned that the government of -- the interim government of Rwanda was operating from there; didn't you? 
A.	I didn't learn anything of that kind. 
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I beg the indulgence of the Court.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, when you got to the hotel room, did you settle in? 
A.	Yes, I tried to settle in. 
Q.	Who shared your room with you? 
A.	I was with my children, and my husband remained with us also until sunset or bedtime. 
Q.	So that room was not shared between yourselves and any other family; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Witness, you have come all this way from France, left your good job, to testify for a person you want the Court to believe was a distant acquaintance; is that not correct? 
A.	He was not a relative; he was an acquaintance. 
Q.	And you want the Court to believe that you came all the way to France (sic) to testify for a distant acquaintance; is that not correct? 
A.	Yes.  I do trust this Tribunal and I believe that they are here for them to do that. 
Q.	But that is not correct, is it?  Because your family and the family of Callixte Nzabonimana were close and they knew each other for a long time, isn't it? 
A.	Those are your words.  
Q.	Finally, Witness, you know that this Tribunal tries persons who are most involved in the 1994 genocide; isn't that correct? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Please, before you answer, can you wait?  

Can the witness be taken out from the Court?  Unless Your Honours want to rule immediately.  I think it is quite obvious that that question should not be allowed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, maybe you could step out for a moment to enable us to dispose of a legal argument between counsel?  We crave for your understanding, Witness.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Learned Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I know that the Prosecutor may have a bit of -- some preconceived ideas about the persons who are being tried by this Tribunal.  First, I would like to remind him that all these persons are presumed innocent, so that to say that this Tribunal is trying people who are the most involved in the genocide is an offence to all these people, and I take this opportunity to salute Mr. André Ntagerura, in the public gallery, who was tried by this Tribunal and found innocent.  So the suggestion should not be put to the witness, and I request Your Honour to order the Prosecutor to put proper questions to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Please, Learned Counsel, maybe you could rephrase your question.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I will.  I will, My Lords.  I will rephrase it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Can we have the witness back in the courtroom?
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, you are aware that this Tribunal was set up to try suspects of the Rwandan genocide; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Witness, on the 12th of April 1994, the French evacuated you to Bukavu? 
A.	We were -- they evacuated us, but not to Bukavu.   The destination was Bangui, in the Central African Republic. 
Q.	Did you eventually get to Bukavu? 
A.	Yes.  Our itinerary caused us to find ourselves in Bukavu later on. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court, at Bukavu did you see the family of Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, I saw the family of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana in Bukavu.  
Q.	And you took residence with them in Bukavu; isn't it? 
A.	We were in the same place, but we did not live in the same rooms because there were several hotels. 
Q.	In which hotel did the family of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana take residence? 
A.	I do not know the names of the hotels in which we were accommodated. 
Q.	Wasn't it the same hotel as the one you were accommodated in? 
A.	Both hotels were not far from one another, but it was not the same hotel. 
Q.	And you knew that the family of Callixte Nzabonimana was in the neighbourhood, because you visited them and they visited you; is that not correct? 
A.	We saw ourselves because we ate at the same place, but I did not pay them a visit. 
Q.	And when did they leave Bukavu, the family of Callixte Nzabonimana, that is? 
A.	We stayed for about two weeks in Bukavu and we left at the same time as Mr. Callixte's family.  
Q.	Tell the Court, from Bukavu -- you left Bukavu on or about the 26th of April 1994; isn't that correct? 
A.	I do not recall the precise date on which we left. 
Q.	Witness, from Bukavu where did you go? 
A.	We went to Cyangugu in Rwanda.  
Q.	When you got to Cyangugu in Rwanda, you continued to have meals and share accommodation with the family of Callixte Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	No, we did not share meals together and we did not share the same rooms either. 
Q.	How did you part ways in Cyangugu? 
A.	Parted company -- parted ways with whom? 
Q.	With the family of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	When we got there, we were accommodated at the Lake hotel, the Hôtel de Lac in Cyangugu, and each family was given a room in (inaudible) with the size of the family. 
Q.	And this arrangement was made by Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, who was still in Rwanda; isn't it? 
A.	I do not think so. 
Q.	Witness, who paid for your bills? 
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	It's also true that you do not know who made the arrangements for you to go to the Hôtel de Lac in Cyangugu; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  When we were in Cyangugu we were visited by Minister Mbangura, and we discussed with him and we told him that we were not properly accommodated in Bukavu and that he had to find a solution.  And the solution he found was that we should return to Rwanda, on the border.  So I believe he's the one who decided, with the Cyangugu authorities, to have us accommodated at the Hôtel du Lac.  Subsequently, he got in contact with our husbands who were not aware of the arrangements. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, what is the name of the minister who arranged for your accommodation in Cyangugu? Could you spell it out for the record, please? 
THE WITNESS: 
Mbangura, Daniel. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, Bangura is spelt B-A-N-G-U-R-A, Daniel.  
THE WITNESS: 
It is M-B, there's an M -- initial M. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, by the time you got to Cyangugu, you, your family and the family of Callixte Nzabonimana, were quite close; you shared meals together; you travelled together; and common arrangements were being made for you and Béata and her family; isn't that correct? 
A.	No, we did not share the same room, we did not share food; each person prepared food for their family. 
Q.	But, Witness, you told the Court a short while ago that you ate at the same place.  That's what I mean; you ate at the same place? 
A.	That is when we were still in Bukavu. 
Q.	And in Cyangugu, you stayed in the same hotel in different rooms; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  We accommodated with the others in the same hotel. 
Q.	Who were the other persons accommodated with you?  Were they ministers' wives and other prominent families? 
A.	They were all kinds of persons from various backgrounds. 
Q.	Witness, you arrived in Cyangugu on or about the 27th of April 1994; isn't that correct? 
A.	I do not really remember the date on which we arrived in Cyangugu. 
Q.	And for how long did you stay in Cyangugu, Madam Witness? 
A.	For about two and a half months.  
Q.	Yes.  During the two and a half months you stayed in Cyangugu, you lived in the same hotel as Béata, and you shared your experiences with her; isn't that correct? 
A.	It is not because we lived in the same place that we necessarily shared the same experiences. 
Q.	Are you telling this Court that by that time you had started quarrelling with Béata Nzabonimana? 
A.	At any rate, I did not have any problem with whomever.  
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that during the two and a half months you were in Cyangugu, from 27th of April 1994, you became extremely close with Béata and her family, and you became very familiar with her children; isn't that correct? 
A.	No, that is not true. 
Q.	So when earlier you told this Court you did not know exactly with whom Béata travelled, that was misleading the Court because you lived with this lady for a very long time; isn't it? 
A.	No.  I said that Béata travelled with her children.  I did not lie. 
Q.	But you could not remember the names of the children and you could not remember how many; that was misleading the Court, isn't it? 
A.	I do not even see how that could mislead the Court, if I don't know the number and names of Béata's children.  I've come here for Mr. Callixte.  I've not even come for Béata.  So, I really do not know the number of children and their names. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I thank you very much for answering my question, even though be it with a bit of hesitation.  

Thank you very much, Witness.  That's the end of cross-examination.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I request, My Lords, at this point -- or, maybe you would like to say something, Madam President, because I would like to put in the two documents that we referred to in the cross-examination of this witness.  I would like to have the little map. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, maybe after the testimony of the witness, Counsel. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Any re-examination, Defence Counsel? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
No, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Madam Witness, the Judges have questions for you.  Judge Rajohnson.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

Good day, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good day.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
If I understood you well, when you were testifying after the questions put to you, you were at the French embassy at that time in a hall, on the corridor, with the other women and children while the men were closer to the door or outside. 
THE WITNESS: 
No, the men could also stay with us.  And they would go out from time to time to get some fresh air in the garden, but they were not really compelled to stay inside. 
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
You also testified that you went out from time to time and that you had the possibility of doing so. 
THE WITNESS: 
When I speak of outside, it is not outside the embassy, but within the embassy compound but this time in the garden.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
So, could one therefore infer that at least you had an overview of all the persons who were there? 
THE WITNESS: 
Since there was a crowd, I could see people outside, but I did not stay out for long since I had a baby.  But I would go out when there was distribution of food, and immediately I got my food I went back inside.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
In that case, why did you not mention, if I remember correctly, the three families that you knew, that is, Ntagerura and Nzabonimana and Ferdinand Nahimana, those families?  And regarding the other ministers, could you add other names? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I saw Mugenzi's family.  I also saw Siméon's family and many others.  
(Pages 1 to 15 by Eleanor Bastian)


















1030H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what is the second family you saw?  If you could mention the whole name because if you mention just the first name, it becomes difficult for the record to reflect who this person is and for us to understand your testimony.  Who is Siméon?  
THE WITNESS:
I can't remember his family name.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But he was a minister or not?  
THE WITNESS:
No, he was not a minister back then. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Judge Rajohnson.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:
When you left with your husband, as you testified, and also with your children on 11th April, that is, when you left the embassy to go to Hôtel des Diplomates, you stated -- and to use your very words on CaseView, "you were checked".  What was this checking all about?  How did it take place?  Because today, you also testified that you didn't sign anything; you were not checked in.  So what is the truth?  What really transpired?  
THE WITNESS:
I testified that when we were coming into the embassy, we were checked in, but when I was leaving on the 11th, I was not made to sign any document or any form to show that I was leaving.  So when I was leaving, I was not checked.  And even when we were coming in, we were checked in, but it was not written anywhere.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:
So there was no one to check that you were leaving on 11th April, and even later on when you left the embassy definitively?  
THE WITNESS:
There was someone at the entrance who checked persons coming in and going out, and he was told that we were leaving and that we had found a room at the hotel, so he left us go. 
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:
You got to the embassy, according to your testimony, on 7th April.  And together with your family, you slept at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 11th February -- April, and your husband spent the night there on the 12th of April again; is that correct?  
THE WITNESS:
When I left the French (sic) on the 12th of April, in the morning, I don't know whether he had left the hotel or whether he was still there.  I left in the morning.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:
The reason that you cited, the reasons that prompted your husband to leave you alone at the embassy and to spend the night at the Hôtel des Diplomates was that he was feeling exhausted.  And the earlier nights, because you were there on the 7th, was he not tired?  Was he not tired that he'd stayed at the embassy?  
THE WITNESS:
Those are the reasons, among others, that prompted him to look for a room.  So there were many reasons that could prompt somebody to look for a room:  The sanitation; there was not much to eat; and the place had become unhygienic; one could not take a bath; it was difficult to change one's clothing; to find a bathroom; to take a bath.  And those are some of the reasons that prompted him to look for a room.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:
Thank you, Witness.  

Thank you, Madam President.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge Rajohnson.  

Witness, I have two questions for you.  My first question is:  When did you first get to know the Accused, Minister Callixte Nzabonimana, and his family, if you knew them differently, at different times, that is?  
THE WITNESS:
Are you speaking of the 6th of April 1994?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I saw them -- I saw them on the -- that evening of the 6th, at the Presidential Guard camp, yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Was that your first time to meet them and get to know them?  
THE WITNESS:
No, we knew one another well before. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And when did you first get to know each other?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember the year, but when Mr. Callixte became minister, there were often national festivities where we could see one another.  We would find one another together in receptions which were organised, and that is how we came to know one another, but I do not remember which year exactly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And did you know when Mr. Nzabonimana first became minister?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't remember at all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Witness.  

Now, my next question refers to the time you spent in Cyangugu at that hotel.  Did you say that it was two-and-half months that you stayed there?  
THE WITNESS:
I said that we remained there for about two-and-half months.  

I have a problem.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, what is the problem?  
THE WITNESS:
I am all right now.  It's gone. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  So during your stay of two-and-half months, did you stay with Mr. Nzabonimana's family, his wife and his children, throughout this period?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, his family was also with us all at the hotel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What about himself, that is, Mr. Nzabonimana?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't know about that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you mean to say he was not there or you don't know where he was?  
THE WITNESS:
I can't tell you where he was; he wasn't with us in Cyangugu. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you also.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, Witness, we have now come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming to enlighten the Chamber about the events of 1994.  Your testimony will be taken into account, together with all the other testimonies that have been adduced and will be adduced during this trial before a verdict is made in this case.  So you may leave now.  And thank you, once again.  
THE WITNESS:
May I please ask your favour, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are not saying we are going to grant it, but we can hear your request first.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  I would like to know whether it would be possible for the few days of leave that I have remaining if I could visit my husband, who is in prison.  And also, if I could obtain my passport, which has remained in the custody of the policeman.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the registry will make the necessary arrangements in accordance with the rules regarding both the requests.  

Registry, could you kindly attend to these requests of the witness.  Registry?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness, you may now leave.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution, you were talking about certain documents.  Perhaps this is the time to consider them.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, I would like to enter the documents from Bizimungu trial, dated 1st May 2008.  This is the testimony of this witness in that previous case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, do you have notes ready to accompany these documents?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, we have highlighted the areas that are relevant to the matters that have been talked about so that the Court need not go to each and every point that is contained in that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and what is the purpose for which you want to have these documents entered into the record?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
First and foremost, is to show that this witness has given slightly different stories in the Bizimungu trial.  This is with respect to having not mentioned the presence of Callixte Nzabonimana and his family in the previous testimony.  Something that has come only now.  

And, secondly -- and I think also quite importantly that, she does not mention that the reason why they left the Presidential Guard barrack and go to the French embassy was because of the predicament Béata found herself in when the soldier came searching for her.  So these are the two slightly different versions of the same witness.  It's for that reason, My Lords, that I am requesting that the document of the 1st of May 2008, be admitted.

Now --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment.  Let's deal with one by one.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, Your Honours, as we are speaking of this matter, we are painfully preparing written submissions with regards to each of the exhibits for which we will be seeking admission.  We are working on that as well.  So I think the same ruling should apply to the Prosecutor, simply to prepare a written document stating the reasons for which -- this is what was requested from us.  I don't see why the Prosecutor should not be -- submit to the same ruling, so simply a short document stating the purpose for which any given exhibit they are seeking its admission.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, we will do that.  We can put in a one-page document to show the relevance and the purpose for that.  We have no objection to that.  But then, we request that be given some more time, probably till close of business tomorrow, to do that.  And then, when we come in tomorrow, we can file in the documents with the relevant portions marked.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Yes, Learned Counsel, we would follow that procedure for both parties.  We would also like to say that, if any party intends to enter any maps as exhibit, then the maps should be self-explanatory so that the Chamber doesn't have a lot of difficulty reading them.  We can read maps, but we need helpful -- more helpful maps.  

Yes, Defence Counsel, your next witness.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, Your Honour, it will be Witness T9, and we would require the Trial Chamber to move into 
closed session for that witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, is the witness here?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We requested WVVS to bring in the witness this morning.  So, normally, the witness should be here.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, after drawing the curtains, please ensure that the witness is brought into the courtroom. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 22] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)  
(Pages 16 to 21 by Sheriffo Jammeh)






















MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you very well, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, everyone.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, kindly administer the oath to the witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Declaration made by Witness T9 in Kinyarwanda)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, before you begin your testimony, the Trial Chamber would like to give you a briefing about the procedures that obtain in this Tribunal.  

You will be led in your evidence by the Defence team, which is seated on your right-hand -- or, rather, on your left.  

The Prosecution is also entitled to ask you questions.  And after the Defence has finished its questions, the Prosecution, which is seated in front of translation booth, will also ask you questions.  The translation booth is on your right.  

You are required to answer all questions put to you by either party, unless the Trial Chamber considers them inappropriate.  And if they are inappropriate, the Trial Chamber will say so.  

Answer all questions briefly; avoid making long narratives, because they cause difficulties in translation and recording of your testimony.  

We conduct these proceedings in open and closed sessions.  In open sessions, the public is entitled to attend, while in closed sessions the public is excluded.  You will be informed which session we will be going into, and if we are in open sessions, do not mention names and places that may identify you, as the public may be out there listening or watching.  

If you have not understood a question put to you, you may ask for it to be repeated.  And we believe that if you follow these very simple instructions, we will quickly come to the end of your testimony.  We would like now to know whether you have understood our instructions, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel, you may deal with the preliminaries and then when you are done you can advice us.
WITNESS T9,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, you have before you -- you have before you a personal identification sheet.  Please look at it and confirm that information contained therein is in conformity with the truth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, the witness can do this on her own?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I suspect she can.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	If there are words or any information that you do not understand, could you please inform us?  
A.	I ---
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are in open -- 
THE WITNESS:
I have read the details about my identification and I have not a remark for anything that needs to be changed.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Could you please give the witness a pen for her to be able to sign that PIS?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we want you to confirm that the particulars are correct.  Is that so, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, all the information is correct.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, I would like to see the admission of that personal identification sheet with a number that will have to be determined later, I realise.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, any objection, Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Well, no objection, save to say that it should be under seal.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I thank my learned colleague for that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, what number would this exhibit be?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President, it will be D. 7.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the personal identification sheet of this witness -- is it T9, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, you're right, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, T9 is entered as a Defence exhibit, D. 7, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness, who is a protected witness.  
(Exhibit No. D. 7 admitted, under seal)
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, at this point, Madam President, there are two requests I will address to the Court.  The first is that we move into closed session because the very first question I will ask is likely to identify the witness.  

And may I request that we take the break now so that we can start the examination of that witness immediately after that break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, have you signed the personal identification sheet?  Please append your signature to indicate that the particulars contained therein are correct.  Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
I have already signed my personal identification sheet.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, can the Trial Chamber have a look.  

Yes, thank you, Witness.  We have approached the morning break and we will take a break of 
30 minutes before we proceed with your testimony.  Do not move until the curtains have been drawn.  You will be informed by the registry of when to get out of your seat.  

These proceedings are adjourned to 11:30 this morning, 11:30.  
(Court recessed from 1102H to 1140H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

The Trial Chamber asked for the bringing in of the witness to be delayed in order to deliver a ruling on one of the pending motions before the Trial Chamber, and this is the oral ruling of the Trial Chamber regarding the Defence motion to vary the witness list.  

On 14th April 2010, the Defence filed a motion asking the Trial Chamber to vary its witness list, pursuant to Rule 73 ter E, and to permit it to add two witnesses; namely, Fernand Batard, a Defence investigator; and Suzanne Thomson, an expert witness, to its list of witnesses.     

The Trial Chamber notes that the Defence has now disclosed the identifying information of these witnesses, and that in a response filed on the 15th April 2010, the Prosecution stated that it had no objection to adding these two witnesses to the Defence list.  

The Trial Chamber rejects the analogy made by the Defence in its motion with respect to a decision made in the Ngirabatware case regarding variation of witness list before the start of the Defence case.  

The Trial Chamber in this case has repeatedly reminded the Defence that the issue here is the failure of the Defence to provide adequate identifying information about the witnesses in accordance with the deadline set by the Trial Chamber, despite the fact that the Trial Chamber extended the relevant deadline on more than one occasion.  

Nevertheless, the Trial Chamber considers that the Defence, in its motion, had shown good cause for adding these two witnesses to its list of witnesses, and concludes that it is in the interest of justice to grant the Defence motion.  It, therefore, grants the Defence motion.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, now that we are dealing with this matter, may I request my learned friends to enlighten us about the list of witnesses after week 3.  As you remember, they gave us the list of witnesses up to number 14 on week 3.  We are eagerly awaiting, and I hope they can do it now, and give us the list of witnesses, as they will occur, the batting order, after witness 14 to the end, if they may do so now.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Would it be agreeable to the Prosecutor if we file a document with a comprehensive list of witnesses by the end of closing day today?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
That would be acceptable.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay then.  Well, let this matter lie.  

Registry, could we have the witness brought in, please.  
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, could we go into closed session for the testimony of the witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 44] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 23 to 27 by Sheriffo Jammeh)

























(Court resumed at 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  The Trial Chamber apologises for starting late.  It had a matter of grave concern that it was addressing.  And the Trial Chamber -- the parties will be apprised shortly of this matter.  However, the Trial Chamber wishes to begin by making an oral decision relating to the request by the Prosecution to unseal closed session testimony.  

This is the oral decision on the issue of hearing testimony in closed versus open sessions:  During proceedings on 15th April 2010, the Prosecution made an oral motion to revisit portions of 
Defence witness testimony that were held in closed session, with a view to determining what parts might be unsealed and made part of the public record.  

The Prosecution submitted that certain testimony did not contain information that might identify a protected witness.  The Defence objected to the Prosecution motion and indicated that, if it were granted, it would file a motion asking the Trial Chamber to open testimony given in closed session during the Prosecution case.  

The Trial Chamber is acutely aware of the delicate balance that must be maintained between the need for all witnesses who come to testify before it to be able to do so without fear of reprisal against themselves or their families, and the need for proceedings before this Tribunal to be conducted in a transparent manner.  

The Trial Chamber notes that the Prosecution's proposal will likely result in time-consuming litigation on exactly what evidence ought or ought not to be unsealed.  The Trial Chamber is, therefore, of the opinion that the instant motion would unduly compromise the need to conduct this trial in an expeditious manner.  

The Trial Chamber further notes that it is the responsibility of the parties, particularly opposing counsel, to object in a timely manner if it believes that closed session testimony is no longer required while a witness is testifying.  

The Trial Chamber rejects the assertion of the Defence that all or nearly all Prosecution evidence was delivered in closed session and notes that the Defence made no objections at that time.  

The Trial Chamber seizes this opportunity to remind both parties of their duty to ensure that as much testimony as possible is delivered in open session.  The Trial Chamber intends to continue overseeing the proceedings and will not hesitate to address the issue when it deems it necessary to do so.  That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber in this regard.  

The Trial Chamber has another matter to raise with the parties.  It has been brought to the attention of the Chamber that, as these proceedings were adjourning for lunch break, the Defence counsel made several utterances that, if proven, may amount to an insult not only to this Trial Chamber, but of the Tribunal as a whole.  It included abusive language with possible racial connotations, such as description of the Chamber as Mongolian and Banana Republic, as well as lewd gestures.  

We would now like to invite comments from the Defence regarding this matter.  

Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
On what topic, Madam President?  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We are waiting to hear from you, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I have no knowledge of any discussions between the parties, nor any such statements.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Learned Counsel, this was not a discussion between the parties.  It was a discussion conducted by the Defence team amongst themselves at the time of adjourning these proceedings for lunch.  That is the clarification the Trial Chamber wishes to make.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I believe that outside the court hearing, the Defence may want to have any discussions it wants to have, and that anything that is situated outside the hearing of the Chamber is beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and of the Chamber itself.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, the Trial Chamber would like to say that it will be actively seized of this matter and will act on it in accordance with rules and applicable regulations of professional conduct.  That is all the Trial Chamber wishes to say.  

Registry, could we now have the witness brought in the courtroom after the curtains have been drawn.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Madam President.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The Trial Chamber regrets the delay in the commencement of your cross-examination.  It had other urgent matters to deal with, but is now ready to continue with your testimony.  You are reminded of the oath you took at the beginning to tell the truth during your testimony.  
WITNESS T5 (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.       Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.       Good afternoon, Prosecutor.  
Q.       I hope you've had a lot of rest since Thursday, when we last met. 
A.       Yes, a lot of rest. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, we're in open session.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  I will remember that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness.  We're in open session, so be careful not to mention any -- to give any information that may identify you, as the public is allowed to attend this session.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.       Good morning, Witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness.  Did you have something to say?  And remember we're in open session.  
THE WITNESS: 
Madam President, the last time I insisted that my entire testimony be heard in closed session, and I continue to insist.  I do not know, but I'm still insisting on this fact.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, this matter was considered at length by the Trial Chamber last week, and we did say that we will go to great strength to protect your identity because you're a protected witness and we are enjoined to do so.  

However, we also said that we have a duty as a Tribunal to conduct these proceedings in a transparent manner, giving due consideration to the rights of the Accused, of our duty to protect all witnesses and victims, and of the wider international public, which has invested in these proceedings.  

We would like, therefore, to assure you that you will be safe, and that if there is need for us to discuss your testimony in a closed session, we will do so.  The parties know this; they are not supposed to ask you questions which will identify you.  And you, on your part, while answering questions, must make sure that you are careful in order not to breach the protective measures that were granted to you.  
So, have these considerations in mind as you testify.  If the Prosecution has questions which it feels will identify you, it will say so.  On our part, we will intervene if we think that the Prosecution or any other party is taking risks with your security.  So rest assured, Witness.  

Have you understood, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Madam President, I have understood you.  But I think I came here to speak the truth, the truth as far as I know it, and what I experienced.  If we start leaving aside the relevant information that has to do with the case of Nzabonimana, we might not be speaking the truth here, because we have come here to speak the truth.  

You are talking about security.  Security for me is not the security or safety of the individual, because we're in a political context here.  Let me be clear:  This is a political context which is not only limited here, and even goes beyond this room.  It goes beyond the borders.  I am telling you that security does not only concern an individual.  We are living in a society, and this society is governed by certain policies -- politics.  And we have -- we're involved with these politics in our sub-region.  

So I was insisting that if you want the truth to be said, then my testimony should be in closed session so that I can tell you what I saw, what I experienced, what I heard.  If -- for security reasons -- I clearly see, because security does not only concern my person; others are also involved.  Others are also involved in this case.  And that is why I'm asking that if you're really insisting that my testimony be held in open session, I would ask counsel, who is listening to me, to withdraw my testimony.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, we want you to listen very carefully to what we are saying.  We don't know the questions that are going to be put to you; therefore, we cannot determine in advance that these questions will challenge your identity.  We have to listen to the question first, and before you answer, take appropriate remedies.  And that is what we will encourage you to do as well, Witness.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, Your Honours, the witness is talking about his safety, his security and the security of his family in his country.  He told you last week and he's repeating it today.  We do not even know the questions that would be put to him by Mr. Prosecutor.  And I think that this security is extremely important.  This is a legitimate request that is being submitted to you by someone who has a capacity to reflect and assess the risks he's running.  

I would even say that the mere fact that his voice is being heard, a voice that is easily recognizable, his manner of speaking, could identify him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution Counsel?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, unless counsel is not telling us something, the kind of questions that I want to ask this gentleman in open session are of a very general nature.  They will not tend to identify him.  And during the previous submissions, with respect to opening up the session, counsel, calling this witness, did not bring up any new argument to show why or how this witness is at risk because of his voice.  

Now, there are certain things that we know about this witness and, in my view, save that his name and current address are not given, I feel that counsel is taking his argument too far in trying to protect a hypothetical situation.  

So it is my submission that we can proceed with this matter.  If I ask a question whose answer is likely to identify this witness, I will bow down to any objections to the contrary.  So I -- I have not come upon any jurisprudence to the effect that my learned friend now proposes, that unless there is a motivated argument to show so, the witness's voice can be heard, but his face and his identity is kept sealed.  

And, My Lords, there is no end to it.  If, for instance, a witness comes here and says that he wouldn't want even the Judges to see him, what shall we do?  I think the request can go too far.  And in my humble submission, unless, of course, counsel shows it, there is nothing extraordinary about the status or even the position of this witness that would cause a grave danger if his voice is heard.  That is my submission. 

I, therefore, request that the cross-examination of this witness continues in an open session until such time that we all feel that we need to go into a closed session for a while.  But, as it is now, we request that I proceed in the open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I cannot give the Trial Chamber any indications before the public, any reasons which, besides the voice of this witness, who is testifying in French and who has a specific way of speaking that is specific to him, which would allow for any direct or indirect consequences if the voice were recognised.  So I cannot respond to that in open session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber:  The Trial Chamber would like to advise the parties that if any additional protective measures are required, they should be brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber in a timely fashion before the beginning of the testimony of the witness.  
That said, we have listened carefully to the submissions of the parties.  The Trial Chamber considers that the witness may have genuine fears that his voice may be recognised.  We will go into closed session to hear the testimony of this witness.  But, in the meantime, we request the registry to work on the technicalities necessary to enable the witness to testify in open session with a disguised voice.  Should this technology be installed before he finishes his testimony, we will revert to this technology before the end of his testimony.  

We would now like to request the public to leave the gallery, because this is a protected witness and we have to hear his testimony in closed session.  We apologise.
