         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         2        Yes.  Your next witness, Professor Hinds?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Defence calls Witness TLA. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: T --

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: T as in Tom, L as in lovely, A as in 

         6        adorable.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Or is it a short one.

         8   

         9        Can you swear the witness, please?  Make him make the 

        10        solemn declaration, registry, please. 

        11        (Declaration made by Witness TLA in Kinyarwanda)

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Witness TLA, you have just made a solemn 

        13        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

        14        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        15        essential elements before you begin your testimony.  You 

        16        will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Defence, 

        17        who are seated on this side of the courtroom.  

        18        Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        19        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        20        this side of the courtroom.  Also the Judges sitting in 

        21        front of you may put questions to you as you testify, if 

        22        they will have such questions to ask you to clarify your 

        23        evidence as you go along.  If a question put to you is 

        24        not clear or you do not understand it, please say so and 

        25        such a question shall be repeated or explained.  These 

        26        are the few essential elements we wanted to bring to 

        27        your attention before you start your testimony. 

        28   THE WITNESS: Thank you.  

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, learned counsel? 

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         2                   first having been duly sworn,           

         3                       testified as follows:

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Witness TLA, how do you feel this morning?

         8   A.   Good morning, Counsel.  I am all right. 

         9   Q.   Witness, we will show you a document and I would like 

        10        you to look over the document.  The document contains 

        11        particulars concerning yourself.  We would like you to 

        12        look over these particulars and if they are correct, we 

        13        would like you to sign the document and date it, and 

        14        then return it to me.  Do you understand this? 

        15   A.   Very well.  There is no problem.  The information on 

        16        this document reflects the reality. 

        17   Q.   Then, Witness, would you kindly sign the document and 

        18        date it, please, and return it?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, the Defence tenders this 

        20        document as Defence Exhibit 32, and we would ask that it 

        21        be sealed since it contains the particulars of this 

        22        witness. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection? 

        24   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour.  

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Let the document containing the personal 

        26        particulars of Witness TLA be admitted as Defence 

        27        Exhibit No. 32 and the same shall be kept under seal as 

        28        it contains the personal particulars of this witness, 

        29        who is a protected witness.

        30   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel. 

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I will request that we go into 

         4        closed session so that I could deal with some 

         5        particulars which may reveal the identity of the 

         6        witness, and I'll try to keep this as brief as possible 

         7        in closed session.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Any objection to that?  

         9   MS. OJEMENI: No objection.  

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We will go into closed session to enable 

        11        Counsel to raise questions, some of which could have a 

        12        bearing on the identity of the witness.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: We are back to open session.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Witness, we are now in open session and I will put a 

         5        series of questions to you.  Listen to the questions 

         6        very carefully, and if you think by answering the 

         7        question it may reveal your identity, indicate so to the 

         8        Trial Chamber and we will try to either rephrase the 

         9        question or something like that.  Do you understand 

        10        this? 

        11   A.   Yes, I have. 

        12   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, before my learned friend continues, 

        13        may I know if there is any mark of identity on the 

        14        location on the Exhibit 33 that he just tendered?  If 

        15        so, may I have a look at it. 

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Sorry, identity --

        17   MS. OJEMENI: Mark of identity for the various locations that 

        18        he mentioned on the sketch.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that it is proper for the Prosecutor 

        20        to see the document in any event, she is entitled to see 

        21        it.  

        22        

        23        May I, Your Honours?  

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The only thing about the identity could 

        25        be the time frames when linked up with the pseudonym.  

        26        One could -- that is the element only that I think comes 

        27        up on that particular issue.  Go on, Counsel. 

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli? 

        30   A.   Yes, I know him very well.

         1   Q.   When did you first meet Juvénal Kajelijeli and under 

         2        what circumstances? 

         3   A.   I met him for the first time in 1991 when I began my job 

         4        because that was in his commune. 

         5   Q.   When you say it was in his commune, what do you mean by 

         6        that? 

         7   A.   In 1991, he was the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune. 

         8   Q.   Do you know whether he was removed as bourgmestre, and 

         9        if so, when? 

        10   A.   Yes, he stopped being bourgmestre in February 1993, if 

        11        my memory serves me right. 

        12   Q.   And do you know whom he was replaced by? 

        13   A.   Yes, it was Conseiller Ndisetse.

        14   Q.   And --

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Our attention is being drawn by the registry 

        16        to the drawing with regard to TLA's place.  Formally 

        17        there was one structure, and, of course, there was an 

        18        explanation with regard to the other structure.  So that 

        19        might be further explained so that the distinction is 

        20        made for further record.  When you refer to the home, 

        21        how far do you go?  I think it is a valid issue.  

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: We are not complete, Your Honour.  There are 

        23        other notations that are going to be made on that 

        24        document as we go along. 

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Go on. 

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Witness, do you know who succeeded Ndisetse, if any one? 

        28   A.   Yes, he was replaced.  But I want to find out from you 

        29        if I can mention that name, since we are in open 

        30        session.

         1   Q.   Yes, you can mention the name of the individual who 

         2        replaced Ndisetse.

         3   A.   After Ndisetse there came bourgmestre Emmanuel 

         4        Harerimana. 

         5   Q.   And do you know up to what date he served as 

         6        bourgmestre? 

         7   A.   Who?

         8   Q.   You mentioned the bourgmestre who replaced Ndisetse.  

         9        I am asking you, do you know up to what year did he 

        10        serve as bourgmestre, Harerimana? 

        11   A.   Yes, after Ndisetse, he served as bougmestre until 1994, 

        12        and more specifically, up to the 8th of July, because on 

        13        the 8th of July, he died. 

        14   Q.   Is it 8th of July that he died? 

        15   A.   I don't remember the date very well, but I think we 

        16        buried him on the 9th of July.  I believe the 9th of 

        17        July 1994 he was buried. 

        18   Q.   Witness, I draw your attention to the period when the 

        19        president was killed.  Do you remember that date? 

        20   A.   Yes, I do.  I remember that date very well. 

        21   Q.   What date was that? 

        22   A.   I learnt of the death on the 7th in the morning that he 

        23        was killed on 6th, the night of 6th to 7th April. 

        24   Q.   Now, does that refresh your recollection with respect to 

        25        when bourgmestre Harerimana died? 

        26   A.   Yes, yes.  It was therefore Harerimana who died on 8th 

        27        of April.  Yes, that is it, 8th April or 9th April.  

        28        Thank you very much. 

        29   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know who replaced Harerimana, if 

        30        any one after he died?

         1   A.   Yes, he was replaced by one Felicien Semahane. 

         2   Q.   And do you know if any one replaced Semahane?

         3   A.   Yes, after Semahane came Mr. Kajelijeli who was once 

         4        again elected bourgmestre of Mukingo.  I don't know 

         5        whether he was elected or appointed.  But, in any case, 

         6        he was the one who replaced Semahane.  I didn't work in 

         7        the Ministry of Interior, so I wouldn't know the exact 

         8        details as to how he became bourgmestre.

         9   Q.   Do you know for what period he served as bourgmestre 

        10        in 1994? 

        11   A.   Who? 

        12   Q.   Kajelijeli -- do you know for what period, what time he 

        13        served as bourgmestre? 

        14   A.   Yes, during his second term, I think it was in June -- 

        15        from June 1994 and we fled in the month of July.  I 

        16        don't think he remained in the country.  So it was a 

        17        very short period of time. 

        18   Q.   Now, Witness, we'd like you to look around the courtroom 

        19        and see if you can identify Juvénal Kajelijeli.  You 

        20        should -- you can stand up and describe what he is 

        21        wearing and where he is sitting, and if anyone is 

        22        sitting next to him, describe those individuals for the 

        23        Trial Chamber.

        24   A.   Thank you very much.  Yes, I know Kajelijeli very well.  

        25        He is wearing spectacles.  He is behind someone who is 

        26        wearing spectacles and he is touching his mouth.  He is 

        27        wearing a khaki coloured jacket and a blue shirt.  I 

        28        believe there is a fan to his right, after which there 

        29        is a light-skinned person sitting.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating Mr. Kajelijeli.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: And that person holding his mouth, could that 

         2        be Professor Bompaka?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: The person who was -- 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Who was holding his hand. 

         5        

         6        Yes, the witness has identified the Accused Kajelijeli 

         7        in the Court well. 

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, you can sit down.

        10   A.   Thank you. 

        11   Q.   Witness, you have indicated to us when you learned of 

        12        the president's death.  Can you tell us the time? 

        13   A.   Thank you very much.  Before I tell you about the time, 

        14        I would like to apologise because during these events, 

        15        no one was looking at the time.  So, I am going to give 

        16        you an approximate time.  I learnt of the death of the 

        17        president of the republic in the morning of the 7th at 

        18        around 5:30, something like that.

        19   Q.   And, Witness, how did you find out about the death of 

        20        the president? 

        21   A.   It was in the morning of 7th April around 5:30 a.m.

        22   Q.   Yes.  By what means did you learn of the death of the 

        23        president at 5:30 in the morning? 

        24   A.   It was through a neighbour whose house was behind my 

        25        house.  He came to wake me up standing behind my fence. 

        26   Q.   And what if anything did he tell you?

        27   A.   He called out and said:  "Gentleman, have you heard 

        28        about the death of our president"?  He was standing 

        29        behind the fence and I was looking at him.  I did not 

        30        understand what he was saying, but any how, I heard it

         1        from him.  I was surprised and I was perplexed after I 

         2        heard this. 

         3   Q.   What if anything did you do after you learnt of the 

         4        death of the president? 

         5   A.   Very difficult, very difficult.  I went back, woke my 

         6        wife up and told her that it appeared the president was 

         7        dead.  She jumped up, I maintained my cool all the same.  

         8        And at 6:00 a.m. I now heard it on Radio Rwanda, and it 

         9        was horrible to us.  It was terrifying. 

        10   Q.   Now, what information did you obtain on Radio Rwanda? 

        11   A.   After I heard it with my own ears on the radio, there 

        12        was a press release on the radio urging the people to 

        13        remain at home. 

        14   Q.   Now, Witness, you said that a neighbour gave you the 

        15        information in the first instance.  What was the name of 

        16        that neighbour?

        17   MR. KIYEYEU: I am sorry.  Do you want the witness to mention 

        18        the name of the neighbour who lives directly behind?  Is 

        19        that what you want?

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: I get your point.  Okay.  We will take that 

        21        up in closed session. 

        22   MS. OJEMENI: I wonder, Your Honour, if it could be written 

        23        down.  

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: No.  I prefer not to have notes written 

        25        down.  We will deal with that when we go into closed 

        26        session.  The witness has not answered, as far as I 

        27        know, has he?

        28   MS. OJEMENI: But, Your Honour, we already have Exhibit 33, 

        29        can't it be written on it?  It is under seal.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Judge Ramaroson says that the name has been

          KAJELIJELI                                       2 DECEMBER 2002



         1        mentioned in French.  You were suggesting, Counsel?

         2   MS. OJEMENI: If the name could be put on sketch that we have, 

         3        D33, the sketch is already under seal.  

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: If the witness has already said it in 

         5        French, we may just as well go into closed session and 

         6        deal with it.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, that would be one option.  But the 

         8        option of writing notes -- the problem with notes is 

         9        that a piece of paper -- they have got to the admitted 

        10        into evidence and when you have these small little 

        11        papers, sometimes over a period of time they get lost, 

        12        particularly at the time when they might be required.

        13   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, I am just suggesting that since we 

        14        have Exhibit D33, which describes the location of the 

        15        witness's house, he might as well use that to put down 

        16        the name of the neighbour.  The exhibit is still under 

        17        seal.  

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, if that was the neighbour you have in 

        19        mind. 

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, we could do that, Your Honour.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: But whichever way, we have got to hear it.  So  

        22        we have to go maybe into closed session for a short 

        23        while and then --

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's what I am suggesting, Your Honour.

        25        

        26        Your Honour, as I understand it, this witness has not 

        27        given the name of the neighbour.

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Witness, have you given the name yes or no?

        30   A.   No.  I have not given the name of the person who gave me

         1        the information.  

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: The name has not been given, that is a fact.

         3        Now, we can deal with it.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Deal with it.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we are back into open session.  Are we 

         2        there?  Yes.

         3   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lord. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: So, Witness TLA, take note that we are now in 

         5        open session and that you should be careful not to 

         6        mention names of people and places which could have a 

         7        bearing on your identity. 

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Now, Witness, from the place that you were, that you 

        10        just testified to, could you see Kajelijeli's building? 

        11   A.   *****, I could easily see Kajelijeli's house. 

        12   Q.   Witness, as you testify, do not identify *****.  Do 

        13        you understand that?  Just indicate from the place that 

        14        you were.  Do you understand that?

        15   A.   Yes, I understand. 

        16   Q.   Thank you.  Did you see Kajelijeli at that time? 

        17   A.   I never saw him. 

        18   Q.   Do you know what that building that he owned was used 

        19        for at that time, that is on April 7th of 1994?

        20   A.   Yes, the house had been rented out and was being used as 

        21        a bar, where people come and take a beer. 

        22   Q.   Do you know who rented that house out? 

        23   A.   Yes, I know the name of the person who rented that 

        24        house, but I cannot give his name since we are in open 

        25        session. 

        26   Q.   Now, you can give the name of the person who rented the 

        27        bar?

        28   A.   The person who rented the house is a lady called 

        29        Nyiramafaranga.

        30   Q.   On that morning, was that bar open at that time?

        12   Q.   What if anything did you do after you opened the window? 

        13   A.   Just as any man who was in charge of******, I opened 

        14        *** and stood right **** to see and 

        15        if I realised that somebody wanted to enter, then I 

        16        would move.  So, I placed myself at the **** 

        17        **** and I could watch all the movements.

        18   Q.   And, Witness, what did you see, if anything? 

        19   A.   I saw an unusual movement, even if you consider -- if 

        20        you compare it to a market day, on that particular day 

        21        there were a lot of people, people coming from Byangabo, 

        22        war displaced people were moving towards the centre of 

        23        Byangabo and they were shouting, they were crying.  So 

        24        there was an uncontrollable movement, crying, shouting, 

        25        agitation. 

        26   Q.   Could you tell the Court how these people were dressed 

        27        in terms of their outer appearance?  What did you see?

        28   A.   The people were wearing ordinary clothes, except for the 

        29        war displaced people who were wearing dirty and torn 

        30        clothes.  But generally, they were wearing ordinary

         1        clothes, nothing special. 

         2   Q.   Did you see -- were they carrying any weapons, or 

         3        anything that could be used as a weapon? 

         4   A.   Yes, that is why I said it was a strange movement.  

         5        There were people who -- well I don't know how to put 

         6        it.  So, let me put it in Kinyarwanda, is that possible?

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, it would be translated.

         8   THE WITNESS: These people were carrying clubs, bamboo sticks, 

         9        sharpened stones and it looked like all these people 

        10        were going to the war front.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Now, Witness, how long did you remain at that location 

        13        that morning? 

        14   A.   I stayed there for a long time.  I stayed there until I 

        15        realised that the crowd was dispersing.  And then, I 

        16        also saw around 8:00, approximately 8:00, 8:30, I saw 

        17        the conseiller Ndisetse run towards his house, his house 

        18        which was close to mine. 

        19   Q.   Now, where specifically did you see the conseiller 

        20        running?  And, Witness, please, think very carefully 

        21        when you use any references to yourself, so you do not 

        22        reveal your identity, please.  You testified you saw the 

        23        conseiller.

        24   A.   Yes, I saw him. 

        25   Q.   And you said you saw him running? 

        26   A.   Yes. 

        27   Q.   You could tell us whether he was running in your 

        28        direction, but that is as far as you can say.  Do you 

        29        understand? 

        30   A.   No, I saw him enter because I was looking at the street.

         1        He entered into his house, inside, within the compound 

         2        of the house, a house which was close to mine -- 

         3        adjacent to mine.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think we will have to go into 

         5        closed session to deal with this, because I can't seem 

         6        to get the information in open session without -- to 

         7        fully get the record, unfortunately.  

         8   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, I think my learned friend can 

         9        organise his work in a better way to be able to give 

        10        members of the public an opportunity to know what is  

        11        going on in this case, because we are a bit worried with 

        12        this closing and opening again the sessions.  He can 

        13        organise his work better than this. 

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we obviously have an 

        15        interest in full ventilation and that has been our 

        16        position throughout.  That has to be balanced obviously, 

        17        against the issue of confidentiality of protected 

        18        witnesses.  The witness obviously has problems in 

        19        expressing himself.  So, therefore, I'd rather -- than 

        20        continue to jeopardise his own situation.  I think it is 


        21        prudent for us to go into closed session as long as we 

        22        are dealing with this issue. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: I think it cannot be avoided that this area be 

        24        dealt with in closed session, in view of what the 

        25        Trial Chamber perceives the witness to be talking about 

        26        the various locations.  It is not easy to have these 

        27        spelt out or ventilated clearly without perhaps causing 


        28        certain problems connected with the identity of this 

        29        witness.

         1        So, we will go into closed session for a short while.  

         2        And, Counsel, if you can address all the issues that you 

         3        think can cause problems or are connected to the 

         4        identity of the witness, please, do it so that we -- 

         5        when we come out of the closed session, we can move on 

         6        in a coherent way in the open session, rather than going 

         7        in and out. 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think, Your Honour, the only issue we are 

         9        dealing with are the events at Byangabo, but I was 

        10        trying rather than dealing with all of that in closed 

        11        session.  I wanted to at least have as much of it in 

        12        open session but obviously the witness is only able to 

        13        testify without identifying himself in the context of 

        14        his testimony. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Who has the sketch?  Where is the sketch?  Can 

        16        you screen it?

        17        

        18        (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the 

        19        transcript [pages 31 to 41] was extracted and sealed

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Now, Witness, between 6:30 in the morning to 5:00 in the 

         3        afternoon, did you at any time see Juvénal Kajelijeli or 

         4        his car at Byangabo?  

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Between, sorry?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Six-thirty in the morning and five in the 

         7        afternoon.

         8   THE WITNESS: I never saw him.  I neither saw Kajelijeli nor 

         9        his car ever.

        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Now, Witness, you have indicated that you know the 

        12        Isimbi house.  And Witness in answering, please, do not 

        13        say anything that reflects your identity.  Do you know 

        14        the Isimbi house?

        15   A.   Yes, I know the building.

        16   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know what activities, if any, were 

        17        conducted at that location?

        18   A.   Yes, there were activities carried on in that building.

        19   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber what type of 

        20        activities were conducted in that building between 1991 

        21        and 1994?

        22   A.   Yes, in that building there was a pharmacy, there was a 

        23        bar and there was also the office of a project 

        24        responsible for water supply.  And behind, or in the 

        25        back courtyard were the renters, people who rented 

        26        space.

        27   Q.   Do you know who rented space, without telling us the 

        28        names of the people?  Do you know what their profession 

        29        was?

        30   A.   Yes, I knew them.  One was a doctor and the other one

         1        was a seller of beer of the bar, and the other one had 

         2        learned his field.  Now the tenants were teachers who 

         3        taught at an institution of education.  I don't want us 

         4        to be mentioning this name, since we are in public and 

         5        open session.

         6   Q.   Yes, Witness, I don't want you to mention the name of 

         7        anyone.  Do you know the party affiliation of the people 

         8        who were teachers?

         9   A.   Yes, I know what political party they belonged to, but I 

        10        don't know whether I should mention the name of that 

        11        party here now.

        12   Q.   Yes, you can.  What was the party?

        13   A.   The two teachers were members of the MRND.

        14   Q.   Do you know who owned Isimbi?

        15   A.   Yes, I know the owner.

        16   Q.   And who was the owner?

        17   A.   It was the house belonging to the family -- in fact, I'm 

        18        avoiding mentioning the name because we are in public 

        19        session.

        20   Q.   You can mention that name?

        21   A.   All right.  This was the Nzirorera's family's building.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is an appropriate time for 

        23        me to stop, and I hope to finish with this witness 

        24        before 12 o'clock.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  We'll stop here and take a break 

        26        for 15 minutes; that is, we resume our work at twenty 

        27        past eleven.  So, when we come back we have about forty 

        28        minutes to twelve, Professor Hinds.  All right.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: **don't form me exactly, I'm pushing for 

        30        twelve.

         5        are late, we have another thing to do.  We'll continue 

         6        the evidence of Witness TLA in examination-in-chief by 

         7        the Defence.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you. 

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: May I proceed?

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please. 

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Yes, Witness, you testified concerning -- 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: We are in open session.  Tell Witness TLA so, 

        15        or well, he understands that in French.  We are used to 

        16        that.

        17   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   Witness, you testified concerning Isimbi.  You indicated 

        19        who owned Isimbi.  Witness, do you know what activities, 

        20        if any, we conducted at Isimbi other than what you 

        21        testified about?

        22   A.   Apart from the activities that I referred to, there were 

        23        no other activities.

        24   Q.   Were there any meetings that were held there?

        25   A.   No.

        26   Q.   Did you at any time between 1991 and April of 1994, see 

        27        any training -- military training of youths in front of 

        28        Isimbi?

        29   A.   Never, I never saw that.

        30   Q.   Did you ever see any distribution of uniforms at Isimbi

         1        by anyone?

         2   A.   Never, I never saw such activities of distribution.  No, 

         3        never.

         4   Q.   And did you see any distribution of weapons?

         5   A.   No, I didn't see anything.

         6   Q.   Now, was there -- were there any flags of political 

         7        parties flown at Byangabo?

         8   A.   Yes, there were flags of the various political parties 

         9        flying at Byangabo, even from the road either towards 

        10        Ruhengeri or Gisenyi.

        11   Q.   What party flags did you see flying at Byangabo?

        12   A.   They were flags of the MRND, CDR, MDR and PSD all had 

        13        their flags flying.

        14   Q.   Now, do you know who mounted those flags of the various 

        15        political parties?

        16   A.   No, for the other political parties, I was not 

        17        interested, but I know the one who hoisted the flag of 

        18        the MRND.

        19   Q.   How many places in Byangabo was the MRND flag hoisted?

        20   A.   To my knowledge, that was a long time ago, but the flag 

        21        that I remember very well is the one in front of Isimbi 

        22        house.

        23   Q.   And do you know what party flag they were -- that was?

        24   A.   Which party?  I didn't quite understand you.

        25   Q.   Yes, the flag that was in front of Isimbi, which party 

        26        was that flag affiliated with?

        27   A.   It was the MRND flag.

        28   Q.   Do you know who planted that flag, if anyone?

        29   A.   Yes, I know them.

        30   Q.   How do you know those individuals without mentioning

         1        their names?  How do you know those people have planted 

         2        the flags?

         3   A.   I saw them raise the flag in the morning and bring it 

         4        down in the evening.

         5   Q.   Sir, as a -- what was your title in your job, without 

         6        telling us where that job was located, what was your 

         7        title in the job that you held between 1991 and 1994?

         8   A.   I was in charge of a ****.

         9   Q.   Now, Witness, between 1991 and 1994, were there any 

        10        meetings that were called of all students at primary 

        11        school level by Kajelijeli or by Nzirorera where they 

        12        were asked to join the Interahamwe, are you aware?

        13   A.   Such meetings never took place.

        14   Q.   If such meetings took place, would you have known about 

        15        it?

        16   A.   Yes, necessarily, because I was in charge **** 

        17        *** definitely I had to be informed.  Such a 

        18        meeting could not be called or ************** 

        19        **** could not be invited in such a meeting without 

        20        me knowing.

        21   Q.   Now, Witness, without telling us the secteur or cellule, 

        22        were you a member of the MRND?


        23   A.   I was an active member of the MRND.

        24   Q.   Without telling us the secteur or the commune or the 

        25        cellule, can you tell us what title you held at the 

        26        cellule level within the MRND?

        27   A.   I was in charge ****** that were affiliated to 

        28        the MRND at the *****.

        29   Q.   And what about at the cellule level?

        30   A.   Yes, necessarily, because that's where I was operating.

         1        It was at the cellule level and at the secteur level, 

         2        and, therefore, necessarily at the communal level.

         3   Q.   What was your title at the secteur level within the 

         4        MRND?

         5   A.   Let me start from the beginning.  As an officer in 

         6        charge ***********************, I was in 

         7        charge of *********************** 

         8        of the ********************, ****organs 

         9        of the MRND.

        10   Q.   At any time between 1991 and 1994, were you aware of 

        11        Juvénal Kajelijeli being in any leadership position 

        12        within the MRND?

        13   A.   No, Kajelijeli did not have any function within the 

        14        MRND.  He was the bourgmestre -- only bourgmestre up to 

        15        1993.

        16   Q.   Witness, as a -- in your role as a leader at the cellule 

        17        and secteur levels ******************* did you ever 

        18        become aware of list of Tutsi that were prepared or 

        19        distributed?

        20   A.   Never, ever did I hear that.  I have never heard that, 

        21        never heard about such a list.

        22   Q.   Now, were you aware whether Kajelijeli played any 

        23        leadership role in the MRND at the préfectural level?

        24   A.   Never, ever.  No role at all at the préfecture level.

        25   Q.   Witness, I would like to show you again in, 

        26        Prosecution Exhibit P 7, Picture 10, Picture No. 10.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can the witness be shown Photograph 10.

        28   THE WITNESS: Yes, I see Photograph 10.

        29   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        30   Q.   And, Witness, do you know what that photograph depicts?

         1   A.   Yes, Photograph No. 10 is the administrative building of 

         2        Mukingo commune.

         3   Q.   Witness, did you have occasion to travel pass and to 

         4        that building between 1991 and 1994?

         5   A.   Yes, it is *************, and where I 

         6        *********************8.  I know it very 

         7        well.

         8   Q.   How often, would you estimate, on a weekly basis would 

         9        you pass by that building?

        10   A.   One every other day, I would pass by that building 

        11          *********************.  

        12        So every other day, I would go there.

        13   Q.   Witness, do you know if there was any military training 

        14        of youth outside of the Mukingo office between 1991 and 

        15        1994?

        16   A.   Never.  There was never any training at the Mukingo 

        17        commune.  I never saw any training session.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: I may be at the end of my questioning, but I 

        19        just need to check with Mr. Kajelijeli.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness, as an active member of the MRND, could you tell 

        23        the Trial Chamber whether Kajelijeli after he was 

        24        removed as bourgmestre, did he play any role at any 

        25        level within the MRND in 1993 to 1994?

        26   A.   Yes, after he was removed from office, he did not 

        27        exercise any activity of influence in the MRND, because 

        28        I used to see him undertaking his private activities, 

        29        particularly farming.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions of the witness.
