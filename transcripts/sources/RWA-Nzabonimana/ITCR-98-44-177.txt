P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good noon, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you just commence the proceedings? 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, who is absent and Judge Kam, who is absent, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, the 7th of October 2005, for the telephone status conference in the matter of the Prosecution versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR 98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar.  

Madam Prosecutor, I see I have taken you by surprise in coming robed, but you are quite welcomed in MUFFY.  So, at this stage could we have your appearances, please, for the record? 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am today accompanied by  Mr. Iain Morley, Mr. Adama Niane, Tamara Commings-John and Mr. Cadilapika (phonetic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Is the Defence on line?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, can you you hear me?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I can hear you.  David Hooper, I am in London.  I -- (inaudible) I should add, for was André Rwamakuba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. O'Shea is not on line at this time?  Is Mr. O'Shea on line?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, he is not.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
He is not.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French booth promptly wishes to point out that the line is actually quite fuzzy, so do bear with us if sometimes we do have to ask for things to be repeated and that sort of thing. Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Has everybody heard that, Madam Prosecutor, Mr. Hooper?  

Well, I can start the proceedings.  Now, the most important item for the Chamber was to fix the commencement date for the Defence in the Rwamakuba trial.  The arrangements which are open to the Trial Chamber are such that we anticipate that we will only be able to sit in half-day sessions.  I am not sure as of yet whether we have the morning or the afternoon half of the day.  But we will be sitting until, I think, it is the 16th of December.  And we will have a courtroom and other facilities for half day during that period including Fridays, I think.  So that is what we are looking at.  

Now, in that context, as you know, we had wanted to start on the 31st of October.  I notice that there are sighs all around, but is there any suggestion as to what would be an appropriate time that would be at the convenience of both parties?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Would it be appropriate for me to start?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.
MR. HOOPER:
Since it is the Defence case; first of all, good morning to the Prosecutor -- or Prosecutors, I should say.  I don't know whether Ms. Fall received, because I copied it to her, a brief (inaudible) that I e-mailed to Mrs. Denis yesterday setting out our essential proposals.  And I hope, perhaps, it has also came to the notice of Your Honour.  But, basically --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can just confirm that your note has come to my notice, has come to my attention.  
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphone overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And Ms. Fall has indicated that she has seen it as well. 
MR. HOOPER: 
All right.  So our proposal is that we start on Monday, the 7th, which is a week later than the proposed date of Your Honour.  But it is just for the Defence, that extra week more in which to gather and harness witnesses.  And there are difficulties, I need not enumerate them; most of them are practical difficulties which I'm sure everyone would recognise if not have experienced already.  

But if we did start on Monday the 7th of November, it would give the Defence six weeks of half days, including the Friday.  And we feel that we can cut our cloth, as it were, we can fit in our place, we hope, within that period.  So, that is our proposal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
In fact, we are glad to hear that we will be sitting only half days.  We make a point of that in our note.  We feel even if full days were available to us it would be difficult for us to manage our case, manage the witnesses sitting full days.  So half days would actually probably assist us; and I hope can lead to a more directed and discreet use of the evidence.  So those are my initial suggestions in relation to a start date. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think we are in a situation where it is difficult for us not to accept Counsel Hooper's proposal to the extent that we ourselves always have felt that the date of the 31st of October was in the calendar.  And we were, therefore, expecting information from Mr. Hooper.  We do not object to -- we have no problem with the date of the 7th of November.  However, we feel -- I think that in accordance with the decision handed down, the information should be disclosed to us, at the latest, on the 10th which is next week; the 10th of October. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
By "information", you are referring to the statement of witnesses?  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, the identification. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Identification?  
MS. FALL: 
The identity of the witnesses. 
MR. HOOPER: 
If I can just speak over here, we feel that we can provide that information by Monday, certainly the details and summaries of what we anticipate witnesses that we will call will say -- or may call will say.  And we will also, in fact, as soon as we can, provide their statements.  We should be able to do that, again, by Monday.  The statements themselves, at the moment we can serve in theory by e-mail.  But I have been experiencing a technical difficult in that respect.  And as it may be that I will send a CD by DHL over the weekend.  But certainly, we will get the statements to the Prosecution in the near future, and over this weekend. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Well then, that is -- that deals with that issue because, in fact, we don't need to make an additional scheduling order, because that would be in compliance with an order that we have already made.  

One of the issues that has not been discussed up to now, except in a very peripheral sort of way, is the issue of statement of admitted facts and law.  Is it necessary for that to be filed in this case, and if so, what would be a reasonable delay with in which they should be filed?  Does either party have any position on that matter?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Are we talking about admitted facts of law submitted by Prosecution or admitted facts of law as sought to be admitted by the Defence, or is there a distinction?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I was actually looking at Rule 73ter.  It is not necessary for these matters to be filed, but during the trial you had made inquiries of the Prosecution to admit certain matters.  Now, if there was, in fact, going to be some communication between yourself and the Prosecutor on this matter, then a statement of what is admitted should be filed by you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So my question really was prompted by a recollection of those events. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  Well, thank you, Your Honour.  That is, I think, a timely reminder.  And I would have thought that given our current position, or perhaps our certain current position now that all of a sudden we should, I think, be able to provide the Prosecution with a request for admissions by the 19th, that is Wednesday, a week after the ten days, the working days.  Would that be acceptable or do you feel we should --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, well --  
MR. HOOPER: 
I say, by then; if we can do it sooner then we will do it sooner. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I have to liaise, and then he has to come back to me and to and fro from where he is and where I am.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER: 
It will take a little bit more time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, do you have a problem with that proposed time standard? 
MS. FALL: 
No, Mr. President, we have no particular problem, except that we would like the dates given to be complied with.  So when Counsel Hooper says that before the 19th, or thereabouts, he should nonetheless be able to give us a quite specific date, we could work on the -- we could work with. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, one of us has not understood Mr. Hooper properly.  I thought that he was going to provide a request to you by the 7th, for you to respond by the 19th.  That is what I thought. 
MR. HOOPER: 
No, no, I'm sorry.  That's a misunderstanding. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, I misunderstood. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  I was proposing that we, in fact, put in a request of admissions of facts and law by the 19th. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You put it in by the 19th. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, that gives us the 10 days. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fine.  And what would be an appropriate time for response?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, some of these areas have already been indicated in the course of the case.  And we would have thought by seven days after the 19th -- takes us to the 26th of October.  

I could add that where we feel that admissions may affect, for example, the conduct of the Defence case, calling witnesses, for example, that we will give an earlier, perhaps, informal indication of the area that we are seeking to be admitted.   
(Pages 1 to 6 by Donna M. Lewis)















1230H
MR. HOOPER (continuing):
So, for example -- I could give an example that everyone could appreciate in respect of our contention of Rwamakuba being in Belgium from mid-September to March -- mid-March or 23rd March of '94, that would be a matter that we would ask the Prosecution to admit.  And I can put the notice of that now, but they know about that, one of the areas we've invited them to admit.  And it's an area which would assist us, of course.  If they were in a position to admit it as soon as possible because I am presenting discussing travel arrangements with witnesses relating to that, as well as making further enquiries in respect of secondary issues relating to that.  Or maybe Prosecution will never be able to admit that as a matter, of course, for them, but the sooner, if they do admit it, the better for us.  So I can know that on the 19th, that would be one of the matters that will be in our request for admitted facts, but the Prosecution has notice of it and our prayer as and when (unintelligible) comes up like that (unintelligible) friendly to the Prosecution so that they are not really necessarily resting on a document that (unintelligible) on the 19th, if I can put it like that.  But you will have the formal document presented by the 19th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, Ms. Fall, would that time standard fit in with your concept of what's possible to be complied with?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, apparently, I could say that if within the time limit of seven days it is possible that we reply -- what happened last time around, though, with the Defence when we had to file the admission of evidence, we needed to negotiate with the Defence at a certain point in time.  I believe, however, that with respect to the documents that will be sent to us, I could say that the seven days would be sufficient for us to provide a reply or to send a reply.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, there is one other issue which I think is important.  Mr. Hooper, would you be in a position to file your list of witnesses -- the list of witnesses you intend to call with the 73 ter information?  I know you really accepted -- there already there is an order for you to submit their witness statements, but would you be in a position to file the lists of witnesses with their pseudonym, where necessary, and estimated length of the time required for each witness?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The 73 ter points.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yeah.  I have a list of witnesses with details and with summaries here which I can e-mail forth with.  It's -- it's more than probably -- it's a fact that some of these witnesses will, in fact, not be called.  But, it's really a question of gauging the response from certain witnesses and if they cover the point, then we dispose of others covering the same point.  So I can provide that list and I can provide, one way or the other, I have indicated either through e-mail or through a disclosure, the statements or such statements as we have relating to each of these witnesses.  I can send the witness list today.  I'll do that today.  I can do it now, in fact.  I will send it forthwith.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Well, those cover the points that I thought were necessary for trial preparation.  But, Madam Prosecutor, are there any other issues which you think need to be addressed at this time?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I don't know what is going to happen concerning the pre-trial conference.  It was said that it would be set for the 25th of October, and in respect of the changes that have been made, will a date be set for that pre-trial conference?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, the importance of that conference or that -- of the date, would depend on the extent to which you think we have already covered what is necessary for trial -- trial preparation.  If you think that what is necessary is already suitably covered, then the next session could be closer to the actual trial commencement date.  Mr. Hooper has suggested the Monday before, that's the 1st of November -- the 1st of November.  And if you think that the -- that we have already covered what is necessary for trial readiness, then that would be probably a suitable date for us to meet.  

So are there any other issues you think that are outside -- from my position, I think we have covered everything, but I don't know if there are any issues which are of concern to the Prosecutor.  
MS. FALL: 
For now, no, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I should ask you as well.  Are there any other issues which you think ought to be covered to prepare for the trial -- for the commencement of the Defence case?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, no, I can't think of any offhand.  If the 1st of November can perhaps be put down as a -- as the date for a status conference, that's necessary in the future.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes 
MR. HOOPER: 
And, perhaps, I can add that if there are any difficulties that arise between now and then that I foresee, that I will contact Ms. Denis and the Prosecution in respect of that.  And if it is something that  (unintelligible) travelling, then I can perhaps suggest we could perhaps repeat the exercise that we are doing now with a tele -- telephone conference.  But I don't foresee the need for that at the moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think let it goes without saying in these matters that both matters (sic) always have the liberty to apply to the court, if it is necessary.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it seems to me now that the date of the 1st November is appropriate and convenient to everyone, and closer to that date, the actual time will be communicated by Ms. Dennis or trial coordinator.  
Ms. Denis?  

Well, I think we can take the adjournment now.  What we will do just to -- for clarity, we will try and issue a scheduling order, which basically would encapsulate the arrangements discussed this morning.  Hopefully, we can get it out later today or, at the latest, on Monday morning.  
MR. HOOPER: 
All right, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Well, thank you all very much, and we can now close our session.
