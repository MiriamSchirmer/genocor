MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Karin Hökborg; and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 5th September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes, we -- Madam Witness, we had other commitments this morning, as I mentioned to you on Friday, and that is why we are only starting in the afternoon.  Your evidence will continue today, and you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you first began to give evidence last week.  Do you understand that?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, apparently the witness is not hearing the interpreter's voice from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar, could you.  

Yes, I can hear you.  Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  I can hear you well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I was explaining to you when you were not connected that we had other commitments this morning, and that's the reason why we are starting this afternoon, as I had explained to you on Friday.  Now we're going to resume with your testimony, and you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you started giving your evidence last week.  Do you understand me?
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Then the Prosecutor will continue with the examination now.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Mr. President, and good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
WITNESS RJ,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, when we separated last Friday, I was going to broach the last line of questioning of my examination in-chief.  But before doing that, I would like to go back to two small points and put two additional questions to you.  

During your examination in-chief, you told us that the name of André Rwamakuba, that is, who he was, you said you were informed by a Hutu lady who was at the maternity and whom you served as a patient minder for and somebody you met in the corridor.  The first question is as follows:  We are going, with the assistance of the registry, to provide you with a sheet of paper on which you're going to write down the name of the man who told you that the person was André Rwamakuba.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like that it be mentioned that the witness has mentioned a name of the person who told her that it was André Rwamakuba and that this should be entered and admitted as a Prosecution exhibit and put under seal under number -- Prosecution exhibit number 71, unless I'm mistaken.  

Seventy-one -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Confirms the Prosecutor.  
MS. FALL:
Seventy-one, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is admitted under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 71 admitted, under seal) 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'll put just one question to you on that subject.  Now, this person who told you that the person in question was André Rwamakuba, did he tell you under what circumstances he came to know him? 
A.	No, he didn't talk to me about that.  Rather, it is the woman in question who explains to me the circumstances under which she got to know the gentleman.  
MS. FALL:
I did not get a translation.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor is saying that apparently there is a technical problem, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I heard about it.  

Is there something we can do about it, Mr. Registrar?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the problem solved now?  Thank you. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Can I have the witness's answer, please?  Because I didn't get it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I think it will be more advisable -- it will be advisable to tell the witness to repeat her answer because we are not certain that we can give back the answer as she gave it.  

Now question by Prosecutor. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you repeat the answer that I put to you, that is, the person who told you the circumstances under -- who told you that it was André Rwamakuba, did he tell you the circumstances under which he got to know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	This person did not explain to me the circumstances under which he got to know the gentleman.  Rather, it is the woman I was attending to as a patient minder who explained to me the circumstances under which she got to know Mr. André Rwamakuba.  
Q.	Madam Witness, the second item on which I would like some clarification is, while you were at the préfecture, you told us that at a certain point after leaving the hospital around the 1st or mid-May you saw André Rwamakuba arrive.  I would like to ask you, did you formally recognise him? 
A.	I recognised him indeed.  However, I did not -- I indicated that I said it was in the month of May, around the 1st of May, but I cannot tell you the exact date.  But I recognised him.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Madam Witness, during your examination in-chief, when I put questions to you regarding the testimony that you gave in Rwanda, you told us that you have had to give testimony against certain persons, including Dr. Gatera and Dr. Twagirayezu; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Madam Witness, concerning -- or, in the Dr. Twagirayezu case, did you have the opportunity of mentioning André Rwamakuba's name? 
A.	I do not quite remember.  It is quite possible that I did not mention his name, given that he was not involved in that trial.  However, I cannot have proper recollection.  I don't have a clear memory of what I said.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether, in respect of the Dr. Gatera case in Rwanda, you had occasion to mention André Rwamakuba's name? 
A.	It has been a long time since that happened, and I do not have a recollection.  I can't remember.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think I have no further questions to put to the witness for now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Cross-examination, please.  

Madam Witness, under the rules that govern our proceedings here, you will now have to be questioned by the counsel who is representing the Accused, Rwamakuba.  Do you understand that?
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that you now have to answer these questions.  

Mr. Hooper.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	I want to say right at the outset, Madam Witness, that I know from what I've read and what I know of you that you suffered grievously in the genocide with the loss of your husband, child, and other relatives.  I acknowledge that.  

If I may, can I go to essentially your evidence on Friday to clarify the position as to how many times you saw André Rwamakuba -- or, as you put it, very fairly, the man who was identified to you as André Rwamakuba?  And as I understand it, you saw that man, first of all, when you were in the sheeting, the tents.  Is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not what I said.  I think I said this three or four -- I saw him three or four times:  First, in the paediatrics unit, the other tents; secondly, in the maternity service; thirdly, in the surgery unit; and, lastly, at the préfecture office.  
Q.	Yes.  I was confining my questions to the -- to the hospital.  So thank you for that running -- running us through that again. 

And you ran through it, as I understand it, in the correct sequence that those events occurred; is that right? 
A.	Yes, if I remember correctly, that is the chronological order.  That is the right sequence of the times when I saw him.  
Q.	So let me just clarify one matter which puzzles me, and that is the incident that you referred to where your child was beaten by Dr. Gatera.  As I understand it, that occurred in maternity; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when did that occur?  Did that occur on the -- the second sighting of Rwamakuba?  

Well, let me ask you this:  Was Rwamakuba there when that happened, when your child was hit?  Was he there or thereabouts when that happened? 
A.	He was also present.  He was with the Gatera that we're talking about. 
Q.	And, again, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but would it follow that this was on the second occasion that you set eyes on Rwamakuba?  First of all, the tents, and then in maternity, and this is part of the -- the incident in the maternity; is that right or wrong? 
A.	I really do not remember very well.  
Q.	Well, this is what puzzles me, you see.  You see him once when you're at the paediatrics, in the sheeting.  You see him again in maternity.  You see him in surgery when you're in the corridor.  When's this incident when your child is beaten?  Where does it fit into the events? 
A.	I do not remember very clearly, but when my child was beaten by Dr. Gatera, Rwamakuba was present.  But I cannot say whether this happened on the first, second, or third occasion when I saw him.  
Q.	So it could have happened in the tents.  It could have happened in maternity.  It couldn't have happened in surgery because that's not an incident like that.

Now, I know and appreciate that when your family were attacked and moved to the church, where you were attacked over several days, where you lost a child, and where your husband was killed, and then you had to walk and get to Karama, and there, as I understand it, your wound turned a bit bad, which required you to go to hospital -- is that right, that your wound turned septic and you had to go to hospital?  Was that the situation? 
A.	I didn't talk about my wound, which was becoming infected.  I said that all wounded persons were taken by the priests, whom I mentioned, and that, as much as was possible, all wounded persons were transferred to the university hospital.  
Q.	But -- but your wound was, as you said, becoming infected, and that has a debilitating effect on people, obviously.  Would it be fair to say that, given the awful experiences you had to suffer and your own wound, your mental exhaustion, that your stay in the hospital is by no means clear?  Would it be fair to say that? 
A.	I have always explained the events that I went through.  I have tried as much as possible to explain all the events that I witnessed.  I do not know why you're going back and even trying to propose -- or, to put to me something that I cannot accept.  I do remember the events that I witnessed, after all. 
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  Did you say you have a good memory of these events, or is it a poor memory?  
A.	Even if it is a long time ago, no one can easily forget these problems -- or, these events.  If I may say so, these events were calculated to be detrimental to my welfare. 
Q.	Of course.  But how good a memory of them do you really have? 
A.	I have talked of those events that I can remember. 
Q.	I mean, having your child attacked with a club by a doctor is not something that you easily forget, and you don't forget it, but when did it happen?  
A.	I remember neither the month nor the day.  
Q.	Let me move on.  I will probably return to that, but the identification of the man as being Rwamakuba was an identification that was first done by the Hutu lady.  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the same man was confirmed as being Rwamakuba by the man whose name you just wrote on a piece of paper; is that correct too? 
A.	Yes, it is.  Yes, he also told me about it. 
Q.	And your evidence is they both identified the same man as André -- well, as André Rwamakuba and that that man you then saw later at the préfecture; is that right too? 
A.	Yes, yes, I witnessed that.  
Q.	And so the accuracy of your identification by the name of André Rwamakuba, you would agree, is entirely dependent on the accuracy of what those people told you, the Hutu woman and the man who wrote -- whose name you wrote down on the piece of paper.  Your -- your naming of the man depends on -- on those two people and their accuracy; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  The first person who told me is this lady who -- who was in the maternity.  And afterwards -- after the events that occurred in the surgery ward, this man indicated that the author of these acts was André Rwamakuba, and this confirmed what I had learned from the lady who was at the maternity.  
Q.	Indeed.  Now, I want you to look, please, at a photograph -- or, a copy of a photograph, which we've all seen -- 
MR. HOOPER:
And it can go to the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you recognise that man? 
A.	It's a long time ago, 10 or 11 years.  

As I did not know this person, and in view of the circumstances, I didn't take a close look at him.  It is difficult for me to remember his features.  It is entirely possible that it is he and possible that it is not he.  But I am not able to recognise him, as such, for the reasons that I have just given. 

I think that, as I witnessed what he did and as he was identified by the people who knew him, I think that should be enough.  I consider that, even if I am not able to recognise him, you may not discount the fact that I was a witness to what he did and that the people who knew him identified him at the time. 
Q.	And amongst your reasons -- or, the principal reason why you give for not recognising him is the lapse of time -- or, let me rephrase that.  The reasons you give for not being able to recognise that photograph as being him or not is the lapse of time, obviously, and also, as you've just said, I -- that you didn't take, quote, "a close look at him," unquote, at the time.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I saw him commit these reprehensible acts at the maternity.  And when he got patients out of the surgery ward, when I met someone, I asked him who that was, and the person told me that this was André Rwamakuba.  But I didn't turn back to go and take a closer look at him.  I saw this man act as I have described, and I cannot remember his face or any other of his features, for that matter.  
Q.	Well, that's not right, is it, because on Friday, for example, you were able to tell us that this man had a big nose and that this man was, quote, "quite corpulent, but not fat," unquote.  So those are two features of him that you do remember and you have told us about.  Can I ask you this:  Can you remember if that man was wearing glasses? 
A.	I did not see him wearing glasses.  If I remember correctly, I didn't see him wear -- wearing glasses at that time. 
Q.	You've described his dress, his clothing.  Can you confirm that you never saw him wearing anything like a yellow -- a yellow track suit?  Is that right? 
A.	I saw him wearing boots at the time I was standing with someone else.  Afterwards, on subsequent occasions, I shall tell you most sincerely that I didn't pay attention to what he was wearing.  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  

Can I show you another photograph?  Again, it's one that's been sealed.  
A.	I do not need to look at this photograph.  I have clearly stated that, in view of the time that has passed, I cannot recognise this man.  
Q.	Well, just -- well, you don't -- 
A.	It's a long time ago. 
Q.	You don't know, do you, till you've looked at the photographs?  So can you please assist me and -- can you please assist me and the judges by looking at that photograph -- it won't take you more than a moment -- and tell me, having looked at it, whether you recognise the person in the photograph.  Can you do that, please.

It will take but a second.  Look at the photograph and tell us either yes or no.  The photograph lies there in front of you.  Just cast your eyes on it and just help me whether you recognise that person in the photograph.  If it's yes, then tell us.  And if it's no, it's 11 years ago.  I understand.  Can you please do what I ask -- or, request.  Thank you.  
A.	I apologise to the Trial Chamber, Mr. President.  This is someone I saw when he was committing horrible acts.  After 11 years, I cannot recognise this person because I did not have the opportunity to approach this man calmly so that I could recognise his face.  I cannot recognise this man.  This is what I have already said.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You haven't looked at the photograph.  Would you please look at the photograph before you make -- before you answer the question.  You can't answer the question without looking at the photograph.  So please look at the photograph and tell the judges whether you recognise that person or not.  And I -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  Headphones, please.  Headphones.  Sorry.  
MS. FALL:
Could the witness be helped to remove her headphones.  

Mr. President, as I was saying, but I do not know whether this -- as I was saying, I do not know whether this harassment of the witness is really necessary.  A first picture has been shown her.  She says she doesn't recognise it.  A second photograph has been shown to her.  She has apologised and said that she cannot judge because it's been a long time.  She has apologised to the Trial Chamber.  She doesn't feel that it is necessary.  I do not understand why Mr. Hooper is insisting, as the witness has said clearly that it is no use showing her the photographs in the sense that she has -- she has stated clearly that she saw him under difficult circumstances.  She couldn't approach him, and she couldn't recognise her -- his photograph at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it's fair to categorize this as harassment.  The witness has said that she's not going to look at the photograph, so we don't know -- she doesn't know who the person is.  She doesn't know if it's somebody she does know or it's somebody she doesn't know.  It could be any photograph.  So she could look at the photograph, and after she looks at the photograph, she can say whether she knows the person or not.  I don't think that is a difficult thing for her to do.  Is it -- one is acting under the assumption that it is a particular photograph, but I do not know what photograph has been shown to her, and she doesn't know what has been shown to her.  So she should at least look at it and say whether she recognizes the person or not.  

Madam Witness, do you think you can do that?  

Yes.  

I'm sorry, Madam Witness, but can you hear me now?  

Yeah, the -- the Prosecutor was making a legal argument on your behalf, but I think that it is not really a difficult thing for you to do, to actually look at the photograph.  You don't know yet whose photograph it is, but you should look at it.  If you recognise the person, you say, "I recognise the person."  If you don't recognise the person, you say, "I don't recognise the person."  

It's very simple.  But I think you should look at the photograph and indicate whether or not you recognise the person in it.  
MR. HOOPER:
So I see the witness looking at the photograph. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And do you recognise the person? 
A.	I do not know the person on the photograph.  
Q.	Well, let me tell you who it is.  That is Father Ngomirakiza, who tried to rescue you, who protected you in the church at Kibuye, who took you to the hospital, and who was himself later murdered by Interahamwe.  Is that right?  Looking at the photograph again, do you recognise him? 
A.	I realise that this is not the person that you're trying to describe.  
Q.	Well, I can assure you it is.  
A.	I went to Karama for the first time, then I found him on the spot.  He tried to transport various wounded persons in his car.  And as far as I'm concerned, I am not in a position to recognise this well.  When I look at the picture, I am unable to recognise this person.  And the truth be told, he tried to help us, but, unfortunately, I cannot recognise him on this photograph.  
Q.	Now, can we come, then, in sequence to the opportunities you had to see the man that you say, from what other people -- two other people have told you, was André Rwamakuba?  And you told us how you arrived at the hospital on the 21st, and at some time there came a group of people, a large group of people, indeed, who, on your account, all -- all were there to inspect identity cards.  Can you remember how long you'd been in the tents before that happened?  
A.	Sincerely speaking, I cannot remember.  When I was at the location, I used to see the night come after the days, et cetera.  So it was difficult for me to know what date it was or what day it was.  So I have no recollection.  
Q.	I'll remind you that people you say who came to see you were Dr. Gatera; Dr. André Rwamakuba; Colonel Muvunyi; Juliette, the sister of Gatera; Dr. Twagirayezu, who you added later -- 

Can I ask you this:  Was Dr. Kageruka there as well?  
A.	You should bear in mind the fact that I said there were other doctors, but I could only name a few of them.  There were doctors and other nurses.  There was also Munyemana, Sosthène.  There were many doctors.  I gave the names of only a few of them, but there were others.  
Q.	Was Kageruka amongst them? 
A.	He also must have been present.  All the doctors at camp had to look at those refugees that had come to that location.  
Q.	Was Dr. Mbarutso among them? 
A.	No, he was not part of that group.  Dr. Mbarutso died, and he had accused those other doctors.  
Q.	And as I understand it, all these doctors' names, Muvunyi's name -- sorry.  All these doctors' names and Muvunyi's name were told you later by the Hutu woman in maternity; is that correct? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Said Prosecutor.  
THE WITNESS:  
I have never made the statements that you are attributing to me. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like a clarification because Counsel Hooper has just said that, amongst the doctors that were presenting, there was a Dr. Muvunyi.  And I think -- I wonder if the witness at any moment said Muvunyi was a doctor.  And I would like that this error be corrected, and it -- because I realised that this error in the French transcripts.  And Dr. Hooper -- and Mr. Hooper here has just talked about Dr. Muvunyi as being one of the doctors.  But I'd like to know if the witness at any time said Muvunyi was one of the doctors that were present. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Now, I've never suggested that she did, Mr. President.  That's either a mistranslation or mishearing.  Muvunyi I've referred to as Colonel Muvunyi.  He's clearly not a doctor.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The question I asked, Madam Witness, was:  Is it right that it was the Hutu woman in maternity who named all these people for you, yes or no? 
A.	Those people found us at the maternity, and it is the lady in question who informed me about those persons.  
Q.	But as to the people in the tent who were refugees, like yourself, even though they came from the same place as you, you can't remember the name of one of them, can you?  You told us that last week.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Those persons are taken refuge at Kibeho.  We left Kigamba together, but I don't remember their names.  

Do you want to tell me that I'm lying?  Do you want to say that I am lying and that there were no people in front of the paediatric unit?  Well, there is a priest who is a survivor and who was accompanied by Ngomirakiza, and he can be called to come and testify.  He would be in a position to tell you that there were many refugees at the university hospital.  It would appear to me that you are minimizing the genocide that took place at the hospital.  
Q.	And what was that priest's name, please? 
A.	I cannot remember his name, but he was accompanied by Ngomirakiza.  They were at Karama, and they brought us.  One of the priests was tending to the wound -- the wounded persons, and the other took us to the hospital.  I don't know -- remember the name of that priest, but I know that he works at Save.  I saw him recently when I met him on the road, and I didn't know that he had survived.  I told him that I saw him at Karama, and he told me where he is today.  
Q.	I'm sorry.  I understood you to say that that priest was at the hospital.  I'm not talking here about Father Ngomirakiza.  I know he took you to the hospital.  Did I misunderstand you, or was that priest, in fact, at the hospital?  If he was, I'm interested to know who he is.  Was he at the hospital with you? 
A.	He also brought refugees to the hospital, to the university hospital.  Or, when the refugees were taken to the hospital, that priest was aware of it.  
Q.	And he's presently where?  In which parish?  Save, did you say?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  

Would it be fair to say that you not only are Tutsi, but, with respect, you look Tutsi and wouldn't be mistaken for anything other than a Tutsi, would you? 
A.	I did not quite understand the question that you wanted -- or, that you put to me. 
Q.	Would you say that you look Tutsi?  A Rwandese looking at you would say, "I bet she's a Tutsi."  
A.	And what are the physical features of a Tutsi?  How does a Tutsi look like?  What does a Tutsi look like? 
Q.	Well, you're -- you're tall and elegant.  What other features might there be?  
A.	I am Rwandan.  I am not Tutsi. 
Q.	Well, that's become a bit of a stock answer here.  But other witnesses have said, "Well, yes, you can tell."  The last witness told us.  He seemed to have no difficulty in telling.  And, in all frankness, that's right, isn't it?  As you sat there in the hospital, anyone looking at you would have thought, "I bet she's a Tutsi," and that must have been a horror for you.  Am I right? 
A.	But I've told you that I'm Rwandan.  

During that period of April, there were people who had identity cards in which it was indicated that they were Tutsis.  But, now, this is an invention of people.  Normally, we were all Rwandans.  And at the time people split because of the indication of their ethnicity in their identity card.  But as far as I'm concerned, I am telling you that I am Rwandan.  
Q.	So you weren't anxious in the hospital there with your surviving child to think that someone might think you were a Tutsi and pick on you for that?  That's not something that troubled you there; is that what you're saying? 
A.	I was anxious, actually, while I was at the hospital.  I spent some -- a few days without any problem, but subsequently I felt threatened when I looked at the patient that I mentioned earlier. 
Q.	Now, from what I understand of your evidence, all these doctors and Colonel Muvunyi and soldiers all seemed to crowd into this tent, looking at identity -- or, looking at people's identities, an ethnic identity.  And in your case, you had thrown your ID card away.  But having no card, you told us on Friday, was, quote, "synonymous with being a Tutsi," unquote.  So what happened to you when this body of doctors and soldiers came and spoke to you?  Were you taken away or were you left there?  

And I understand, of course, that you were left there.  So how did you escape not being taken away? 
A.	They did not take me away.  They merely asked me to produce my identity card, but I gave the answer to the effect that I didn't have it.  And they continued -- they continued asking people to produce their identity cards.  People who had been seriously wounded were taken away.  And since I could move about, I was able to move away.  And any person who was capable of moving about did the same.  In fact, not all people -- people do not all die at the same time, and I would say it's thanks to God that I survived this situation.  
Q.	Well, that certainly may be true.  

Now, it's right to say, also, that you saw nobody killed or die at the hospital at any time that you were there; is that right? 
A.	I saw people being abducted or taken away, and they were taken away to be killed.  I was also seeing people that were being struck.  Probably there are some of them who died while I was inside the house.  I wasn't always outside.  Probably people were hit and they died outside the hospital.  I did not always show myself around because I was scared that I might be found out.  But one thing is certain:  People died at the hospital. 
Q.	In December 2003, you gave evidence in this case on a previous occasion, and at page 87 of the transcript, you gave -- when you were asked about whether you'd seen any killings, you said, "The people were taken away and thrown into mass graves around the hospital.  Personally, I didn't see anyone die at the hospital."  

And that's correct, isn't it?  That's the simple answer.  
A.	But I said so.  I did say that I did not witness death with my own eyes or the death of any person whatsoever, but I was seeing people that were being hit or struck.  But, personally, I did not see any corpse.  What I saw were people who were being abducted.  I did not see any corpse at the hospital.  And this is because I was always inside the rooms.  I only went out to go and look for porridge or food for that lady.  

In any case, the hospital is very big, so I couldn't be all over the place or wherever people were being killed. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, let me ask you about the first statement you made in this case, and that was a statement made, I remind you, and I'm sure you'll accept from me, on the 11th of September 1997.  You were seen by two investigators and an interpreter from the ICTR here, and you provided a fairly lengthy statement, detailing your recollection of events.  Now, first of all, 1997 is now eight years ago, a long time ago.  But do you remember that you made such a statement, and have you had the opportunity recently of going through it with Ms. Fall, for example, in your preparation for this trial? 
A.	I don't remember.  We did not discuss the statement.  
Q.	Very well.  Now, if you want to see it at any time or your signature's on it or all your confirmation of the truth of it or your confirmation that it had been read to you and that you'd understood it, if you want to see any of that, then you just ask, and we can provide it for you.  But in the meantime, I just want to read what you say in that statement about your experience at the tents.  And then, having done that and read it through and reminded you what you said, I may come back and ask you some questions.  

So let me just read what it says here.  And this is at TM4 in the Prosecution bundle.  It's the first page of actual testament, and you start off by telling us how you left the parish and -- and went to take refuge at the university hospital.  And I'll just read from this part, quote -- so I'm reading from -- these are your words in your statement dealing with the tents:  "Since I was wounded by a spear, which was thrown at my leg, I was taken to a tent built by the Red Cross.  I stayed there for three days.  While I was in the tent, I saw Dr. Gatera of Butare University Hospital along with a woman, apparently his sister, selecting wounded and sick Tutsis from my home area and loading them into a vehicle.  They were accompanied by persons dressed in banana leaves and wearing hats with MDR inscriptions, armed with clubs and small hoes.  I didn't see these men again because they were killed.  The Red Cross doctors protested against their disappearance.  
"After spending three days in the tent, I found refuge in the hospital maternity ward with a Hutu lady waiting to deliver a baby, who took me as her bedside help.  At the maternity I saw a man several times wearing black boots, which were reaching his knees.  Upon enquiry, I found out his name was André Rwamakuba," unquote.  

Now, that's a statement you gave as your statement against André Rwamakuba.  Now, the first thing to notice is that the statement was made only three years after the events to which they relate, not eleven years, as we are now.  And the second thing is -- and I'm sure you've seen it and know it, is that there's no reference to seeing André Rwamakuba or, indeed, any of these other doctors or soldiers or Colonel Muvunyi.  You refer only to Gatera and his sister.  Now, why is that?  Why is this such a different account? 
A.	I am going to give you an explanation.  I came before the Trial Chamber.  I left my home.  I left my children without giving them -- putting them under anybody's guard, and I could have done this to explain the events that I witnessed with my eyes.  I have been interviewed by many people.  There are some who came and probably poorly wrote down my statements.  And I've decided to explain everything before the Trial Chamber.  

I have -- I saw Rwamakuba in the maternity.  You claim that I did not see him in front of the paediatrics unit.  I saw him there.  Probably the interpreter did not translate what I said correctly because we gave lots of details, and sometimes people didn't quite understand.  Or, not everything was written down or well understood.  

Now, if I have left Rwanda to come here, it is in order to explain everything that happened, and this is what I'm doing.  What interest would I have to leave my children behind and alone in Rwanda?  I think I have come here in order to explain everything, and I think that's just what I've done.  
Q.	Well, that doesn't quite answer the question.  Well, it does perhaps in part because you're saying it was the fault of the investigators, perhaps.  

But may I ask you this:  You also refer that -- to seeing the people being put on the vehicle to be taken away.  But that's not your evidence here, is it?  You told us how you would -- had to go and you had no idea what had happened to them.  You thought they had been taken to other wards.  It was only the next day when you made enquiries that they had been taken away to be killed because they were Tutsis.  So why is your story so different?  If you're telling one story that's a settled account in your mind, why is it so different?  
A.	People were taken away on board a vehicle.  They were taken, seized from the beds.  In any case, the cleaners could carry people on stretchers.  I am telling you -- I must say that you're telling me what you have read.  I am telling you what I saw.  People were taken away and killed.  This is common knowledge.  It happened.  Everybody knows this.  
Q.	But what other people may know mustn't become your evidence of what you saw or heard unless you did see or hear it.  You do understand that, don't you? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I am telling you what I saw.  I am prepared to answer your questions.  When the Prosecutor put questions to me, I answered, and I am ready to do the same for you.  
Q.	Now, further confusion arises if I look at your testimony, the transcript of your evidence of the 8th of December 2003, page 49.  And several times here you're -- you're asked this.  You're asked, "Had you seen him before," and you say, "Three or four times all together."  

And then you're asked details, and you give this answer, page 49 at line 11.  "When I saw him --" 

Just please listen.  You'll -- you'll hear what I'm going to -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	"When I saw him for the first time, I saw him alight from a vehicle."  

And you're then asked, "Can you describe the vehicle?"  And you say, and this is your evidence in-chief, "It was a car.  I do not remember the car.  I didn't pay attention to that.  On subsequent occasions, I didn't see how he arrived.  The only time I saw him alight from the vehicle was the first and the last time."  

But there's no question here of you seeing, on your evidence today, André Rwamakuba arriving the first time you saw him in a vehicle.  That's right, isn't it, he appears when you're inside the tent?
A.	You're putting words in your -- my mouth that I never spoke.  I never said that the first time that I saw him he came on board a vehicle.  I clearly said that on one day I saw him on board a vehicle that was coming from the direction of the kitchens and that actually this vehicle was coming from the tarred road and that it parked near the maternity and that he got out of the vehicle and he went towards the surgery unit.  So I never said that it was the first time that I was seeing him.  I did say, clearly, that I saw him three or four times, and I think that this was taken down.
Q.	Well, I've just read your very clear answer.  And I can read you another one, if you want, the same lines.  But the question here is this -- it may be -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Earphones, please.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I shall not belabour the point because I do not wish there to be an argument between what Mr. Hooper is actually saying and what is in the transcripts.  I would just like to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber that all the transcripts are at your disposal.  And if the transcripts as -- are read, it -- they will show clearly what the witness did, in fact, say.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I suggest, Madam Witness, that what those transcripts will show, for anyone reading them, is that you'll say one thing at one moment and then a page or two later something quite contrary and different.  And I'm -- I asked you at the beginning of my questions how clear a memory do you have of these events.  How settled in your mind's eye are these events?  Or is it all mixed up in your mind? 
A.	There is no confusion in my mind at all.  I'm not mentally deficient, and you can conduct investigations if you so wish.  I am healthy.  I've never suffer -- been traumatized in -- suffered any trauma in my life.  I have never been to a psychiatric hospital.  When I talk of events that occurred in the hospital, I am narrating the facts as I experienced them and as I was an eyewitness to.  So I have no reason to come travel to Arusha with a little baby and leave the rest of my children in Rwanda to come and tell lies to the Trial Chamber.  
Q.	You see, that statement you made, referring to Gatera and his sister and seeing Rwamakuba later in maternity, that statement you made was taken from you on the 11th of September, but it wasn't signed -- read back to you and confirmed by you until a week later.  That's on the document.  We can see that.  You see, you had every opportunity to correct that if they'd got it wrong.  And, not only that, but then later in 2003, in October, that statement was shown and read to you again in what is known as a confirmation process, and you confirmed it as correct, and you made no additions to it.  So you see, why is that? 
A.	In regard to my statement on Gatera and his sister, I don't think you should be dwelling on Gatera's business.  His trial is over.  Her sister -- his sister is in Kayibanda.  I do not know what your interest in the matter is.  I do not know whether you're counsel for Mr. Gatera.  And if you are his counsel, then if you'd go to Rwanda and defend his cause there.  
Q.	Well, that man's dead, isn't he?  On such evidence as yours, he was put in prison.  

Can I come to another statement you made, 22nd of April 1999?  Now, the last statement I read to you wasn't anything to do with Gatera, in fact, was to do with Rwamakuba.  

And just before I move from that statement, is it right that, when the investigators came to talk to you, you were already aware of André Rwamakuba?  He was being discussed in the hospital; is that right? 
A.	Counsel, I don't understand your question.  
Q.	Well, let me put it like this:  When those investigators came to see you back in September '97, is it right that at that time you -- you had an idea of what they were coming to talk to you about?  They were going to come to talk to you about an André Rwamakuba?  And by then you'd heard speak of that man and -- and you -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	There's been mention on the radio, for example, and people were talking about him.  This is all before you -- you put a pen to paper to make that statement against him.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I answered the investigators' questions based on what they put to me by way of questions.  I know that they took down my answers.  I do not know whether they did take down all of my answers, but I know for sure that they took down what I was saying in writing.  
Q.	Yes, now I'm asking you:  Did you know at that time when you went to be interviewed that they were going to talk about André Rwamakuba?  Did you -- did you know that? 
A.	When they put questions to me about Rwamakuba, I gave them information about Rwamakuba.  Well, when they gave me -- asked for information about other people, then I gave them information about these other people.  
Q.	But not the question I'm asking.  Let me ask you this:  Had you heard about André Rwamakuba by then on the radio?  In 1997 was he being talked about on the radio? 
A.	I really don't understand the thrust of your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, let me cut it short by telling you what you said on December -- on December the 8th, 2003, at 
	page 61 of the transcript.  You were asked if you knew that the interview was going to concern a man called Rwamakuba, and you said, "Answer:  I knew that.  They came.  They spoke to me about him, mentioning his name." 

Then you were asked if you heard his name on the radio at that time in 1997, and your answer, again, page 61, was this:  "People talked about André.  Well, André Rwamakuba was being talked about over the radio.  It was said that he was minister of primary and secondary education."  
A.	Yes.  That is what I said.  I do not always remember the details that I give about this matter, but I remember saying that.  
Q.	And if we look at your first statement of September 1997, nowhere in it do you refer to André Rwamakuba as Dr. André Rwamakuba.  Nowhere is he referred to as a doctor, and nowhere do you say he was a minister.  And throughout -- almost completely throughout, you use the word "André."  "André."  Why such a familiar name, "André"?  Why use it in describing or talking about that man?  
A.	Frankly, I really don't know how to answer this.  Sometimes I used his family name, sometimes his first name.  So I really don't know how I can answer you on that.  
Q.	Why didn't you call him "Doctor"?  
A.	I did not know that he was a doctor.  I never saw him in his doctor's coat.  Perhaps on other occasions he may have worn a doctor's coat, but when I saw him, he wasn't wearing a doctor's coat. 
Q.	I thought you told him -- told us he was -- they were the doctors, and among the doctors were, and you named them, Gatera, Rwamakuba, Twagirayezu, Sosthène.  
A.	Yes, there were other people with him.  
Q.	The first time you ever mentioned André or André Rwamakuba being a minister was in your evidence in December 2003.  That was the first time you ever said it.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I did not know that he was a minister.  I only learned of this afterwards.  When you conducted your investigations, did you find anything to the contrary?

1545H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I am not allowed to answer that, I am afraid.  But let's come to your second statement.   I've said I was going to mention it.  It's dated the 22nd of April 1999, and it's a long statement, and you relate in it the terrible experiences you experienced and I wholly accept, and how you went to the hospital on the 21st of April.  Then it reads, and I will read this, "I left Runyinya church for the hospital on the 21st of April 1994.  When I was at the hospital, attackers also came.  When they came, Dr. Gatera was separating Tutsi patients from the others.  The Tutsi patients went to stay outside in plastic sheeting shelters, while the Tutsi refugees were told to sit outside.  The Hutu patients remained inside the hospital.  The attackers comprised soldiers led by Colonel Muvunyi.  In this group of attackers, there were also civilians with wooden sticks.  I attempted to hide in the basement at the maternity ward."  

	So, there is your motive for going to the maternity ward, because of the attack by soldiers and civilians with wooden sticks led by Muvunyi.  So when did that happen? 
A.	I would like to give you an answer, although I know that I've already given you an answer to this question before.  I told you that several people came to put questions to us about it, and sometimes when we speak in Kinyarwanda, our message is not taken down exactly as we have given it.  That is why I have come from afar to this Trial Chamber to narrate events as I witnessed and as I experienced them.  I am telling you that I really do not trust the people who took down my words enough to say that they took them down accurately.  That is why we come before this Trial Chamber and take the oath to tell the truth.  That is why we come here to tell the truth, and that is why we take an oath. 
Q.	Very well.  It's right to say that obviously, as a statement that concerned Muvunyi, and you also go into considerable detail, if I may say so, in respect of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko and her son Shalom.  Now, those three people are all on trial, at the moment, in fact.  The last two, of course, part of the Butare case, as is known here, and Muvunyi on his own in a separate trial.  Am I right in saying that you were at one time to be a witness in both those cases, but, in fact, after you gave evidence in 2003 in this case, you are no longer a witness that the Prosecution is going to call?  That's right, isn't it?  You've never given evidence, in fact, as a result, in respect of either one of Muvunyi or the Butare case.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it is true that I was on the list of witnesses for the Butare trial, but I never gave testimony in the Butare trial.  When I came to give testimony in this trial, I don't know what happened, I returned to Rwanda without giving testimony.  I was told that I would return to give testimony in the Butare trial, but I was never called to give testimony in the trial. 
Q.	Well, I've dealt with the tents and some other factors that I wanted to ask you about.  I'm now going to move on to deal first with events in maternity, and I hope not to take up too much time with you on that, and then the surgery incident and then some general matters.  I can move on to the maternity matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT.  
	Is there a possibility (inaudible) this afternoon?  
MR. HOOPER: 
	I've given up projections, but I hope -- I would like to, and I'm sure the witness would like to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	We will take a short break now. 
	(Court recessed from 1555H to 1620H)
MR. PRESIDENT.  
	We will resume now.
	
	Can you hear me, Madam Witness?  
THE WITNESS:  
	Yes, we may proceed, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Let's move now to the maternity ward, where you told us that you saw Rwamakuba once, and the first time that -- or the time that happened, you described in this way essentially, that, "Gatera, 
	André Rwamakuba, and others came to the maternity ward.  When the group came," you said, "they asked for the patients to show identification."  And then you went on to say that Gatera hit your child.  Did all that happen on the one occasion? 
A.	I did not say that Gatera tried to strike my child.  He actually struck my child while I was at the maternity. 
Q.	Was this all on the same occasion when you said, "I was in maternity and Gatera, André Rwamakuba, and others came, asked for identification.  Gatera struck my child."  Is this all at the same -- on the one occasion or not? 
A.	Yes, all those events took place on the same occasion. 
Q.	All right.  Now, the Hutu lady and her identification to you.  Now, you told us just a short while ago, this afternoon, two things:  You told us that you didn't know at the time André Rwamakuba was a doctor.  You didn't know until later, and you didn't know that he was a government minister.  You didn't know that until later.  You found out afterwards.  Is that right? 
A.	No, that is not true.  That lady is the one who gave me the information.  This lady, actually, she is a teacher and she is the one who told me that Rwamakuba was a minister. 
Q.	I misunderstood, then, your answer about half an hour ago.  There is nothing in your statement about that.  Do you agree? 
A.	I am referring to the testimony before this Tribunal.  I said I want to come before this Tribunal.  It is to give fuller information.  When you called me to appear, to give evidence to the Tribunal, it is because you are aware that the written statements are not adequate, and that is why we come to the Tribunal to say all that we know, since we ourselves think that our statements are not all written down in total as they should have been. 
Q.	What was the name of this Hutu woman? 
A.	Now, listen, I do not know her name, to be honest. 
Q.	But you were her helper?  You were with her, depending on what view we take of your evidence, from about the 24th of May, April, sorry, until the 1st of May.  That would be a week, or two weeks, if we accept your extended evidence of being there till mid-May.  Two weeks with this woman, and you don't know her name?  Did she exist? 
A.	I gave the days of early May.  That was when I left the hospital.  I was with her, I must admit, but I never asked what her name was. 
Q.	But you were her designated helper.  It must have been on a sheet of paper that you were given to go and get the porridge.  So why don't you know her name? 
A.	Even if she had medical document, I didn't look at it.  All that was important to me was that she had requested for me to be given authorisation, and what I did for her was to look for food for her.  I had to prepare some porridge for her. 
Q.	No, that's not all.  You were there by her bed day and night in that maternity ward.  You've told us that you only went out to get porridge.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Frankly speaking, I do not know her name.  I never asked what her name was.  The only thing she told me was that she was from Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Was this her first child? 
A.	When I left the hospital, she hadn't given birth yet.  She had a problem.  She was a -- she ran the risk of aborting the baby.  But when I left the hospital, she hadn't given birth.  
Q.	Have you made, or anyone on your behalf made, any attempt to trace this woman through the hospital archives, where records are kept of those in maternity? 
A.	I had no interest in knowing her name.  I did not carry any research to the effect of knowing her name.  Probably, you, yourself, who is interested in knowing her name, can carry out investigation in order to find out what her name was. 
Q.	So let's come to the surgery ward and the events you saw there, and you related those to us, and how you saw Rwamakuba as you returned with the porridge with other doctors, pulling out the drips, telling patients to get out, and they were taken to the corridor, in particular, the man in a plaster cast from **********, whom you knew.  What was the name of that man? 
A.	Let me explain.  All these events took place in the surgery ward.  It is not in the operating theatre itself, but in the surgery ward.  I cannot remember the man's name also, but his child was called -- a carer was looking after the sick.  This child survived, and his name is **********.  It is not his own child, but it was a relation of his.  This child, as I said, survived.  If you want further information about this matter, you might ask ********** about it. 
Q.	Is that a man called ***********? 
A.	I don't remember that name.  I told you that the person who was taking care of him survived.  I think that this child was his nephew.  The child is still alive.  If you are looking for this man's name, the child might be able to give it to you.  He can also explain how Rwamakuba ordered this man to get off his bed. 
Q.	And, indeed, had this man, in fact, in plaster broken his leg in a car accident? 
A.	He had been attacked and wounded with sharp objects. 
Q.	So, anyway, those events, as you put it, you saw with your own eyes and you saw them taken outside to the red pickup and put on there, or thrown in there.  And you speak of Gatera and Rwamakuba having ID cards, and Gatera said, "Look at the world for a last time."  And then André Rwamakuba tore the ID cards, and he said, "Look at the world for a last time."  Is that right?  
A.  	That is what happened.  The two men came down holding their identity cards.  Afterwards, after the war, we saw pieces of identification cards behind the maternity.  People who returned to the maternity, to the hospital in the days following the end of the war, observed that there were torn bits of identification cards there. 
Q.  	And, indeed, if we look at your statement, the TM4, your first statement, you state here -- you give the Kinyarwanda, which I'm not going to attempt, which meant you said, and this is André saying, "Look at the world for the last time."  You also said immediately after that, "André would come at times twice a day."  Did André come twice a day? 
A.	No, that's not true.  I never said that.  I have told you that perhaps the interpreters did not interpret what I said correctly.  What I am saying here is the truth.  Take it as such.  What I am saying here as I am giving testimony, should be considered as the truth and should take precedence over my written statement. 
Q.	So he's identified by that man whose name we know -- you wrote down.  There came a time when you left the maternity and you went to hide in the sorghum field, next to the hospital, and then you went from there to the préfecture building.  Now, let's just stay at the hospital for a moment.  Why did you actually leave the hospital?  You said, "It was because I was discovered."  "I was found out," that was the word.  When you were asked by Ms. Fall what that meant, you said, "My identity card had been thrown away.  I had no ID, and that was synonymous to being a Tutsi."  Is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You aren't sure of the date, but when you gave evidence in 2003, page 50 of the transcript, you said "it was, I believe, the 1st of May," that you left.  Does that sound about right to you?  In other words, you would have been, according to your previous statement, three days in the tents. 
A.	I think I left the hospital towards mid-May.  I think it was towards the beginning of May.  At that time, no one paid attention to days and dates, but I think that April had already ended and that we were around the beginning of May.  
Q.	Well, in your statement, made much close to the time, you said you were at the tent for three days.  Now, that would take us up to the 24th of April.  Do you think you were in that maternity ward longer than a week with this Hutu woman? 
A.	I think that you are putting words into my mouth.  I never advanced any dates whatsoever when I gave that testimony, apart from the date of the 21st of April, which was recalled by other people for my benefit.  I think, apart from the other dates, the 15th, that is the date of the Kibeho event.  I have advanced no other date.  I think that is an invention on your part. 
Q.	Well, let me read your words, and this is in examination-in-chief.  When you were answering questions from the Prosecution on the 8th of December 2003, line 36 page 50, and I'll read the whole little section.  It's quite short.  "I left the hospital at around the 1st of May.  It is difficult for me to know exactly which day of the week it was, but, rather, it is too difficult for me to remember exactly when it was, but I believe it was around the 1st of May."  
	
	Now, has anything happened since then to make you change your mind? 
A.	Counsel, I said that I thought it was towards the beginning of May.  I never specifically stated that it was 1st of May.  I have never given a specific date.  I only mentioned the first days of the month of May. 
Q.	Well, I've read your answer and I'm not going to comment on it.  Can I go to your statement in the Muvunyi case, your second statement to the ICTR where you talked about leaving?  And I read the earlier bit, and I am going to read all of it to you.  Muvunyi and his attackers, they'd come, you remember, civilians with wooden sticks, and I'll read from top of page TM18 in the English, your statement signed and dated the 9th of June 1999, and the statement incidentally, that are full of corrections by you, as we can see from the initials that appear in the margins.  There are seven or eight of them, at least.  
	
	"I attempted to hide in the basement of the maternity ward."  So you've been attacked, and you are now hiding in the maternity ward.  "Dr. Gatera, however, came with Rwamakuba, André, soldiers, and other doctors whom I did not know.  I was with other refugees.  When he came, he asked everyone for his or her identity cards."  And I take that to be Gatera.  That's my comment.  "One of the Tutsi hiding had a Hutu identity card.  The rest of us did not show our identity cards.  He said that since the others do not have identity cards, then they must be killed.  One of the attackers then asked the gender of my child.  When he found out that he was a boy, he tried to kill the boy using a club.  I blocked the club before he hit my child, and in the process my hand was hit.  They told us to follow them.  We did.  I was the last one.  As we were going, I diverted.  They did not notice, as they were searching for other refugees.  I went to hide in a sorghum plantation near the hospital, and later on in the evening, I went to hide in the préfecture office."  
	
	Can you help us, where does that fit into your current evidence, please? 
A.  	You have just said that this is what I said in the Muvunyi trial.  When the Muvunyi trial starts, call me and I would explain what happened, since the person who took this down in that statement did not do so correctly.  This person mixed up events.  This is a mixture of events. 
Q.  	Well, there are a lot of signatures and corrections.  It seems, yet again, you had every opportunity to correct the statement, if you wish, but it is such a different account, isn't it?  
A.	I must say that I speak only Kinyarwanda.  Perhaps the person who interpreted what was taken down as my statement did not do so correctly.  But considering the way the sequence of events is described in this statement, I think everything has been mixed up.  As to Muvunyi, when we shall get to the Muvunyi trial, call me as a witness, and I will explain.  As to the events that I witnessed in respect of the Rwamakuba trial, I have told you what I saw and what I experienced. 
Q.	You see, they are not calling you for the Muvunyi trial, just as they didn't call you for the Butare trial.  And the name incidentally of the interpreter on that second occasion was Fabien Nsengiyumva (phonetic), and that sounds pretty Rwandan to me.  Does it to you?  
A.	Even if he is Rwandan, he didn't do his job well, because the information that was read out to me is mixed up.  Based on what you read out to me a while ago, the events are completely jumbled. 
Q.	And I suggest that's because you can't tell the same story twice.  It's not the interpreters and the investigators getting it wrong.  They've got no interest to do that.  It's you telling different stories every time you tell your story.  My question is, why is that?  If you are telling the truth, it's not so difficult to deviate from the truth.  
A.	What you say is not correct.  I am telling you the truth.  It is the second time that I am appearing before a trial to give testimony.  The first time I said what I knew, and you can check the accuracy of what I am saying as to the interviews that took place in Rwanda.  These people came on several occasions.  I observed that what I said was not taken down accurately.  Proof of this is the passage that you have just read out.  I think that is, in fact, why we are required by the Trial Chamber to give evidence.  I should like to repeat that there are statements that do not always reflect exactly what we say. 
Q.	There is a man you wrote down as the second name that identified Rwamakuba.  The first time you mentioned that was in the course of the trial in 2003.  Wasn't it?  You've never mentioned his name in either a statement or confirmation before that.  Is that correct, yes or no, please? 
A.	I do not know whether this is a point important enough for you to dwell on it at such length.  You said that I did not mention to the investigators before that date.  So what?  
Q.	Rather oddly, you didn't mention his name on Friday, nor were you asked until today.  You don't know why that was, do you?  Had you discussed that man's name with -- 
A.	What Friday are you talking about?  The last time I mentioned it, and I repeated it today. 
Q.	No, you didn't, I can assure you.  My ears were sticking out on stalks waiting for you to mention it.  You didn't mention it, nor were you asked.
A.	I called that name. 
Q.	Well, I can assure you.  You didn't, but I am not here to have a tennis match with you about that.
A.	Whether the name is called or not, does it demonstrate that Rwamakuba never took part in the act of genocide committed at the university hospital?  Is that your point?  Is that what I am to understand?  
Q.	How long have you been in Arusha this time? 
A.	Why?  
Q.	Well, it's a simple question.  You can answer it, please.  
A. 	 I have stayed here for a relatively short time. 
Q.	How many days is that, please? 
A.	Why are you asking me the number of days?  I didn't take the time to count, but when I shall have counted the days, you can be sure that I will let you know. 
Q.	Well, have you been here for two weeks or longer? 
A.	I don't remember, but if I have a little time and I think about it, I'm sure I'll manage to count the days. 
Q.	How many times have you met the Prosecutor to discuss your evidence? 
A.  	I have met the Prosecutor once. 
Q.	In the last trial you were asked if you had met the Prosecutor at all, and you said no.  That was untrue, wasn't it, when you said you hadn't met the Prosecutor at all in the preparation of your case?  Are you telling the truth this time? 
A.	I met the Prosecutor once, and the interview lasted a few minutes. 
Q.	You met the Prosecutor once this time, and the interview lasted a few minutes.  If that is not the truth, I hope that I will be told so.  If that is not the truth, I will expect my friend to confirm so. 
	
	Let's move to the préfecture building itself, and there you said that this man arrived, who'd been identified in the way you described, and he said -- really a short sentence, though the four times you said it, you said it in different ways.  You said, "Why are they still there?  They are to be killed," or "Why are these refugees down here?  They are Tutsis.  They must be killed; they must not be seen here again," or "What are these people doing here?  They should be killed.  They shall no longer live in this country," or, "These people must be killed and out of the country."  

	So would it be fair to say that when you say you overheard something and you express it, you are really giving expression to a sentiment, if I can put it like that, rather than to actual word-for-word statement made by this man?  Would that be right?  
A. The various versions of what you said are based on one fact.  He always talked of massacring people.  I thought that you had discovered a sentence where he had said that people were to be saved.  That is what I was waiting for.  "People must be killed," that is the message conveyed in all of these versions.  If you had discovered some place where he allegedly said that people were to be saved, I would have accepted your proposition.  But all the various versions centre on one thing, that is, getting people killed.
(Pages 19 to 25 by Sheriffo Jammeh) 


1700H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And in your statement you have a similar sentiment, but it's preceded by these words:  "André told the civilian préfet 'I told you these people, you transferred them from the university hospital to the préfecture -- to the préfecture here.'" Is that right?  Was that said, that the préfet had transferred them from the hospital to the préfecture? 
A.	You're twisting words.  He said that the people in the préfecture office were to be killed.  That is what he said.  You're twisting my words and you try to present them in a manner that is not correct.  I did not come here to say anything other than the truth. 
Q.	And on a small point, it might be a very small point, you tell us that your baby was then 18 months old.  But the last time you gave his age in December 2003, page 84, you were very specific, and you said he was one year and three months.  There's not a great difference, 15 months and 18 months, but it may reflect a difference in, perhaps, mobility of a child, you see, particularly when you're saying the whole reason for you overhearing this was going to collect your child who had gone across to where the car was.  So how old was your child?  Was he one year and three months or 18 months? 
A.	I have my identity card with me, and I can show it to you, and you would see the child's year of birth.  She (sic) received a number of immunisation shots, and at the time, he was one year three months of age.  He was born in 1993. 
Q.	And immediately before leaving the hospital, that child had been clubbed in the head, had he not?  He'd been attacked and clubbed in the head, that little baby.  
A.	Yes, he was clubbed.  And the child was treated soon after the war.  He received medical treatment at the -- at King Faisal hospital.  And during that period the child was bleeding in the ears and in the nose or nostrils.  Thanks to his evacuation to the King Faisal hospital, the child was treated, and now he's in good health. 
Q.	He was clubbed just before you left Butare hospital and seriously injured, wasn't he? 
A.	The child was clubbed while we were at the university hospital. 
Q.	And it's this child, you say, who's wandering off over to the vehicle, isn't it? 
A.	That child could move about, and I can tell you that he started walking when he was ten months old. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you about a series of previous statements you've made.  And the first one, I'm going to read you a few lines out of an -- a book or booklet made by African Rights dated April 2, the booklet.  And the title of the booklet -- booklet is "Lieutenant Colonel Tharcisse Muvunyi," and it's subtitled, "A Rwandanese genocide commander living in Britain."  And at ******** it reads -- it gives your name, your age, where you're from, and the fact that you and your family at first took refuge at the parish of Kibeho in Mabuga, that you made your way to Runyinya, and like -- and it names another person referred to in the article -- was driven to the hospital by Father Ngomirakiza.  And now I'm going to read out what it claims you said in an interview on the **********************  1999 to African Rights researchers.  It says, "About three or four days after our arrival at the hospital, ESO soldiers started coming and taking away hundreds of -- " 
MS. FALL: 
I merely want clarification.  I would like to know if that document has been disclosed to us.  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, it hasn't.  But it's part -- I think the Prosecution have it, in any event, as part their archive files.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'll start again.  This quote is footnoted, "Interviewed  ***************** 1999," and it has your name and your age and those details.  And it reads:  "About three or four days after our arrival at the hospital, ESO soldiers started coming and taking away hundreds of people and killing them."  Just pausing there, is that correct, first of all?  Did you say it, and is it correct? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, but the questions that you are putting to me have nothing to do with the proceedings at hand.  You are delaying the proceedings, and that has nothing to do with the instance trial. 
Q.	Did ESO soldiers start coming and taking away hundreds of people and killing them?  Is it true, and did you say it?  
A.	You can always put that question to me during -- in the course of the Military trial, but for now the case that we're dealing with is the trial of André Rwamakuba.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, there are rules which govern the kind of questions which can be asked in these trials, and they are fairly well established, and it is our job as Judges to control the proceedings to make certain that you are not asked questions which are improper.  If counsel asks you a question which he should not ask, we will stop him from doing so.  This question is not an improper question, and we think you should answer it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is it right?  Did you say it? 
A.	Please, can you repeat the passage that you read out to me a while ago, Counsel?  
Q.	It's not you wasting time, I hope, now.  I'll read it to you then.  "About three or four or days after our arrival at the hospital, ESO soldiers started coming and taking away hundreds of people and killing them."  Let me -- let read on.  "They started with the rich people, generally the men.  After two weeks, the only ones left at the hospital were women and boys too young to be distinguished from girls.  Then the soldiers threw us out of the hospital and told us to go to the office of the préfecture.  They said the hospital was only for soldiers wounded at the front."  Do you have any comments, madam, on that? 
A.	Yes.  Answering that episode in which soldiers came and abducted people, once again, I think that it is, rather, to the préfecture office that the soldiers came and abducted men to take along with them.  You should understand that the interpreter did not translate my statements well.  The incident that you are situating at the hospital occurred, rather, at the préfectural office, and that is where the soldiers of ESO took away people.  Understand, therefore, that when the statement was taken, the facts were confused.  As for the events that took place at the hospital, those are the ones that I have already narrated or related.  
Q.	Was it that the soldiers told you and the people you were with to go to the préfecture because the hospital was now only for wounded soldiers?  Did that happen? 
A.	No, I never made such a statement.  The soldiers never told me to leave the hospital.  I never gave such a statement.  If my recollection is correct, where they came and drove us away was at the préfectural office, but that incident never took place at the hospital.  This is a distortion, a distortion of my statement. 
Q.	Well, that's how it appears in that particular article, and as I understand it, your statement made to African Rights is in the African Rights archive in Kigali, and you, for example, can have access to it if you want to.  So if you're troubled by that statement, perhaps you can go and get it and let us have it. 

You gave evidence in the Gatera trial, and the procès-verbal statement appears in the Prosecution bundle TM56, 57, and 58 in the original, 64, 65, and 66 in the French.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I invite the Prosecution to respond:  Is there an English translation, please, of this document?  
MS. FALL: 
No, we don't have the English translation.  The translation of the document is requested, but we haven't had it yet.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, can I provide an attempted translation, which I think is sufficient, and it's been checked.  And all documents are, I hope for convenience, stapled together.  And can one of those documents please go to -- or one of the bundles please go to the witness herself. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to ask something from the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may do that.  You may ask your question.  
THE WITNESS:
I think this will be the third time that I will be expressing myself in this manner.  I realise that the people whose duty it was to write down our statements confused everything.  Sometimes when the statements that we made were read out, we realised that there was confusion or mix-up, in particular in relation to the chronology of events.  I realise that there are incidents that I could have referred to, but I realised that there are quite a number of errors.  And this is the reason wherefore I have come here before the Trial Chamber in order to give clarifications in the event that there are confusions here and there in the statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, that is one of the reasons why our rules permit these questions to be asked and to provide you an opportunity to make comments.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, this is, in fact, of course, a document, and you have the original photocopied and in front of you, with your signature on it at the end.  Do you recognise that signature at the end?  It's on the last page of the document next to the date, ************************ '97.  Is that your signature, madam, underneath your written name?  Look on the original, madam.  Is the handwritten document -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You won't find it on the English or French translations, so don't trouble yourself looking at those.  They won't help you.  It's the third page of the document and it's right at the end.  Do you see your name and your signature, and do you acknowledge that as yours? 
A.	I realise that this is a copy.  Where is the original from which the photocopy was made?  I do (unintelligible) the fact that it is a Kinyarwanda version.  I believe that there is also an English version that hasn't been signed. 
Q.	We're not interested with the English version, as I'm sure you're aware, nor are we interested in the French version.  They're there as aids to those of us who do not speak your language.  Will you please look at third page of the photocopied original and tell the Court, the Judges, not me, tell the Judges whether that's your signature, yes or no, please.  
A.	Even when there are people who don't understand Kinyarwanda, I will actually tell you that people have come and made us sign documents that were written in a language rather than Kinyarwanda.  I notice that there is no signature on the English version, and yet, when people come to make us sign a document, we sign the document -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- even when it is written in a language other than Kinyarwanda. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask the assistance, please, of registry.  My belief is this witness knows very well the point, but just to assist her, just in case I'm mistaken about that, could you point out her signature on the third page of the original document?  And perhaps it would assist her and us if you -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
-- took away the English and the French.  Can you just leave the witness with the Kinyarwanda, please?
THE WITNESS:
At no moment did I give my statement in Kinyarwanda.  I have realised that either the statement was in French or it was in English -- in French or in English.  Now, you are showing me a photocopy of a statement that was drafted in Kinyarwanda, and here since I was -- 

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness.  
A.	-- interviewed by the investigators -- 
Q.	Madam Witness, can I interrupt you?  I apologise for interrupting you, but you're rattling on, and it may assist you -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Listen to me, please, Madam Witness.  The document you have in front of you -- will you turn to the first page? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Will you turn to the first page, and will you -- 
A.	I've seen it. 
Q.	Now, will you look at the top left-hand corner of that page, and you'll see it starts off, in fact, in French.  This is a statement, madam, provided by you on the ************** of 1997 -- so before your statement in the Rwamakuba case here -- given in Kinyarwanda to Callixte Twagiramungu, whom I'm sure you may remember, is the principal prosecution officer for the Butare court of first instance.  So this is a statement taken by him questioning you in relation to the case of Geoffroy Gatera.  And if you look at the third and last page, you will find, I suggest, a photocopy of that last page with your signature and your date and your name.  This is not a United Nations document.  This is a document taken by and on behalf of the procureur général in Rwanda.  Do you recognise your signature on the last page? 
A.	You're talking to me about page 4, but I don't see anything that you've said, and my signature doesn't appear on the page either. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. Issa, can you go and show the witness, please, if you can find it yourself, under the name of the witness, which is midway or two-thirds down the page, our TM56, page 4, as it appears on the document, under the printed name her signature?  Can you show the witness that signature, please?  
THE WITNESS:
There is no signature on that document. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In fact, you're missing a page of the document, but is doesn't -- it's not relevant to this question at all, and we'll provide it to you.  You do have the page I'm questioning you about, which is page 3.  
MR. HOOPER:
Is anyone else missing page 2 of the document?  I'll come back to that in a moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, what I have, I have TM56 and then I have TM58. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't have TM57. 
MR. HOOPER: 
57, can I pass mine up very quickly to remedy.  It's in Kinya, but so the Court can have sight.  It's on the electronic copy served by the Prosecution.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But, Madam Witness, that needn't distract us in any way because you don't have, of course, TM58, and I hope you've now been handed -- I hope you've now been handed -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, give that to the witness, please.  Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I hope you've now been handed the page that you were looking at, anyway, claiming you couldn't see a signature, and I've circled that signature in blue ink and put a big arrow there.  Do you see that?  Is that your signature, madam?  
A.	These are false signatures.  Somebody must have copied or forged my signature.  This is really not the way I sign. 
Q.	Of course, madam.  Now, these documents were served by your government on us and the Prosecution.  So you're suggesting that someone in the procureur général's office has bothered to scroll out a statement -- a false statement with your name on it, serve it on us when you're a witness for the Prosecution at the ICTR?  Is that really what you're suggesting? 
A.	This is why I say that there's something fishy.  Each time I met the people who interviewed me, they took down notes in French or English.  At no point did I meet anyone, an investigator, who took down my statement in Kinyarwanda.  However, I see that in this statement here before me, there is French and Kinyarwanda, which is why I doubt the authenticity of this document.  It is the first time that I have seen a document drafted in this manner. 
Q.	Now, this statement -- I believe you understand, but I'll say it again -- is a statement given to a man called Callixte Twagiramungu.  I hope you're listening to that, Callixte Twagiramungu.  And he's the prosecution investigator for the Rwandese government for the court at Butare.  And he claims here that he sat you down and asked you questions, and at the end of it all, he's repeated the answers to you, and you confirm it, and you sign it.  Did you ever, ever make a statement, a written statement, to a prosecution investigator for the Rwandese government in the case of Geoffroy Gatera in Rwanda, yes or no? 
A.	I never saw him take down these notes in Kinyarwanda.  All those who interviewed me prepared my statement either in French or in English, whereas, I observed that this document was written in Kinyarwanda.  That is my problem. 
Q.	Or is your problem you're not telling the truth, Madam Witness? 

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER: 
May I just say -- 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. -- perhaps I might be of assistance to you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
(Microphones overlapping)
MS. FALL: 
Can the witness be asked to remove her earphones?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the Prosecution.  
MS. FALL: 
I would -- first, I would just like to ask whether the witness has understood Mr. Hooper's question, because from her answers it seems to me that she is thinking of her statements.  Perhaps the explanation is not clear to her, whereas, his is a procès-verbal of an interview in the Gatera trial.  Perhaps clearer explanations would enable the witness to understand better.  In my view, I think it is a problem of understanding here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Now, I want you to take the document. 

Mr. Registrar, assist, please. 

Look at the front page of the document in Kinyarwanda.  Look at the front page of the original document.  Okay?  Now, do you understand -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you see it?  Now, do you understand that that is a document taken on behalf of the government of Rwanda?  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Is this what is written on the document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute.  Don't argue.  It's very simple.  Do you understand that it is a document taken on behalf of the government of Rwanda?  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Do you understand that it is a procès-verbal given in the case against Dr. Gatera?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you read?  
THE WITNESS:
I can only read Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, would you read the last page of the Kinyarwanda, the last -- the end of the statement, the end of the procès-verbal?  Look at the end of it.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've looked at this page. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Can you read the last -- the last few lines of it?  Start from the last question.  Just read it out to us.  
THE WITNESS:
What question are you referring to?  Is it the seventh?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The very last question on the page.  
THE WITNESS:
I cannot read because my eyesight is defective.  It's not very clear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, look below the last question.  Is there anything you see -- 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there anything you see below the last question that you recognise?  Anything below the last question that you recognise?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Tell us what -- 
THE WITNESS:
I have been able to read the seventh question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Read it aloud then, please.  Read it aloud.  
THE WITNESS:
I can read from the seventh question in Kinyarwanda.  "Do you have anything to add?"  Question.  Answer:  "What I know is that I do not wish to see him as a head of the institution, whereas he caused people to be killed."  What follows is in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you read that?  
THE WITNESS:
Everything else that follows?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
THE WITNESS:
I can't read.  It is not legible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Is there anything else you see behind that you recognise -- underneath, anything underneath that that you recognise?  
THE WITNESS:
The passage that follows is in French.  I can see my name and the signature, but I think this is a photocopy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Is there anything else that you see that you can recognise?  For example, do you see a date?  Can you recognise that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can see the date. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What date is that?  
THE WITNESS:
It is the *********** 1997. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And do you see -- 
THE WITNESS:
I note that this statement has something to do with the Gatera trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And do you see a name underneath the date, and do you recognise the name?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not recognise the name Twagiramungu. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope that assists you to understand what is the document that you're looking at.  That's what I was trying to help you to do, to understand what it is you're looking at.  Do you understand what you're looking at now?  
THE WITNESS:
I do not really recognise this document, but it seems to me that the document is connected to the Gatera trial which took place in Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's enough for me.  Now, I hope that that will assist you to answer the questions that are being put.  So to put you in the location of what you're looking at and what questions are being asked. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you can see where the date is there, the ************** 1997.  And if you look at the document, please, you've just indicated to the Judge that to the left of that there's a name, and that's your name, isn't it?  I'm not asking you about the signature now.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Listen -- listen to the question.  It bears your name, and we can all read it, and you can read it too, can't you?  There's your name, and do you see that? 
A.	I saw my name and my signature, but it seems to me that this is not an original document.  It is a photocopy, which is why I am emphasising this fact.  Moreover, I see that the document is in Kinyarwanda.  This is a copy.  This is why I wished to find out where this copy comes from. 
Q.	Well, it's a copy, of course, of an original document.  And it won't surprise you, I'm sure, to know that the Rwandese government likes to keep important documents like this, and so you'll find this document in the procureur général's office in Kigali.  That's where it is today.  Now, obviously, we're not going to have in a court like this all the original documents, which is why this has been photocopied.  But am I right in saying this, that if we look at the photocopy, and you've got it in front of you, that's clearly your signature, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I saw my name and the signature. 
Q.	Now, I'm just going to -- I'm not going to deal with this document very much, but what it tells us at the beginning -- and if you look at the document, you can obviously read it well enough, just as you were able to read all your personal details and correct them at the beginning of this trial.  You can read all right, can't you?  

So if we look at your -- your statement, it starts off and it tells us about the attack at Kibeho, and it talks about you going to the hospital.  And it says this:  "At the end of the war, I was in the forest of Rango."  Now, just pausing there, is that right?  Were you in the forest of Rango at the end of the war?  
A.	I made another statement elsewhere in regard to my arrival in Rango forest.  I shall explain at the appropriate time.  I was, in fact, in that forest.  I had been taken there -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	-- by someone and this person took me there with other people. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  We don't need to know all the details, but it's a detail that's there and appears to be correct.  And then you're asked if you know Dr. Geoffroy Gatera and how he behaved during the war.  And I'm not going to read it all, but what you say in its essentials is that you saw him in the maternity department.  You were in the basement.  He appears to have been asking what all these stupid Tutsi were doing there.  And he asked if you belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group, and it says here that, "We responded that we were not Tutsis."  And that he said that if you thought the hospital had become a hiding place for Tutsis, you can only blame yourselves if anything bad happened to you.  And before leaving, Gatera told you that something bad was going to happen to these stupid Tutsis who had sought refuge at the hospital.  Now, just pausing there, was there a time when Gatera came to maternity and spoke in that way and threatened you, the Tutsis, who were hiding there?  Is that true?  Is that something that happened?  
A.	I do not know where the information you refer to is found.  I have explained to you what happened in the hospital.  I do not know why you're dragging me into another line of questioning.  I have told you that Gatera has been tried.  We accused him.  And now you want me to return to what we have already said.  Gatera threatened people, and he committed crimes for which he was prosecuted.  This is what will happen to other people who committed crimes.  I do not know why you keep causing me to return to what we have already said. 
Q.	Now, looking at the document, and you have it in Kinyarwanda, and I think it's important that -- if you can, can you read out what happened?  This is the end of your third answer.  If you look at the answers and you go to the third one, and it's quite a long answer, and it starts off with all that business that I've just related to about the maternity department and being in the basement.  And you say, "There were two young men.  He took one of them away, holding him by the collar of his shirt.  We never saw them again.  Their sister was killed the same night."  Do you remember ever saying anything like that about two young men and their sister being killed that night?  Do you remember anything about that? 
A.	But I told you that many people were taken away from the hospital, and they were put on board this vehicle, and these people were killed.  I have said it time and again. 
Q.	But the specific mention here of two young men who were held by Gatera and their sister is killed, do you remember that?  Did that happen? 
A.	He took them away.  I told you that he took people away and he put them on board a vehicle.  Perhaps I referred to young people.  For the time being, I have talked about people, but young people are people.  He took these young people onto a red van.  I think I have said this over and over. 
Q.	Thank you for that.  Now, we may need to check the original Kinyarwanda, all right, but if you can find the section, it reads in my translation in English, "Before leaving, Gatera told us that something bad was going to happen to these stupid Tutsi who had sought refuge at the hospital.  Indeed, he then sent the soldiers.  They arrived at night to beat us, and they broke my spinal cord."  And in the Prosecution statement from which this is being translated, it's "viser la colonne vertébrale".  It's been translated as "spinal cord".  I'm not sure if that's a proper medical translation, but something serious anyway, by the looks of it.  Anyway, "They arrived at night to beat us, and they broke my spinal cord.  Some of us were killed."  Now, just there, can I just ask you, did soldiers arrive at night?  Did they beat you?  Did they break your spinal cord or cause a serious injury or some injury to your back?  Were some of you killed?  So there's four questions, really.  Question one:  Did Gatera send soldiers, yes or no, to you?  Did he send them to where you were hiding?  
A.	That isn't correct.  I made no such statement.  I never said that Gatera sent soldiers.  Was Gatera a military commander?  No.  That is not correct.  Whoever took that statement did not do so correctly.  Gatera was not the military commander.  It is Muvunyi who was the commander.  This passage isn't correct.  Even if I was hit, I was hit when I was at the préfecture.  It is my child, rather, who was hit when we were at the hospital.  And if there is a mix-up, I would like to say that I was hit when I was at the préfecture, and my ribs were cracked, so -- and my arm was broken.  Things have been mixed up.  This is an invention.  It's a mix-up.  
Q.	I agree it's a mix-up, but it's your mix-up, isn't it?  It's not Callixte Twagiramungu's mix-up.  He's just writing down what you're telling him.  Did soldiers ever come at night to beat you at the hospital, yes or no?  
A.	You mustn't ascribe declarations to me that I do not recognise.  I was hit when I was at the préfecture.  I was not hit when I was in the hospital.  It is my child who was hit there.  I stayed in the préfecture for a long time, and it is when I was there that I was hit.  So you can see that things have been mixed up.  I was at the préfecture.  My ribs and my arm were broken.  I was not hit when I was at the hospital.  It is my child who was hit when we were at the hospital.  I made no such statement.  And I have told you that I came before the Trial Chamber to say to what extent mistakes had been made. 
Q.	And I'm going to just, I'm afraid, read that passage again for context, and I'd like you to listen, when you say it's mixed up.  "Before leaving, Gatera told us that something bad was going to happen to these stupid Tutsi who had sought refuge at the hospital.  Indeed, he then sent the soldiers.  They arrived at night to beat us, and they broke my spinal cord.  Some of us were killed.  The next morning I found refuge at the office of the préfecture, and they came there to take people away to kill them."  So with respect to you, it doesn't read mixed up, does it? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I was hit when I was at the préfecture, and Gatera was not a military commander.  The soldiers had a commander.  So these are blatant lies. 
Q.	Now, we're coming up to 6:00, and I'm going to ask you about the statement you made in the Twagirayezu -- the Dr. Twagirayezu case.  Now, can I ask you this:  Is it right that you did, in fact, make a statement to the Rwandese prosecutor for the purpose of the Dr. Twagirayezu trial?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	I made a statement. 
Q.	Now, when you were shown this statement by the Defence in December 2003, page 74 of the transcript, you were shown the document.  And we can circulate that and one can go to you.  And I'm going to take all the English and French away because it might only serve to -- to confuse.  
MR. HOOPER:
That's for the witness.  And these are found at TM60.  Is there an English at TM60?  No, there's no English translation.  Again, there's no English translation.  The Defence produced one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how long is this going to take?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, it was a bit uphill on the last PV, and I have no reason to think it's not going to be a similar journey this time, and I've got another PV after that.  I'm not going to conclude this witness in half an hour.  I could, if the witness assisted me, but there are difficulties, and they may not all be purposeful, they may be genuine misunderstandings, so -- and then we're going to have re-examination.  But I don't have altogether that much longer to go.  And I would -- I did think I'd finish her today, but I'm afraid that's not happening. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're wondering if now is a convenient time.  That's what we are thinking. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, certainly if you don't want to sit later. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if we have to come back tomorrow -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I agree.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and what's you're saying -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I agree.  There's re-examination, in any event. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, we'll take the recess now. 

Madam Witness, it's now 6:00.  Even if we sat a bit later, you would have to come back tomorrow, so we think we'd better take the adjournment now, and we resume tomorrow morning at quarter to nine.  I would like to remind you, as I have done on previous occasions, that during this, or any other adjournment, while you are a witness, you remain a witness, and you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that?  

THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  Thank you.  You have taken up quite a bit of my time.  Perhaps my child has cried.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will take the adjournment now, and we resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1800H)
