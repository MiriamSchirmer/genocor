12th, in an editorial, President

You can go on with that question,

BY MS. OJEMENI:

11

Witness, which list were you referring to

12

that was published during election?

13

A.

Well, it was that list containing the names

14

of those that were elected as members of the

15

MRND prefectural congress.

16

yesterday I did remember the name of

17

Nzirorera and the former Deputy Prefect,

18

Nzanana.

19

those two names because it has been a long

20

time.

I believe I did omit to mention

22
23

Let me spell Nzanana, N-Z-A-N-A-N-A.
Q.

24
25

same as the prefectural committee of MRND?

A.

prefectural committee.

2

those that were in the committee were

3

automatically members of the prefectural

4

committee.

5

rather, the prefectural congress was allied.

6

But I did say very clearly, and for the

7

prefectural committee there were eight, if

8

my memory serves me right.

9

Q.

10
11

In other words,

And the prefectural congress,

Thank you.

Is Kajelijeli a member of the Prefectural
committee, and MRND congress as well?

A.

Yes.

Let me explain that.

The members of

12

the committee were automatically members of

13

the congress, because in the prefectural

14

congress you had, not only members of the

15

committee, there were also those presidents

16

that came from the various communes of

17

Ruhengeri, including the president of MRND

18

in each commune.

19

that the congress was rather enlarged, and

20

the committee was restricted to eight

21

members.

22

Q.

23
24
25

So, you can see clearly

Is Ruhengeri a prefecture or commune,
because I heard commune in the translation?

A.

No.

Ruhengeri is a prefecture and the

prefecture is divided into 16 communes.

12

Q.

I

Thank you.

Witness, you told the Court that the family

13

of Muvunga was headed by a Hutu, was this

14

head killed on the 8th, when you attacked

15

the family?

16

A.

Yes.

17

Q.

Was the husband killed of Mrs. Muvunga?

18

A.

No.

The husband was not killed because he

19

was from the Hutu ethnic group.

20

killed, massacred his wife Nyirahusoro and

21

his five children, I think there were five

22

children.

Q.

We only

Why did you kill the children who were Hutus
as well as, on one day?

and among other things, among others,

2

Nzirorera and Kajelijeli.

3

to eliminate the Tutsis, because according

4

to them, any Tutsis knew that the

5

assassination of the President of the

6

Republic will be carried out, so that we

7

should fight again the enemy and precisely,

8

the enemy was the Tutsi ethnic group.

9

Q.

We were ordered

When did you kill the two people you

10

mentioned that were residing in Ruhafi house

11

namely, Ndagijimana and Nyirabukowa?

12

A.

At Ruhafi, as I clearly said, there is a

13

road, a small road coming from Ruhengeri

14

towards this Rukuma secteur, it is a small

15

road that goes in front of Muvuka and in the

16

morning they massacred Nyirahusoro and her

17

children.

18

towards Ruhafi where the two children of

19

Seriyombo were hiding.

20

was killed with a bullet from my Kalashnikov

21

because I shot at the ceiling and his small

22

sister Nyirabukobwa was killed with the

traditional club.

A.

3 OCTOBER 2001

No, it was not in the morning because in the

2

morning, we went to Muvukas; Nyirahusoko was

3

Muvuka's second wife, he had two wives.

4

we massacred and looted the belongings in

5

Nyirahusoko's house and his wife and towards

6

the afternoon we went up, it was that same

7

day.

8

is long time ago.

9

in my statement in Rwanda.

So,

You will kindly excuse me because it
I did not clearly say it
I said that it

10

was between the 8th and the 9th and that

11

doesn't mean that we went to Ruhafi's on the

12

9th and the 8th at Muvuka's.

13

massacred Mrs. Nyirahusuko and the children

14

the same day, but at different parts of the

15

day.

16

Q.

17
18

So, we

Did you consider the children of Muvuka Hutu
or Tutsi, when you killed them?

A.

Well, there was a small discussion among us

19

the assailants, some of them were saying

20

that we should kill, massacre

21

Mrs. Nyirahusoko only and the others were

22

saying no, we shouldn't leave the children

23

because these two children have the blood of

24

Muvuka running in them, he is Hutu and their

Could you tell this Court why you and the

10

others, the other attackers obeyed the

11

instructions from Kajelijeli to eliminate

12

the Tutsis?

13

A.

Yes, because Kajelijeli was the spokesman of

14

Nzirorera.

Nzirorera was a member of the

15

Government of Rwanda and if one didn't

16

respect their orders, especially the

17

interahamwe, was to be punished most

18

severely because it was said, that if you do

19

not do what we want you to do, if you do not

20

fight against the enemy, the enemy that is

21

the Tutsi, that is tantamount to your being

22

on their side, in other words, to kill the

Who were these authorities who told you not

These were Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.

by the people at the roadblock of Ginda

Can you recall the people who were present

at this meeting, some of them that you can

6

A.

I, so far as my commune and that is Nkuli

7

8

Sharire Habyimana, that is the president of

the CDR party that I talked to you about.

I

10

was with Sendungu Shadreck, the president of

the MRND.

I was with -- without of course

Could you tell the ethnicity of the people
who were present on that day?

A.

Well, it was the Hutu, there was not a

18

single Hutu that had the courage, even if --

19

he couldn't have the courage to come into

20

that room, not only on the day of the

21

meeting but in that pub.

22

do you call it -- no Tutsi went to that bar

23

to have a drink because they knew about the

activities of Nzirorera and Kajelijeli.

25

They couldn't venture into that bar because

those meetings was -- that meeting was to

2

remind ourselves that we should accept the

3

orders of Kajelijeli, because the orders

4

didn't come regularly, they came in during

5

the weekend because they said there were

6

busy in Kigali.

7

there was Mr. Kajelijeli -- who was asking

8

us not to worry about what Mr. Kajelijeli

said to us, and I do not remember any other

So that in his absence,

matter that we talked about.

We talked

11

about the uniforms of the Interahamwe,

because we had heard that in other communes

13

they had different uniforms.

14

it is because I was there as a guest, it was

15

the representatives of the Mukingo

Interahamwe that solicited such assistance

and Nzirorera obliged.

and he fulfilled his promise to give in wrap

4

Q.

Witness, were you referring to the uniform

for the Interahamwe or for the MRND; which

6

one?

7

A.

Now, the MRND followers wore wrap arounds

8

just like they wore wrap arounds usually.

9

But for the Interahamwe, it was uniforms

10

sewn, that is the material was used to sew

11

Bubus or long shirts with trousers, nobody

12

else wore such uniforms.

Amahindure group, I was a close friend of

theirs, I cooperated with them, I was in

charge of the youth and Sendugu, the

President of the MRND could not hide the

source of the funds and during the meeting

21

held by Nzirorera, he told us that when it

comes to the budget, do not have any fear

representative of Bizabarimana who was the

It was the prefectural committee and I said

so.

I said that there were two committees,

at the prefecture there were two committees.

12

There was the MRND prefectural committee and

the Congress, in other words, the MRND

Prefectural Congress and I did indeed

15

emphasise the fact that the members of the

16

MRND Prefectoral Committee had automatically

17

to be part of the Congress, the Prefectural

18

Congress and since in each commune, there is

was a committee of the commune and there was

a Congress responsible for the development

of the commune.

you make an objection, you are supposed to

lay out the foundation for it, Counsel and

that is all I am doing.

am asking questions on one that took place

would be the role the Amahindure was

in his answer.

So, he may want to go back to it, but the

problem we have is, he gives the answers and

3

then you have to go back.

4

ask the Witness to be as precise and follow

5

what you want.

But I think he did answer

that question.

You can ask him to confirm.

Q.

Please, could you

Witness, you are talking about a particular

meeting that took place at the communal

office towards the end of 1993; is that

11

correct?

12

A.

Yes.

13

Q.

Can you tell this Court what Nzirorera said

14
15

on that day; if you can recall?
A.

As I said clearly, the meeting that took

16

place at the Nkuli communal office and

17

convened by the various authorities,

18

Kajelijeli, Nzirorera and the bourgmestre of

19

the commune -- I said that meeting was

20

intended or targeted at the same objective,

21

in other words, sensitisation, incitement of

22

the population to fight against the enemy,

23

the enemy being those of the Tutsi ethnic

24

group.

25

between the two meetings was that, during

And I said, the only difference

the Isimbi meeting, personal issues were

raised, that is with respect to the

Interahamwe group and the Amahindure

battalion.

5
6

For instance, they were talking about what

7

they would need, what kind of activities are

8

to be carried out, what had to be modified,

9

et cetera.

So, these were matters of

10

concern to the group, whereas at the Nkuli

11

communal office, at the meeting that took

12

place there, there was sensitisation,

13

incitement as I stated, I am sorry to be

14

repeating myself, an incitement of the

15

entire population; recruitment of people so

16

as to reinforce the Amahindure group and the

17

introduction of that group.

population which was not aware, which was

19

not properly informed regarding that group

20

which was defending the country, so that

21

people cannot be taken unawares, you know

midst.

those two gentlemen, Kajelijeli and

Nzirorera and even other authorities

5

including the bourgmestre, each time and at

each meeting they did not fail to sensitise

7

or incite the population to fight against

8

the enemy, the Tutsis enemy.
