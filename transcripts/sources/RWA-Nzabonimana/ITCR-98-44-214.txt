WITNESS 9/17,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, madam.
Q.	Madam Witness, when we last saw each other, I had finished putting questions to you in closed session and I had put to you a few questions concerning the statements that you've had to give to investigators.  I'm going to continue this morning with your cross-examination, and I will begin by asking you a question concerning your participation at the -- your involvement or participation in the Gacaca hearings.

Madam Witness, you did tell us that you could not, for health reasons, be frequent at Gacaca hearings.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Would it be correct, therefore, to say that since you could not attend the Gacaca hearings frequently, you couldn't know persons who were cited or not during those hearings?
A.	I know those who were sighted at those hearings.
Q.	Do you know the number of sessions you have attended?
A.	Four.
Q.	Were you present from the beginning up to the end of the session?
A.	Yes, I participated at those sessions from the beginning to the end, and I'd like to point out that I went to participate at Gacaca sessions twice in my place of origin, and twice at my place of residence.
Q.	Madam Witness, would it be possible that, during the sessions you did not attend, names might have been cited and that you are not aware of them?
A.	I was informed about what was said by people who attended the sessions at which I was absent.
Q.	We agree, but you personally did not hear the names that were mentioned?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm now going to move on to another subject, and this concerns your going to the university hospital.  You did tell us that when you were attacked you went away.  You first of all took refuge at the communal office in the company of your children, and subsequently you had to leave to go to the university hospital.
A.	That's true.
Q.	I think you also said that at a certain point in time you had to be present at the -- you were present at a roadblock, which was close to Pauline's house.
A.	That's true.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us, even approximately, at what period you are referring to, or if you have an approximate date, please tell us.  
A.	I do not recall the date, but this was in April, towards the 20th -- around the 20th of April.  Of course, this is only an approximation.
Q.	Madam Witness, I think you did not give precise dates.  How, therefore, were you able to remember that date of the 20th?
A.	I am going from the fact that we left our house on about the 17th of April.
Q.	Madam Witness, in the statement that you gave to the Defence investigators on the 3rd of December, you situated that date as falling between the 20th and the 27th, which I think is a long period.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Madam Witness, according to your statement, you went to the hospital alone passing through that roadblock.  Can you tell us how long it took you to get to the hospital?
A.	It took me one full day.
Q.	And when you reached the hospital, where did you settle down?
A.	Actually, we first of all went to the groupe scolaire.
Q.	Yes, I know, Madam Witness, but we would like to leave that cellule event and go only to the hospital.  That is of what is of interest to us.
A.	Before going to the hospital, I passed through the roadblock at Nyiramasuhuko and that is where my relatives were arrested -- were stopped and killed, and I was told that I could die in a different manner and that is why I was left to go and I went to the hospital.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  So now we are at the hospital.  You told us that you were installed in the -- or you were settled in tents.
A.	That is true.
Q.	Do you know who installed those tents?
A.	Those tents had been set up at that location to lodge people who had come from Burundi.
Q.	But do you know the authorities or the people who had set up the tents?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Can you tell us at what spot those tents were set up?
A.	The tents were installed in front of the hospital.
Q.	Can you be a bit more specific to this Chamber and tell us at what location at the hospital, or near which building at the hospital the tents were set up?
A.	Those tents were set up not far from the operating ward commonly known as a surgery, and there there was an avocado tree.  That is where the tents were installed.
Q.	You were therefore accommodated in those tents.  Can you tell us for how long you stayed in those tents before going to the surgery unit?
A.	I stayed there for four days with other persons and on the fifth day those tents were dismantled, but at the time those tents were being dismantled -- were dismantled, I was no longer there.
Q.	Madam Witness, you actually told us that those tents were dismantled, and that the person who was responsible for giving the order to dismantle the tents was the person known as Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Were you present when Pauline was issuing the order to the effect that the tents be dismantled?
A.	I was present.
Q.	Madam Witness, I suppose that Pauline, who was a high official, I think when she was going to the hospital she wasn't alone?
A.	She was not alone; she was accompanied by soldiers.
Q.	To your knowledge, was she accompanied only by soldiers?
A.	At that time and under those circumstances it was difficult to look into the eyes of persons who were coming.  People only cast glances at those who were arriving and you would look down in order to not be noticed.  So when I opened my eyes and I saw those persons, I remember having seen soldiers and I didn't pay attention to the others.
Q.	So if you didn't pay attention, it might just be possible that, besides soldiers, there were other persons who were present and who were not soldiers?
A.	To my knowledge, Pauline was not with other persons besides the soldiers that I saw.
Q.	So what you are telling us is that besides soldiers, there were no other persons -- not even the hospital authorities?
A.	There was also Gatera and his colleagues, but Gatera and his colleagues were at the hospital when Nyiramasuhuko arrived.
Q.	Madam Witness, you tell us that you looked at people furtively, and you say that, besides soldiers, you don't know what other persons were there, but now you are admitting that there was Gatera and others persons?
A.	Concerning the doctors, the doctors had already been present at the location, so they were our hosts at the hospital.  When you put your question to me to ask whether there were other persons accompanying Nyiramasuhuko, I thought you were referring to other persons who were not doctors -- people who might have come from outside the hospital.
Q.	Madam Witness, you are a bit more precise than myself.  Were there other persons who came from outside who were accompanying her and that you did not know?
A.	I have told you that she came with soldiers, and I added that, as concerns the doctors, she found them at the hospital, and she talked to those doctors at the hospital, but she found them there on the spot.  And she told them, in a nutshell, that they had to dismantle or to do away with the rubbish that were the tents, so the tents had to be removed because she didn't want to see them at that location.
Q.	Madam Witness, you are talking about rubbish that was made up of the tents.  What do you mean by that?  What do you understand by what she meant when she talked of "rubbish" or "dirt"?
A.	Well, actually, dirt or rubbish was us.  She wanted us to be seen and some of us were taken to the préfectorial office and to ultimately be taken away to be killed.
Q.	Madam Witness, will we agree to say that the term "dirt" or "filth" as pronounced by certain authorities referred to the Tutsis?
A.	That is how it was.
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know whether those tents had been installed by an association called Médecins sans frontières -- Doctors Without Borders, as it were?
A.	I wasn't aware of that.  When I arrived at that location, I found the tents there.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us at what time your wounded daughter arrived at the hospital?  Were you still under the tents when she got there?
A.	Yes, I was still under the tent.
Q.	You remained there under the tents for four days, according to your statement.  Can you tell us at what point in time within those four days your daughter arrived?  Was it at the beginning or at the end of the four days?
A.	She found me at the place, so she came towards the end of the four-day period.
Q.	You told us in your statement, your testimony before the Chamber, that you later went to the surgery unit.  Can you tell us how much time you spent there, or for how long you stayed there?
A.	We stayed at the surgery unit between the months of April and September.
Q.	So during that entire period you remained at that unit?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Madam Witness, I presume that there were other persons in that unit.
A.	Yes, there were other persons there.
Q.	Of course you had patients and their minders there.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know all the persons that were hospitalised in that unit who were with you?
A.	I knew some of the people amongst them.
Q.	It would therefore be correct to say that you did not know all of them?
A.	It would have been impossible for me to know everybody.  I knew a few, or some of those persons.
Q.	Could you be in a position to tell us how many people were in that room?
A.	I won't be able to do so.  However, I know some of the persons who were taken out of the surgery room.
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that before the war there were rooms for women, young girls and children, and other rooms for men, but you also stated that during the war women could stay in the same rooms as women (sic) -- or men could stay in the same rooms as women.
A.	Yes, the patients were put in those rooms at random, irrespective of their gender.
Q.	Madam Witness, it would appear from certain testimonies that there was indeed a room for men and another for women, even if those rooms were not far apart, or not far from each other.
A.	At the time of the events, people settled themselves where they found space.  You didn't need to look for any specific or special place to settle in.  Nobody had any place that was specific or that was dedicated to him -- I mean, people were taken away and killed -- people were taken away from the hospital and killed, and I was witness to that.
Q.	Madam Witness, in that ward that you considered as being a mixed ward, can you tell us how many men were admitted there?
A.	In the ward where I was, there were three men.  There was another ward a bit further up where there were other men and their carers.  No distinction was made as to sex.  Before the war, when you were sick, if you were a man and hospitalised, you had a carer who was also male, and that applied also to women.  If you were a woman and you were admitted, your carer was female.  But during the war, at the time we are concerned with, no such distinctions were made.
Q.	Madam Witness, in speaking of carers, you said that you were the carer for your daughter, and that at one point you received a permit allowing you to move around.
A.	Well, you can't really speak of a permit.  I told you that I could move around in the corridors and God protected me and no-one touched me, so I could go around and about, even outside the hospital buildings, but I couldn't go far from those buildings.  I could move around the hospital buildings and visit some people that I knew who were admitted.
Q.	However, Madam Witness, did you not say that you had a document allowing you to move around?
A.	Yes, of course I had a document.  It was attesting to the fact that I was a carer.
Q.	Madam Witness, two names were put to you -- of men, Mutabazi -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the second one.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	-- and you said that you knew them well.
A.	Yes, I knew them.
Q.	Madam Witness, those two people arrived at the hospital, one of them was wounded.  Can you tell us whether you were present when those people arrived at the hospital?
A.	Yes, I was present.
Q.	Those people were in the ward where the men were?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So you were not in the same ward as they?
A.	We were not together.
Q.	Can you tell us what was the approximate distance between where you were and where they were?
A.	They were not far from where I was.  The ward where I was was not far from the ward where they were.  I occasionally even brought them water to drink, so it was near where I was.
Q.	So we agree that there was a ward for women and another for men, even if it wasn't so far from where you were?
A.	Yes, I agree.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That name was Kazasomaho.
MS. FALL:
I will repeat the names for the English booth.  The names were Mutabazi -- Mutabazi and Kazasomaho.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall spare you a few details to come to the point in time when those people were taken away.  You have told us that they were taken away towards the end of May.
A.	Yes.
Q.	You also told us that it was assailants who took them away.  You used the word "assailants".
A.	No, no, no.  You're putting words in my mouth.
Q.	Well, we can check that in the transcript.  Can you tell us then who were the people who took them away?
A.	I told you that the doctors put the names on a list.  They came around the wards, but in fact they wanted to check how many Tutsis were inside.  So they drew up a list, and when the list was finished they informed Nyiramasuhuko, who came and took away the Tutsis.  That is how the people we have talked about were taken away.
Q.	You told us that the lady named Pauline, on the basis of the lists prepared by the doctors, came to get the selected Tutsis.  Was it she herself who came to take away those selected Tutsi?
A.	No, she would send soldiers.
Q.	Did only soldiers come?
A.	Those soldiers came, but Interahamwe also came.  When they found people outside, they would take them away.
Q.	Madam, when we speak of "assailants", could we take that to mean soldiers and Interahamwe?
A.	No.  I told you that the people who were hospitalised, admitted, they were listed and then they were taken away subsequently.
Q.	Madam Witness, you spoke of doctors who drew up the lists.  Did you know those doctors?
A.	I don't know the names of all the doctors, but since I was there, I know some names of doctors.  But I don't know the names of most of the doctors who were there.
Q.	Can you give us the name of the doctors that you knew?
A.	I knew Pascal, Emmanuel and Gatera.  As to the others, I did not know their names.
Q.	So we do agree that, apart from the three names you gave us, the other doctors that accompanied them you didn't know?
A.	Yes, I told you that I did not know the name -- the names of some of the doctors, but even if I didn't know their names, I knew them by sight, because I lived with them at the hospital.  We would say "good morning" -- we would greet each other.
Q.	Madam Witness, you've told us that those two people -- those two men who were taken away were in the surgical ward and soldiers came to take them away?
A.	Yes, when the soldiers came to take them away, they were with the doctors.  I was sitting on their bed and the soldiers took those two men, went down with them, and doctors such as Gatera came back -- returned to where they were before.
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that you were not in the same ward as those two men when the doctors arrived with the soldiers to take them away.  Were you present in the ward?
A.	We were on the lawn.  We were sitting on the lawn, and we could see everything that was happening.
Q.	From the lawn could you also see what was happening in the ward?
A.	The lawn was between the two wards in front of the two doors -- the door on the left and the door on the right.  So the lawn was in the middle between two wards.
Q.	Madam Witness, once more, could you, from where you were, see everything that was happening inside the ward?
A.	Please don't make life hard for me, madam.  I told you the two wards face each other.
Q.	Once more, and I should like you to answer:  from where you were, was it possible or not to see everything that was happening in the ward?  I don't want to complicate your life at all.
A.	I told you -- I'll give you an example.  Let us suppose that the lawn is here where we were and there on the left there's one ward, on the right there's another ward.  Don't you think that you couldn't see through the door what's going on in the other ward?  I think that you're tiring me for nought.
Q.	I'm sorry to tire you, madam.  That is not my intention, but I think that if you're opposite the ward, what happens at the end of the ward -- at the other end of the ward you couldn't see what is happening; is that not correct?
A.	Well, I shall answer you with an example.  Let us suppose that we're here on the lawn, and that there's another ward there in front of us.  How can you cast doubt on the fact that by being here I couldn't see what's happening there in the other ward, whereas I'm on the lawn?
Q.	So if I've correctly understood you, what occurred occurred right in front of you.
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness, but I beg you, please, don't go on tiring me, because what I lived through already tired me quite sufficiently. 
Q.	I'm very sorry, madam, but you are a witness, but I will be asking you all the questions, since you have agreed to come here.  However, I shall try not to tire you too much.

Madam Witness, you have stated last time before the Trial Chamber -- previously stated before the Trial Chamber that the assailants took them from the ward and there was Dr. Gatera and another doctor, and when they were taken away the doctors did not follow the assailants; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	However, Madam Witness, you stated on the 26th of June 2005 -- and in that statement you said that those two people were indeed taken by the soldiers, who took them away and when they were taken away Dr. Gatera, who was with two other doctors, followed them.
A.	No, the doctors did not go together.  When the doctors -- after having handed them over to the assailants, they did not leave with them.
Q.	Yet in the statement of the 25th of June you are most precise, and I can quote for you, "So the soldiers took them away and when they took them away Dr. Gatera was with them as well as two other doctors."  So which is the correct version between what you stated before the Trial Chamber and what you stated previously?
A.	The truth is that after having handed them over to the assailants, they went together, but not for very far.  They immediately came back -- they immediately turned on their heels, if you like, and the others were taken away in the direction of the mass grave.
Q.	So we do agree, madam, that the doctors did accompany, for a while, the soldiers who were taking away those two men?
A.	Yes, I agree with you.
Q.	I should also like to know exactly how many doctors there were.  
A.	I told you that there were three doctors that handed over Kazasomaho and his colleague.
Q.	Which means that what you have stated before the Trial Chamber is not correct, because you spoke of Dr. Gatera and another doctor.  So what was correct was your statement to the investigators that there was Dr. Gatera and two other doctors, which in fact means three doctors.
A.	I've always stated that there were three doctors, Gatera and two other doctors, who accompanied the assailants for a few paces -- a short distance, and then turned back, whereas the assailants continued on their way to the mass grave.
Q.	Well, madam, I shall not dwell on this.  We will be able to check these contradictions between the transcripts and the statements you have made.

You told us, Madam Witness, that those people were taken to the mass graves, that there were three mass graves, and that you were not present when they arrived at those mass graves.
A.	Yes, I was not present.
Q.	You don't know, therefore, what happened to those people.
A.	No, I don't know what happened to those people.  All I know is that when those people were taken away nobody has ever seen them again to date.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you approximately again tell us in relation to where you were, and you tell us that you were on the lawn, the distance between the point where you were and those mass graves?
A.	There was one mass grave a bit below the maternity ward.  A bit further than us there was also another mass grave where most of the victims were thrown, but we were afraid.  We were in fear, and we knew that our turn would be next.  We didn't have the time to observe all the details.
Q.	You did not have time to observe all the details.  Is it correct to say that between the time when you saw them taken away and the time when they arrived at the mass grave some events could have occurred which you were not aware of?
A.	All I can tell you -- all I am sure of is that those people were taken away to be killed.  And you must admit that, in view of the circumstances, we did not have the heart to follow closely everything that was happening.  And, in any case, when I recall all that, my heart aches.
Q.	So, Madam Witness, yet again, between the time when you were -- saw them being taken away and the moment when they arrived at the pit, at the mass grave -- and I should like a specific answer "Yes" or "No" -- events could have occurred of which you were not informed, which you could not see, as you have told us that you could not follow everything.
A.	I have told you that you could not even stare at the assailants.  When the assailants took someone away, you couldn't follow them, you mustn't follow them.  You knew that the next turn would be yours.
Q.	I consider that therefore as an affirmative answer.

You said that Dr. Gatera was in the company of other doctors.  Who were they?
A.	I told you that one of the doctors was Pascal, and I don't remember the name of the other one, the third one, if you like.
Q.	Madam Witness, I should like now to turn to the person named André Rwamakuba.  You told us that you knew Rwamakuba, but he was an old man who was already dead; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And that demise must have occurred before the war.
A.	Absolutely, yes.  I was still very young when that old man died.  It was a very long time ago that that old man died.
Q.	Can you tell us what that person's Christian name -- forename was?
A.	I do not remember.  I think he was called Déogratias Rwamakuba.  In fact, I remember his full name.
Q.	You have also told us that you have heard of a certain Rekeraho, if that is the correct pronunciation.  
A.	I heard of him.  He is from -- from the village not far from mine.
Q.	You have certainly had the opportunity.  Since he comes from not far from where you come from, you've probably seen him then.
A.	Yes, I did -- I have seen him occasionally.
Q.	You have, no doubt, been told that that person came to the hospital.
A.	He went everywhere.  He was the one who was distributing weapons -- even at my place, it's he who came to distribute weapons, so it's possible that he came to the hospital.
Q.	You say it is possible, but you are not sure?
A.	If I knew him very well, I would have recognised him.  But even if I had seen him at the hospital, I would have hidden, because when you see killers come to the hospital, you hide.  But all I can tell you is that Rekeraho went everywhere.  It was he who seemed to organise all the killing by distributing weapons.
Q.	If I've correctly understood your answer, you say you've heard of him, it's possible that he came to the hospital, but you yourself did not see him at the hospital.
A.	No, I did not see him at the hospital, because most of the time I was hiding.
Q.	Madam Witness, a photograph has been shown to you, and obviously you've had to see them?
A.	Are you referring to Rwamakuba's photograph?  
Q.	Well, I haven't finished my question.  A photograph was shown to you, and indeed it was a photograph of André Rwamakuba.  Can you tell us at what precise moment you saw that photograph?
A.	I believe the counsel came one day and they showed me a photograph and I said I didn't see that person at the hospital.  I spent many days in the hospital, and if he had come to the hospital, I think I would have seen him.
Q.	Madam Witness, could you tell us approximately the date or the period during which you were shown that picture?
A.	That picture was -- it's been several days -- several months.
Q.	Several months, but I think we do agree that events of 1994 took place more than ten years ago.
A.	Yes.
Q.	The person whose photograph was shown to you in 2005 and whom you said you didn't see in the hospital, did you know him before the events of 1994?
A.	No, I did not know him before the events.
Q.	I think you had never seen him and you never heard about him.
A.	I do not know him, and I hadn't heard people talking about him, except the old man that I mentioned to you earlier.
Q.	Madam Witness, at the time -- and I am saying in 1994 -- you did not know him, you had never heard of him.  You therefore could not know whether he was at the hospital or not, since you did not know him at all.
A.	I did not know him, but I did not see him at the hospital.  As I have told you, I stayed at the hospital for several days, and if I had seen him there, I would have told you so.
Q.	Madam Witness, once again, since you did not know him and had not heard of him -- had never seen him, how could you know whether that person was present at the hospital or not?
A.	If, for instance, he was a doctor, he might have treated my child who was at the hospital, but I never saw him at that hospital.  I never saw him there.
Q.	You haven't answered the direct question I put to you, but I'll move on to another subject.

Madam Witness, you allegedly spent most of your time there with your child that was sick and that you were at the surgery but that you used to move about now and then to go and look for food.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	That means most of the time, most of your stay from April to September, was at the surgery or nearby, since you were in hiding for most of the time, since you were scared?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Madam Witness, you therefore could not at all times know what was happening in other rooms or at other locations in the hospital.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	You will agree with me, therefore, that certain persons could have come to the hospital and certain things might have happened without you being aware of them at all?
A.	Yes, I agree with that statement.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.

Madam Witness, you may have to answer a few other questions.  The rules permit the counsel who examined you first to re-examine you at this stage.

Mr. Hooper?

1015H
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Yes.  Good morning, Madam Witness, basically two questions, or areas of questions.  The first is this:  Either at the time you were at the hospital, or at any time in the 11 years since, have you ever heard of Dr. André Rwamakuba, a minister in the government, ever visiting the Butare university hospital during the genocide?  
A.	No, nobody has told me such thing.  I never heard that André Rwamakuba came to the Butare hospital.  I swear to you that I have never heard anybody talk about him and that nobody has told me that there was a certain Rwamakuba who was minister who came there. 
Q.	Now, you've told us in some detail of two people who were known to you -- indeed, related to you -- called Kazasomaho and Mutabazi.  Am I right in understanding that there was a third member of that family or group, a sister, who was with them in the hospital and acting as a carer of Kazasomaho? 
A.	I have always talked to you of that person from my mother's family.  I never saw the sister that you are talking to me about.  
Q.	Sorry, that was my misunderstanding.  So who was this third person who was with Kazasomaho and ...(microphones overlapping) 
A.	There was their sister who was abducted with her two brothers. 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, could we have that translated again?  
THE WITNESS:
There was their sister who was abducted with their (sic) two brothers.  I don't know if the misunderstanding is from what I get from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me start again.  When those two are abducted, were just the two of them abducted or were they with somebody else?  And if there was somebody else, who was that? 
A.	There was Kazasomaho, Mutabazi and their sister.  All three were abducted.  They were in that room and it was from that room that they were taken away. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you told us that this was at a time after -- or at a time when Kazasomaho, his serious -- you told us his serious wounds had begun to mend and he was getting better; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  He had already begun to walk.  He didn't have any real serious problems any more.  He certainly could walk and things were getting better. 
Q.	And can you remind us again approximately what time of the year this was when he was abducted?  
A.	That was in the month of May. 
Q.	Now, there's been a witness here for the Prosecution.  She's called ALW, and her evidence -- and I'd like just to tell you what it is and ask for your reaction to it.  Her evidence is that she came with an aunt, was put in a hospitalisation room, and this was in about the 22nd or 23rd of April, so fairly early on.  While she's in there, André Rwamakuba comes in and, with an axe, kills five women as they lie in their bed.  Now, let me ask you about that.  Did you ever hear of such a thing?  
A.	I think that incident never took place.  The authorities could not undertake such duties.  They had people that they were employing and they therefore could not act like that.  Those are slanderous statements.  The authorities could move about with access.  Rather, they would give them to assailants. 
Q.	Now, this same witness goes on to say that just two days after that, that is, therefore, about the 27th of April, Kazasomaho and Mutabazi are walking along the pathway just near the avocado tree when they are attacked by André Rwamakuba, who hits them both on the head with an axe and kills them.  What do you say about that? 
A.	I have always told you that these are slanderous statements because I am *********************************** to Kazasomaho and Mutabazi.  Now, if somebody tells you that -- if she says she saw Rwamakuba, well, that is her statement, but I don't buy the statement.  
Q.	Those are all my questions, Madam Witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Unless you, Mr. President, or your colleagues, have any questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we don't.  

Madam Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming to give evidence at the Tribunal, but now you have completed, you are free to go. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I again -- Dr. Rwamakuba would like to meet this witness, if she wants to see him.  Can she have permission, if she wishes to see him, to see him?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.
(Witness excused)  
MR. HOOPER:
While this witness is leaving the witness box and before the next witness comes in, can I say that we've provided a schedule, an itinerary of the proposed view of Rwanda and invited a response from the Prosecution.  I hope that response will be coming very shortly.  We haven't had one yet, as far as I know, as it was done over the weekend.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Hooper, we are thinking of taking the mid-morning break now.  We are thinking of taking the mid-morning recess now, and the witness can commence his testimony on the resumption. 
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly.  We will be starting in closed session, I think -- for how long?  Mr. O'Shea is taking the next witness, who is a protected witness, and he wishes a closed session of about an hour and a half. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a substantial portion of the entire portion of his testimony.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Can I just explain, Your Honour?  This is potentially a long witness.  The witness, I think, may take four hours in-chief.  I will do my best to cut that down.  I will do my best to cut that down, but he does cover a lot of areas.  There are specific reasons why the closed session may take quite a long time, which I think I should explain in closed session, when we resume.  But we can always review it, if there's any disagreement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But can you give me enough information so I can make a statement so the public will understand the reason for the closed session?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Essentially, a significant portion of the story relates specifically to the identification of the witness.  I think that should do.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  Members of the public, we are going to take our mid-morning recess now, but on the resumption we start a new witness, and counsel has indicated that for the first part of his testimony, it's likely that what he says would be directly -- would be capable of revealing his identity.  We have a general rule to try to prevent that, where witnesses have had the benefit of a protective order from the Trial Chamber.  

So we take a brief recess now, and on the resumption we will go into closed session for about an hour and a half. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 15 to 34] was extracted and sealed under cover, a the session was heard in camera) 
(Court recessed from 1025H to 1100H)
